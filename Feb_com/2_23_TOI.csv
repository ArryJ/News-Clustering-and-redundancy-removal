0,['23/02/2020'],City police kickstart campaign to get women to reclaim public spaces,"This story is from February 23, 2020

For a woman, irrespective of the socio-economic background she comes from, being out and about after dusk comes with perils. No matter whether other people are around or not, walking alone along Bengaluru’s poorly-lit roads or even parks can be quite creepy, because you never know from where an eve-teaser or molester can suddenly pop up from. Women may not always be equipped to deal with a situation like that, so, what most of them do is that they either avoid being out alone beyond a certain hour, or only do so if they have ample company.

A new campaign by the Bangalore City Police , though, is looking at changing that. In a recent video shared by Isha Pant , DCP South East, she has urged women to come out and claim public spaces, which has been making quite the positive noise.

Speaking about the campaign, Isha adds, “It is a 14-day campaign starting on February 24 across eight locations from 7 pm to 10 pm. The idea of choosing a late evening slot is to get more women out and make them feel safe about public spaces.”

The awareness campaign, she insists, is not restricted to a certain section of society, but every woman who goes out to work and feels unsafe in certain pockets of the city. “We want representation from women from all walks of life. In fact, the pourakarmikas and domestic workers who start their day really early and have to move around the city at odd hours often bear the brunt of harassment. This campaign is ideal for them as well.”

Sadly, while one might take solace and comfort in such an event, one is also struck by the fact that despite being the IT city, women’s safety continues to take a backseat in Bengaluru. In 2019 alone, 761 FIRs have been registered by the Bangalore Police under IPC sec 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty). So, where does the problem lie? “It’s a very complex issue that combines factors like the way our society works, which includes gender stereotyping and the way women are expected to behave in public. Many times we are also passive bystanders when witnessing to cases of harassment,” adds Isha.

Urging women to raise an alarm if they face harassment and call out their predators, she continues, “If you are in a public space, where there are a lot of people and you are not alone, then raise an alarm and corner the offender. We are also planning to set up boxes at eight locations where women can drop suggestions and complaints if they have faced harassment or been affected by any such untoward incident.”

The DCP adds that based on the response, they campaign will be extended to other pockets of the city as well. “We are involving NGOs and citizen activists to organise events and talks to help spread the message of safety. It is time that women take charge and come out and reclaim public spaces,” she signs off.

Sensitisation of the police force on the cards

One of the problems women also face is that members of the police force question them about hanging out at odd hours.

""We understand that a bit of sensitisation is required. We have already begun training personnel on soft skills, especially on how they should converse with people.""

1,['23/02/2020'],6 ways you can recover from a gruelling workout,"Whether you’re a gym novice or someone who loves to work out, recovery is an important part of your fitness journey. Some expert-approved tips on how to recover correctly from an intense workout:1. Drink up: Says Urmi Kothari, founder of a wellness centre, “Hydrate properly: Have at least 150-250ml of water in one go after the workout. If it’s an outdoor workout/boot camp type workout, then you must keep hydrating while working out as well.”2. Eat properly before your workout: “During the day, make sure you have your micronutrients through green veggies, nuts, seeds and one or two fruits. Most people are deficient in vitamin B12, vitamin C, vitamin D. Supplement if your food cannot provide you enough quantities of the same,” says Urmi. She recommends adding amla, ginger, turmeric, ashwagandha to your food to optimise recovery.3. Get enough Zzzs: You can have an intense workout and be good at it but if you don’t get your optimum amount of sleep of 7-8 hours, your body will not recover as muscle building and performance-oriented skills are developed when you sleep. Lack of sleep leads to an increase in stress hormones which hampers recovery.4. Plan your post-workout meal: “Exercise depletes muscle glycogen and breaks down muscle protein too,” says Dr Deepti Bagree. “It’s important to work both on quality and quantity of post-workout meals. A wrongly chosen post-workout meal can take away the benefits of exercise. Hence it is of utmost importance to opt for the right combination along with quality, the quantity of carbohydrates, protein, and fats although carbohydrates and proteins play the most crucial role.”5. Meditate: At the end of a workout, close your eyes for a few minutes and focus on your breathing to feel centred and connected to yourself. Taking some time off, restricting screen time during the day, especially just before bed can help quieten the constant mental chatter that can improve quality of sleep and general response to stress.6. Keep moving: Urmi recommends going for a short, slow recovery jog of 5-7 km or opting for foam rolling. “Stretching after any high intensity workout is necessary. This will help you recover faster as this recovery run will help increase blood flow/oxygenation to your muscles.”(By: Karen Alfonso)",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74239782,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-81478/74239782.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/health-fitness/fitness/6-ways-you-can-recover-from-a-gruelling-workout/articleshow/74239779.cms
2,['23/02/2020'],How I Start My Day,"No matter how I feel when I wake up in the morning, it’s crucial for me to get moving. I leave a yoga mat next to my bed, where I stretch and meditate, along with a candle and some crystals.Since I struggle with anxiety and nightmares, these tools are very helpful for cleansing my energy and helping me ground myself in my loving reality. It’s important for me to engage my senses as soon as I wake up, gently at first. I use candles with essential oils, so that my sense of smell will awaken good feelings and help me associate with a positive attitude at the start of my day.After about 30 minutes of meditative dance and/or yoga, I eat breakfast, which usually consists of sunflower butter and toast, or eggs and some fruit. To bolster my diet, I usually also have CBD coffee or te, mixed with collagen peptides (which are excellent sources of protein for digestion and bone strength).If I can help it, I avoid checking social media until after I eat; since I’ve noticed that the tension it generates can hinder my digestion. A few minutes after eating, I usually work out, using some of the same tools I used in meditation to crystallise my intentions for the day. No matter what you choose to do, let it be in alignment with your body’s needs and your soul’s desires. Get comfortable with your own breath, your own thoughts, your own feelings. They are manifestations of your True Nature. You are worthy of Love and Peace, for you are made of it.If you can, let the first conscious breath of your day be the deepest. Not only does this nourish your body and brain with oxygen; it also prepares you for flowing movement (walking, jogging, or yoga perhaps) and your nutrient intake (like a yummy breakfast of eggs and fruits). On a spiritual level, deep breathing connects our body to our soul, reminding us of the energy that flows through and around us. Make a delightful beginning every day. If the sun is hiding, try lighting a candle. You are worthy of Love and Peace, for you are made of it. The day is thankful to have you in it.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74227043,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-148361/74227043.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/health-fitness/de-stress/how-i-start-my-day/articleshow/74227043.cms

After Munirathna Kurukshetra, Darshan is all set to team up with filmmaker Munirathna again. The latter announced that he is backing a new project starring the Challenging Star in the lead, scripting of which is currently underway. But what sent rumour mills into overdrive on Friday evening was his announcement that the film is called Major Abhinandan. Reports that Darshan was playing war hero Major Abhinandan began doing the rounds, but Munirathna clarifies that his film is not a biopic. “This is a film about the armed forces and will highlight the India-Pakistan conflict and terrorism. The idea is to showcase patriotism and the valour of our armed forces. Of course, there will be inspiration from real stories, but that is all there is. We are making a film that will address all the things that people need to know.""The team is yet to decide who will direct the film.

In fact, he has become my favourite comedian after the legendary Vadivelu.Sometime ago, on a Friday evening, I was waiting in Mumbai airport to catch my 6pm flight to Chennai. I had reached quite early. After completing my security formalities, I was walking towards the boarding gate when I suddenly saw Yogi Babu walking towards me. Though he was accompanied by another guy, there weren’t any security guards with him. I got excited and rushed towards him. I introduced myself and he was all smiles when I told him that I enjoy watching his comedy regularly. We spoke for more than five minutes and it was an interesting conversation. Since he was in a rush, I couldn’t spend more time with him. But that has been very memorable.To rewind a bit, when I heard that he was in Mumbai for the shooting of Rajinikanth’s Darbar, I decided not to miss this chance to meet him. I tried to locate him through several contacts, but the shooting site kept changing, which eventually spoilt my plans. There was a moment when I didn’t know what to do. I decided to give up. And then, one day, in the month of July, when it was raining crazily in Mumbai, I landed at 10am in Santa Cruz airport. To my surprise, I saw Yogi Babu near the washroom on the ground floor. I tried reaching him, but he left before I could reach the ground floor. And security restrictions didn’t allow me to move up ahead as the shooting of a particular scene was happening right outside the airport. I waited there for quite some time, but finally, had to leave disappointed.So, imagine my happiness when by sheer coincidence I finally met him at the same airport again and managed to take a selfie with him the very next month!",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74256199,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-798071/74256199.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/movies/news/fan-moment-he-was-all-smiles-when-i-told-him-that-i-enjoy-watching-his-comedy-says-s-sridharan/articleshow/74256199.cms
7,['23/02/2020'],Hope to rekindle my cricket connect after ‘83: Aditi Arya,"Miss India World 2015, Aditi Arya made her Kannada film debut with the magnum opus Kurukshetra and is set to take her tryst with the industry further with a film opposite Upendra. The actress is also eagerly awaiting the release of the Hindi film 83, which is the retelling of team India’s iconic cricket World Cup win. In Bengaluru on a whistle-stop visit, Aditi took time out to speak to us about her filmi journey, working in Sandalwood and more…My filmi journey happened by accident. In fact, after winning the title, I went back to working as a software professional. It was only when I was asked to audition for a Telugu film that I thought that a career in showbiz was a possibility. That first audition gave me the boost of confidence that I needed. I began to audition more and got roles in varied industries. Honestly, my journey so far has just been too good to be true.I often get asked if language is an issue, given that I work in multiple regional industries, but that is the least of my worries. Given that I was born in Chandigarh, and then lived in Delhi, Gurgaon and Mumbai, Hindi and Punjabi come naturally to me. However, regardless of the language, my focus is more on transforming into the character I play. Memorising the lines and understanding what they mean just takes a little effort — it’s not a daunting task.Apart from it being my first Kannada film, it was my first 3D film too, so it was a learning experience. I was working on a huge project with such an accomplished ensemble cast. Nikhil Kumar was a wonderful co-star and so much fun to work with. Even though he comes from a family with a lot of legacy, he is so down-to-earth. He would help out with any challenges that I faced on set. If I was worrying about how I was playing my character or stressing over getting my diction right, he'd crack jokes to lighten my mood and ease me into the role. The rest of team was genial too. Many of them come from strong theatre backgrounds too, so I loved watching their acting processes. It was overall such a warm welcome to the industry. Till date, I get encouraging comments from my Kannadiga fans and am often asked about my next project here.Since Kurukshetra, I have signed on Ravichandra , which will see me as one of the female leads alongside Upendra sir. He is such a humble soul , despite being one of the biggest stars in the industry, and has no airs about him.Yes, and she has been such a lovely character to transform into. Inderjit was a modern, independent woman based in London and studying to be a doctor at the time. She is an easy-going, chilled out person and I just loved the vibe of her character.While I did not get to meet her, I met Mohinder sir and boy, what an impact that interaction had on me. Meeting someone who has made history, left me awestruck.The movie has also given me the opportunity to work with a stellar ensemble cast, who I was constantly in awe of. Ranveer, for instance, would joke around set, but the minute cameras start rolling he’d immediately transform into Kapil Dev . Pankaj Tripathi sir too is such an effortless actor who would slip into his character with ease.I have a personal connect to the game through my father. He watches a lot of cricket, and growing up, watching matches with him was a way for me to spend more time with him. In the last few years, life has taken its own course and this tradition of ours has taken a backseat. Hopefully, once I watch the movie, my interest will be renewed and dad and I can start following the game together, again.I have travelled a lot and been in different parts of the country. Whenever I get asked ‘Where are you from,’ I always say that my personality is closest to a Bengalurean’s. This city has such a chilled out, laid-back vibe — people aren’t offended easily. And while they work hard, they don’t overworkthemselves. People here, know how to live it up.

8,['23/02/2020'],THE WEIGHT IS OVER,"Delhi-based photographer Mansi would have no energy to do anything on a daily basis. She started to feel weighed down emotionally and psychologically. “Initially, I thought I needed to lose weight and then everything would fall into place. But then I gave it another thought, and went for functional training (helps provide strength, stability and mobility that people need to thrive on a daily basis). My prime objective was to strengthen my back and get overall endurance. But in the process I started to lose weight too. Now, I feel I can handle much more, both physically and mentally. I am definitely in a more positive space,” she says.‘Healthy’ is the new ‘thin’. Only there is very little to ‘lose’ this time. Latest research says millennials, increasingly, consider health as more than just a number on a scale. The 2019 Food and Health Survey found that 49 per cent of those aged between 18 and 34 years are more inclined towards mindful and intuitive eating practices instead of fad diets.This was on the anvil for long. With a barrage of medical glossary like inflammation, anxiety, pollution, immunity, metabolism and gut health governing our day-to-day living, how long can one hold on to the weary old topic of weight loss and fad diets? Celebrity nutritionist Pooja Makhija says, “We are living in an age of self-preservation. There is cancer, pollution and viruses breaking out out frequently, we can’t just sit and worry about looking pretty. We need to bolster up to face the consequences.” The new approach: There is only one life so why not spend it enjoying food rather than toying with it. Sleep more, eat better and walk miles instead of obsessing over something that’s transient.Losing pounds alone isn’t a prescription for happiness. When people struggle for thinness, they can sometimes emerge unhappier, and often just see the weight pile up again. “The realisation is setting in that a fit body harbours a fit and healthy mind. People are making time for functional fitness, like cycling, swimming and running that keeps them fit and close to nature too,” says Dr Monica Goel, internal medicine. Plus, knowing that you’re doing something positive for your bone density, cardiovascular health and cognitive abilities every single time you exercise can add to the good feelings that make exercise easier to sustain.While Keto and Mediterranean diets will still find takers, it’s the talk around “un-diet” – less food restrictions and more natural body cues – that’s caught attention. “People are done with fad diets. They prefer healthy meal plans that ensure essential nutrients,” says fitness expert Shalini Bhargava.According to studies in the American Journal of Evolution, Medicine, and Public Health (2016), food restriction in almost any form — elimination diets, wellness diets — routinely upsets hormonal regulation, potentially setting off serious mental and physical health problems and, paradoxically, weight gain.That’s what the discernible lot is waking up to. “Yes, there is still a huge number that comes to me for wacky, starvation diet prescriptions but there is also a growing number that wants to eat right. I would say the ratio is 50:50 and that’s a cause worth celebrating,” says Makhija. Weight watchers are still dime a dozen and they will go to any length to fit into a bikini for a friend’s bachelorette or a tux for their 50th birthday bash. But there are also those who are done pumping in the gym and taking protein supplements. They want to not just look fit but also ‘feel’ fit. According to Makhija, “70 per cent of the weight loss battle is won in the kitchen. Even doctors are turning into ‘functional’ practitioners and prescribing hydration and nutrition over painkillers to patients. They are waking up to the ancient wisdom of ‘food is medicine.’Did you know that all the while you stressed over and lost your sleep over weight loss, you gained a few kilos? Sleep deprivation leads to the release of certain hormones that can cause weight gain, says Dr Lancelot Pinto, pulmonologist. In many countries, the number of people who are sleep-deprived is almost equal to the number of people who are obese. “Patients who come to me want work-life- balance and not just a good body. Lifestyle issues like stress, anxiety and insomnia have become a priority for them. The word diet is losing its credibility, people are looking for nutritionally dense diets so that their skin looks good, they get good sleep and their mind gets nutrition. I refer more patients to counsellors these days than to a gym,” says Dr Anjali Hooda Sangwan, obesity, metabolic medicine and clinical nutrition specialist. The answer lies in finding an equilibrium between physical movement and diet. Make eating right part of your lifestyle, exercise for good heart health, strong bones, lung capacity, digestion and automatically you get close to your ‘happy’ weight!— with inputs from Deebashree MohantyThere is a difference between staying healthy and losing weight. We should all aim for the former. Mindless weight loss can be really dangerous. Also, the reason why you want to lose weight cannot be ‘so, I can look good’. Looking good has other aspects to it too.- Rethink and redesign your schedule to squeeze in some movement on a daily basis.l Endurance training and getting the form right is more important. Keep weights for later. l Make the kitchen your medicine box. Eat fresh, homemade, seasonal, on time and in the right measure l Have weight complex? See a counsellor, not a trainer. l And get enough sleep before you do the above!I do not conform to the atypical Bollywood macho hero image and I am ok with it. Because not everyone is sculpted the same way and that is how it is meant to be. At the same time, I am not judging people who are pushing their limits to get a well-toned body. As long as it is not affecting you adversely you are welcome. But should losing weight consume you totally? No. There are other things to perfect, many skills to hone.We are living in an Ornamental Age. Be it cars, houses, roads or ourselves, we want everything to look good. We don’t bother about the inner self, or the foundation. We chase toned abs... it’s only after we cross 40 that we accept spiritual and mental health is more important.

9,['23/02/2020'],Anton Chekhov’s The Seagull to be staged in Bengaluru,"In the mood to watch a play that premiered in the year 1896 right here in Bengaluru? The Department of Theatre Studies at Christ (deemed-to-be) University is putting up a treat for theatre lovers – a staging of acclaimed playwright Anton Chekhov’s first-ever full-length work — The Seagull “The play is set in the countryside and focuses on conflicts between its four main characters. It is relevant even today, because these are conflicts that people face every day — even though this is a play that was written over a hundred years ago. The characters go through a myriad of emotions and struggles and these are what people can relate to. From someone who wants to be an actress, but gets rejected each time, to someone who is in love, but does not get it reciprocated… this one is about aspirations and dreams that seem to fail. Personally, I like the genre of psychology and socio-realism, and the fact that this work is so relatable, irrespective of time, is what makes this staging more interesting,” says Philipp Sulim, a faculty member at the college who is also directing the upcoming production.The cast, however, includes novices, students who are learning theatre and working with them, Philipp says, has been a revelation of sorts. “These students are portraying characters twice their age. They have spent over three months on research — reading about Russia, the culture, their mannerisms and costumes of people there, and understanding situations from their perspective — before even getting down to portraying them on stage,” says Philipp.In addition to also being technically involved in every aspect of the production, the students are excited about experimenting with a different system of acting. “When the play was revived after it flopped the first time, the actors created a system called The Stanislavski method of acting.

DUBAI: Simona Halep defeated Elena Rybakina 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7/5) on Saturday to secure her 20th career title with victory at the Dubai Championships and claimed she felt ""pretty dead"".

The world number two from Romania , who also won the title in Dubai in 2015, clinched her first trophy since Wimbledon last summer.

""I love playing here, I gave everything I had,"" said Halep who had been 1-3 down in the final set and took victory after coming back from a set down for the third successive match in Dubai.

""Now, actually, I'm pretty dead.""

Rybakina, 20, who will rise to 17 from 19 in the new rankings next week, was playing her fourth final from five tournaments in 2020 having won the Hobart trophy last month on the eve of the Australian Open.

""She's a talented player,"" Halep said of her opponent who has a WTA-leading 19 match wins for the season.

""She's young and has many more years ahead of her.""

Rybakina, who was just inside the top 200 this time last year, took the tight final set into a deciding tiebreaker when she broke Halep as the top seed served for victory.

""I may have been a bit nervous,"" Halep said. ""I just kept trying to fight for every ball.

""I'm really proud of this week, I think I gave my best. I enjoy every match I play here.""

Rybakina took the early initiative, gaining a 4-2 lead but struggling to close out the opening set.

The Kazakh had to save two break points as she served for the set leading 5-3.

The 20-year-old double-faulted on a first set point before finally claiming the set on her third opportunity after 38 minutes, saving a pair of break points.

Halep struck back in the second, breaking for 3-1, but Rybakina answered in the seventh game with a break back before losing serve again to trail 3-5 after salvaging three break points.

Halep squared the match at a set each from Rybakina's backhand error a game later.

RIO DE JANEIRO: World number four Dominic Thiem of Austria missed a chance to reach a career-best third in the ATP rankings with a Rio Open quarter-final loss Saturday to Italy's Gianluca Mager.

Mager, a 128th-ranked qualifier playing in only his eighth career tour-level match, defeated 2017 Rio champion Thiem 7-6 (7/4), 7-5 in a match that was halted Friday by rain.

Had Thiem reached the semi-finals in his 2020 clay-court debut, he would have overtaken Roger Federer for third in Monday's ATP rankings.

Thiem was down a set and a break when rain stopped the match Friday with Mager leading 7-6 (7/4), 2-1.

Mager served for the match in the ninth game of the second set but Thiem broke to pull level at 5-5, only to have the Italian claim the final two games and the match after one hour and 55 minutes on the court.

Mager booked a semi-final date later Saturday against the winner of another rain-halted Friday match between 133rd-ranked Spanish qualifier Pedro Martinez and Hungary's 106th-ranked lucky loser Attila Balazs .

Martinez led Balazs 6-2, 2-2 when play was stopped.

Saturday's other semi-final pits Chilean third seed Cristian Garin and fifth-seeded Borna Coric of Croatia.

Isolating yourself from crowded places to prevent contracting the infection is one thing but it may not be practical considering the fast-paced life that we live today. Someone exposed to an infected person or the virus may acquire the disease and another may not, it is all based on their immunity. If you can build a strong immune system, then it acts like your own personal army and can defend you and reduce your susceptibility to infections. Vitamin C’s powerful antioxidant properties help to protect certain white blood cells from the toxic compounds they produce in their fight against pathogens. Here’s why and how you could bolster your intake of this immunity superstar.Vitamin C plays a vital role in maintaining the body’s natural defence and supporting a healthy immune system. People with low vitamin C are at a much greater risk of increased susceptibility to infections. It turns out that vitamins D3, A, and C are all very helpful in boosting your immunity. Combining these vitamins with zinc and probiotics, you’ve got yourself a good flu-fighting remedy.Vitamin C cannot be made by the human body and so we need to eat a diet rich in this vitamin. Though most citrus fruits like oranges, lime, lemons are decent sources of vitamin C, nothing comes close to the Indian gooseberry, amla. The best part about amla is that the vitamin C does not get destroyed even if you pickle it, juice it or cook the vegetable.

14,['23/02/2020'],Five secrets of Chennaiyin's magical turnaround in ISL,"This story is from February 23, 2020

Chennaiyin FC footballers. (TOI Photo)

CHENNAI: Chennaiyin FC completed a remarkable turnaround in the ISL on Friday as they made the playoffs by beating Mumbai City FC 1-0. For a team which had to change their coach midseason - John Gregory made way for Owen Coyle after six matches - and were languishing at the bottom of the table in the early half of the league, making the semis has been nothing short of a miracle. TOI looks at the five reasons how the team surged to the top-four:

Coach's tactics: Owen Coyle might have inherited the squad from John Gregory but he managed to get the starting XI right, something which his predecessor failed to do. Coyle's mantra has always been to play attacking football which will be attractive to watch. In a bid to do so, he tweaked the playing positions of a few - he brought Edwin Sydney Vanspaul to midfield from right-back and introduced Laldinliana Renthlei to full-back position - and the players responded well by giving him results.

Chennaiyin had scored just four goals, conceded 10, and won just once in their first six matches. But Coyle cleared the cobwebs in the players' minds, turning things around in fascinating fashion. Chennaiyin scored 26 goals in their next 11 matches and winning eight, including four straight away matches. It meant Chennaiyin weren't just winning matches but making a statement of intent and desire.

High-intensity football: Chennaiyin might still concede goals at a similar rate (1.67 per game under Gregory and 1.3 under Coyle), but their goal scoring ability has improved significantly. After scoring four in six games (0.24 goals per game) under Gregory, Chennaiyin has netted 26 times in 11 games (2.4 goals per game). This is a result of Coyle's high-intensity football. ""We had to win every match and the only way was to play high-pressing game. We had to be organised and maintain our shape while going for the wins. I am glad that my players responded to my tactics so well. It shows the character and desire of the squad. We hadn't won away since November 18. So the wins against Hyderabad, Kerala was important to boost the morale of the lads. It helped in giving them confidence in ATK and Mumbai matches,"" Coyle said. With the side playing with high intensity, defensive stability came as a by-product as they could switch from attack to defence and vice versa effortlessly.

Dynamic midfield: In order to play Coyle's offensive and entertaining football, Chennaiyin needed their midfielders to perform in a 4-2-3-1 formation. With a dynamic Vanspaul partnering the ever-reliable Anirudh Thapa behind a fluid front four - Lallianzuala Chhangte , Rafael Crivallero, Andre Schmerbi, and Nerijus Valskis - Chennaiyin could attack effortlessly. While Thapa and Vanspaul brought stability, Chhangte added agility, Crivellaro gave vision, Schembri provided balance and Valskis scored freely.

Prolific Valskis and Crivellaro: Chennaiyin scored for fun in the last few games and it was largely due to the efforts of Valskis and Crivellaro. Having arrived 10 days after the season had started, Crivellaro took time to settle down and develop an understanding with Valskis. ""But once I became comfortable in my role, the results started to show. In football, things don't happen quickly. You need to be patient,"" Crivellaro had told TOI. Crivellaro, who scored seven with six assists, shared 20 goals with Valskis. The duo worked magic and provided with all the necessary thrust upfront even as Valskis found the target 13 times - he is now the third-highest scorer - and also has five assists to his name, establishing him as a team player.

Resurgence of Indian contingent: Chennaiyin's Indian players - Vanspaul, Thapa, Germanpreet, goalkeeper Vishal Kaith, fullbacks Jerry Lalrinzuala and Laldinliana, and Thoi Singh rose to the occasion when it mattered. The consistency of Vanspaul and Thapa gave Coyle the freedom to pick his attacking quartet regularly. For Coyle's attacking football to work, all the players needed to be in sync and the way Jerry and Laldinliana went on overlaps showed a changed mindset. Their performance helped Chennaiyin play make a swift transition from defence to attack. In the midfield, Thapa has made five assists and is the second Indian player to do so behind FC Goa's Brandon Fernandes (6 assists) this season.

CHENNAI: Santi Cazorla has been having a renaissance of his own at Villarreal. Having left Arsenal at the end of a six-year spell, his career saw an upsurge when he rejoined his old club. Cazorla has scored 12 goals and six assists for Villarreal so far this season and his performance has even earned him a recall into the Spain team.

The midfielder now wants to help Villarreal qualify for the CL. The Yellow Submarines are sixth with 38 points from 24 games and can enter the top-four if they manage to beat Atletico Madrid at home on Sunday. ""The secret for our performance is that we play as a group. Our aim is to be in Champions League and we have to beat top teams if we want to go there. But it won't be easy. Atletico have beaten Liverpool , which has only lost twice this season. So we have to play an organised team game to beat them,"" Cazorla told TOI in an interaction facilitated by La Liga .

Asked who are the favourites to win La Liga this season among Real Madrid and Barcelona, Cazorla said it is difficult to call at the moment. ""They are two massive teams but they might not be going through the best possible phase at the moment. But it is exciting to see them both fighting for the title. Real Madrid are fantastic on the pitch. Barca have to settle down again under the new coach but that doesn't mean their challenge will fizzle out. They will be as strong as ever,"" he signed off.

17,['23/02/2020'],Donald Trump’s mean machines: The vehicles that form the US President’s motorcade,"W hen US President Donald Trump arrives in India on Monday, he will bring with himself an assortment of vehicles as part of his 40-vehicle strong motorcade. This motorcade will transport him from his aircraft at the Ahmedabad’s Sardar Vallabhbai Patel Airport to the Motera Stadium 22km away and then continue to be at his disposal throughout his two-day India visit. Led by a police pilot, the motorcade features two identical limousines in the front. One of these carries the President and the other serves as a decoy. These two cars are among the most advanced, luxurious and heavily armoured vehicles in the world. The number of vehicles and their order in the motorcade keep on changing for security reasons but the President’s limousine is usually followed by US Secret Service vans, vehicles containing military aides, President’s doctor and journalists, as well as the motorcade’s primary defence – the US Secret Service’s Electronic Countermeasures vehicle. The next set of vehicles house the President’s counter-attack commandos. The rear is brought up by the Roadrunner – the communication command centre of the motorcade – and an ambulance. Franklin D Roosevelt was the first US President to be driven in a modified car in 1936. Once the car has run its course, it is destroyed by the US Secret Service to protect the secrets of its manufacture, armouring, and defensive abilities.Here are some of the salient features of the United States presidential state car, Stagecoach, also known as Cadillac One and nicknamed The Beast:1. The windows of the car are made of five layers of polycarbonate and glass with the ability to withstand armour-piercing bullets.2. The driver’s cabin has a GPS tracking centre. The driver of the car is trained by the US Secret Service to navigate extreme driving conditions, make emergency escapes and perform 180-degree turns.3. The vehicle’s front has night vision cameras while the boot is fitted with a firefighting system along with smoke screen dispensers. 4. Just like James Bond’s vehicles, the Beast is equipped with hidden weapons such as pump-action shotguns and tear gas cannons.5. The body is made of five-inch thick military grade armour while the tyres are reinforced by Kevlar, the material used in bullet-proof vests.

20,['23/02/2020'],Mohun Bagan simply unstoppable against Churchill Brothers,"This story is from February 23, 2020

Margao: Mohun Bagan worked their magic as they put it across Churchill Brothers FC 3-0 in a I-League clash at the Nehru Stadium, Fatorda, on Saturday.

In 12 matches, Churchill were the only side to have defeated Kibu Vicuna’s side 4-2 early in the league stage in Kolkata. On Saturday, Churchill were desperately hunting for a win that would bridge the gap at the top but nothing worked in their favour. A Bagan-supporting tantric – travelling here from Kolkata – invited plenty of ire in the VIP gallery and had to be taken away by police after Bagan had raced to a 3-0 lead.

Bagan started aggressively and Papa Diawara gave them an early lead. Suhair Vadakkepeedika doubled the advantage five minutes into the second half and Tajiskistan’s Komron Tursunov rose from the bench to seal the tie before the hour mark. Bagan have now extended their unbeaten run to 11 matches and opened a 11-point lead at the top of the table with just seven matches left to be played.

Churchill lost the chance to climb up the standings and remain in the third spot with 19 points, although they still have a game in hand. Bagan have 32 points in their kitty.

India coach Igor Stimac was in attendance and the visitors exerted early pressure. They easily got into dangerous positions on a number of occasions. Francisco Martinez’s close effort was shielded by Ponif Vaz, who started in place of the suspended Robert Primus.

It took Bagan just seven minutes to go ahead through a well-worked set piece. Joseba Beitia’s freekick found Fran Gonzalez and the Spanish midfielder headed it towards Diawara. The Senegalese forward connected from close and goalkeeper Sukhdev Patil, starting his second game since joining Churchill, couldn’t keep the ball away.

Coach Bernardo Tavares tried to reorganise his side, especially in midfield where Glan Martins and Quan Gomes slowly got into the game. Soon, the home team looked dangerous and Willis Plaza came close on two occasions. First, the Trinidad and Tobago’s grounder went wide and then his header was spilled by goalkeeper Sankar Roy. Lalkhawpuimawia shot wide from handshaking distance.

In the second half, Churchill were unlucky as Socrates Pedro saw his header hit the horizontal. Then, Lalkhawpuimawia was brought down from behind by Franz inside the box but the referee overlooked ignored strong shouts for a penalty.

At the other end, Diawara set up Suhair, who outmuscled Lamgoulen Hangshing and shot past Sukhdev before Abu Bakr could even tackle.

Bagan consolidated their lead in the 58th minute when U-17 World Cupper Nongdamba Naorem provided a perfect cross from the left and Tursunov stormed inside to connect it well.

Thereafter, it were only Bagan creating a string of chances. Sukhdev was out of position and Diawara was in disbelief when his effort was blocked by Ponif on the goalline.

Diawara was denied his eighth goal of the season yet again by the upright while Sukhdev produced another save to block Tursunov’s effort from close range.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mohun-bagan-simply-unstoppable-against-churchill-brothers/articleshow/74262077.cms
21,['23/02/2020'],ISL winner gets unexpected Asia spot,"This story is from February 23, 2020

Panaji: The All India Football Federation ( AIFF ) has confirmed the continental spot allocations for next three seasons with the Indian Super League ( ISL ) final winner getting an unexpected AFC Cup playoff spot.

The prized AFC Champions League group stage spot has been won by FC Goa as ISL league winners, while I-League champions will now get a confirmed place in the AFC Cup group stage. While there was never any doubt about these two spots, the AIFF has moved to reward the ISL final winners as well.

“India has three spots and we’ve already informed the AFC how we plan to allot them. There are two spots for ISL league stage winners and I-League champions. The third (AFC Cup playoff) spot is for the ISL final winner. If the ISL final winner and League stage winner is the same (FC Goa, in this case), the third spot will go to the ISL league stage runnerup,” AIFF general secretary Kushal Das told TOI on Saturday.

The allocations are for seasons 2021, 2022 and 2023.

The AIFF had initially decided to allot the third continental spot to ISL’s league stage runnersup. That would have gone to ATK, who are guaranteed of a second-placed finish. But, after consultations with AFC, the AIFF has had a rethink.

“The AFC also felt that the winner of the ISL final should also get some recognition,” said Das.

With Mohun Bagan opening a 11 point-gap at the top of the I-League ladder and now overwhelming favourites to win the title, the AIFF could be forced to make more alterations to their continental plan.

Bagan, it is well known, will join hands with ATK and form a new entity latest by July 2020. Should Bagan emerge champions and ATK also win a continental spot – either by winning the ISL final or as ISL league stage runnerup (should Goa triumph), the runnerup in the I-League behind Bagan, will find a place in Asia.

“There are several possibilities, so we have to wait till the end of the season. Logically, if Bagan are not there, then the I-League spot (for AFC Cup), will go to the runner-up team,” said a senior AIFF official.

There is also a possibility that Bagan will finish on top in I-League and ATK will be without a spot. According to sources, the new entity, ATK Mohun Bagan, will then be allowed to take part in the AFC Cup.

FERRARA: Cristiano Ronaldo celebrated his 1,000th professional match by scoring for a record-equalling eleventh consecutive Serie A appearance to set leaders Juventus on the way to a 2-1 win at SPAL in a top-versus-bottom match on Saturday.

After being rested against Brescia last week, the 35-year-old celebrated his return by scoring from Juan Cuadrado 's cross in the 39th minute before Aaron Ramsey added a second on the hour.

Andrea Petagna pulled one back from a penalty in the 69th minute amid problems with the VAR system. Neither the referee's ear piece nor the pitchside monitor appeared to be working, forcing him to use a walkie-talkie to talk to the video officials.

The win ensured that Juventus, chasing a ninth successive title, stayed top for another week as they went four points clear of Lazio who visit Genoa on Sunday. SPAL's fifth consecutive defeat left them bottom with 15 points.

Ronaldo's goal, which took his league tally for the season to 21, meant that he joined Fabio Quagliarella and Gabriel Batistuta as the only players to have scored in 11 consecutive league appearances. Quagliarella did so for Sampdoria last season and Batistuta for Fiorentina in 94-95.

He also reached yet another milestone with his 1,000th match for club and country in a remarkable career which has seen him play for Sporting, Manchester United, Real Madrid and Portugal.

However, his unhappy record of never having scored from a free kick for Juventus remained after he saw a late effort bounce off the crossbar.

Juventus defender Giorgio Chiellini made his first start since August following a knee injury although Miralem Pjanic was among several players missing.

Ronaldo had an early goal disallowed for offside and Dybala struck the inside of the post before Juventus went ahead. Ramsey sent Cuadrado down the right, he fired over a low cross which was swept in by Ronaldo.

Ramsey dinked the ball over goalkeeper Etrit Berisha for the second after he was released by a typical piece of Dybala skill.

There was confusion in the 69th minute as Simone Missiroli went down under a challenge from Daniele Rugani .

The referee, who initially waved played on, eventually changed his mind but the communication problems meant it took nearly four minutes to reach the verdict.

23,['23/02/2020'],Uddhav’s new allies ask him to review stand on CAA-NPR,"This story is from February 23, 2020

Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. (PTI)

MUMBAI: A day after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray once again made clear his support for CAA and NPR in New Delhi following his meeting with PM Narendra Modi , his new allies Congress and NCP mounted pressure on him to get him and the Shiv Sena to reconsider their stand in view of the three-party coalition government in the state.

While Congress leader Manish Tewari tweeted that Thackeray needed to be “briefed” on CAA and NPR and NCP’s Sharad Pawar and Ajit Pawar discussed the twin issues among others that came up at their meeting with Uddhav in Mumbai on Saturday, state Congress president and revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat said he would meet the CM on Sunday to know what prompted Thackeray to back CAA and NPR.

Both Congress and NCP have made it clear they will not allow implementation of NPR in the state and feel Thackeray’s statements have led to divergent voices in the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi.

Tewari said Thackeray needed to understand how NPR was “the basis of NRC.” “Once you do NPR, you cannot stop NRC,” he tweeted. On CAA, Tewari stated that Uddhav needed to “be re-acquainted with (the) design of (the) Indian Constitution that religion cannot be (the) basis of citizenship.”

At Uddhav’s meeting with the Pawars, a senior NCP leader said, it was proposed that senior cabinet members of the Congress, NCP and Sena should meet soon to study CAA and NPR. “We had a good meeting with the CM. Besides CAA and NPR, we discussed issues that will come up during the budget session of the state legislature,” Deputy CM Ajit Pawar told TOI.

The senior NCP leader who spoke off the record said it was decided at Thackeray’s meeting with the NCP chief and Dy CM that contentious issues would not be discussed during the budget session which starts on Monday. However, matters related to CAA and NPR would be taken up with the Centre.

Thorat said, “I was supposed to join Pawar for the meeting with the CM, but it was not possible for me to make it on Saturday. I will meet the CM on Sunday. I am sure we will resolve the issues amicably.”

Uddhav had said on Friday in Delhi that there was no need to fear CAA or NPR. The NPR, he said, was proposed along with the census and it had happened in 2010 too, and the census happened every 10 years. If there were any new columns proposed in the NPR, they would be scrutinized by his government and if anything seemed problematic, his government would not take it ahead, he said. On CAA, he said it is now an Act of Parliament and “as it seems, it won’t take away anybody’s citizenship in Maharashtra.”

Former Congress MP Sanjay Nirupam said it was wrong on Thackeray’s part to meet Modi and support CAA and NPR when Congress and NCP have taken a firm stand on the matter. “Before meeting Modi, Thackeray should have consulted Sharad Pawar, Thorat and senior leaders of NCP and Congress as it’s a coalition government of three parties,” Nirupam said.

Meanwhile, NCP leader and state minority development minister Nawab Malik said in Pune on Saturday that MVA constituents would hold a meeting soon to finalise the draft of the NPR questionnaire in the state. “The NPR questionnaire was drafted in 2010 but the Union government included some additional questions. We shall examine them and take a decision after consulting the governments in non-BJP states,” Malik said. Officials said several states had requested the Centre to delete some of the questions.

Gabriel Jesus celebrates scoring a goal against Leicester, with teammate Riyad Mahrez. (AP Photo)

LEICESTER: Gabriel Jesus struck to give Manchester City a 1-0 win at Leicester City on Saturday, strengthening their hold on second place behind champions-in-waiting Liverpool .

Pep Guardiola's men have endured a turbulent week after they were banned from European club competitions for two years for breaches of financial fair play rules.

But a second-half winner from substitute Jesus after Sergio Aguero had failed to convert a penalty put them 17 points clear of fifth-placed Tottenham.

City, who still trail Liverpool by 19 points, bossed possession in a lively opening spell at the King Power Stadium but Leicester should have taken an early lead when Jamie Vardy was put through.

The pacy forward, who has not scored since December after an electric spell, was preparing to celebrate but saw the ball rebound agonisingly off the base of the post to safety.

A minute later, former Leicester favourite Riyad Mahrez went close, striking a left-footed shot from outside the box that was palmed away by Kasper Schmeichel.

Ilkay Gundogan had a chance after being played in by Aguero but he scuffed his shot from close range.

James Maddison tested Ederson with a free-kick in the 37th minute and minutes later played in Kelechi Iheanacho, who was floored in a collision with Ederson.

Aguero had the ball in the net on the stroke of half-time but the goal was ruled out for off-side.

Both sides maintained their intensity after the break and Schmeichel produced a fine save, diving down to his right, to save keep out a Kevin De Bruyne shot.

Defender Aymeric Laporte was replaced by Nicolas Otamendi in the 58th minute, sparking concern ahead of City's midweek Champions League clash against Real Madrid.

The decisive moment appeared to come just after the hour mark when Manchester City were awarded a penalty after a VAR check confirmed that Leicester's Dennis Praet had handled the ball in the area.

Aguero blasted the ball down the middle but Schmeichel kept it out with his legs, moments later denying the Argentine hitman with his left foot.

Guardiola replaced Aguero with Jesus with less than a quarter of an hour to go and the change paid quick dividends as the Brazilian stretched to put the ball past the diving Schmeichel after an assist from Mahrez.

City, who could win their third consecutive League Cup next weekend when they face Aston Villa at Wembley, are appealing their UEFA ban at the Court of Arbitration for Sport.

Leicester, have won just one out of their past Premier League matches after a fine start to the season and will be glancing nervously over their shoulder at Chelsea, now just six points adrift after their 2-1 win over Tottenham.

25,['23/02/2020'],India: China 'deliberately delaying' Wuhan flight nod,"File photo used for representational purposes.

NEW DELHI: With its request for operating an evacuation flight from Wuhan pending with Beijing for more than a week now, a livid Indian government on Saturday accused China of deliberately delaying approval even while allowing other countries to evacuate their citizens.The delay, official sources here said, had caused a great amount of mental stress and anxiety to Indian nationals in Wuhan who were looking to return to India immediately. There are about 100 Indians waiting to be brought back by a C-17 military aircraft, their arrival being anxiously anticipated by their relatives.The Indian assertion soon turned into a public spat with the Chinese embassy spokesperson responding that there was no such thing as Beijing “deliberately delaying granting flight permission” and that the situation in Hubei province was complicated as work for prevention and control of coronavirus had entered a critical stage.However, China has allowed other countries to operate relief flights during this period, like Japan on February 16, Ukraine on February 19 and France on February 20.Official sources here again responded to China’s claim, saying India had sought permission on February 13, submitted a flight plan two days later and, even after a five-day notice, is still awaiting approval from Chinese authorities. India had proposed that the flight be allowed on February 20.“If the work was not critical enough to stop or delay these flights, how did it suddenly become critical for the Indian flight?” asked a source. Significantly, the same flight will also carry relief supplies to China, in keeping with, as government sources said, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s offer of assistance to Chinese President Xi Jinping in dealing with the crisis.“Hoping to get approval, the Indian mission has been issuing advisories to those who want to return. Nobody now knows what to do,” an Indian official said. After Modi’s letter to Xi Jinping, sources said, India had put together relief supplies as a token of solidarity, particularly in this 70th year of diplomatic relations.“These supplies have been offered even as India faces tremendous shortage itself, given our ethos of helping others, especially neighbours, in their hour of need. Items being supplied are gloves, surgical masks, feeding and infusion pumps and defibrillator based on the requirements as indicated by the Chinese side,” said another source.“There are relief and evacuation flights from other countries which are still going on, including by France. Why is the Chinese government delaying clearance for the relief flight? Are they not interested in Indian aid provided as our token of support?” the source sought to know.Chinese ambassador Sun Weidong had said last week that Beijing attached great importance to the health and safety of foreign nationals in China, and “will take good care of the Indian citizens in China like our own”. He also said so far there was no report of any Indian national testing positive for coronavirus in Wuhan.Sun, however, had added that China was now at the critical stage in epidemic prevention & control and will carefully assess the situation, as required by prevention-related work. He was replying to a query on India’s request for evacuation.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74262123,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-268130,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-china-deliberately-delaying-wuhan-flight-nod/articleshow/74262116.cms
26,['23/02/2020'],India has fully accepted critical verdicts: Modi,"This story is from February 23, 2020

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday highlighted India’s civilisational belief in the rule of law and said this core value cleared the way for the “wholehearted acceptance” of recent critical judicial verdicts.

“In recent times, there have been some critical judgments and decisions which have been the subject of global discussion. Before these judgments were delivered, several apprehensions were being expressed about the consequences. But look what happened, 1.3 billion Indians wholeheartedly accepted the judicial verdicts,” the PM said while inaugurating a two-day international conference judicial conference organised by the Supreme Court.

His remarks were seen as referring to the SC’s verdict in the intensely contested case for the disputed site at Ayodhya , which the top court awarded to Hindus for the construction of a Ram Mandir.

Modi said the rule of law forms the bedrock of the tremendous faith reposed by people in the judiciary. The maturity with which the verdicts were accepted underlined the country’s ancient saying that “law is the king of kings, law is supreme”, he added.

The Prime Minister said the government has, in the last five years, taken numerous steps to protect the rights of citizens and put to an end to discrimination faced by the disabled, transgenders and women. He said the government repealed not only 1,500 archaic and irrelevant laws but also enacted new legislation to strengthen the social fabric.

“In legislating the rights for transgenders, the law against the practice of triple talaq, expanding the rights of divyang (people with disabilities), the government has worked with complete sensitivity and responsiveness to the needs of modern society,” Modi said.

Hailing India’s strides towards economic development, the PM said that the country has become the fifth largest economy from its earlier position of 11th in the last 5-6 years. He said India is scaling new heights, creating new definitions of success and challenging old beliefs and perceptions.

“There was a time when it was said that rapid development and environment protection cannot go together. India has changed this perception. Today, while on one hand India is taking rapid strides in development, our forest cover has substantially expanded,” he said.

The Prime Minister appreciated the role played by the SC in redefining environmental jurisprudence and creating a balance between development and environment. He said technology could be handy in ensuring speedy justice and pitched for synchronisation of artificial intelligence with human wisdom in judiciary. He said the government is working towards connecting every court to the e-courts system to achieve the goal.

27,['23/02/2020'],Govt summons urgent meeting on telco relief,"This story is from February 23, 2020

Representational photo.

NEW DELHI: The government has called an emergency meeting on Sunday, including key officials from the telecom and finance ministries and Niti Aayog, as efforts to come up with a bailout for the beleaguered telecom sector gather pace.

The process is being closely monitored by the PMO amidst heightened concerns over the fate of companies such as Vodafone Idea, which stares at a possible shutdown in case it fails to pay the telecom department Rs 53,000 crore as ordered by the Supreme Court.

The sources said the government is “deeply concerned over the worsening position of the telecom industry” with the Supreme Court making it clear that it wants full recovery of the Rs 1.47 lakh crore dues, demanded from the mobile operators.

Relief measures likely to be discussed could include soft loans for telecom companies and easier payment terms for the interest and penalty portion in the AGR (adjusted gross revenues) order, highly placed sources told TOI.

While Airtel, which has to pay around Rs 35,000 crore (it has already given Rs 10,000 crore), has assured that it will deposit the amount before the next date of hearing, Vodafone Idea has expressed inability to meet the demand in the absence of a government bailout.

Sunday’s meeting is expected to be headed by telecom secretary Anshu Prakash, who is also the chairperson of the multi-ministry Digital Communications Commission (DCC). Sources indicated that officials from the PMO and finance will be there, and even Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant will be called in.

The government is keen to work out a bailout formula as the Supreme Court’s next date of hearing in the AGR matter falls on March 17. With companies appearing to be in a precarious position, it is important to help them out sooner than this deadline, a source said.

Vodafone Idea chairperson Kumar Mangalam Birla has already had a series of meetings with top government functionaries, including finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and telecom minister Ravi Shankar Prasad .

Sources said with the court staying firm on its order for recovery of dues at the earliest, the government wants a relief package readied as soon as possible.

While the “top priority” for the government is adherence to the top court’s order, it is also satisfied by the efforts made so far by the companies to start paying up. Vodafone Idea has so far paid Rs 2,500 crore, while the Tata group has also paid Rs 2,197 crore (its demand is pegged at around Rs 14,000 crore in the AGR order).

“We are walking a tightrope on this matter. The government does not want the sector to collapse and thus we are taking unprecedented steps to help the companies in meeting the orders of the Supreme Court,” a senior official said.

However, even as it works out the relief package, the telecom department officials have also started the process of invoking the bank guarantees submitted by the companies in case they do not pay up before March 17. “We have to follow the licensing agreement which stipulates that in case of a default in payment, we are free to invoke the bank guarantees,” an official said.

Sources also say that if the bank guarantees are found to be insufficient to pay the demanded AGR dues, the telecom department will have no other option but to work towards cancellation of telecom license of the defaulting company. “It will be done only in extreme cases. We hope to find a solution and salvage the industry from this position before that.”

28,['23/02/2020'],Insta pe parcha: Activists are reinventing the pamphlet,"PhD student Prerna Subramanian was in Canada, feeling rather far away from home — not because she missed ghar ka khana, but because of the angst of watching the last two months of anti-CAA and NRC protests from afar. She wanted to help people cut through all the noise and present to the world something meaningful yet digestible. “A lot of us were really aching to do something. Coming from academia, I felt my job was to educate, to learn and unlearn and make things easy for people,” the 25-year-old says. So, along with a handful of friends, they took to a tried-and-tested means of activism — the parcha (pamphlet). The shorter parchas were posted on their Instagram page called Inquilab Series, while the longer versions were put up on Medium.The parcha may seem outdated, but activist groups and individuals on social media have made them useful yet again. The idea is the same — collating pieces of information relating to a certain topic in an accessible manner that enables people to think, question and educate others. The A4 sheets have, however, given way to Instagram posts with a number of slides outlining everything, from what the CAA means to the communication lockdown in Kashmir , from the objections to the Trans Rights Bill to what NOTA really amounts to. These Insta-parchas open up the world of politics for a generation with short attention spans and disdain for mainstream media.Young People for Politics is an organisation that has been posting parcha-style Instagram posts since April 2019. Their national convenor Radhika Ganesh says their work with rural youth prompted her to raise political awareness among young people in urban India. “Coming from a grassroots movement background, we know the significance of the parcha. It serves the intrinsic purpose of retention,” she says, adding that the response to their posts, which tend to focus on factual information, on everything from what Panchayat Raj is to breaking down parliament lexicon has been promising. They have 20,000 followers, contributors from 16 states and content in 6 languages.Mujeeb ul Shafie, activist at We the People of India, says these new-age parchas are making the form regain relevance again. “It helps with reaching the people who are on the fence, with whom your parcha may resonate,” he says. “Also, the parcha is a tool of ideological debate for those who disagree with you.”WeUnlearn was one of the first organisations to start making such posts two years ago, focusing mostly on gender-related issues. The goal, Riya Roy, their chief of communications, says is to “serve as portals” for information. “Our posts should lead people to information that gets hidden or is purposely put out of sight. This is why we always disclose our sources, not just because we are accountable, but because we want people to read more.”For a lot of young people, political engagement is more recent. Shalini Jena, a 27-year-old filmmaker says, “I was one of those privileged people who thought I was apolitical.” That changed when she experienced gaslighting in her personal life. Published on Feminism in India’s Instagram account, her post on political gaslighting outlined what it is, how it works and what we can do to stop it.Like many other young people, Jena says gets a lot of her news on Instagram. Long considered the vain, apolitical cousin of the social networks, it has slowly become an important political tool. Ganesh notes that this apolitical image can be an advantage. “It becomes a way to reach out to the people who aren’t already in the choir. We have had success appealing to fence-sitting young people by keeping it objective,” she says.Student Shreyas Urgunde, 19, runs a page called empowered.humans.of.earth where he breaks down how economic policies affect our lives. “My goal is to talk about important issues that don’t make for an attractive headline,” the Mumbai boy says. On an average day, he spends 3-4 hours researching and writing content for his page.This kind of content is being accessed by young people. Twenty-two-year-old Charu Pragya runs a page called Akademi Mag with graphic designer Aarman Roy . Their 8,000 followers are mostly young — 43% are between the ages of 18-24 and 48% are 24-34. Pragya says they responded particularly well to a series they did on how to respond to the various arguments one encounters, like students should concentrate on studies or that being anti-CAA is being anti-hindu.The hope with these parchas is to give young people a robust political vocabulary, to question one’s assumptions, to spread the good word, but if nothing else, at least they give new meaning to the term Instagram influencer.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74260670,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-349425,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/insta-pe-parcha-activists-are-reinventing-the-pamphlet/articleshow/74260654.cms

Justice Arun Kumar Mishra. (ANI)

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Judge Arun Mishra on Saturday hailed Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his leadership which he said led to India emerging as a “responsible and friendly member of the international community” and also praised Modi as a versatile genius who thinks globally and acts locally.

“India is a responsible and most friendly member of the international community under the stewardship of internationally acclaimed, visionary Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi. India is committed to constitutional obligations and dedicated to a peaceful and secure world, free from terrorism,” Justice Mishra said delivering the vote of thanks at the international judicial conference here.

“We thank the versatile genius, who thinks globally and acts locally, Shri Narendra Modi for providing us inspiring thoughts which would act as a catalyst in initiating the deliberations, and setting the agenda for the conference. We express our deep gratitude for inaugurating the Conference,” Justice Mishra said.

Also speaking at the conference, CJI S A Bobde said, “A feature often neglected is a chapter on fundamental duties imposing on every citizen the duties to abide by the Constitution, the whole of it and respect its ideals and institution,” he said. The CJI said over 50 countries have specific provisions on fundamental duties in their constitutions. Quoting Mahatma Gandhi , Justice Bobde said the exercise of rights depends on one’s sense of duty and “real rights are a result of performance of duty”.

He said the impact of an order passed by a court is not confined to a territorial boundary of a country in a globalised world and has global implication. He said institutions across the world should interact and exchange ideas on how to deal with universal problems.

Terming India as a “melting pot of myriad cultures and traditions”, which has assimilated legal cultures of all the civilisations who have come to our shores— the Mughals, the Portuguese, the French, the Dutch and finally the English, Justice Bobde said the entire world is now connected and there is a need to hold dialogue and exchange ideas with judges from other countries on many aspects of gender justice, right to privacy, populism, environment and sustainable development.

“Judiciaries all over the world are dealing with this kind of change— what might be called a rights revolution, a technological revolution and a demographic revolution. Our decisions no longer impact only those who live in our jurisdiction but also those who live in other jurisdictions — some far away,” the CJI said.

Highlighting the new challenges like terrorism, cyber-crimes, environmental degradation faced by a globalised world, Justice N V Ramana , the senior-most judge of the SC, said that there is a need of unanimity among institutions cutting across the country to evolve solution of these problems.

“For example, terrorism is one of the main issues which has affected every part of the world and has no end in sight. The judiciary needs to appropriately respond to this problem by evolving innovative principles and jurisprudence so that terrorism is kept at bay, while, at the same time upholding the rule of law. More importantly ‘globalisation’ demands rule of law. With the increase in cross-border dealings, movement of citizens, goods and investment, there is a requirement of stronger trust between nations. This trust can be built by creating institutions with strong emphasis on the rule of law, which creates a secure environment,” he said.

30,['23/02/2020'],Thousands of Japanese making a smooth transition from Zen to Jain,"The popularity of Jainism is spreading in Osaka and Tokyo.

MUMBAI: Zen no more. It’s Jain.Wrapped in white loin cloth, they chant the navkar mantra, follow dietary self-abnegation, wake up with the sun, consume only warm water, meditate for hours in derasars (Jain temple) and dine before the sunsets. Thousands of Japanese are turning to Jainism . Apart from living like astute Jains, their calendars are marked for an annual pilgrimage to India where they spend weeks studying Jain script under learned monks.The charming Naganoken town, home to the seventh century Zenko-ji temple with a hidden Buddha, sees hundreds of Japanese nationals travel to Palitana and Shankheswar to embrace Jainism every year. Churushi Miyazawa came as a traveller in 2005 and her first meeting with Gachadhipati Swargiya Jayantsen Suriswarji Maharaj Saheb, a senior monk, charmed her into the religion. Such was the appeal that she decided to shed her past, lead a minimalistic life, give up the comforts she earlier soaked in and vow to live like a Jain.Thus was born Tulsi. Churushi wanted to take deeksha (renunciation) and would brook no opposition. “My guru entrusted me with a bigger task: To spread Jainism across Japan. Every month, since then I have been travelling to India four to five times a year with hundreds of Japanese who are ready to embrace Jainism,” Tulsi told TOI from Japan. After Naganoken, the popularity of Jainism is spreading in Osaka and Tokyo too.Not only have thousands of Japanese turned to Jainism, many are readying themselves to take up monkhood. Under conventional practice, initiation into monkhood comes after immense training. The initiates live with monks in temples and the preparatory phase can last anywhere between six months and 10 years, says Babulal Jain-Ujwal, a veritable fount of information on Jainism.Just a month ago, 2,500 Japanese travelled to Tharad in northern Gujarat and spent a week there with the disciples of Jayant Sensuriswarji Maharaj Saheb. “There are a number of Japanese coming here in large numbers. They follow all our rules, pray with us, eat Satvik food before the sun sets, mediate and go back home to follow the same lifestyle we induct them into,” says Nityasen Suriswarji Maharaj Saheb.Next week, too, if travel restrictions are relaxed, another group of Japanese nationals is travelling to Gujarat. To understand the intricacies of the religious texts, most of them are also taking Hindi tutorials, says Jain-Ujwal. “A new temple is being planned in Japan and now we are told there are more than 5,000 families are newly inducted into Jainism,” he adds.The Japanese follow the eight-day holy festival of Paryushan too. “There they fast for eight days (atthai) by merely consuming warm water. Even children follow Paryushan and keep fasts for a day or two,” says Tusi . “The appeal of ahimsa or non violence propounded by Jainism has found a connect with all of us.”In Video: Meet the Japanese nationals who come to India to embrace the Jain way of life",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74262194,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-184552,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/thousands-of-japanese-making-a-smooth-transition-from-zen-to-jain/articleshow/74262195.cms
31,['23/02/2020'],"Steel ropes, earthmovers, crane...‘leaning tower of Munirka’ defies all for two days","This story is from February 23, 2020

Work to demolish the building began in earnest on Friday

NEW DELHI: While you were asleep, the ‘leaning tower of Munirka ’ might have collapsed in a heap, but it’s just as likely to be on its feet. Till late on Saturday, evacuated residents, neighbours and civic engineers were on tenterhooks, awaiting its fall. The tilt at the top of the 6-storey building had increased to 1.5 feet, from 10 inches two days earlier, but, like a tranquilised bull elephant, it was still teetering.

Work to demolish the building began in earnest on Friday, a day after the tilt was first noticed. Municipal engineers tried to pull it down with steel ropes, earthmovers and a light crane. When that failed, they brought in a heavy-duty crane on Saturday, to make it fall towards Gangnath Marg.

“We are trying to break the columns towards Gangnath Marg, to minimise the damage to the surrounding buildings,” a senior municipal engineer supervising the demolition said. “The building is loose now, and it might give way on Saturday night or early on Sunday.”

Local conditions have made the task difficult. Since the building is in a crowded cluster, its fall is bound to damage others around it, said an engineer. “We are trying to minimise the damage radius, but it is impossible to save all the surrounding buildings. Unplanned growth has made our task very challenging.”

The engineers didn’t have many options. Sending in labourers with sledgehammers was out of the question as the building had become unstable and could have come down on them. Using explosives was also ruled out because it could cause extensive damage to other buildings.

To prevent loss of life, the demolition team had evacuated about 100 residents of the adjacent buildings on Thursday. The area near the north gate of JNU was also barricaded for the safety of passersby.

32,['23/02/2020'],"After over 2 months, 6km stretch of alternative route opens near Kalindi","This story is from February 23, 2020

There was chaos on the 6km stretch as it could not handle the traffic that rushed towards it from both Delhi a... Read More

NEW DELHI: An alternative route of Okhla Road that connects Sukhdev Vihar with Kalindi Kunj , which is away from the Shaheen Bagh protest site, was opened by a group of people on Saturday.

As the news spread, traffic began heading for it from both Delhi and Noida sides, in order to bypass the Shaheen Bagh bottleneck, but it turned out that only one-way traffic could be allowed since one carriageway is blocked by students. Moreover, there is an old bridge on the way which cannot handle the volume.

There was chaos on the 6-km stretch, which passes through Okhla Marg near Jamia Millia University, over a bridge to reach the Kalindi Kunj Road crossing through Abul Fazl Enclave, could not handle the huge volume of Noida-bound traffic and the ensuing snarl reached the Escorts-Sukhdev Vihar crossing within a few hours.

Meanwhile, both carriageways of the main artery of G D Birla Marg, where the protesters are squatting, remained blocked. The protesters have told the mediators to get Supreme Court to ensure their safety if the opposite carriageway which brings traffic from Noida to Delhi – and which they say has been blocked by the police – is allowed to be opened.

DCP (south-east) R P Meena said that no orders were given by the police to open the alternative route. “It was an arbitrary decision taken by some people. We were not consulted. However, we will not allow chaos on the stretch and have deployed enough personnel to manage traffic,” he said.

The drama began around 3pm on Saturday after two groups of people started squabbling over the removal of barricades. Soon after, one of the groups managed to open the blockades. Police say the other group shut it again but around an hour later, the two groups finally reached an agreement and allowed traffic to pass. Soon after, a celebration broke out among some of the protesters.

On an average, more than 10,000 vehicles are headed towards Noida from south Delhi daily. After the barricades came up, people have been using the Ashram-DND route for the daily commute.

With Jamia Nagar-Kalindi Kunj road being opened, the volume on this stretch is expected to go up by almost three times. Besides the fact that only one carriageway is available for two-way traffic movement, there is another bottleneck further ahead near the two-lane Okhla Head culvert constructed almost 50 years ago.

On Saturday when the road turned into a bottleneck, vehicles coming from Faridabad and Mithapur too tried to muscle their way towards the Kalindi Kunj road, which cops had to stop to avoid the mess. Zaki Khan, a resident of Batla House who was turned away, said “We heard the road has been opened so I came. They are letting people come but not allowing us to go. It is evident that the road was opened up for only to cater to residents of the area”.

Cops had a tough time explaining to them that people could only come through the road but cannot re-enter. “We did not remove the barricades, it was the protesters who did so. However, we cannot allow the traffic to go up and down. Imagine, what would happen if an ambulance or a fire-engine gets stuck in the mess that would be created,” said a police officer.

Vinod Kumar, an employee of a private company who resides in Badarpur, got into an argument with the cops after being stopped from going towards Abul Fazl Enclave from Kalindi Chowk. “I was so happy to see in the news that the road has opened but now they asking us to turn back. What is the point of opening the road when only travel time for people living around is cut down?”

Sunil Kumar, who works as driver in Noida sector 127, had managed to sneak past the Noida police barricade and reach Mithapur Chowk only to get stuck in the jam. “I reside in Malviya Nagar and from two months all I do is witness the traffic. Today the news said they have opened and I thought I would reach early but this is a surprise. I have three daughters and for the last two months have not spend time with them due to the traffic woes,” he said.

33,['23/02/2020'],Agra gets a hurried makeover to sweep Trumps off their feet,"This story is from February 23, 2020

Roads have been widened, sewers cleaned and stray cattle rounded up

AGRA: The tryst will last just a couple of hours, but Agra is going for a hurried beauty therapy. With barely 48 hours left for the rendezvous, the likely route of US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania to Taj Mahal is getting a facelift.

Sewers are being cleaned. Roads have been widened and ornate flower pots placed on dividers. A rusty overbridge of the colonial era was being spray-painted metallic silver grey on Friday evening. Pavement encroachments have been removed and electric poles installed with tricolour LED lights. An army of municipal workers has been nabbing stray cattle and sending them to gaushalas. The WhatsApp joke doing the rounds is that Trump should visit Agra more often, just to breathe life and activity into the somnolent civic authorities.

This will be Agra’s third dalliance with a US president. Dwight Eisenhower (1959) and Bill Clinton (2000) too were charmed by the Taj, generally acknowledged as the world’s greatest monument of love.

This is Trump’s time. The city is teeming with monster banners welcoming the US president and the first lady. There are also direct proclamations to the US president’s “yaarana” with PM Narendra Modi . One of them featuring the two says, “Do mahaan desh, ek bemisaal dosti (Two great nations, one matchless friendship).” Another one goes, “Bhagwan Shri Ram ki dev bhoomi mein aapka swagat hai”, while a third says, “Heartiest welcome to the land of Lord Krishna.”

Last year, the Ardh Kumbh had turned the walls of Allahabad into an open-air art gallery. Parts of Agra now have the same feel. Hundreds of cultural, religious and modern motifs have been painted on boundary walls. One of them shows the US president in a red tie and black jacket, with the words Atithi devo bhava. Closer to Taj Mahal, trees have been washed, their barks painted in white and brown.

As in Delhi’s Connaught Place during the 2010 Commonwealth Games, signboards of hundreds of shops on the scheduled route now sport a uniform white-and-brown look. “Eight days ago, they took away the old signboards at night and replaced them with new ones a few days later. The shutters in all the shops have been painted cream and the steps bright yellow,” says Iqbal Khan of Mesco Tailor. His shop is located close to Kheria air base, where Trump will land on Monday. Stationery shop owner Charanjit Singh admits that Agra’s state of cleanliness has improved due to Trump’s visit. “His visit has resulted in a series of developmental activities,” he said.

On Monday, about 25,000 school students will line up on either side of the road and wave flags. At least 3,800 artists from UP’s different regions will perform folk dances like Rasiya, Saira and Dhubiya. Over 3,000 cops have been pressed into action for security. All leave has been cancelled till February 26.

Kulwinder Kaur, who runs a stationery mart, is also impressed by the positive changes that the US president’s impending visit have brought to the city. About 500 kg silt has been taken out of the Yamuna river. About 950 cusecs of water is being released to provide the river with a brimming look and to remove the stench that affected the nearby areas.

But Kaur also has a question. “Why do you have to wait for Trump to clean up the city? We get so many tourists from abroad every day. Don’t they deserve a clean river and a clean city?” It is a question that the UP state government and local civic authorities can best answer.

34,['23/02/2020'],Banners hailing CAA spring up at housing societies,"This story is from February 23, 2020

MUMBAI: In a show of support for the Centre’s amended citizenship rules, certain housing societies in Mumbai and Thane have begun to display banners endorsing CAA, NRC and NPR. The sentiment is fuelled, some say, by the prolonged dharna against CAA-NRC-NPR in Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh.

Posters are visible in Gujarati-dominated Mulund, Borivli and Thane, and messages are being circulated on a few society WhatsApp groups too. Plus, pro-CAA citizens in Bhayander have decided to take out an hour-long rally in Bhayander on Sunday morning to back CAA.

A couple of pro-CAA banners are strung on both entrance gates of Shree Rasraj Heights, a high-rise at Borivli West. The 17-storey building houses Gujarati and Jain members.

The society management was not available for comment when a TOI correspondent visited on Saturday. However, one resident, Dipti Bhavik Shah said, “Yes, we are silently making a strong statement in favour of CAA-NRC. If opponents of these laws can hold rallies and dharnas, can we not at least put up banners? Citizenship has several benefits. Innumerable outsiders keep coming to India without fear of being stopped or checked. Why are their native countries not developed so that they don’t feel the need to migrate? I agree some Indians will be inconvenienced by CAA too, but things will settle down in a few months.”

In Thane, a residential complex, Garden Enclave in Vasant Vihar , has expressed support to CAA-NRC and put a poster on its gate declaring its affiliation. Office-bearers of the society said there has been lot of “misleading information” about the CAA, and they felt the need to voice support.

“The core members of our society committee decided to do so as we feel the issue has been unnecessarily politicised and given a religious angle on social media. The idea is not to (merely) put up a banner but to encourage healthy discussion among residents. We are also planning to hold a session to give more information about the Act,” said Viraj Deshpande, chairman of Garden Enclave Federation.

Organiser of the Bhayander residents’ rally, Suresh Patel of the NGO Aadhaar Seva Sanstha, said they felt the need to endorse the “positive Act by the Centre in the face of anti-CAA sentiment.” “Ours is a non-political organisation so we will not carry party flags. We have prepared banners favouring the new laws.” he said. The Bhayander rally will take a circular route from Maxus Mall police chowky at 10am, onward to MTNL and 90 Ft Road and end at 11am.

Residents and shop-owners of a building on Babasaheb Ambedkar Road, Mulund West, received an animated video in Gujarati on their society WhatsApp group advocating CAA and NRC. The voiceover said, “I went to meet an old friend. The building watchman made me wait, opened a register and made me write my name, mobile number, time, number of the flat I wanted to visit, purpose, and took my autograph as well. He asked where I was from and called my friend’s flat to verify. It was after my friend approved that I was allowed to enter the building. The process took five minutes. I realised that to meet an old friend, I have to provide basic information for the safety of that society. So if government seeks information from people who come from other countries and settle here, what is wrong in that... I support CAA, I support NRC and I support government.”

BJP leader Atul Shah said, “We keep disseminating WhatsApp messages (on CAA). But this campaign to display banners has gathered steam on its own, it is not a concerted party effort. People are seeing the Shaheen Bagh protest and want to counter it.”

35,['23/02/2020'],"No evidence against BJP MLA, sons in gang rape: Cops","This story is from February 23, 2020

Representative image

VARANASI: Police on Saturday arrested the nephew of Bhadohi BJP MLA Ravindra Nath Tripathi on charges of rape and said no evidence was found against the legislator and his five sons in the case.

On February 10, a 35-year-old woman had lodged a complaint accusing the MLA’s nephew of raping her for the past four years. She had also alleged that the MLA and his sons also raped her during 2017 state elections.

Police arrested the MLA’s nephew, Sandeep Tripathi, on Saturday morning while claiming that no evidence was found against other accused. However, the MLA’s son Nitesh Tripathi was taken into custody on charges of threatening and manhandling but was later released on personal bond.

Producing Sandeep before reporters following his arrest, Bhadohi SP RB Singh said: “Evidence in support of woman’s allegations were found against Sandeep only. The MLA’s son, Nitesh, was found to be involved in threatening and manhandling. He was taken into custody but as charges against him were bailable, he was released on personal bond.”

On the woman’s claims of gang rape by the accused in a hotel in Bhadohi during 2017 assembly elections, the SP said: “The complainant had mentioned that she was kept in a hotel and gang-raped in May while assembly polls had taken place in February and March only. She also refused to go for medical examination.”

“When the hotel records were checked, it was found that she had stayed there with Sandeep on 10 different days in March 2017,” the SP said.

After the woman lodged complaint, an ASP was assigned the probe into the matter. After submission of his report with preliminary evidences, an FIR was lodged on February 19 against Tripathi, his five sons — Sachin, Chandrabhushan , Deepak, Prakash and Nitesh — and a nephew Sandeep under sections 376D, 313, 504 and 506 of IPC.

The woman, who is a widow from Varanasi, had said that Sandeep met her in a train in 2014. She alleged that Sandeep promised to marry her and repeatedly raped her in hotels of Bhadohi, Varanasi and Mumbai. She also accused the MLA and his five sons of raping her in a hotel room in Bhadohi during 2017 assembly election.

36,['23/02/2020'],‘Killer cough syrup’ maker failed quality tests several times,"This story is from February 23, 2020

Representative image

SRINAGAR: The company whose cough syrup is suspected to have caused the death of nine children in Jammu has been found to produce substandard quality medicine several times in the past by drug authorities in many states from 2014-15 onwards. Different products of the Himachal-based pharma manufacturer Digital Vision were found to be not-of-standard-quality (NSQ) in Rajasthan, Karnataka , Maharashtra , Gujarat and Kerala .

The database of the Xtended Licensing and Laboratory Node, an authority for issuing sales and manufacturing licences for pharma companies, recorded several such instances of quality failure of Digital Vision’s products from 2014 till 2019.

The company also figured in the government’s national drug quality survey report of 2014-16, where out of eight samples of the company’s products, four were found to be substandard.

Despite such numerous instances of poor quality drugs being manufactured by Digital Vision, a Rs 45 crore turnover company incorporated in 2009, it has continued to do business as usual raising questions about the consequences, if any, for manufacturers caught producing substandard drugs.

Of the 17 children affected in Udhampur district in Jammu, 9 died from renal failure. The common factor in all the deaths was that they had consumed the cough syrup Coldbest PC. There are 5,500 bottles of this September 2019 batch of Coldbest PC out in the market spread over eight states including Haryana, J&K, Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and some in the north-east.

The J&K drug controller has said that all units are being recalled. Himachal Pradesh health and safety regulation authorities have suspended all production at the company’s Kala Amb facility in Sirmaur, where the cough syrup was manufactured.

However, Dinesh Thakur, an activist who has worked on drug safety, pointed out that there were no binding rules on recall of drugs. “The CDSCO and the Himachal authorities have to answer how exactly they are going to execute a nation-wide recall,” he said.

PGI Chandigarh’s lab found that the cough syrup samples contained diethylene glycol, a chemical used to make polymers and anti-freeze, which could have caused the deaths. The samples have been sent for further testing to the Regional Drug Testing laboratory. The contaminant, diethylene glycol was found to be present in propylene glycol, a common food additive also used in drug manufacture. The propylene glycol used originated from Manali Petrochemicals in Chennai. Thakur pointed out that Digital Vision could not shift the blame to the supplier of the intermediary. “Under the law, the company that markets the drug is required to test all batches,” he noted.

37,['23/02/2020'],"On Fridays, these Mumbai cops climb 32 storeys to their office","This story is from February 23, 2020

MUMBAI: Vijay Khere, a deputy superintendent of police at Cuffe Parade ’s Maharashtra Cyber—the nodal agency for the state's cyber security—may be inching towards retirement but the 55-year-old still has very good reasons to call himself a social climber. Recently, when the King’s Circle-based cop forgot his spectacles at home, he sprinted up three floors to fetch them even though the lift was working. While it was actor Akshay Kumar ’s fitness regime that had long goaded Khere into abandoning the lift in his residential building, the renewed speed with which the cop ascends the stairs to his home has a lot to do with the latest policy of his self-styled workplace guru and colourful boss, senior cop Harish Baijal .

Every Friday since December 20, Khere and other employees of Maharashtra Cyber climb up 32 floors of the 32-storeyed World Trade Centre at Cuffe Parade because Baijal—a deputy inspector general who rides a cycle to work at times—felt that the exercise would “promote health consciousness” among the cyber crime staff before weekend reverie kicks in. So, every week, following a roll call by Baijal around 9.45am on the ground floor, the employees follow their boss up roughly 750 steps as a team. That’s how, for instance, many discovered that the stairs tend to taper after the 30th floor.

While this exercise mirrors the various motivational sports and physical gaming activities undertaken through the year by startups and corporates across the nation, it stands out given its weekly nature. “You should see their expressions at the end,” says Baijal about his staff members. “They all feel like they’ve achieved something spectacular.”

Though his vertical policy is not mandatory for all and “employees are free to take the lift on a certain floor in case they are unable to climb further”, his breathless idea predictably wasn’t an instant hit. If Khere’s wife worried about his aging heart, intern Smita Shitole ’s family was apprehensive about the effects on their asthmatic daughter’s lungs. Two months into the vertical marching order, though, the owners of both organs say they are functioning rather well. “It used to take me 20 minutes to climb 32 floors. Now it takes me 14,” says Khere, who also credits the weekly policy for his ability to finish the recent five-kilometre police marathon in a feverish 32 minutes. Besides, at the age when most men get ready to hang up their boots, Khere has started running 6km in them every other day from King’s Circle to Shivaji Park, thanks to the boost in stamina. “I want to run 10 kilometres in the next police marathon,” he says.

Twenty-two-year-old Shitole, on her part, has collected three roses from the various people her big boss invites to the terrace to felicitate employees after a successful climb. Shitole confesses that while she climbs slowly, she makes sure to complete the exercise and has now gained enough “confidence” to choose to walk from Vidyavihar to her home in Kurla’s LBS Marg at times. But the transformation Baijal—who sometimes invites people to felicitate his employees with roses at the end of the climb—is most proud of is that of 23-year-old, five-foot-three-inches-tall intern Gauri Sawant. “I now fit into my old clothes,” says heavy-set Sawant, adding that weight doesn’t make her run of breath after ten floors anymore.

Given the lurking danger of being “carried away by the group”, though, sports medicine consultant Dr Anant Joshi advises caution before undertaking such vigorous exercise. “Listening to the body is key. Not everyone’s body is designed the same way. In cases like stair-climbing, the impact is such that your knee cap and thigh bone takes three times your body weight, specially in women who are knock-kneed. In those cases, the knee cap tends to track sideways which may predispose them to early wear and tear. If you are not accustomed to heavy exercise, the key is to increase exercise in small increments,” he says.

Meanwhile, watching Sawant—who has begun to walk home from Santa Cruz station to her home near Kalina University over the past two months—has rekindled Baijal’s faith in his own local Fit India policy. “There are so many skyscrapers in Mumbai and it just takes a few minutes to climb the stairs. If everyone begins to walk, imagine how healthy the city can be,” says the 57-year-old cop, who did not cluck his tongue recently when he found a long queue outside a lift in a building opposite the Mantralaya in which he was supposed to attend a meeting on the 17th floor. “I said, ‘to hell with it’ and climbed,” he says.

38,['23/02/2020'],Congress needs to find a leader urgently: Shashi Tharoor,"This story is from February 23, 2020

Stung by a washout in the Delhi elections, Congress leaders are calling for urgent action on a leadership vacuum at the top. Shashi Tharoor tells TOI why it has become vital for Congress to dispel the notion that the party is in limbo and rudderless.

Should the Congress leader be a non-Gandhi as Rahul said when he resigned?

I think the question of whether or not the next president of Congress will be from the Gandhi family often misses the much larger concern, which is that Congress is indispensable for India, to give the country an alternative unifying vision to the divisive policies of the BJP government. We do need to find ourselves a new president to fill the vacuum created in the wake of Rahul Gandhi ’s resignation and, we need to do so without any further delay. I wish he hadn’t resigned. But if he persists in his determination, we need to find a full-time leadership so the party can move forward. To do this, we need to ensure there is a participatory democratic process through which this candidate emerges as it would significantly add to the winner’s credibility which would be a vital asset as to address organisational challenges. Obviously if a member of the Gandhi family stood for elections, they would be welcomed effusively. But I sincerely hope that the process is expedited. The perception that we are in limbo and rudderless needs to be dispelled immediately.

How soon should the process of changing the leadership happen?

The urgent need for this to be made a priority comes from the public and the media being increasingly prepared to write us off, as reflected in the magnitude of our defeat in Delhi. Those results make clear that we simply cannot afford to let this perception go on any longer. There are several other state elections around the corner and a national campaign in four years, which is not a period of time that can be simply tossed off as ‘distant future’. The direction and leadership of a capable and dynamic Congress president is indispensable.

Can Congress have a non-Gandhi as leader since it is generally said the Gandhi family keeps the party together?

There is no denying the clear fact that the Gandhi family has a special place in the hearts of Congress members and with good reason too. Aside from the great legacy they have inherited from their illustrious forebears, they have consistently brought together various groups, ideologies, geographies and communities that collectively make up the fabric of Congress and have a clear record of success and experience in leading the party, both when in government and during tough times in the wilderness. But again, the repeated question of “Gandhi or non-Gandhi” is missing the wood for the trees. The urgent need is to find a new president and I am confident that if we do so through a transparent, democratic electoral process internally, the workers will at the end of the day throw their might and energy behind whoever emerges as the winning candidate.

Is Priyanka Gandhi Vadra the candidate the Congress should look at?

This is not about any individual. I certainly hope that she will throw her name in the ring when the call for elections are officially declared. For one, it must be said that she has a natural charisma which has often prompted many to make comparisons with the late Indira Gandhi , which could certainly galvanise and rally party workers and voters alike. At the same time, she also comes with organisational experience. But at the end of the day, this will be her personal decision and we must respect that.

39,['23/02/2020'],"‘Want to take along Congress, RJD’","This story is from February 23, 2020

PATNA: Putting all speculations to rest, HAM(S) chief and former Bihar CM Jitan Ram Manjhi on Saturday said his party and two other smaller Mahagathbandhan allies –Upendra Kushwaha-led Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) and Mukesh Sahni-led Vikassheel Inssan Party (VIP) – would fight the assembly elections in the state alongside RJD and Congress.

There were rumours that the three parties might toe a different line after their chiefs met Loktantrik Janata Dal patron Sharad Yadav in Patna last week and poll strategist Prashant Kishor in New Delhi on Thursday to discuss political situation in the state.

However, Manjhi cleared the air in New Delhi on Saturday when he said, “We want to take along every party. RJD and Congress are bigger parties. Hence, we want to take them along. We had felt that the two parties were maintaining distance with us and therefore we met Sharadji,” Manjhi said.

He added, “I met Congress’s Rajya Sabha member Akhilesh Prasad Singh in New Delhi on Friday and held a fruitful discussion with him. We will meet again in the first week of March for further talks.”

Making an appeal to RJD to strengthen the alliance, Manjhi said Lalu Prasad’s party should also come forward for formation of a Mahagathbandhan coordination committee. Manjhi has been demanding formation of coordination committee ever since the opposition alliance suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of NDA in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

The RJD, on the other hand, said Manjhi should not get “restless”. “Why is he (Manjhi) in haste? RJD is strengthening its organization and our ‘Berojgari Hatao Yatra’ is a step in this direction. If the party becomes strong, it will be beneficial for everyone,” RJD national vice-president Shivanand Tiwari said.

40,['23/02/2020'],Gaya sewage treatment plan in limbo as ADB refuses funds,"This story is from February 23, 2020

GAYA: Execution of the much-awaited Gaya sewage treatment plant has suffered a setback as the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has refused to provide fund for the project’s execution. This was revealed by urban development and housing department’s secretary Anand Kishore before a high court bench headed by Chief Justice Sanjay Karol on Tuesday.

The revelation was made during the hearing of a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Pratijyana, a citizen group that has approached HC for betterment of civic amenities in the holy town and prevention of sewage flow in the sacred Falgu river. As of now, the sewage from Mansarwa Nala and other city drains flows in Falgu river, where ‘pindaadan’ ritual performers have to offer ‘tarpan’ with the highly contaminated river water.

According to HC lawyer Manish Kumar, who appeared for the petitioner in HC, told the court that following the refusal of ADB to fund the project, alternative funding sources are being explored and the economic affairs department of the Union finance ministry is being approached. The scheme will be executed once the issue of funds is resolved, the official told the court.

ADB has committed to a Rs 311 crore project for supply of tap water to 75,000 households of Gaya Municipal Corporation (GMC) area spread over 53 wards of the town. The sewerage treatment plant (STP) is estimated to cost about Rs 200 crore.

Besides STP and removal of encroachment from Falgu banks, the citizens’ body has petitioned the court for execution of four-laning of 127km- long NH-83, linking the GT road with Patna. According to Pratijyana’s lawyer, NHAI and the stage government took a divergent stand on land acquisition for the four-lane project. The government has assured the court to acquire the remaining land and hand over its possession to NHAI by mid-April.

During the hearing, the CJ said that mere filling up of potholes on Gaya-Patna road will not do. Proper black topping of the road was needed for smooth ride of road users. Earlier, the CJ had to abandon his vehicle in Gaya and return to Patna by train on account of innumerable potholes dotting the road. Subsequently, the CJ summoned officials concerned and directed them to get the things done.

41,['23/02/2020'],CBI raid in Barh to nab two Vyapam scam accused,"This story is from February 23, 2020

PATNA: CBI sleuths carried out raids in Barh at the hideouts of two Vyapam scam accused — Hem Narayan Tiwari and his brother Namo Tiwari — on Friday night, but failed to make any arrests.

The admission and recruitment scam in Madhya Pradesh had dogged the Shivraj Singh Chauhan-led BJP government till he was voted out of power. The scam, involving senior politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen of that state, relates to irregularities in 13 exams conducted by the Vyavsayik Pariksha Mandal (Vyapam) for job recruitments and admission to educational institutions.

A two-member CBI team from Madhya Prasad conducted the raids near Satisthan under Barh police station. The CBI team was camping in Patna for the past three days and conducted raids with the help of Barh police after zeroing in on the mobile phone locations of the accused. The two brothers are absconding since their names cropped up in the scam.

Barh SHO Sanjeet Kumar said on Saturday, “We are cooperating with the central agency in the investigation. But the CBI team returned empty handed after submitting relevant documents pertaining to the case at our police station.”

He clarified that the local police had no role to play in the raids. “The CBI team has visited this sub-divisional town at least six times in the past two years in search of the accused, who are evading arrest in the Vyapam scam,” the SHO added.

The scam involved collusion of undeserving candidates, who bribed politicians and MPPEB officials through middlemen, to get high marks in the entrance tests. The scam also led to an unusual number of deaths of around three dozen individuals. The scam involved 13 different examinations conducted by Vyapam for selection of medical students and state government employees, including food inspectors, transport constables, school teachers, dairy suppliers, forest guards and police personnel.

Cases of irregularities in the entrance tests had been reported since mid-1990s. However, the sheer scale of the scam came to fore only in 2013 when the Indore police arrested 20 people who had come to impersonate candidates for PMT 2009. The interrogation of the arrested people led to the arrest of Jagdish Sagar, stated to be the kingpin of the organized racket involved in the scam.

42,['23/02/2020'],‘RPC agriculture university has made important innovations in last 4 years’,"This story is from February 23, 2020

PATNA: After the conversion of Rajendra Prasad Agriculture University into Rajendra Prasad Central Agriculture University (RPCAU) in 2016, its first vice-chancellor Dr Ramesh Chandra Srivastava tells Abhay Singh how it has been distinctively innovative in responding to the reigning concerns that is demanded of any such institution. Excerpts:

What are the changes made in the last four years?

At the time of its conversion, this institution had only 468 students. The number of students has now increased to 1,439. We have degree courses in six to seven subjects, postgraduate courses in 24 and conduct PhD studies and researches in 11 subjects. We also opened two business management courses — through College of Horticulture and Forestry and another unit of Agro Business and Rural Management. We have also developed a robust recruitment policy for the teaching, non-teaching and service-provider staff.

How do students finally end up?

There is 80 to 90% of placement for students who want to get into job. Overall, about 60% of students go for higher studies, 10 to 15% in government job and rest get placement with the entry-level package of around Rs4.5 lakh per year.

If there have been any highly innovative interventions, other than academic researches and innovations in the field of agriculture?

Yes. A unit on the campus uses stems of ‘arhar’ plants for making handicrafts, as the universal launch of Ujjwala Yojana has resulted in the ‘arhar’ plant stems going waste. We have also developed a method to use maize cobs as packaging material to replace the use of thermocol, because the latter takes 500 years to decompose and causes environmental hazards. Then, we have developed a method to convert flower and other wastes at temples into vermicompost. Finally, we have developed a method to convert litchi seeds into fish feed.

Could you say something about ‘fish cot’?

It’s a kind of solar panel powered fridge with 140 litre capacity that can be used to preserve quality of raw fish for long hours on a day, say up to 2pm, when they are taken out for sales. The ‘fish cot’ is used by fish vendors. In fact, the Bihar animal husbandry and fishery resources department has decided to give 25 such ‘fish cots’ manufactured by a Kolkata based company to fish vendors in the Kosi river basin area. The department would give subsidy to fishermen and RPCAU will get 5% royalty from the company on each sold item for innovating it.

Farmers in the ‘diara’ areas face irrigation problem. Any advice for them?

Yes, we have designed a system in which we installed a solar panel on boat. The energy generated can be used to draw water from land for irrigational use. The method has come in use in some ‘diara’ villages in Muzaffarpur and a few other districts.

Bihar faces extreme weather conditions. Any insightful advice for farmers?

The state government has asked us to frame a policy framework on water management and utilization of wetland. The clue lies in developing a method and farming practice that involves farmers in keeping the groundwater recharged even while they draw in underground water for irrigation purposes.

Varanasi: Police on Saturday arrested the nephew of BJP MLA from Bhadohi Ravindra Nath Tripathi on charges of rape and said no evidence was found against the legislator and his five sons in the case.

On February 10, a 35-year-old woman had lodged a complaint accusing the MLA’s nephew of raping her for last four years. She had also alleged that the MLA and his sons also raped her during 2017 state elections. Police arrested the MLA’s nephew, Sandeep Tripathi, on Saturday morning while claiming that no evidence was found against other accused. MLA’s son Nitesh Tripathi was taken into custody on charges of threatening and manhandling but was later released on personal bond.

Producing Sandeep before reporters following his arrest, superintendent of police, Bhadohi, RB Singh said: “Evidence in support of woman’s allegations were found against Sandeep only. The MLA’s son, Nitesh, was found to be involved in threatening and manhandling. He was taken into custody but as charges against him were bailable, he was released on personal bond.”

On the woman’s claims of gang rape by the accused in a hotel in Bhadohi during 2017 assembly elections, the SP said: “The complainant had mentioned that she was kept in a hotel and gang raped in May while assembly polls had taken place in February and March only. She also refused to go for medical examination.” “When hotel records were checked, it was found that she had stayed there with Sandeep on 10 different days in March 2017,” the SP said.

After the woman lodged complaint, an ASP was assigned the probe into the matter. After submission of his report with preliminary evidences, an FIR was lodged on February 19 against Tripathi, his five sons — Sachin, Chandrabhushan, Deepak, Prakash and Nitesh — and a nephew Sandeep under sections 376D, 313, 504 and 506 of IPC. The woman, who is a widow from Varanasi, had said that Sandeep met her in a train in 2014. She alleged that Sandeep promised to marry her and repeatedly raped her in hotels of Bhadohi, Varanasi and Mumbai. She also accused the MLA and his five sons of raping her in a hotel room in Bhadohi during 2017 assembly election.

PATNA: Senior JD(U) leader and state’s information and public relations department (IPRD) minister Neeraj Kumar on Saturday said the state government will conduct an inquiry in the purchase of a hi-tech luxury bus in the name of a person holding a below-poverty-line (BPL) card.

The controversial bus registered in the name of BPL card holder Mangal Pal, has been designed and named as ‘Yuva Kranti Rath’. Neeraj, during a previous press conference, had alleged that the bus would be used by RJD leader Tejashswi Prasad Yadav for his statewide ‘Berojgari Hatao Yatra’ which will begin from the state capital on March 23.

Addressing a press conference at the JD(U) office here on Sunday, Neeraj furnished more documents to support his claim that the luxury bus has been purchased in Pal’s name. He also asked Tejashwi to explain as to why he implicated a poor BPL card holder in the racket of financial irregularities.

Flanked by his cabinet colleagues planning minister Maheshwar Hazari, rural works minister Shailesh Kumar and Yuva JD (U) leader Om Praksh Singh Setu, the IPRD minister further said that the controversial bus was purchased by committing financial irregularities.

“Tejasjwi Ji, I have provided enough documents to prove your involvement in illegal purchase of the bus. You can contradict my claim if you have documentary proof. You are also free to register a case of defamation against me, if I am levelling false allegation against you,” Neeraj said.

46,['23/02/2020'],NMA seeks revised redevelopment plan for Gotalawadi tenements,"This story is from February 23, 2020

Surat: Finally , about 1 ,304 families from economically weaker section living at Gotalawadi tenements at Katargam will get houses after National Monument Authority (NMA) asked Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) to submit a revised building plan with height of 35 metres for approval.

Last year, the SMC had taken up redevelopment of Gotalawadi tenements under redevelopment of public housing scheme 2016 on public private partnership (PPP) basis. The developer of the tenements was asked to pay rent to the beneficiaries till the time the project was completed.

Since the project is located 130 metres away from heritage Dutch Cemetery near Gotalawadi in Katargam, the developer had approached the NMA for approving the project under Heritage Impact Assessment with the height of 45 metres. The NMA approved the no-objection certificate (NOC) for total building height of 22.80 metres, which comes to around six storeys.

As the required height was not approved by the NMA, the developer stopped paying rent to the beneficiaries.

Darshana Jardosh, Surat MP, and Dr Jagdish Patel, mayor, sought intervention of Prahlad Singh Patel, Union minister of culture, over the plight of 1,304 families who were forced to live without shelter for the last many months because of the building height issue raised by NMA.

Based on a special review petition filed by SMC, NMA asked the civic body to submit a revised plan for approval of the building height.

Darshana Jardosh told TOI, “It is a big win for 1,304 families of Gotalawadi tenements. A revised plan with 35 metre height will be submitted soon to NMA for approval. Once the approval comes, redevelopment of Gotalawadi tenements will be taken up on a war footing.”

PATNA: CPI functionary and former JNU Students’ Union president Kanhaiya Kumar on Saturday claimed that his February 27 rally at Patna ’s Gandhi Maidan, to be organised under the banner of ‘NPR-NRC-CAA Virodhi Morcha’, would shake the Centre and state government and compel them to rethink on implementation of NPR and CAA.

“My rally is based on morality and it has nothing to do with politics,” Kanhaiya told reporters here, adding that leaders of all non-NDA parties will attend the rally. “We may have different political ideologies, but we will come together in our fight to protect the Constitution,” Kanhaiya said.

He added that the rally at Gandhi Maidan will begin at 10am. “It will be addressed by Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad, Mahatma Gandhi’s great grandson Tushar Gandhi, actor Swara Bhaskar, social activist Yogendra Yadav, dalit leader Jignesh Mevani, former IAS officer Kannan Gopinathan, JNU Students’ Union president Aishe Ghosh, Congress functionary Sadaf Jafar, Rohith Vemula’s mother Radhika Vemula, Najeeb Ahmad’s mother Fatima Nafees, Congress leader Alka Lamba, social activist Medha Patkar, actor Sushant Singh, film director Anurag Kashyap and student representatives from Jamia Millia Islamia University, Delhi University and Patna University,” Kanhaiya said.

PATNA: The district administration is on its toes as the nationwide bandh called by Bhim Army and supported by some opposition parties in the state and launch of ‘Berojgari Hatao Yatra’ by leader of opposition in state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav from Veterinary College ground here might disrupt vehicular traffic and train movement on Sunday.

The ‘chakka jam’ by Bhim Army could see buses and autorickshaws staying off the roads. Tens of hundreds of vehicles to be brought by RJD supporters for Tejashwi’s yatra, on the other hand, may also hit traffic in the city.

Some non-NDA parties in the state and Imarat Shariya have supported the bandh called by Bhim Army against the Supreme Court’s ruling that the states are not bound to give reservation in government jobs and promotion. Other issues, such as alleged atrocities on dalits, CAA and NRC will also be raised by Bhim Army during the bandh.

Jan Adhikar Party-Loktantrik (JAP-L) chief Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav and HAM (S) chief Jitan Ram Manjhi have said they would hit the roads along with their party workers on Sunday in support of the bandh. Bhim Army state general secretary Amar Jyoti said they will not allow vehicular movement during the bandh. However, emergency services will be spared, Jyoti added.

Bihar State Auto Chalak Sangh’s general secretary Raj Kumar Jha said only 25% autorickshaws would be available on the roads on Sunday. “Many auto drivers have also supported the bandh,” Jha said.

However, state transport department secretary Sanjay Kumar Agarwal said government buses would ply as usual.

Shopkeepers have also decided to play it safe during Sunday’s bandh. “I will open my shop only after lunch,” said Anil Juneja, owner of a shop at Hathwa Market.

Mahima Singh, a local, said, “I had planned to meet my friends over lunch on Sunday. However, I do not want to take any risk as the ruckus created by RJD and JAP(L) activists during December 21 bandh is still fresh in my mind.”

49,['23/02/2020'],Government to act tough against agitating teachers,"This story is from February 23, 2020

PATNA: Taking a tough stand against agitating teachers, the state government on Saturday said those boycotting their evaluation duty in spite of being served a letter in this regard will be suspended and FIR will be lodged against them.

As the agitating contractual schoolteachers continued with their protest at district education officer’s office in the city on Saturday, police used water cannon to disperse them.

State education department additional chief secretary RK Mahajan on Saturday held a videoconference with chief executive officers of zila parishads, district education officers, district programme officers and executive officers of urban local bodies to review the preparations regarding evaluation of Intermediate answer sheets from February 26.

Mahajan asked them to suspend those who will boycott evaluation work even after getting a letter from the department. Calling it a negligence of duty and obstruction in government work, Mahajan instructed the officers to lodge FIRs against the teachers who don’t resume their work by February 25.

He also asked the officers to create a monitoring cell in all the DEO offices and apprise the department and Bihar School Examination Board (BSEB) about the ongoing evaluation on daily basis.

“Evaluation is among the priorities of government. Career of lakhs of students is dependent on it. Hence, any obstacle will not be accepted. If any teacher, teacher association or anyone who tries to create obstacle will be dealt with strictly,” read a press release issued by the education department.

The niyojit (contractual) schoolteachers went on strike when BSEB Intermediate examination started on Monday. The government has maintained its tough stand since then and suspended as well as terminated some of the agitating teachers.

On Saturday, police used water cannon and picked 20 teachers from the DEO office and took them to Gardanibagh protest site. These teachers had been protesting there for the past three days against termination of two permanent teachers and FIRs lodged against four of their union members.

Bihar Rajya Shikshak Sangh Samanvay Samity (Patna) convener Prem Chandra said, “We have been protesting against termination of our colleagues Manoj Kumar and Mohammad Mustafa Azad, as well as FIRs lodged against four union members.” Chandra alleged that police resorted to lathicharge and took 20 of them in riot control vehicle to Gardanibagh police station. From there, they were directed to go to the protest site.

State education minister Krishna Nandan Prasad Verma said such lathicharge and mild force were natural during protests. “I would request teachers not to be misled by a select few who have political agenda,” said Verma.

50,['23/02/2020'],50 Bowbazar residents evacuated from three buildings on Urvi route,"This story is from February 23, 2020

Kolkata: Around 50 Bowbazar residents of three buildings on Chaitan Sen Lane, under which tunnel boring machine (TBM) Urvi will be passing in the next four or five days, were evacuated on Saturday. The process started at 10am and went on till the evening.

Among those who were shifted out of Bowbazar was 64-year-old Shibaji Dhani, who had a dialysis session on Saturday. “I picked up my father from the hospital and, instead of going back home to 11/2A, Chaitan Sen Lane, we took him to a hotel on Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road,” said his son Sourav.Sourav, 30, and four other members of the family had moved into the hotel in the afternoon. The 64-year-old joined them in the evening.

ITD ITD-Cementation, contracted to build the last stretch of the 2.4km twin tunnels from Esplanade to Sealdah, has told the hotel management to cook light food for Dhani, who has to undergo dialysis thrice a week.

For the Roys at 13, Chaitan Sen Lane, however, this was the second evacuation, and to the same hotel. They had been shifted after the TBM Chundee hit an aquifer and the subsequent subsidence damaged their house on 13/1, Durga Pithuri Lane. After a stint at the hotel, they had moved into a rented apartment, which now falls on Urvi’s route.

At 11/3, Chaitan Sen Lane (Dewan Bari), however, cancer patient Alpana Bhattacharjee, 55, has stayed back since she is too weak to leave having just undergone a chemotherapy session. Her son Sayan and their domestic help Rabindranath Pal have stayed back with her because she cannot eat hotel food.

The evacuation notice pasted on the buildings in Bowbazar, however, has said the occupants’ stay at the hotel till Thursday may be prolonged by a day or two since the TBM’s movement will be extremely slow. Most of the buildings below which the tunnels are being dug are more than a 100 years old and are structurally unstable. These buildings have now been propped up with steel rods and their foundations are being strengthened by grouting.

KOLKATA: What do you do when someone makes an obscene gesture or touches you inappropriately? Kolkata Police advices you to tackle the situation head on, using self-defence techniques that the cops themselves plan to teach you. The third edition of the Tejashwini project — where cops teach women basic self-defence techniques — will be held from from March 4, winding up on Women’s Day, March 8. But this edition promises to be different. Kolkata Police will now provide self-defence training to women every three months.The camp will run by the Kolkata Police Sergeants Institute at the Police Athletic Club (PAC) tent, opposite the East Bengal grounds. The training will be for two hours each day, between 8am and 10am, and is open to girls and women between 12 and 40.The training camps will be held every three months after Lalbazar received repeated requests to do so following the first two editions. For the first time, kick-boxing will find greater application and there are plans to impart certain psychological training as well.The cops said efforts were on to conduct these classes across all nine police divisions. “We often receive complaints that women cannot reach the camp so early. That is why we pushed back timings in the morning by an hour this time. The fact remains that women from far-off places fail to travel such a long distance. Hence, there is an urgent need to spread it across the city,” said an officer involved with the project.“Our training will make women more confident in tackling incidents where they face unwanted behaviour from men,” the cops tweeted. Those interested can register on the Kolkata Police website. Others can register offline by visiting the PAC tent. They can also ask for details on the WhatsApp number 9748438165.The response, especially from women, has so far been good. Almost everyone welcomed the move, though several wanted a change of timing to make the training more “flexible and inclusive”.“This is a good initiative. I will try to join with friends. But reaching south Kolkata at 8am is not always a feasible option for all. If there is a change of timing, it will help attract more people. Otherwise, a similar attempt at all police divisions should be made,” said Samriddha Banerjee on Facebook.Schoolgirls who are learning various martial arts, as well as their parents, felt it was very important for girls to learn self-defence. “Learning martial arts increases self-confidence, which helps us tackle adverse situations,” said Chandrani Biswas, a Class VII student who trains in taekwondo.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74261907,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-299437,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-self-defence-camp-for-women-back-with-new-training-techniques/articleshow/74261907.cms
52,['23/02/2020'],Kolkata: SSKM ‘shortcut’ turns into traffic trouble for police,"This story is from February 23, 2020

Vehicles cut through SSKM to avoid snarls at AJC Bose Road-Harish Mukherjee Road crossing

KOLKATA: The biggest government hospital in Bengal is facing a curious problem that even the local traffic guard is finding difficult to solve. Complaints are pouring in from SSKM Hospital about cars and bikes using the wide roads within the compound as a shortcut to reduce journey time and avoid the snarl at the signal at AJC Bose Road-Harish Mukherjee Road crossing.

Till 1pm, cars usually take the roads within the hospital complex to reach AJC Bose Road from Harish Mukherjee Road. When the vehicular flow turns towards the south, cars coming from AJC Bose Road, or the flyover above, turn left and take a shortcut through the hospital to Harish Mukherjee Road.

The Kolkata Police’s Facebook page has received multiple complaints in this regard. The Bhowanipore traffic guard said that in the past week, at least six challans have been issued to various motorists — from rash driving to honking and illegal parking. The worst offenders have been taxis and bikes, said police sources. On Friday, TOI stood at the two gates — on AJC Bose Road off the AJC Bose Road flyover and at the main entrance on Harish Mukherjee Road — and found several cars getting off the bridge and entering the premises. This included taxis, bikes and even top-end SUVs that jostled for space with ambulances once they entered the SSKM campus.

“This problem has escalated in the past two weeks. Not only does it increase chaos in the silent zone, making it difficult for patients’ vehicles to move faster, but it is also a security issue. Any speeding can lead to accidents,” claimed Amartya Ganguly, a doctor who first flagged the matter to Kolkata Police.

A Bhowanipore traffic guard officer, though, did not agree that it was a regular phenomenon. “A variety of issues have led to a slightly longer wait at the AJC Bose Road-Harish Mukherjee Road crossing, but that cannot be an excuse to use the compound roads. We have started a special drive and now this phenomenon happens on and off. However, everyone on duty here has been asked to be vigilant,” an officer said. Lalbazar officers, however, said they were not aware of the developments and will look into the complaints.

After the assault on doctors at NRS Hospital earlier, the police and the health department had made a number of recommendations to make government hospital campuses safer. One crucial recommendation was to ensure that vehicles with no connection to the hospital should not be parked inside.

“We did not count on vehicles plying on the internal road. A similar problem existed at Medical College and Hospital, which offers easy connectivity between CR Avenue and College Street. But stricter access control helped us tackle the situation. A similar strategy has been planned for SSKM Hospital,” a sergeant said.

Researchers from Calcutta University’s Centre for Urban Economic Studies (CUES) had strongly advocated reforms in vehicle taxation and road pricing — including imposing a congestion tax on cars entering the central business district and places that have high public presence — to make car users “pay for the costs they impose on society”. “This will not only reduce use of personal vehicles and, therefore, cut down on congestion and pollution, but also generate revenue that can be invested to improve public transport and infrastructure for pedestrians and undertake pollution control,“ the study had concluded.

PATNA/BUXAR: The Buxar police had to face the wrath of the supporters of an RJD functionary Manoj Thakur after they arrested him allegedly in an inebriated condition under the Brahmkrishna police outpost on Friday night.

An assistant sub-inspector of police was among three policemen injured in the incident. Thakur, stated to be Dumraon block functionary of the RJD, was nabbed from Noniapura village around 8 pm on Friday for violating the prohibition law. As the news about his arrest spread, a group of his supporters attacked the police team near the railway crossing and set him free.

An ASI Banka Choudhary along with two other cops suffered injuries in stone pelting. They were rushed to the Dumraon hospital where Choudhary’s condition was stated to be critical. He had received serious injuries on his head while trying to disperse the mob.

Buxar SP Upendra Nath Verma said that altogether 20 people were detained for being involved in letting off Thakur, stated to be former mukhiya of Soba panchayat from police custody and attack on the police team. Of them, nine were arrested and sent to jail on Saturday while others were released from the police station for lack of evidence.

The SP further said that raids were on to nab Thakur, who is absconding after the incident. Police have also seized two bottles of liquor from Thakur’s bike, who has been booked under sections 353 (assault or use of force to deter public servant from discharge of duty) and 307 (attempt to murder) of IPC besides relevant sections of Bihar Excise and Prohibition Act 2016.

BJP national president J P Nadda

PATNA: BJP national president J P Nadda on Saturday reiterated that the NDA would go to the assembly elections under the leadership of CM Nitish Kumar . He also maintained that the BJP’s rank and file should reach out to all sections of people, including Muslims, to clear their confusions by citing advantages accruing from the abrogation of Article 370 and triple talaq.

“The abrogation of Article 370 and ending the practice of triple talaq were aimed at mainstreaming the people of Jammu and Kashmir as well as Ladakh, and Muslim women,” Nadda said.

Nadda said the poll reverses BJP faced in the recently held assembly elections should not dampen their morale, as the BJP, unlike other parties, always “considered country as primary and vote bank secondary”.

As to Patna and Bihar, Nadda referred to infrastructural supports, like roads, bridges and flyovers, saying: “You will accept that the Bihar scene has changed in the last 10 years and also in the last five years with money provided by PM Narendra Modi.”

Nadda was on his maiden one-day visit to the state after becoming the party’s president. He also made a courtesy call on CM Nitish. He inaugurated the newly constructed buildings for the fully furnished party headquarters in 11 party districts, besides holding in-camera meeting with the party’s core committee members to reach at a strategy and chalk out programmes required to prepare for the assembly elections.

BJP national general secretary Bhupender Yadav, state chief Dr Sanjay Kumar Jaiswal, Union minister Nityanand Rai and Bihar minister Mangal Pandey also spoke on the occasion. BJP’s Rajya Sabha members Dr C P Thakur, Gopal Narayan Singh and R K Sinha, as well as Bihar ministers Nand Kishore Yadav and Prem Kumar were also present.

In his deliberation, Nadda skirted the issues of Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Population Register (NPR) and National Register of Citizens (NRC). Otherwise, he gave a clear signal that the state BJP should hammer on Article 370 and ‘triple talaq’ to win over the people of the state, who had given 39 of the 40 parliamentary seats to the NDA constituents — 17 to BJP, 16 to JD(U) and six to Lok Janshakti Party in May last year.

SURAT: A 14-year-old schoolgirl walked into Tapi River near Savji Korat Bridge with the intention of committing suicide on Saturday. But as luck would have it, an auto-rickshaw driver who was nearby rescued the distressed girl in nick of time.

Her family members informed the police that the tempestuous teen must have been angry over some issue and thus walked into the river to end her life.

A resident of Simada area, the girl reached the riverbank on Saturday evening and started walking into the muddy part of the river where the water is shallow which saved her life. Meanwhile, auto driver, Ajit Pal, who was cleaning his rickshaw nearby, noticed the girl’s unusual behaviour. He quickly followed and rescued the girl while she was just about 35 feet away from the deep waters.

Locals alerted Surat Fire and Emergency Services (SFES) and a team arrived at the spot. Meanwhile, the girl was already rescued by Pal and she was later shifted to the hospital.

""Initially we received the information that she jumped but after verification at spot and with the girl it was found that she walked into the water. Her family members claimed that she has temperament issues and due to some unknown reason she must have been upset,"" said a police officer at Sarthana police station.

Seven-year-old Kanika does addition of 100 single digit numbers in just 50 seconds

SURAT: Four kids in the age group of 7 to 12 years from the city have proved their ability in mental arithmetic. They claim they are the fastest human calculators in the world. These kids have applied for Guiness Book Of World Records. Their trainer claims that there is no such world record previously registered in this area.

Kanika Mehta (class I), Harsh Goyal (class V), Chinmay Bafna (class V) and Mann Agarwal (class VI) leave onlookers speechless when they start counting numbers. Seven-year-old Kanika does addition of 100 single digit numbers in just 50 seconds.

Kanika is learning mathematics with the help of abacus, and gradually she will learn higher level of mathematics through Vedic mathematics. “I started learning mathematics two years ago. Initially, it was difficult but now I find it easy,” said Kanika, who completes the counting with a smile.

Harsh completes addition of 98 sets of five single digit in just 2.52 minutes, while moving his fingers in the air. While Chinmay does addition of 200 single digits that changes at every three seconds on screen.

“I have learned the technique to count the numbers that looks difficult but after practising, it looks easy. I prepared for this record for just two months and achieved it,” said Harsh.

Chinmay does the counting while holding a pen in the hand. “I enjoy achieving the tough mathematical tasks now,” he added.

Mann Agarwal can complete 100 multiplications of one double digit with a single digit numbers in just 1.58 seconds. He also does addition of 100 two digit numbers with the numbers changing at every 0.6 seconds on screen.

“I don’t feel any stress now. I have been learning mathematics for the last three years, and I will soon start learning the tougher modules,” said Mann.

Tutor of the students, Dipesh Desai , said, “We have applied for the Guiness Book Of World Records, and there are no previous records in these categories. The process will take time of six months. Meanwhile, we have also applied for the Limca Book of Records and Asia Book of Records as well.”

Patna received little over 1.3mm rainfall over the last 24 hours (File photo)

PATNA: Several districts in central Bihar, including Patna , received lights showers on Saturday. India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted that the showers will continue at least till Monday.

The daily weather bulletin issued by Patna meteorological centre stated that light to moderate rainfall occurred at a few places over the state during the last 24 hours. Patna received little over 1.3mm rainfall over the last 24 hours.

“Light to moderate rainfall likely to occur at many places across Bihar in the next two days after that rainfall intensity will decrease. Thunderstorm with lightning and hail activity is also likely to occur at one or two places over north-central and south-central parts in the state on Sunday,” the daily weather report stated.

The IMD bulletin stated that light to moderate rain or thundershowers are likely to occur over east India from Sunday to Tuesday due to confluence of middle level westerly winds and lower level easterlies from the Bay of Bengal.

The weather bulletin further stated that thunderstorm accompanied with lightning and hail is also likely over Bihar and Jharkhand during the next two to three days.

Private weather agency Skymetweather also reported that many parts of Bihar received light rainfall with one or two moderate spells in the last 24 hours. It further stated that the rainfall activity is likely to increase during the next 24 hours.

“Rain is expected to continue with light to moderate intensity over the region of Bihar, while also covering Jharkhand and West Bengal. Rain is likely to continue up to February 25 and will reduce thereafter,” the Skymet report stated.

The private weather agency attributed the showers to a cyclonic circulation over central parts of Uttar Pradesh and a confluence zone extending from east Madhya Pradesh to northeast Bihar.

As far as temperature is concerned, Skymet stated that the day temperatures are set to drop by at least four to five degrees in the coming days.

Patna divisional commissioner Sanjay Kumar Agarwal

PATNA: The newly appointed Patna municipal commissioner, Himashu Sharma, has been asked to expedite the works under smart city projects.

Patna divisional commissioner Sanjay Kumar Agarwal, during a meeting on Saturday to review the ongoing projects under smart city mission in the state capital, asked Sharma to do spot inspection of all major drains in the city, including Baadhshai Nullah, to ensure that they are not clogged.

Agarwal said all required administrative support will be provided to Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) for cleaning the drains and carrying out anti-encroachment drive.

“The drains should be cleaned properly to prevent clogging due to waste, which can lead to waterlogging during monsoon. Bleaching powder should also be spread while cleaning drains to prevent waterborne diseases,” Agarwal said.

A press statement released by the office of the divisional commissioner stated: “Special attention should be given to cleanliness in the city. Garbage should not be seen strewn anywhere and cleanliness should be carried out regularly.”

Agarwal also praised door-to-door garbage collection and asked the municipal commissioner to ensure that it is carried out without any disruption.

With regard to street lights, the divisional commissioner asked Sharma to ensure their maintenance regularly. “A survey should be carried out to find out how many street lights are functioning. All defunct street lights should be replaced to ensure that all streets are illuminated after sunset,” he said.

Agarwal also asked the municipal commissioner to ensure signage at parking and no-parking zones.

Other officials present in the meeting included chief general manager of Patna Smart City Limited S K Sahu, its chief executive officer-cum-deputy municipal commissioner Devendra Tiwari among others.

Harsh Mander speaks at a city college on Saturday

KOLKATA: There is possibility of immense bloodshed in Bengal if NPR is enforced, felt author, communist, teacher and activist Harsh Mander. He was delivering the keynote address at a national conference on ‘Statelessness and the Right to Have Right’, organized by The Legal Aid Society, West Bengal National University of Juridical Sciences in association with Cornell Law School Human Rights Clinic in Kolkata on Saturday.

“There are dangers ahead. The government will not pull back. If NPR happens, the authorities will get the right to identify people who they feel are doubtful. The CAA will do the rest. The 2003 amendment of the Citizenship Act needs to be withdrawn. There is immense possibility of violence in Bengal as it is the front line after Assam. Unfortunately, I don’t see any clarity or courage among political parties to take on the government. The issue won’t be resolved in Parliament or any court. It has to be resolved on the streets and in our hearts,” Mander said.

According to him, the extreme Right sees this as a decisive battle to finish the “unfinished business” of Partition. Those protesting against what Mander calls the “unholy trinity” of CAA, NRC and NPR are also trying to complete the unfinished business of the freedom struggle, he said.

“This is a tacit war against citizens based on religious identity. In the last 5-6 years, an ideological ‘project’ has been launched against a section of people,” the activist added.

He believes that there are three parts to the project — political marginalisation, social legitimisation of hatred and bigotry, and turning the Muslim into a second-class citizen. The protests, however, are like explosions of light after a long, dark journey, he said.

LJP president Chirag Paswan

PATNA: LJP president Chirag Paswan said in Sheohar on Saturday that the contractual teachers’ demand will be included in the party manifesto for the upcoming state assembly elections. Chirag has embarked on a ‘Bihar First, Bihari first’ yatra across the state from Friday. Incidentally, the NDA government, of which LJP is an ally, has refused to accept the contractual teachers’ demand of equal pay for equal work.

Around four lakh contractual teachers of government and government-aided schools belonging to 32 teachers’ associations have been on an indefinite strike since February 17, demanding equal pay for equal work, old pension scheme and service conditions. They have also boycotted invigilation duty during the ongoing matric examination conducted by Bihar School Examination Board.

“I am agreed to your demands. I will give this memorandum (of striking contractual teachers) to the chief minister and every demand being raised by you all will be put in our manifesto and resolved as well. I am with you all,” Chirag said.

The group of striking teachers, who met Chirag at Sheohar, also handed over a memorandum of their demands to him. They claimed that two teachers were terminated and FIRs were lodged against five teachers and several others have been suspended. They hailed Chirag’s announcement regarding their demands.

When asked for his reaction on Chirag’s announcement, JD(U) spokesperson Rajiv Ranjan Prasad said: “Every party in any alliance has the right to include issues, which they consider important, in their manifesto. It is purely their prerogative. However, we would like to assert that Nitish Kumar government has always looked after the interest of niyojit (contractual) teachers. Their employability issue has been resolved and the government has improved their honorarium. Thus, the teachers should also think about the future of the students and not be adamant on their demands.”

RJD, on the other hand, claimed that Chirag’s statement is aimed at ‘politics of vote bank’. “Chirag’s statement is mere gimmick as his party is in the government. He should talk to the CM and get the grievances of the protesting teachers resolved at the earliest. Claiming that their demands will be included in the manifesto is nothing more than asking for votes by showing shallow sympathy,” RJD spokesperson Mrityunjay Tiwari said.

PATNA: Bihar Police will honour former alcoholics, who have successfully kicked the habit, to inspire others and create awareness on the ill-effects of alcohol consumption.

The DGP’s announcement came a day after CM Nitish Kumar asked the state police chief to get the law implemented in letter and spirit. “DGP sahib bhashan to achcha dete hain, lekin sharab bandi ko bhi puri nishtha se lagoo karwaye,” Nitish had said in Patna on Friday.

“Alcoholics, who abandoned consumption of liquor after prohibition came into effect in April 2016, would be felicitated in the presence of their family members,” DGP Gupteshwar Pandey made the announcement at the state police headquarters on the occasion of police week starting Saturday.

In addition, the DGP said around 500 youths belonging to the ‘Mushahar’ community would be appointed as brand ambassadors of the state police and will visit rural areas to create awareness on consequences of liquor consumption. “The youths will take a vow to stay away from alcohol and encourage members of their community to abandon the habit,” Pandey added.

Nitish Friday’s remark came after the DGP’s recent comment in Aurangabad where he blamed the local police of turning a blind eye to illicit liquor sale in the state. “Thanedar ki marji ke bagair ek bottle bhi sharab nahi beek sakti hai,” the 1987-batch IPS officer, who took charge in January last year, had said.

RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav had picked on the DGP’s statement to post a stinging tweet against Nitish. “Instead of giving sermons on alcohol ban, Nitish Kumar must listen to his Police Chief (DGP) who is confessing its total failure. Ever since alcohol ban has been enforced in Bihar, there is a parallel nexus of police, administration & bootleggers at work running this business unabated,” Tejashwi had tweeted on Tuesday.

Earlier, chief secretary Deepak Kumar inaugurated the police week in the presence of additional chief secretary, home, Amir Subhani. A host of senior police officers, including DG (training) Alok Raj, ADG, CID, Vinay Kumar and ADG (law and order) Amit Kumar also attended the function.

The SPs have been told to adopt a village under their jurisdiction and inspire people to educate their children as part of the police week. Other activities like de-addiction among youths and crime control would also be taken up.

There are 20 flight movements from the airport per day

Surat: The long-pending demand of local people for deployment of Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) personnel at Surat airport will be fulfilled soon. Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) has started the process to deploy CISF personnel at the airport.

Sources said final survey of the airport was carried out by senior officials of BCAS and CISF from New Delhi on January 24 and that a report has been submitted to BCAS authorities recommending deployment of the personnel at the earliest.

At present, the airport is connected with Mumbai, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Kolkata, Delhi, Goa and Bhubaneshwar. There are 20 flight movements from the airport per day, carrying over 1.50 lakh passengers per month.

Despite increase in passenger traffic, the airport lacked adequate security arrangements. Against required strength of 114 personnel, only 95 cops from city and State Reserve Police are stationed at the airport.

It was in March 2019 that the BCAS gave an in-principle approval for CISF deployment at Surat airport. The BCAS agreed to take over Surat airport with CISF deployment following increase in passenger traffic at 1.50 lakh per month, strategic location of the airport near Arabian Sea and launch of international flight operations between Sharjah and Surat.

A senior officer on condition of anonymity said, “A high-level meeting with BCAS and AAI officials was held in New Delhi two days ago. BCAS authorities have agreed to deploy CISF personnel at the airport soon.”

Southern Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry president Ketan Desai said, “CISF deployment at the airport is the need of the hour. We have been demanding it since last couple of years. The airport is strategically located close to the Arabian Sea at Dumas and we have an international flight to Sharjah too.”

64,['23/02/2020'],"CBI shuts Namrata Damor death file, but mystery lingers","This story is from February 23, 2020

File picture of Namrata Damor

Bhopal: It’s the most haunting of 40-odd Vyapam deaths. How did medical student Namrata Damor end up dead beside the railway tracks in Ujjain on January 7, 2012, just days after being questioned in the Vyapam scam? CBI officers say solving this mystery has been tougher than chargesheeting the over 3,000 accused. The central agency recently submitted its second closure report on the ‘Death of medical student Namrata Damor’ earlier this year, sticking to its earlier conclusion that it was suicide, but questions linger.

To find the answer, CBI traced 12 players of a Kerala football team, gauged the speed of a train at the site that day, tracked down almost every passenger in a sleeper-class compartment and concluded that she had jumped off a speeding train to kill herself “due to personal issues”. The partially convincing ‘trigger point or motive’ was questioned the first time CBI submitted its closure report in 2017. A special court in Indore refused to accept it as Namrata’s father raised objections to the agency’s findings.

In the second closure report, submitted two weeks ago, CBI has made strong remarks against the panel of Ujjain-based doctors, who conducted the post-mortem on January 7, 2012. According to their autopsy report, Namrata was strangled and there were semen stains on her clothes. The second closure report details CBI’s exhaustive investigation but skips two key questions: why did she suddenly set off for Jabalpur and who was she going to meet.

Namrata’s father Mehtab Singh isn’t convinced. “I have informed the court that I am not satisfied with the CBI probe. Now that they have submitted the same report, I maintain my stand. Why doesn’t CBI understand that if she had to commit suicide, she could have done it in Indore itself. Why would she buy a ticket and board a train to die? Ever heard of someone reserving a ticket to commit suicide? CBI was never serious about her murder. They closed her case as they did in 40 other deaths. I will fight to death,” he told TOI on Saturday.

Excerpts from CBI’s diary, a copy of which is with TOI.

Conflicting Autopsy?

“..Either the autopsy was considered in a casual manner or the autopsy panel doctors had deficiencies in expertise and domain knowledge regarding autopsy,” the CBI report remarks, claiming that the post-mortem was not conducted in a ‘professional manner and it has glaring shortcomings’. Director MLI (Medico-Legal Institute) has listed 32 injuries, which have not been mentioned by the panel of Ujjain-based doctors in their report, claims CBI. “There are other facts that the autopsy panel could not clarify, including fracture of ‘ala of maxilla’, when no such organ exists in the human body,” the closure report says. The then MLI director, Dr D S Badkur, had contradicted the findings of the Ujjain doctors, and filed another report, saying Namrata committed suicide by jumping off a train. On the basis of Badkur’s report, Ujjain police had closed the file on December 14, 2014, ruling it suicide. CBI, which took up investigation following a Supreme Court order, has reached the same conclusion.

Body Blow

“Analysis of train’s timing, position of the body, time of its first observation, presence of pool of blood underneath the face, presence of broken teeth and maxilla (jaw bones), nature of injuries on the body, statement of co-passenger of S-8 coach, coherently and plausibly eliminate the possibilities of the victim being smothered and then thrown out of the running train, or being smothered somewhere else and dumped (also dragged) to the place where the body was found. Thus there is only possibility — that the victim jumped intentionally from the running train and thereby committed suicide,” the CBI report says.

Inside S-8 Coach

During investigation, the TTE who had checked tickets of passengers in S-8 coach, said that he did not hear or see anything untoward in coaches S-7, S-8, S-9. “Further, out of 42 passengers who boarded from Indore and Ujjain, 24 were examined and none of the passengers of S-8 had noticed any untoward incident,” the CBI report says. The passengers questioned include an entire football team from Kerala. Namrata’s gold chain, money and mobile phones were on the body. “No mark of struggle could be found on her body during inquest and post-mortem, which rules out the possibility of smothering in the running train,” it says.

Friends & ‘Others’

From the statement of Namrata’s friends “and others” regarding their conversations with her three days prior to her death, it is evident that she was in a very disturbed state of mind after her father scolded her and her Scooty and mobile phone were taken away, notes CBI. “From these statements, it is also evident that she desperately wanted to avoid being pulled out of her hostel and taken home. On January 7, 2012 the SMS she sent to Vishal Verma and her call to Dev Sishodiya indicated that she was having suicidal intentions. Namrata, after coming to know on the train that Sishodiya had informed her parents that she was travelling by Narmada Express, may have been afraid of being intercepted by her family members and taken home. This may have probably been the trigger, which made Namrata Damor commit suicide,” CBI concludes.

Cell Locations & Train Timing

Analysis of call details of her friends’ mobile numbers shows that none could be connected to the scene of the crime or the victim on the day of the incident. The location of Namrata’s mobile corresponds with the running of Narmada Express on January 7, 2012, from Indore, the agency says.

In conclusion, CBI said it had examined her background and the circumstances preceding her death. “Although the name of Namrata Damor had been included in the list of 90 students of PMT-2010, who had qualified through cheating by means of the ‘engine-bogie’ pairing, it is pertinent to note that this list was prepared by Vyapam in 2014 — two and a half years after her death. Obviously, her death cannot in anyway be connected to her being named in the Vyapam prepared list, CBI says.

Namrata Damor is one of the most mysterious names in the Vyapam probe. A student of MGM Medical College, Indore, the 25-year-old was charged with using unfair means to clear her entrance exam. Within days of her questioning, she was found dead near railway tracks at Kayta village in Ujjain on January 7, 2012, a week after going missing from her hostel. Three years later, a TV reporter had a fatal heart attack while interviewing her father, adding to the mystery. CBI began probing her death in 2015 and ruled it a suicide earlier this month.

Seer Aatmabodhanand being taken to AIIMS, Delhi, on Saturday

Dehradun: A few days after seer Padmavati —who was fasting for a clean and free-flowing Ganga — was shifted to AIIMS Delhi, another Ganga crusader Aatmabodhanand, who has been fasting since the past 24 days for the same cause, was lifted on Saturday by police and taken to AIIMS, Delhi. Both the seers are of the Haridwar-based Matri Sadan ashram.

Aatmabodhanand had quit drinking water on Wednesday (February 19) in protest at the security personnel provided to Matri Sadan head Shivanand Saraswati being withdrawn by Haridwar police.

Apart from his demands to save river Ganga from mining mafia and hydropower plants, Aatmabodhanand was also demanding removal of Haridwar’s senior superintendent of police (SSP).

Ashram sources said that on the demand of ashram seers, an internal inquiry was set up in January this year to find out the need of security for Shivanand Saraswati. They alleged that the inquiry had found that three gunners are needed for the seer’s safety, but even then, his security personnel were removed on February 19.

To discuss the issue, seer Aatmabodhanand had gone to meet the Haridwar SSP and the DM but he couldn’t meet either. Following which, he had announced to quit drinking water.

The ashram’ seers then sent a letter to state chief secretary, home secretary, Haridwar DM and DIG stating that if anything happens to Aatmabodhanand, the state government will be responsible.

Meanwhile, Haridwar SSP Senthil Avoodai K, reacting to the issue, said that “everything was being done following the law.” “We have removed security of many other people at the local level as the duration (15 to 30 days) to give them security had exhausted long back. They have been asked to approach the state government if they have any issues.”

He added that they had to shift Aatmabodhanand to AIIMS-Delhi as the seer was not ready to quit fasting. “The option of AIIMS, Rishikesh, was given to them but they denied taking it. Therefore, we shifted the seer to AIIMS-Delhi,” added Avoodai.

To recall, Saraswati was accorded security in 1999 after he was attacked by members of the mining mafia. Three other seers of the ashram were also severely injured in the attack. The ashram had then raised their voice against illegal mining in and around Jagjitpur area.

For nearly six months in 1999, police force was deployed around the ashram to protect the seers. In 2014, three gunners were added to the head seer’s security by the then SSP and DM after a threat to the seer’s life.

Varanasi: A peon was arrested on Saturday for allegedly passing on information about the movement of magistrates and flying squad to the manager of a school, which was a UP Board exam centre, over phone at Sukhpura Crossing in Ballia. According to reports, the peon was caught red-handed by sector magistrate and tehsildar Gulab Chandra and his team.

The accused Biskut Yadav was working as a peon at Sukhpura Public Higher Secondary School. The manager of the school Ram Kumar Shukla is currently on the run.

“An FIR has been registered against Shukla and Yadav under various sections of UP Public Examinations (prevention of unfair means) Act 1998,” said station officer of Sukhpura police station Virendra Yadav.

Officials said they had received information that question papers of the ongoing UP Board exams were being sent to Shukla’s house for being solved prior to the exams.

They said that Shukla had directed Yadav to stay put at Sukhpura Crossing to report when the magistrates and flying squad left their offices for the school.

“On Saturday, while passing through Sukhpura Crossing we saw Yadav standing at a paan shop and talking to somebody over phone. To mislead him, my team moved in a different direction. A few minutes later, we returned to Sukhpura Crossing and caught Yadav red-handed,” said Chandra.

During interrogation, the accused confessed that Shukla had given him a motorcycle and a mobile phone. “He was asked to be present at Sukhpura Crossing during examination hours and inform Shukla about each and every movement of magistrates, flying squads and police from the location,” said Chandra.

Chandra and his team raided Shukla’s home later on Saturday, but he managed to escape. “We conducted a videography while class X students were submitting the answer sheets,” Chandra said. The students had appeared for an English exam on Saturday.

Later, his team reached Sukhpura police station and lodged an FIR in connection with the case.

On February 20, sub-divisional magistrate of Bansdih and zonal magistrate Dushyant Kumar Maurya in Ballia had busted a mass copying racket at Panchev Devi Rajmuni Devi Inter College in Bigahi Bahuara area of the district. A case was registered against the center in-charge, who had managed to escape.

STF Varanasi arrested a school principal and a computer operator in Jakhania, under Bhudkuda police, in Ghazipur district for allegedly trying to take 21 solved answersheets inside Jagnarain Inter College. The school was a UP Board examination centre. The students were slated to appear for a physics exam on February 20.

Representative image

AHMEDABAD: Jai Bharat Fabrics , a firm operating from a building at Panchvati, had approached a city civil court in 1998, seeking a declaration that there had been no power theft by it and directions to the electricity company to not disconnect supply to the premises.

In a recent order, C S Adhyaru accepted the firm’s demand and declared that Jai Bharat Fabrics had not indulged in power theft. The court also ordered the power company not to disconnect supply to the office, which used to be on the eighth floor of a building in the Panchvati area.

It took 22 years for the court to make this declaration and issue directions as requested. In the meantime, the power company’s name changed from Ahmedabad Electricity Co to Torrent Power Ltd. Jai Bharat Fabrics does not operate from the office anymore either.

In April 1998, power company employees charged the firm with tampering with the electricity meter to slow it down. It was told to furnish Rs 50,000 upfront towards the penalty, if it wanted undisrupted supply. In May, the company recovered Rs 25,000 more, by threatening to disconnect the supply.

In June, the firm approached the court and its proprietor, Ashok Kumar Agrawal, said that the office used to function between 10am and 6pm and remained closed on Sundays. There was no attempt at power theft and the electricity meter was also not tampered with. The Rs 75,000 was paid only because the power company continued to threaten to snap their supply. If the power was disconnected, their business would stop. The payment was made without any fault on the part of the firm.

The case lasted for more than 21 years. When nobody attended court proceedings, the case was dismissed last year, but the firm got it restored for further proceedings. The court finally said that the company’s employee also supported the firm’s claims in their cross-examinations. The power company could not establish what kind of seal was applied to the meter and how it was disturbed. There was no evidence that the meter was defective at all and there was no report made by the power company officials to their own office.

69,['23/02/2020'],'Bharat Mata Ki Jai misused to construct militant idea of India’,"This story is from February 23, 2020

NEW DELHI: Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said on Saturday “nationalism” and the slogan ‘ Bharat Mata Ki Jai ’ are being misused in the present day context to construct a “militant” and “purely emotional idea of India” that excludes millions of its residents and citizens.

Defending the legacy of India’s first PM at the release of an anthology of articles on and by Jawaharlal Nehru — ‘Who is Bharat Mata? On History, Culture and the Idea of India’ by K E Radhakrishna and Purshottam Agarwal— Singh said an understanding of the former PM’s political and intellectual journey is a “pre-condition for India’s survival as a democratic polity as a humane, compassionate society.”

He referred to Nehru as a “great visionary” who shaped India as a modern nation state, an assertion which comes at a time when the ruling BJP has accused Nehru and Congress of partitioning the country on religious grounds and of not giving due credit to his contemporaries like Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel .

Singh was also sharp in his criticism of the allegations levelled at Nehru. “If India is recognised in the comity of nations as a vibrant democracy and, if it is considered as one of the important world powers, it was Pandit Nehru, who should be recognised as its main architect... Nehru laid the foundation of the universities, academies and cultural institutions of modern India. But for Nehru’s leadership, independent India would not have become what it is today,” he said.

He also alleged people insisting on criticising Nehru were driven by personal prejudices. “Unfortunately, a section of people who either do not have the patience to read history or would like to be deliberately guided by their prejudices, try their best to picture Nehru in a false light. But I am sure, history has a capacity to reject fake and false insinuations and put everything in proper perspective,” Singh said.

Emphasising the utility of an anthology of Nehu’s work in the present day, Singh said it will show to the world and to India how Pandit Nehru and his idea of India “built on Gandhian principles, harmonising the past and the present free from communal discords”. This, Singh said, is the only way to promote the inevitable plurality of our country.

“Nehru makes a very significant and time relevant remark on the dangers of leaderships falling into a trap and getting removed far away from the common people whom they are supposed to serve,” Singh said.

The booth that had offices and other rooms attached to it was erected on the national highway after a bridge was constructed on it. The tenure of the toll collection at the booth had come to an end a couple of years ago. The toll booth too came within the limits of the civic body. To streamline flow of traffic towards the Chhayapuri railway station, the toll booth had to be finally razed.

Visakhapatnam: The district education officials has decided to further tighten the jumbling system in the upcoming intermediate theory examinations, which will begin from March 4 at 109 examination centres in Visakhapatnam.

Under the existing jumbling system, students of one college are mandated to take the exams in another institution. But for the first time, even the faculty and the principal of a particular college will be shuffled and allocated duties at another examination centre. Earlier, the faculty used to be at their campuses as invigilators. Moreover, officials at the Board of Intermediate Education (BIE) can directly monitor the live CCTV footage of any examination centre in the district from this year.

Speaking TOI, regional inspection officer of BIE, B Sujatha, said the jumbling of invigilators and principals will help the board conduct the exams in a transparent manner. “We have started mapping the invigilators with a particular examination centre in their respective zones. The students can take advantage of the board’s ‘IPE Center Locator’ mobile application to locate their examination centres easily,” said Sujatha.

The officials have set up 69 exam centres in the urban areas, 40 centres in the rural areas and 10 centres in the tribal pockets of Visakahaptanm district. About 56,369 students (including vocational courses) would appear for the first year examinations, while about 53,929 second-year students would take the test. Exams at the all centres will be conducted under CCTV surveillance.

Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation would ply special buses to the examination centres for the convenience of the students. The Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) would take care of drinking water supply in the city limits.

The BIE had introduced jumbling system for the faculty in practical examinations in 2018-19 academic year after it implemented the same for the students since 2016. Citing undue favouritism and erring institutions, Professor Dayaratnam committee first pitched the jumbling system in practical examinations in 2005 in the then undivided Andhra Pradesh. But it took nearly a decade to be implemented even after conducting a series of feasibility studies.

RAJAHMUNDRY: Waterman of India, Rajendra Singh on Saturday stressed on the need for everybody to join hand to conserve River Godavari. He spoke at the concluding meeting of “Godavari Parirakshana Yatra” at Adikavi Nannaya University near Rajahmundry on Saturday. Godavari Parirakshana Yatra had begun on February 4 at Nasik Triambakeshwar in Maharashtra and concluded on February 21 at Antarvedhi in East Godavari.

Addressing the gathering, Singh said, the problems in Godavari begins at its source — Nashik — where encroachments have come up on either side. Another problem is Maharashtra’s sewage water, which is being let into the river by all municipal corporations and panchayats.

In Telangana, Singh said, River Godavari River has become Godavari canal due to the over-exploitation of all its water for agriculture. Moreover, idols like Ganesh and Durga are immersed in the river. He explained, “From Basara to Khammam, the sewage and industrial pollutants are entering the Godavari waters, there are encroachments on either side of the river.” He said that he witnessed solid waste being dumped at the confluence of Pranahita and Godavari, in Kaleswaram and at Basara.

Singh observed that the state of Godavari in Andhra Pradesh is no better. He said not much water flows from Telangana as the most of the river water is used for irrigation. Only Sabari, Sileru and a few other rivulets in the Papi National Park are feeding the Godavari in AP. He said, “Due to less flow it is the sea that is coming forward to meet the river rather than the river meeting the sea. This can lead to increased salinity level in the delta region”. He maintained that the river water, which is the main source of drinking water in AP, is now polluted and it is on the verge of becoming unfit for drinking.

He added that sand mining was causing irreparable damage to the river bed and in the downstream of Dowleswaram.

76,['23/02/2020'],Deepening ties 10% of Gujarat’s FDI comes from the US,"This story is from February 23, 2020

AHMEDABAD: A couple of months back, the Bank of America became the first foreign bank to start operations in Gujarat International Finance-tec City (GIFT City) on the outskirts of Gandhinagar. The second largest bank in the US opened its global business service centre in the special economic zone (SEZ) of GIFT City.

Considered to be a pet project of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the GIFT City is also a home to US software giant Oracle’s product development centre (PDC). American chip design company Maxim Integrated too is present in GIFT City.

MNCs such as Ford, Colgate Palmolive, Procter and Gamble (P&G), Hindustan Coca-Cola Beverages, Allied Mineral Products and Visteon Corporation have chosen Sanand, near Ahmedabad, for setting up their plants. Healthcare behemoth Abbott Laboratories operates its nutrition products plant at Jhagadia in Bharuch, while Amneal Pharma owns facilities in Ahmedabad and Dahej.

“It goes to the credit of the Gujarat model of economic development that President Donald Trump is visiting Ahmedabad,” industry body Assocham recently said. Gujarat Inc, too, seem to be upbeat as this visit will further help deepen bilateral trade between India and US.

The US president’s India visit is beginning from Ahmedabad. Hence, it has put a spotlight on Gujarat. “US companies accounted for 10% of the total foreign direct investment (FDI) made in Gujarat over the past four years,” said M K Das, principal secretary, industries and mines department, Gujarat government.

The state has seen total FDI inflows worth Rs 72,697 crore (approximately) since fiscal 2016-17, shows data compiled by the department for promotion of industry and internal trade under the Union ministry of commerce and industry.

More than 100 companies from the US are present in the state and they operate in sectors like engineering, chemicals, automobiles and auto components, pharmaceuticals, electronics, textiles, IT and ITes as well as consumer products.

Although Gujarat plays a significant role in India’s bilateral trade with the US, there still a huge scope of investments in the state for US companies, given the fact that Japanese, European and European companies have higher investment exposure in the state, which received a kind of setback when the US auto giant General Motors sold its plant in Halol to China’s SAIC.

Government estimates peg investment by Japanese companies in Gujarat at around Rs 20,000 crore. The state is, however, leaving no stone unturned to attract more investment from the US. Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit (VGGS)’s 9th edition in 2019 saw US-based companies making investment commitments worth Rs 10,000 crore.

“Advanced-level talks are going on between these companies and the state government to materialize these investments,” said a senior official of state government.

“A high-profile visit like that of the US president will put Gujarat on global map and increase its visibility as a potential investment destination. It generates more interest, as people come and see the level of preparedness seen here and in future expands scope for further investment,” Das further explained.

After the visit, the state government is hopeful of attracting further investments in sectors such as hotels, ports, information technology (IT) as well as oil and gas.

“While traditional sectors such as steel and textiles are already big on bilateral trade with Gujarat, there is more scope in other sectors such as garments and made-ups, pharmaceuticals and defence. In fact, the financial and fintech sector has also great potential to attract investments from US, especially with the setting up of Bank of America,” said Chintan Thaker, co-chair, Gujarat Chapter, Assocham.

“Gujarat enjoys a strong recognition in the world pharma market. The US president’s visit will further strengthen India and Gujarat’s image globally. It will help attract investments to Gujarat as the cost of pharma production is half in the state as compared to the US,” said H G Koshia, commissioner, Gujarat Food and Drug Control Administration (FDCA).

Gujarat’s pharma companies like Zydus Cadila, Torrent Pharmaceuticals Ltd, Alembic Pharmaceuticals among others get a significant chunk of their revenues from the US market. The importance of the US pharma market could be gauged from the fact that Gujarat has 130 USFDA approved plants in the state.

Gujarat FDCA and US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) have formed a regulatory forum for sharing of knowledge and information, capacity and building. As many as 100 officials of GujFDCA were trained by USFDA, said sources aware of the development.

IT and IT-Enabled Services (ITES) industry is hopeful of attracting American investments. “The state is emerging as the new gateway for US-based companies to explore the Indian market in the digitisation space. The state has already seen major acquisitions and now, companies are eyeing to set up their captive delivery centres and product support centres in the state,” said Maulik Bhansali, president, Gujarat Electronics and Software Industries Association (GESIA).

“With the state government’s support and push for industry 4.0 for the manufacturing industries in Gujarat, scope for investment from US-based companies in sectors such as engineering services, recruitments, healthcare and fintech has further widened,” Bhansali further added.

Varanasi: Our scriptures should not be viewed as watertight compartments, but should be studied with an open mind for good understanding, said retired judge of Supreme Court, Justice B N Srikrishna in his inaugural address at a workshop on vedic jurisprudence at Banaras Hindu University on Saturday.

Addressing the inaugural function of the two-day workshop on vedic jurisprudence and its impact on contemporary world, organized by Centre for Vedic Science, BHU, Justice Srikrishna said, “Our shastras cannot be viewed as watertight compartments. Each should be studied independently, with an open mind, since this is real ‘vidya’ which is necessary for ‘moksh’. All old need not be good and all modern need not be bad, intellectuals should interpret things as per needs.”

Speaking on the occasion, Prof. Harekrishna Satapathy, vice chancellor of Kalinga Institute of Social Sciences (Deemed University), Odisha, highlighted the importance of dharma in justice delivery system and said that ‘satya’ and ‘vidya’ are also aspects of dharma.

“There are misconceptions that women were treated poorly in old times in India. The women were given utmost respect and honour in vedic period,” Prof Satapathy said while citing several examples from vedas.

He said resolution, perception and expression are prerequisites for right action which brings satisfaction.

BHU rector Prof. V K Shukla shared the glorious history of the university and vision of its founder Pt Madan Mohan Malviya. Earlier, the centre coordinator Upendra Kumar Tripathi welcomed the guests.

Centre for Vedic Sciences, the first of its kind in country, will explore the vedic corpus related to sciences and conduct multidisciplinary research. It was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his visit on February 16. The centre has been established with the financial support from UP government.

Tripathi said the centre will run both long-term and short-term research projects and collect information on vedic scientific knowledge to include in existing science courses being taught in educational institutions.

It will prepare reference documents and books for promotion of logical and scientific achievements of Vedic seers and scholars and formalize scientific study and Vedic intellectual heritage.

The centre has a state-of-art laboratory for research on the effect of Vedic mantras, rituals, yoga and meditation on human mind through neuro-psychological studies.

Vadodara: Two students from the city have bagged All India Ranks (AIRs) in cost and management accounting (CMA) exams conducted by the Institute of Cost Accountants of India (ICAI) which declared results for foundation, intermediate and final examinations held in December last year.

While Ishita Rathod bagged AIR 30 in final, another student Mohammad Adnan Abdul Rehman Khatri bagged AIR 49 in intermediate exams – results for which were declared on Friday.

Ishita, who has done her diploma engineering in electronics and communication from MS University’s Polytechnic College and worked with a GIDC-based firm for the last three years before she plunged into CMA studies.

Varanasi: Minister of state for parliamentary affairs and rural development Anand Swaroop Shukla on Saturday said AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi and his leaders are “cowards and anti-national whose forefathers embraced Islam out of fear and they have no courage to face the strength of Hindutva”

AIMIM leader Waris Pathan has come under heavy criticism for stating that “15 crore (Muslims) will be tough on 100 crore (non-Muslims) in the country”.

Talking to reporters in Ballia, Shukla said, “Main Owaisi aur unke admiyon ko chunauti deta hun ki wo Bharat ko kamjor nahi kar sakte hain. Ye sabhi bujdil aur kayar hain, inke purkhe Hindu the aut talwar ke dar se Musalman bane (I challenge Owaisi and his men that they can’t weaken India.

81,['23/02/2020'],Enough evidence against ex-ministers in ESI scam: SP,"This story is from February 23, 2020

Tirupati: Vigilance and enforcement SP Venkat Reddy on Saturday said there was enough evidence against at least two former ministers in the erstwhile TDP government in the employees’ state insurance corporation ( ESI ) scam , which has raised political heat in the state.

Speaking to reporters, he said the enquiry by the vigilance and enforcement wing has brought to light several large-scale irregularities in the purchase of medicines, biometric machines, tele health services etc by the ESIC. “The scam would be over Rs 400 crore. Most of the purchases were done from 2014 to 2019, when the TDP government was in power in the state. While the total budget allocated for the purchase of drugs and medicines was Rs 293.5 crore, the purchases made were to the tune of Rs 698 crore, an excess of Rs 405 crore, which was a violation of procedural guidelines,” Reddy said.

Of the Rs 405 crore, Rs 51 crore was found to have been paid in excess towards drugs purchased from non-rated contract firms, the SP said, adding that it was another clear violation of the set guidelines. “An excess of Rs 85 crore was paid to various private firms for purchase of laboratory kits and Rs 10.5 crore towards purchase of surgical kits. Furniture worth Rs 6.6 crore was purchased without any tenders and it has been established that nearly 70 per cent in excess was paid towards furniture purchase as well,” Reddy added.

The vigilance and enforcement department, which conducted a three-month long probe into the scam, has recommended criminal proceedings against three directors, former ministers K Atchannaidu and Pithani Satyanarayana and their kin who are allegedly involved in the scam.

Meanwhile, Atchnnaidu condemned the allegations against him, saying the YSRC government is trying to implicate him with false charges. “I dare them to take action against me if my role in the scandal is proved,” Atchnnaidu told reporters.

He said he had merely asked officials to follow the Telangana model in awarding the contracts to avoid duplication and delay. “It doesn’t mean asking the officials to violate the rules. My family has never compromised on values, ethics and principles,” he said, while adding that he has never been involved in corrupt practices during his two-decade long public life.

Former minister and TDP leader Kollu Ravindra said the government is targeting Atchnnaidu as he belongs to the backward community. “The false campaign against Atchnnaidu is an attack on all BC communities,” he alleged.

BJP MP Diya Kumari

JAIPUR: As poaching cases at Ranthambore National Park (RNP) is turning into a political hotbed, BJP MP and member of the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) Diya Kumari on Saturday said the Gandhi family should direct the chief minister in the Congress-led government to take action in this regard. She had previously written to the ministry of environment and forests expressing concern about 26 missing tigers

Congress general secretary Priyanka Vadra’s visited the reserve recently when the poaching issue was at it’s peak. Kumari said, “In Rajasthan, the government is led by the Congress. Since the Gandhi family is head of the party, it should take initiative and direct the chief minister to take necessary measures.”

Replying to the state forest and environment minister Sukhram Bishnoi allegation that majority of tigers went missing during the BJP tenure, the NTCA member said, “The minister should not start a blame game. When our party was in power, we increased the tiger population in Sariska. During Congress tenure, tiger population was wiped out in Sariska. The matter should be investigated fairly.”

Kumari also said she would write a letter to chief minister Ashok Gehlot and put her point strongly in the next (NTCA) meeting.

She also highlighted poor law and order near the reserve as police and forest department officials have been attacked by villagers during arrest operations.

According to reports, 26 tigers have been reported missing from the (RNP) over a decade. A senior forest department official said, “These big cats have disappeared between 2012 and 2018. We are examining the cases one by one. They are called missing, as their bodies were not recovered.”

The forest administration at RNP has numbered 116 tigers till date. It is claimed, since 2011, nine male tigers and 16 females tigers went missing from the park.

The local body aborted the over Rs 15 crore plan following objections from some opposition councillors.

KOCHI: With incidence of fire at Kochi corporation’s solid waste treatment plant at Brahmapuram becoming an annual ritual, authorities are trying to push through an allegedly dubious project for biomining legacy waste at the plant premises. The local body aborted the over Rs 15 crore plan following objections from some opposition councillors.

Authorities presented the proposal at a meeting of the council held in the first week of February. It included vital details, including cost of the project. “As per the agenda, the biomining proposal was introduced as per instructions of National Green Tribunal (NGT). The cost was pegged at Rs 597 per tonne. But, they tactically omitted the quantity of legacy waste and the total cost of the project. The files revealed that there was around 2,63,158 tonnes of waste. This would translate to a total cost of Rs 15,71,05,326,” said C K Peter, an opposition councillor.

“The mayor and secretary presented the proposal, seeking approval for a project that would cost an enormous Rs 15 crore, without approval of the finance and health standing committees. Moreover, they tried to get the agenda passed by omitting key details, like cost,” Peter said.

As per files pertaining to the proposal, civic body authorities first mooted a plan for scientific capping of the legacy waste. Though a tender was floated on February 20, 2019, the proposal had to be scrapped with the NGT insisting on biomining. Following this, a biomining tender was floated on August 14, 2019. After it received no bidder interest, the local body retendered the project, which saw the participation of only one company. Though the qualification originally fixed for bidders was five years’ experience in operation and maintenance of solid waste treatment plants and biomining, it was later whittled down to three years. Another qualification originally set for bidders was Rs 5 crore turnover, which was toned down to Rs 3 crore. As per the corporation ’s files, Neptune Automobiles of Erode , the sole bidder, has a turnover of Rs 3.32 crore and three years’ experience in operation and maintenance of solid waste treatment plants as a sub-contractor with Dharmapuri and Kulithalai municipalities.

Peter demanded a vigilance probe into how the proposal was presented before the council without the approval or knowledge of the finance and health standing committees and also without key details.

“We later accessed the files and found the embarrassing facts regarding the project,” Peter said. Councillors belonging to the ruling front have also raised apprehensions regarding the project. A B Sabu, Congress councillor and former chairman of welfare standing committee, also demanded a probe into the issue. Mayor Soumini Jain said that her version on the issue would be presented at a special council meeting to be convened soon.

Kochi: Kochi corporation has decided to convene a special meeting to discuss issues regarding the back-to-back incidents of fire outbreak at solid waste treatment plant premises at Brahmapuram. Mayor Soumini Jain said that the tentative schedule of the meeting would be on Friday.

Many of the councillors, including opposition leader K J Antony, raised the issue of frequent fire outbreaks at Brahmapuram. CPM councillor P S Prakash, who started the discussions at the council meeting on Saturday, demanded that the local body should recommend a vigilance probe into the incident. He asked Jain, who had earlier said that there might be chance of sabotage behind the incident, to give proof to substantiate her arguments. BJP councillor Sudha Dileep Kumar also demanded a vigilance probe.

The issue of health standing committee chairperson Prathibha Ansari facing difficulties due to lack of official car caused ruckus in the council. Councillors cutting across party lines said she should be given an official vehicle soon. It had been more than a month since the officials took away her car and gave it to the district administration pulse polio immunisation programme held in January. When it was returned to the corporation a couple of days later, it was found that the car developed technical snags. The car was shifted to the garage. “She couldn’t go to Brahmapuram when the fire broke out as no vehicle was available. “If Jain fails to make arrangement for providing a car to the standing committee chairperson, we won’t allow the mayor to use her official car,” opposition leader K J Antony said.

CHENNAI: After enduring poor admissions over the last few years, 11 engineering colleges in the state have applied to Anna University to close down from the 2020-21 academic year, while seven others have sought to stop new admissions.The total number of engineering colleges under Anna University including stand-alone institutions offering architecture, MBA and MCA courses is now down to 537 from 557 in 2019-20. The fate of two colleges is not known as they are yet to communicate their decision to the authorities.College principals in the city said more than 60 institutions with less than 10% new admissions were also in danger of closure. “A college without at leat 50% admissions cannot break even. Those with fewer admissions cannot hire good faculty and provide facilities like labs. The trend of colleges closing down will continue for at least the next two years,” said one.Last year, after the end of engineering counselling, more than 80 colleges had recorded less than 10% admissions. Several others decided to trim intake in core courses like civil, mechanical and electrical engineering. “They surrendered around 8,000 seats in these branches including 1,400 in civil engineering,” said an official. Many also sought permission to start new courses in artificial intelligence and data science with an intake of around 6,000 seats.Career consultant Jayaprakash Gandhi said admission in civil, mechanical and electrical engineering streams was poor last year. “While reducing the intake in these courses, colleges also will reduce faculty strength in these streams.” Production engineering and automobile engineering are also likely to be closed in a few colleges following industry automation and lack of jobs.Anna University vice-chancellor M K Surappa said reducing intake in core courses is not a happy situation. “We need engineers to build smart cities and smart homes. The curriculum needs to be redesigned to train non-computer science graduates in areas such as artificial intelligence and robotics.” Specialised courses like BTech (artificial intelligence) should be offered only after ascertaining the demand and future workforce details, he added.All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) has allowed universities to offer courses in areas such as cyber security, data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence. With around 50% of seats vacant, the council said it would not accept applications for setting up new colleges for next two years.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74263912,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-147227,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/11-engg-colleges-seek-to-shut-down-over-poor-admissions/articleshow/74261689.cms

Picture used for representational purpose only

CHENNAI: Higher secondary students studying in Velammal Global School in Puzhal may have to write the AS level, which is the Cambridge equivalent to Class XI examination, as private candidates in another school because Cambridge Assessment International Education has suspended the school’s affiliation.

Parents were shocked after they received an e-mail informing them that their children will be enrolled as private candidates to write the finals scheduled in four months. An e-mail received from the school examination coordinator read that students will be registered for IGCSE/A/AS level examination for the academic year 2020 with a private school as a private candidate, though the mark sheet will be supported by the school bonafide certificate.

“Private students will be considered secondary in any Indian university, particularly for admission into professional courses,” said Charles Mohan, parent of a Class XI student from the school. He said his daughter, like others, attended regular classes as a regular student for eight months, “And four months before the public exam they do this. This will affect their future.”

Kannabiran Muthukumarasami, another parent, complained that school authorities refused to meet them to explain the situation. He then wrote to the south India manager of Cambridge Assessment International Education and received an email from them saying ‘Velammal Global School is under temporary suspension’ and due to this, they cannot make exam entries for IGCSE/AS/A levels until they fulfill requirements. The mail also read that students who give these exams as private candidates are not given 10 +2 equivalence by the Association of Indian Universities.

To meet requirements of the Cambridge board, schools must have proper libraries, science labs for higher secondary classes and qualified teachers.

“But they had no labs and teachers were very few,” said Sheila Charles Mohan, former child welfare committee member and a parent. “For a week, my daughter had no classes because there was no teacher,” she said.

The school started around six years ago and has a total strength of more than 500. Nearly 100 are studying in Classes X and XI, which is the first batch to appear for the AS level. While most higher secondary students have obtained transfer certificates and applied in other schools, a few are still hoping the school will re-obtain affiliation.

“But we just received a mail from the management asking us to get the TC. The school charges an annual fee of Rs 2 lakh, and now have to pay more to another school,” said Kannabiran. “I only fear that my daughter doesn’t lose one year, we hope she gets admission,” he said.

M V M Velmurugan, the school’s chief educational officer, did not respond despite several attempts. However, the spokesperson of Velammal group denied the allegation and called it ‘fake news’.

Varanasi: A three-day Uttar Pradesh Agricultural Science Congress on ‘enhancing farmers income and water conservation: opportunities and challenges’ began at Banaras Hindu University (BHU) on Saturday.

Being attended by 400 agricultural scientists and students, the event is organized under the joint auspices of the Institute of Agricultural Sciences and UP Agricultural Research Council.

Addressing the inaugural function, state agriculture minister Surya Pratap Shahi spoke about different government-run schemes for farmers. He said that a remarkable growth was seen in the production of wheat, rice and oil seeds in the state. He said the government is giving 50% grant on the purchase of agricultural equipment and providing required funds to agricultural universities working in the field of animal husbandry.

Agricultural scientist Dr Mangala Rai said although scientists and farmers greatly contributed to make the country self-dependent in foodgrain production but only 0.53% of GDP is spent on agriculture education, which is more than 0.8% after Independence.

He suggested for an overall change in agricultural policy and a special emphasis on natural resources.

Scholar Syed Parnerkar addresses the gathering at Surve Nagar, on Wednesday

Nagpur: Sluggish and passive society does not augur well for a country. Therefore, it is high time people play a pro-active role to build an ideal society by bridging the gap, said scholar Syed Parnerkar at a programme organized at Survey Nagar to mark the birth anniversary of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj on Wednesday.

The programme, titled ‘Chhatrapati Shivrai and Indian Constitution’, was jointly organized by Maratha Seva Sangh (MSS), Jijau Brigade, Sambhaji Brigade, Baanai, Jamaat-e-Islami Hind and Sarv Shakheey Krushnavi Sanghatana.

Parnerkar said if some people feel oppressed, then they should give expression to their thought as the Constitution of India has guaranteed freedom of speech. The definition of maintaining beliefs, religious rights, thoughts and expression has been clearly outlined. Despite this, there are many social ills in the society which need to be addressed, he said.

Writer and thinker Ganesh Halkare said the problem of unemployment is rising with every passing day. Similar is the case of agrarian crisis as farmers are at the receiving end due to vagaries of nature and subsequent crop failure.

Shivaji Maharaj always took care of all sections of the society and ensured that justice was done to them. Shivaji Maharaj established ‘surajya’ and treated all the citizens as equals. He was the king who never tolerated injustice and punished the guilty, he said.

This is the time, he said, the rulers strictly follow the high standards Shivaji Maharaj set for good governance. Instead of making tall promises, the politicians today should emulate Shivaji Maharaj and make people happy by taking initiatives to ensure their welfare, he added.

Professor Sadanand Chowdhary of Chitrakala Mahavidyalaya and MLA Vikas Thakre were honoured on the occasion.

Dilip Khodke, district president of MSS, made the introductory remarks while Seema Talatule conducted the programme. Anita Thangre proposed a vote of thanks.

Allahabad: A man and a woman were found dead locked inside a room at the latter’s home in Saiyed Sarawan village, under Charwa police station, in Kaushambi on Saturday morning. Police said the deceased youth was the woman’s cousin. While the man was found hanging from the ceiling fan, the woman was found dead lying in a pool of blood.

The deceased have been identified as Jyoti (20) and Chhotu (23), residents of Saiyad Sarawan (Kaushambi) and Fatehpur respectively. IG (Allahabad range) KP Singh said, “Circumstantial evidence shows that the youth might have slit the woman’s throat and later hanged himself to death. We are yet to find out what might have led to the deaths.” “The bodies have been sent for postmortem examination and police are waiting for the report,” the IG added.

Police said Jyoti’s father Chatradhari had gone to attend a wedding i in a nearby village Manjhanpur on Friday night, leaving his daughter alone at the house. His wife had died a few years ago. Jyoti was to get married in March second week at a nearby village. On Saturday morning, Jyoti’s uncle Pyare Chand, who lived adjacent to the house, knocked on the main door of her house.

Bengaluru: A 16-year-old girl, who gave birth to a child while she was mopping the floor at her employers’ house in Bengaluru, has told investigators she was gang-raped in Odisha in early 2019. The child birth happened in November 2019.

The pregnant girl, who was squatting while mopping the floor, was suddenly found in a pool of blood. She had a spontaneous delivery. The girl and her baby were then rushed to a government hospital, where they were stabilised and details of the alleged rape were revealed. The case was brought before the district Child Welfare Committee (CWC) and a police case was registered under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act.

The girl, an illiterate, told police she was gang-raped in Odisha in early 2019 and that she arrived in Bengaluru in August 2019. She lived with her cousins, who also worked as domestic helps, in an apartment complex in south Bengaluru.

CWC sent the girl and her child to an NGO and established contact with her parents in Odisha. She was reunited with her parents and she took away the newborn with her in January 2020. Committee members said the survivor not showing any pregnancy symptoms and having a spontaneous delivery was shocking.

Anjali Ramanna, chairperson, CWC, told STOI the girl was stabilised along with the newborn at an NGO for over two-and-a-half months. “Her parents arrived from Odisha and were keen on taking their daughter and granddaughter home. The girl refused to give away her child for adoption and wanted to take care of her. Odisha police have registered a Pocso case and investigation is on,” Anjali said.

The case was also brought to the notice of the labour department. The Bengaluru couple who had employed the teenager are also facing the music for hiring a minor, which is a violation as per Child and Adolescent Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, the CWC chairperson said.

Pregnancy unnoticed?

Officials who handled the case said the girl’s employers had noticed she’d gained weight, but she apparently told them she’d started eating well after working in Bengaluru. “She claimed she hardly had access to three square meals when she was in Odisha. No one knew about her pregnancy till she delivered,” an official said.

According to Dr Sripada Vinekar, a city-based gynaecologist, either the girl was hiding her pregnancy or she may have been ignorant of it. “For many girls, soon after puberty, the menstrual cycle is not regular. The girl hid details about the rape. She was either ignorant about being pregnant or didn’t reveal that too. She must have experienced pain while delivering the baby,” said Dr Vinekar.

KOCHI: Mayor Soumini Jain asked corporation officials to take immediate steps to float special purpose vehicle (SPV) to operate Ro-Ro vessels . She also requested finance standing committee of the corporation to take urgent measures to sign an agreement between the local body and Kerala Shipping and Inland Navigation Corporation ( KSINC ) for operating the Ro-Ro vessels.

Many of the councillors, who spoke at the meeting of the corporation council held on Saturday, brought the issue of accident in which one of the Ro-Ro vessels hit a tourist boat to the notice of the council. They also hinted at the risk in operating the vessels without an agreement with KSINC, the operator. In the absence of an agreement, insurance company will not provide insurance in case of an accident. Now, the vessels are being operated on the basis of a memorandum of understanding between the navigation agency and the local body.

Deputy mayor K R Premakumar said the functioning of the corporation is affected due to the absence of a ‘full-time secretary’. The current corporation secretary also holds the charge of regional joint labour commissioner. She is not unable to attend the council meetings and even the development seminar of the corporation. We can’t proceed in this manner,” Premakumar said. Regarding the accident in which one of the Ro-Ro vessels hit a tourist boat on Friday, mayor said the KSINC has given explanation that it was the speeding tourist boat that caused accident.

K Pandiarajan

CHENNAI: Minister for Tamil official language and Tamil culture K Pandiarajan on Friday said very soon it will be made mandatory for all businesses to name their shops and establishments in Tamil. He added that the fine for not following rules as per the Tamil Nadu Shops and Establishment Rules, 1948, will be increased in the coming days. As the AIADMK government enters its last year of its tenure, it is likely to use Tamil language to woo more people towards it.

According to section 15 (1),(2) and (3) of the Tamil Nadu Shops and Establishment Rules, 1948, the name board of every establishment should be in Tamil and wherever other languages are also used, the version in English shall be in the second place, followed by the versions in other languages, if any.

“It is mandatory for the all shops and establishments to be named in Tamil, as well as ensure that 50% of wordings in name display boards are in Tamil and that in other languages, including English, are kept below 50%. This is as per the Tamil Nadu Shops and Establishments Rules,” said Pandiarajan. The minister also said as per the rules, those who fail to names their businesses in Tamil or follow the display board rule can be fined.

“As of now, the fine is only Rs 50 but we have approached chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami to increase the fine so that shops that do not follow the rules will comply,” said the minister.

DMK government at the end of its tenure in 2010 and 2011 tried to implement the rules strictly and made it mandatory for all shops and establishments in Chennai and nearby areas to ensure businesses were named in Tamil. So, bakeries were called adumanai and hardware shops were called vanporul.

Vijayawada: The long-pending issue of electricity employees’ redistribution is likely to be resolved as Justice Dharmadhikari Committee will meet on Sunday in New Delhi. Andhra Pradesh power utilities raised some objections to the recommendations made by a one-man committee earlier which suggested it take 613 employees who opted for AP and 42 others who did not give any option.

The dispute between AP and Telangana power utilities started in 2014 after 1,157 employees were relieved by Telangana state, based on their nativity. The AP power utilities raised objections terming the decision by Telangana power utilities as unilateral as the allocable cadre strength of Andhra Pradesh power utilities was only 6,102 and they had already hired staff according to the population ratio even though the consumption of power is higher by 12 per cent in Telangana.

Subsequently, the issue went to court and the Justice Dharmadhikari committee was appointed to make a decision about the 1,157 employees. After several rounds of deliberations, the committee called for fresh options from the employees. Out of the total 1,157 employees, 613 opted for Andhra Pradesh and 42 did not give any options. The committee finally recommended that these 655 employees have to be absorbed by the AP power utilities.

However, the AP power utilities moved SC contending the recommendations as unjust. They sought relief to set aside the committee’s recommendations and requested for directions to affect the final modalities and take up allocation of allocable 6,102 employees as on date of bifurcation. They have also sought to the effect that Telangana utilities shall continue to bear the expenditure related to employee benefits of 655 employees who have been relieved by Telangana utilities till the final allocation is made.

CHENNAI: In a major haul, a special team of the Narcotics Intelligence Bureau CID, has seized at Kolathur 50 MDMA tablets, 300 LSD stamps (blots), 20g of methamphetamine and 2.5kg of ganja, and arrested three men for smuggling them. The team also seized two bikes.

A court later sent Kolathur residents V Vasanth, 20, and R Nishanth Rayan, 23, and R Balachandhar, 22, of Korattur to jail.

The three men, who were the main source of the narcotics to college students and others in Maduravoyal and Kattankolathur, had been delivering them near colleges posing as students and receiving funds online.

Following complaints, Narcotics Intelligence Bureau (NIB) CID superintendent of police C Kalaichelvan ordered his officers to nab the peddlers.

A police team led by inspector Selvin Santhakumar monitored drug users in colleges at Maduravoyal and Kattankolathur and through a couple of student decoys placed orders for the drugs.

The team members followed the decoys to a hideout at Kolathur and nabbed Vasanth, Nishanth Rayan, and Balachandhar. The first named is a science graduate, while the others studied at a polytechnic, an officer said. The three were once drug users and turned peddlers after completing their studies.

During interrogation, the arrested men told police that they placed orders through online and sourced drug consignments from Goa and Puducherry by courier after giving fake addresses.

An LSD stamp, used as a party drug, when placed on the tongue gives an euphoric high to the user. The accused had created a dedicated clientèle, selling them for Rs 2,000 a piece.

Depending on the demand, it could go up to Rs 5,000 a stamp, an officer said. They are usually smuggled in through courier, after being declared as books, and it is difficult to scan all book parcels arriving from abroad as well as from other parts of the country, he added.

Allahabad: Paryavaran Sena, a non-profit organisation dedicated to environment protection, has begun compiling data of more than 100 heritage trees that it has identified for preservation.

All the heritage trees identified are banyan and peepal trees, and are more than 100 years old. These trees have been identified in several villages including Kushfara, Saray Gobind Rai, Antpur, Tarapur, Khjohari and Bojhi.

Assisted by the forest department, the volunteers have roped in students and teachers from primary and senior secondary schools, particularly in rural pockets, to preserve the heritage trees.

The exercise to identify ancient trees and plant more banyan and peepal trees was launched in the first week of this month.

Ajay Krantikari, head of Prayavaran Sena, told TOI, “We have been actively interacting with people of all ages, particularly schoolchildren. In our sessions, we brief people about the factors responsible for ecological damage over the past several years and the dire need to preserve trees.

He further added, “With the active participation of local residents, we have managed to collect data of more than 100 old banyan and peepal trees.” A senior official of forest department said, “The department is maintaining a database of heritage trees, planted more than 100 years ago. Efforts are on to encourage plantation of more such trees in villages, blocks and cities.”

KOCHI: More than 30 minors were rescued and sent home along with their elders in a major operation at Aluva Manappuram , which hosted Shivaratri festivities. One child was sent to a shelter home as he didn’t have any relatives to go with.

A host of agencies, led by the district legal services authority (Delsa), special juvenile police unit (SJPU), anti-human trafficking club (ATHC) and Childline Kochi , conducted simultaneous checks at Manappuram, where several thousands of people have been visiting for the past two days. Children aged between 1 and 16 were seen being used for selling items and begging.

Officials said many appeared to be part of a gang looking to take advantage of crowds landing here as part of the festivities. “We have been noting an increase in the number of children being used for begging. Hence it was decided that all the agencies will work together to rescue them. It was seen that the moment any of the volunteers or teams identified a child and started seeking details, elders would approach us and claim the child. Most were migrants or gypsies travelling in groups,” said P S Mohammed Ashraf, SI, special juvenile police unit who coordinated the rescue.

He said that all the children along with their elders were sent back to their respective states with the help of the railway protection force, which arranged their free journey back home. They were from Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra , Bihar etc. “An old woman accompanied by her pregnant daughter and grand-daughter came from Andhra Pradesh. When we asked them to go back, they were reluctant. Then we told them of the strict laws here and that the police would take strict action against them and advised them that it was better to go home. They boarded the train back home,” Ashraf said.

The team from Childline Kochi said they had been receiving calls from the public alerting them to instances of child mendicants. “We received more than 50 calls in the last three months alone. When we or the police reach the place, they would have vanished or the child would be whisked away from the scene by elders. It was then decided that Delsa would take care of legal formalities so that a joint operation can be conducted as we knew that at such melas or fairs will attract such gangs,” a Childline official said.

The district child protection unit (DCPU), under the women and child department, came under criticism as it was expected to lead the operation under the ‘Sharanabalyam’ project. “However, they never took part. They just stuck some stickers and put up a banner and left the place claiming that it was just an awareness programme. The project is also funded by the Union ministry of women and child development. Yet, when the children were rescued, all of us spent money from our own pockets to buy them food. It left many of the volunteers and officials disappointed that DCPU didn’t join or lead the rescue,” said a volunteer who was part of the raids.

A police official said initially the number of injured persons were high, but they then succumbed. “As per information with us, there are only two injured persons and they are undergoing treatment at SSG Hospital,” said sub-inspector T B Pandya of Vadu police station. The injured persons are Javed Solanki (12) of Vadu village and Rizwan Malek (20) of Ranu village.

Police said the driver of the dumping truck fled leaving the vehicle behind after the accident. Police are trying to find about details of the owner of the vehicle to track the driver.

Locals said the menace of dumping trucks is increasing day-by-day. “Truck drivers ply their vehicles at high speed without taking into consideration the size of roads and vehicles coming from the other end. We have approached local police and administration several times to take act against such vehicles but our requests only fall on deaf ears,” a resident of Ranu village said.

Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) had not introduced more buses for the festival that draws lakhs... Read More

COIMBATORE: While all roads smoothly led to Isha Yoga Center on Friday night for the Maha Shivaratri celebrations, the ride back home on Saturday morning was a nightmare for the large crowd that had gathered there. Made to wait for hours for a vehicle, most of them were forced to travel on government bus rooftops and footboards. Some even clung onto the bus windowpanes to reach their destinations. And none of these travelling modes are acceptable by the law.

The private bus operators, meanwhile, made some quick bucks by overcharging the passengers.

While the Isha Yoga Centre had arranged hundreds of buses from other districts to bring devotees, Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) had not introduced more buses for the festival that draws lakhs of people to the centre.

As a result, devotees who managed to reach the centre comfortably by 2pm and 3pm on Friday after taking buses from Gandhipuram found themselves in a fix when they wanted to return to the city in the early hours of Saturday.

T Kaviyan, who attended the event, said, “Many people waited for hours to catch the first TNSTC bus to the city and in their desperation, they travelled on footboards and rooftops. People who took private buses had to shell out Rs 200 to Rs 250 for a ticket to the city.”

TNSTC buses to the city and towns such as Mettupalayam and Tirupur had passengers travelling on footboards, rooftops and by clinging onto the windowpanes, all of which are banned by law. The public who saw such scenes were shocked at the danger the passengers were exposed to.

TNSTC officials were, however, not available for a comment, despite several attempts to reach them.

S Jayaraman, organizing secretary, Citizens Voice Club, said, “There are overhead electric cables. What if one of the cables or transformers touches the passengers? Who will take responsibility? Both Isha Yoga Centre and the state transport corporation know that lakhs of people would travel to the centre for the event and that at least a quarter would travel by bus. It was their responsibility to ensure availability of buses.”

Justice T Raja

CHENNAI: Noting that river Godavari has been emptying more than 3,000tmc of water into the sea , Justice T Raja, judge , the Madras high court, said young professionals should work to achieve inter-linking of rivers so water could be put to optimum use.

Addressing students of MEASI Institute of Management and MEASI Institute of Information Technology at their 13th Graduation Day celebrations in New College premises on Saturday, Justice Raja said a graduate degree alone is not enough for students, and that they should be focused and humble. While students of other professional courses like law and engineering pursue their own professions, management students manage and handle issues from all other professions, he said.

Narrating a tale, Justice Raja said time is more precious than one’s life as it could never be retrieved if a moment is lost, whereas life would anyway come to an end at some point. He recalled his association with the former President A P J Abdul Kalam and said how he told Justice Raja that he turned a vegetarian under strange circumstances. Kalam’s father admitted him in the vegetarian-only hostel of a Trichy college because a non-vegetarian hostel would have cost Rs 30 more a month. Kalam came to know that his father took the decision as the rest of the family was managing its expenses within that Rs 30 every month. Justice Raja said this to drive home the point that students must learn to live simple, and aim high.

Coimbatore: Public Works Department (PWD) officials on Saturday said the restoration work of the Noyyal river would start by March-end or April first week. While the state government has already allotted Rs 230 crore for the project, the PWD has completed the tender procedure. It is likely to announce the contractor details soon.

The Noyyal originates in the Western Ghats in the district and flows through Tirupur, Erode and Karur districts, before confluencing with the Cauvery in Karur. A seasonal river, it usually swells during the northeast and southwest monsoons.

The Noyyal river basin is 158.35km long and there are 18 anaicuts, most of which are in a dilapidated condition. It covers 25 tanks in Coimbatore and six in Tirupur. While the city corporation maintains nine tanks, the remaining tanks are the responsibility of PWD.

PWD officials have already prepared a detailed proposal to strengthen the bund of 22 tanks and surplus weir, and repair sluice gates and supply channel. They would also desilt 18 anaicuts and restore them, besides constructing retaining walls and clearing vegetation from the bunds and river.

The officials had sent the proposal to the state government, which announced Rs 230 crore for the project in the budget session on February 14, 2020. According to the officials, open tenders were invited last month to implement the project. “Many companies have participated in the tender. We will finalize the tender soon and start the restoration work by March-end or the first week of April,” an official said.

MUMBAI: Fugitive gangster Ravi Pujari , who had jumped bail and gone missing after being arrested in Senegal in January last year, was arrested again from South Africa early on Saturday, sources said.

The arrest was made from a distant village in South Africa by the Senegal authorities in a joint operation with India’s Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) and Mangaluru police, sources in the know said.

News of the fresh arrest has apparently been kept under wraps as the Indian government wants to get him back without undergoing the formalities they had to go through last year.

Sources said senior officials from the Union home ministry and foreign affairs ministry had been coordinating with Senegal authorities in order to get Pujari deported at the earliest instead of pushing for an extradition, which would be a time-consuming process.

One of the things that might complicate things if an extradition is sought is that Pujari has been living under the assumed name of Anthony Fernandes and has claimed to be a Burkina Faso citizen. An offence registered against him abroad would also be a hindrance in that case, and it is suspected that he had got a cheating case registered against himself last year to avoid deportation as usually a criminal is tried for an offence committed in the country where he is held before being sent back.

Indian authorities are hoping deportation would be an easier option, sources said. The sources added that if all goes well, Pujari would be brought to India on Sunday or by Monday morning, though it is not clear if he will be taken to Mumbai, Mangaluru or Delhi.

Pujari, who started off in the 1990s as a Chhota Rajan aide, has more than 200 offences of murder and extortion against him. Last year, he was held in the cheating case by Senegal authorities. He then managed to procure bail on certain conditions and went missing. TOI had reported in its June 9, 2019 edition that he had jumped bail and may have fled Senegal.

Sources said ever since he had gone missing, he had taken shelter in a tribal village in Kenya . However, Indian intelligence agencies managed to track him down.

Pujari has an Interpol red corner notice issued against him and among the cases registered against him in India are those for issuing threats to Bollywood stars and a prominent industrialist.

Pujari, who claimed to be “the Hindu don”, had been abroad for 20 years, and India had initiated measures to obtain his custody. Though he had earlier been arrested in South Africa, Australia and Singapore as well, he had walked free as Indian authorities could not secure his extradition.

Premila Baria (21) from Bor village of Panchmahal district

VADODARA: When this young tribal woman from a poor family in Panchmahal district participated in tournaments as a child, her aim was to hit the bull’s eye with a shot at the Olympics. She has been picked up for the trials for the same. But in the meantime, she will get an opportunity to prove her mettle at Archery World Cup round to be held in Guatemala in April.

Premila Baria (21) from the nondescript Bor village of Ghoghamba taluka in Panchmahal district has been a promising talent in archery since she started winning in Khel Mahakumbh in the state and at national level. At the international level, she won an individual silver medal and a team bronze at Seoul International Youth Archery Festa, 2016. She was also picked up for Asia Cup in Bangkok last year.

Baria is training hard at a camp organized in Pune for the Olympics. She will be travelling to Guatemala from there for the world cup. She has done well in the trials so far and hopes to do well in the remaining to make it to the Olympic squad too.

Baria, who competes in the recurve, said she had never hoped that she would reach so far. “I had started learning archery in the ‘ashram shala’ where I studied. At that time, I had no dreams. It was only after I was picked up for coaching at the centre at Nadiad, that I started hoping of participating in the Olympics someday,” she said. The Guatemala round of the world cup will be held from April 20 to 26. Those who qualify here will play the finals in Shanghai.

Senior coach of the district coaching centre at Godhra, Pratap Pasaya, said Baria had to struggle against all odds to reach this level. “We have even visited her home. They have a small land to till that does not have irrigation facilities. The land too is not very fertile. With some more support, she can be a medal winner,” he said.

AHMEDABAD: India’s top bourses NSE and BSE have shown keen interest in setting up international bullion exchanges in the International Financial Services Center (IFSC) at Gujarat International Finance-tec City (GIFT City) on the outskirts of Gandhinagar .

“Both the exchanges are keen to establish their bullion exchanges in GIFT IFSC. They, however, are waiting for regulatory framework to be put in place before they begin work for launching their bullion bourses,” said a source privy to the development, while others confirmed it.

BSE’s subsidiary India INX and NSE’s subsidiary NSE IFSC Ltd already operate their global exchanges in the IFSC, which offer trading in equities, currencies and commodities derivatives as well as debt securities.

“India INX has expressed keen interest to set up an international bullion exchange in the GIFT IFSC. Once the regulatory process for the same is announced, India INX will immediately initiate steps to start the International bullion exchange,” said a BSE spokesperson.

The Union Budget presented this month announced setting up international bullion exchanges in GIFT IFSC as an additional option for trade by global market participants. “This will enable India to enhance its position worldwide, create jobs in India and will lead to better price discovery of gold,” the Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said in her Budget speech.

GIFT IFSC already has an approved free trade zone for housing vaults. It already has 19 insurance entities, 40 banking entities. It has also provided for setting up of precious metals testing laboratories and refining facilities.

“The establishment of spot bullion exchange in GIFT IFSC will bring uniformity in price and quality of precious metals in India. In absence of gold spot exchanges in the country, different prices are currently quoted in different regions,” said people in the know.

“This will also attract other global exchanges like London Metal Exchange to GIFT city as tie-ups with these international players could be formed when the domestic players go for setting up a bullion exchange in the IFSC,” said a source privy to the development.

Annual gold consumption in India is around 800-900 tonnes. A large quantity of this yellow metal is imported through Ahmedabad. The city’s bullion trade will also benefit from these exchanges, said sources.

Irregularities have been reported in purchase of drugs and kits worth Rs 975 crore in ESIC between 2014-19.

Activists of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) staged a protest at ESI main office at Vijayawada on Saturday. “It is a shame that officials of ESI and state ministers looted the money of workers. Reference letters of the then ministers exposed their links with the medical agencies,” said CPM state secretariat member Ch Babu Rao.

Babu Rao said, the money of ESIC is deposited by the poor and marginal workers and officials were misusing them, adding that the ESI hospital in Gunadala is in poor condition and promises on transforming it into a superspecialty hospital has remained on the papers, Babu Rao alleged.

Vigilance officials should take up a fair and transparent investigation into the issue and file cases against the officials and politicians who are involved in the case, Rao demanded.

Meanwhile, Telugu Desam Party MLC Buddha Venkanna condemned the allegations against former ministers K Atchannaidu and Pithani Satyanarayana. “ YSRC is making baseless allegations against our ministers.

VAD ODARA: Adnan Shaikh’s brilliant knock of 90 in just 74 balls and Daksh Patel’s 6 wicket haul helped Shreyas School to defeat Tree House in the semis at the Alembic cricket ground on Saturday.

After winning the toss, Tree House chose to field first. With 92/5 on board in 20 overs, in walked batsman Adnan Shaikh who changed the script of the game. Dropping Adnan on 47 proved costly for the Tree House boys, as he troubled the bowlers and scored 90 in 74 balls. His two successive partnerships of 125 runs with tailenders at eighth and ninth wickets proved to be beneficial for the team.

Spinner Tanvir was the pick of the bowlers, as he broke both the stands in the 40th and 48th over. The team was all out with 256 runs on board. The Tree House boys started the chase with an opening partnership of 45 in 10 overs before the spinner Rajveer Jadhav broke the partnership. The middle order of Tree House collapsed like pack of cards when spinner Daksh Patel ran through the line-up, claiming 6 wickets in his 6 overs. Opening batsmen Priyank Ray was the only ray of hope for the Tree House, but his efforts of 60 runs in 76 balls went in vain when he was sent back to pavilion in the 20th over. The team was bundled out at 110 in 30 overs, handing Shreyas School an easy win.

In the other semi-finals, BHS (ONGC) registered victory over Bright Day School by 6 wickets at the PTC grounds. BHS(ONGC) won the toss and its spin bowler Krish Prajapati ran through batting line up of Bright Day by claiming 8 wickets. They were all down for 110 in 47.4 overs. The BHS boys chased down the total comfortably within 32 overs, with six wickets in hand. Harsh Dave scored 31 of 26 balls to all but end the hopes of Bright Day. Krish Prajapati was declared the man of the match for his 8 wicket haul.

Shreyas School and BHS (ONGC) will clash for the elite trophy in the finals of the Maharani Shantadevi U-19 Inter School Tournament 2019-20 at the Alembic grounds on Tuesday.

Civil engineers are trying to innovate civil construction techniques while executing Metro project

Kanpur: Uttar Pradesh Metro Rail Corporation (UPMRC) has innovated a new construction technique to expedite the ongoing construction work of Kanpur Metro and also to ensure the safety of the staff working at the site and the common people.

A UPMRC official on Saturday said that since the beginning, its civil engineers, on the basis of the experience they had gained from the Lucknow Metro Project, were trying to innovate civil construction techniques while executing the Kanpur Metro Project.

He said previously the concourse slab of the elevated station--a portion just above the road--was constructed on sacrificial shutter made of galvanized iron sheet. The sacrificial shutters were laid over the erected precast beams.

""The concourse slab of the station will now be constructed with the new innovative technology. The slab, along with the beam, will be prepared in advance at the casting yard and placed at the designated location. With the help of this technique, the work will gain momentum and at the same time, safety-related apprehensions will be reduced. Not only this, but the outer beauty of the stations will also be enhanced"", the official added.

According to a source in Metro Rail Corporation, the civil construction work of the Kanpur Metro project is progressing at full speed from the beginning. As a result of the state-of-the-art technology, UPMRC is fully confident that the construction work of the Priority Corridor between IIT-Kanpur and Motijheel would be completed within the stipulated time frame.

In about three months' time, since the work started on Kanpur Metro at the IIT-Kanpur gate, over 500 piles and 35 piers or pillars have been prepared under the project. Concurrently, the casting of the U-girder is also continuing in the casting yard.

The unit employs local tribal people and provides products made by them an access to the market across India

SURAT: At a time when slowdown has cast its shadow across businesses, bamboo crafts and furniture business of tribal artisans in Surat is brimming with orders. So much is the demand of their products that they are compelled to say no to fresh orders so that they can finish the pending work.

The Visdalia Cluster Gramin Vikas Samiti, an initiative of the Surat division of the state forest department, operates a unit to make furniture and artifacts from bamboo in Visdalia near Surat. The unit employs local tribal people and provides products made by them an access to the market across India.

In fact, the bamboo outlets and the cafeteria at the Ekta Nursery near Statue of Unity (SoU) are made by these tribal artisans. The ‘Rural Mall’ operated by Visdalia Cluster Gramin Vikas Samiti on Surat-Bardoli Road has become an epicentre of designed bamboo furniture and craft products. It is attracting a lot of upmarket consumers from different parts of the country.

""It has been a year and a half since the initiative was launched. So far, 119 tribal families have become a part of this incredible journey, which covers seven different business verticals such as restaurant, bamboo furniture, crafts and housing, eco-friendly paper crafts, natural pulses, locally grown spices, mushroom cultivation and millet-based bakery products,"" said Punit Nayyar, deputy conservator of forests, Surat division.

""The unit engaged in making bamboo furniture and artifacts has received overwhelming response from the customers. Such is the response that we are unable to meet demand. Hence, we are opening a new bamboo unit in Umarpada to meet the galloping demand,"" Nayyar added.

The spurt in business could be seen from the fact that the turnover of the bamboo unit was Rs 11 lakh two years back and now it is expected to cross Rs 1 crore by the end of this fiscal.

""This unit run by tribals is receiving orders from Delhi, Mumbai, Gandhinagar and Ahmedabad among other cities. We first trained our tribal artisans and then brought in interior designers and marketing professionals to support them. Now our plan is to enlarge community-owned production hubs on the basis of sustainable business model,"" Nayyar emphasized.

""The idea was to provide regular employment to local tribals, who otherwise have to migrate to earn livelihood and give alternative source of income to landless tribals and decrease their dependence on forests. This will help conserve our natural resources as well and locals get good income as they are now skilled persons,"" Nayyar said.

""The vision of this unit was to revive and retain the local culture, create employment locally, promote sustainable practices in the day-to-day life and make the villages self-reliant and self-sufficient, through sustainable rural enterprises.

""The bamboo unit being the heart of the ‘Visdalia Rural Mall’ has extended its product range from furniture and crafts to bamboo houses and interior designs. Major revenue collected for the bamboo unit is from these two segments. We are getting orders to set up furniture in living rooms, restaurants, eco-tourism centres, hospitals, and farmhouses,"" said Vinit Prabhakar, head, Visdalia Cluster.

""The bamboo unit provides employment to over 70 tribal families and their dependent members who are around 400. Many of these tribals were getting just Rs 120 per day two years ago. Now, after getting skilled, they are earning on an average Rs 300 per day and that too at their native places,"" said Prabhakar.

KRISHNAGIRI: Slain forest brigand Veerappan’s daughter Vidhya Rani, who is an advocate, joined the BJP along with thousand others in the presence of the party national general secretary Muralidhar Rao at a function held in the town on Saturday. Former Union minister Pon Radhakrishnan was also present at the event.

Vidhya Rani, who received the party identity card from Rao, said she would work for the needy and downtrodden. “My father’s ways might have been wrong, but he always lived for the poor.”

Addressing the gathering, Rao, who is also incharge of TN BJP, vowed to quit politics if DMK chief M K Stalin were to prove that the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) was against Indian Muslims.

He said Stalin can’t continue his cheap politics by spreading false information in the state. “Where was he (Stalin) when thousands of Tamils were killed in Sri Lanka? It is a joke that he is now talking about citizenship to Sri Lanka Tamils.”

Pointing out that the number of mosques and Muslims has increased over the years in the country since 1947, Rao said Hindu population in Pakistan had reduced to just 2% from 24% after independence. “Hindus in Pakistan are in deep trouble and India is ready to welcome them if they return.”

122,['23/02/2020'],Bamboo crafts of Surat tribals boom amid gloom,"This story is from February 23, 2020

The unit employs local tribal people and provides products made by them an access to the market across India

SURAT: At a time when slowdown has cast its shadow across businesses, bamboo crafts and furniture business of tribal artisans in Surat is brimming with orders. So much is the demand of their products that they are compelled to say no to fresh orders so that they can finish the pending work.

The Visdalia Cluster Gramin Vikas Samiti, an initiative of the Surat division of the state forest department, operates a unit to make furniture and artifacts from bamboo in Visdalia near Surat. The unit employs local tribal people and provides products made by them an access to the market across India.

In fact, the bamboo outlets and the cafeteria at the Ekta Nursery near Statue of Unity (SoU) are made by these tribal artisans. The ‘Rural Mall’ operated by Visdalia Cluster Gramin Vikas Samiti on Surat-Bardoli Road has become an epicentre of designed bamboo furniture and craft products. It is attracting a lot of upmarket consumers from different parts of the country.

""It has been a year and a half since the initiative was launched. So far, 119 tribal families have become a part of this incredible journey, which covers seven different business verticals such as restaurant, bamboo furniture, crafts and housing, eco-friendly paper crafts, natural pulses, locally grown spices, mushroom cultivation and millet-based bakery products,"" said Punit Nayyar, deputy conservator of forests, Surat division.

""The unit engaged in making bamboo furniture and artifacts has received overwhelming response from the customers. Such is the response that we are unable to meet demand. Hence, we are opening a new bamboo unit in Umarpada to meet the galloping demand,"" Nayyar added.

The spurt in business could be seen from the fact that the turnover of the bamboo unit was Rs 11 lakh two years back and now it is expected to cross Rs 1 crore by the end of this fiscal.

""This unit run by tribals is receiving orders from Delhi, Mumbai, Gandhinagar and Ahmedabad among other cities. We first trained our tribal artisans and then brought in interior designers and marketing professionals to support them. Now our plan is to enlarge community-owned production hubs on the basis of sustainable business model,"" Nayyar emphasized.

""The idea was to provide regular employment to local tribals, who otherwise have to migrate to earn livelihood and give alternative source of income to landless tribals and decrease their dependence on forests. This will help conserve our natural resources as well and locals get good income as they are now skilled persons,"" Nayyar said.

""The vision of this unit was to revive and retain the local culture, create employment locally, promote sustainable practices in the day-to-day life and make the villages self-reliant and self-sufficient, through sustainable rural enterprises.

""The bamboo unit being the heart of the ‘Visdalia Rural Mall’ has extended its product range from furniture and crafts to bamboo houses and interior designs. Major revenue collected for the bamboo unit is from these two segments. We are getting orders to set up furniture in living rooms, restaurants, eco-tourism centres, hospitals, and farmhouses,"" said Vinit Prabhakar, head, Visdalia Cluster.

""The bamboo unit provides employment to over 70 tribal families and their dependent members who are around 400. Many of these tribals were getting just Rs 120 per day two years ago. Now, after getting skilled, they are earning on an average Rs 300 per day and that too at their native places,"" said Prabhakar.

PILIBHIT: Days after ‘naming a retired high court judge’ in an FIR related to anti-CAA protests, the district administration and police officials met the former judicial officer at his residence on Friday evening to reassure him that it was only his namesake who was mentioned as an accused.

City magistrate Arun Kumar Singh and Pilibhit (city) circle officer Praveen Malik informed Mushaffey Ahmad, a retired judge of the Allahabad high court, that his name was not included in the case registered in connection with the assault and unlawful detention of a constable during the anti-CAA protest on February 13.

Speaking with TOI, both Kumar and Singh confirmed that the meeting was arranged to convey to the ex-judge that his name does not figure anywhere in the FIR. They added that the details of the namesake would be clear only during the investigation.

Meanwhile, district judge Mahtab Ahmad has ordered a judicial inquiry into the matter, under CJM Chir Kumaritwa, based on the directions of the Allahabad HC chief justice.

Launching a scathing attack on the police officers, the retired judge said that he would not believe them until they produce the namesake before him. He added that the guilty police officers should be brought to book.

COIMBATORE: A 20-year-old man was sentenced to life imprisonment on Friday for murdering an 80-year-old woman in Annur last year.

Police had arrested S Kannan, a native of Erichanatham in Virudhunagar district , for killing T Lakshmi of Senthampalayam near Annur. “Kannan was working in a private firm at Ponnegoundenpudur near Annur. He was returning to the workplace from his hometown on February 2, 2019 around 3am when he saw the elderly woman sleeping in front of her house. He barged into her house and tried to open a steel bureau to steal gold ornaments. When the woman woke up and raised an alarm, Kannan hit her with a spanner,” a police officer said.

Lakshmi’s grandson K Srueshkumar and other relatives, who were sleeping in the adjacent houses, rushed to the place and tried to catch Kannan. “He also attacked Srueshkumar. But the relatives managed to catch him and thrashed him before handing him over to the Annur police,” the officer added.

Lakshmi and Srueshkumar were rushed to the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (CMCH). But the elderly woman died without responding to the treatment.

The Annur police registered a case against Kannan and lodged him in the Coimbatore Central Prison .

Judge M Gunasekaran of the first additional district judge (I ADJ) court on Friday sentenced Kannan to life imprisonment for murder and 10-year imprisonment each under Section 391 and 394 of the Indian Penal Code. The court also slapped a fine of Rs 3,000 on him. The punishments shall run concurrently.

PILIBHIT: A video showing stray dogs relaxing on hospital beds, purportedly made at Pilibhit ’s Puranpur community health centre’s emergency ward, has sent the health authorities into a tizzy.The video, that has gone viral on social media, not only shows how acute the problem of stray dogs is but also negligence on the part of the medical and civic authorities in dealing with the menace. After the chief medical officer ordered an inquiry, the health department has also directed the Puranpur municipal council to catch the strays at the earliest and shift them elsewhere.What is worrying is the threat the strays pose to patients, their attendants and staff. All are at a risk of being bitten and picking up some zoonotic infection or breaking into an allergic reaction. The danger is manifold if the dog happens to be rabid.Dr Shailendra Gangwar, a private surgeon, said, “A street dog in a hospital bed can be the source of severe parasitic infestation in addition to serious allergic and skin related problems, more so if the bed sheets of the hospital beds where the dogs have rested are not changed immediately.”In fact, the entire ward needs to be sanitized as a preventive measure.Expressing concern over the situation, chief medical officer Seema Agarwal said she had asked additional CMO, Dr VB Ram, to probe the matter and file his report within four days, following which the responsibility of the medical staff at Puranpur CHC would be decided.“In view of the seriousness of the matter, I have directed the medical officer in-charge at the CHC, Dr Chhatrapal, to immediately get all the hospital doors equipped with door closures and to station canine catchers at both entry points of the CHC,” said Agarwal. These measures, she hoped, would keep stray dogs away from the hospital campus in future.On being asked about the lapse on the part of hospital staff in failing to prevent strays from entering the hospital, Dr Chhatrapal claimed that the video that was being circulated on social media was an old one. At the same time, he cited acute staff shortage at the 30-bed CHC. He said, “The 30-bed hospital has two MBBS doctors, including himself, and two contractual AYUSH doctors. We have only one ward boy and no sweeper at present.”As far as the nursing staff is concerned, he said six nurses were posted at the CHC with two each on eight-hour shift. He admitted that lack of class IV staff was posing a great problem in maintaining sanitation and hygiene at the CHC.In Video: Viral video: Street dog relaxes on hospital bed, CMO orders probe",bareilly,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74265542,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-386637,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/street-dogs-on-govt-hospital-beds-cmo-orders-probe/articleshow/74261170.cms

BAREILLY: In order to give a spick-and-span look to all government schools running in rural areas as well as Anganwadi Kendras and Panchayat Bhawans, Union minister Santosh Gangwar launched ‘Operation Kayakalp’, brainchild of the local DM here at collectorate premises on Saturday. According to district administration sources, a budget of Rs 121 crore has been allocated for the facelift of government schools, Anganwadis and Panchayat Bhawans for their optimum utilization.

“We have decided to change the infrastructure of each and every government school running in rural areas. So far, as many as 246 schools have been given a new look which has made the students and teachers quite happy,” DM said.

Under the scheme, Panchayat Bhawans, which will provide range services to villagers, will also be set up.

Around 2,281 rooms in 388 schools have tiled floor while boundary walls of 305 schools have been constructed over the past 50 days.

In the first phase, 248 Panchayat Bhawans will be revamped. Around 166 Anganwadi centres have also been identified in the district for facelift.

While addressing the gathering, Union minister said, “Being people’s representatives, it is our duty to ensure these schools function well since DM has done his bit by providing a pleasant atmosphere to study in.”

Six MLAs including Dr Arun Kumar, Kesar Singh, DC Verma, Shyam Bihari Lal and Chhatrapal Gangwar and Bahoran Lal Maurya and Zila Panchayat chairman Sanjay Singh attended the function.

COIMBATORE: Communist Party of India (Marxist) central committee member P Sampath and chief coordinator of Naam Tamizhar Katchi Seeman on Saturday addressed the people, who have gathered at masjid ground on Aathupalam Junction in the city, to protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, national registry of citizens (NRC) and the national people’s register (NPR).

It would be wrong to call the countrywide protest ‘Muslim protests’, Sampath said. “The Muslim brethren have been spearheading the protest to safeguard the sovereignty of the country, the Constitution and secularism. The ruling BJP is not concerned about this and is working against the Constitution,” he said.

There are 18 crore Muslims in India and they had fought for the country’s freedom, the CPM leader said. “They are Tipu Sultan’s heirs.”

“While 13 states have passed resolutions against CAA, the Edappadi K Palaniswami-led government in Tamil Nadu has been insisting that the Act would not affect Muslims. It is not Palaniswami’s voice, but the voice of the Sangh Parivar and RSS,” Sampath added.

Seeman, who spoke at the venue later in the day, said the BJP government is distracting people from issues such as privatization of Air India and the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC). “The Act is not only against Muslims, but against all Indians,” he said.

JAISALMER: To attract domestic and foreign tourists to Jaisalmer during summers, the district administration is planning a scheme - ‘Jaisal Mera For 99 Days’.

The aim of the scheme is to promote night tourism from March 20 to June 30, when summers are at peak in the region.

District collector Namit Mehta said the administration, along with hoteliers, will make all possible efforts to lure tourists to Jaisalmer during summers.

Leading hoteliers were called in a meeting on Saturday in which themes were discussed to attract tourists to Jaisalmer during peak summers by organising night cricket matches, horse riding, night camel safari, night food plaza etc. The tourist season in Jaisalmer is from August to March when around 8-10 lakh tourists visit the district, while in summers there is total silence.

Hotelier Manvendra Singh said, who was present at the meeting, said efforts would be made to increase the activities. There will also be participation of city residents during these activities. The idea is that tourists will remain in the hotels the entire day and take part in activities during night.

Singh said when Kerala can sell monsoon, why can’t Jaisalmer sell its summer . He said tourists have to be told that nights are cooler in Jaisalmer during summer.

Hotelier Vimal Gopa said many monuments will be illuminated till late night. Also, spots will be identified to open food plazas which will offer Rajasthani, Indian and continental cuisine.

LAKHIMPUR KHERI: Kheri SSP Poonam has transferred SHO Dharmadas Siddharth of Hyderabad police station and two constables Anoop and Deepak to reserve police lines a day after the death of a 20-year-old man, under mysterious circumstances, in Lakhimpur Kheri. Vivek Verma was found hanging from a tree outside the police station on Friday morning. Autopsy report on Saturday has stated that he died due to hanging.

Since Friday morning, Vivek’s family members had been alleging that he died due to police negligence as he was in police custody since February 17, and demanded action against the guilty cops. Kheri SSP Poonam had dismissed their allegations. Probe has been ordered after cops earlier claimed that it was a case of suicide.

Vivek was allegedly detained by police after he was named in a non-cognizable report (NCR) registered by one Anjali’s husband, Mukesh. The 27-year-old woman apparently went missing around 10 days ago and later Vivek brought her to Hyderabad police station where the police detained him on February 17. Anjali was sent to her parents while Vivek was kept in custody. According to sources, there was an extra-marital affair between the two for past few months. Police had charged Anjali and her husband under IPC section 306 (abetment of suicide) and sent them to jail on Saturday.

Earlier on Saturday, police had turned Udaipur village into a fortress with nearly 400 policemen deployed in the area, mainly to ensure no political leader “vitiate the atmosphere”. Gram Panchayat elections are round the corner.

Vivek’s elder brother Sandeep told TOI, “SP and DM met us last night and told us that they will be taking action against the guilty police officials. We have been promised compensation of around Rs 5.30 lakh by district administration. I am not sure whether my brother died inside police station or outside but he was in police custody and his safety was the responsibility of police.”

Kheri ASP Shailandar Lal told TOI, “We ensured that peace was maintained in the village. We had information that some people may try to disrupt peace to reap political benefits. The action against policemen is taken by SSP, but we cannot say that it was a custodial death. Mitauli circle officer Sheetanshu Singh will now probe the matter further.”

BAREILLY: The electricity department is awaiting the decision of the Army to the request to shift 132 kv high tension cables over defence land near 883 Horse Battalion and also increase the height of the towers in order to clear the way for laying the slabs of the under-construction flyover at Satellite Bus Stand. A letter to the effect has been sent to the chief executive officer (CEO), Anupam Talwar , of Bareilly Cantonment Board (BCB) and, she, in turn, has written to the Army authorities.

On their part, Army officers said any decision in the matter is yet to be taken as raising the height of the cables could hinder aircraft from taking off and landing as the Army airbase is adjacent to the 883 Battalion.

At Satellite Bus Stand, the construction of a flyover bridge is underway. Its pillars have been erected. But before placing the slabs, it is necessary to remove the high tension line just above the flyover.

In this regard, executive engineer of the electricity department Anil Kumar Gupta has written a letter to BCB CEO Talwar and administrative commandant of station headquarters cell of Uttar Bharat Area, saying that for the construction of a flyover bridge at Satellite tri-junction, the height of the high tension line would have to be raised. A tower erected on defence land covering an area of around 75 square metres connects Dohana and Faridpur feeders with city power house.

CEO Talwar said the land in question where high tension tower is erected does not come under BCB’s jurisdiction as it is an Army land that is looked after by the defence estate officer. “We have informed the station headquarters cell about the matter and they will dispose of it,” said BCB engineer RK Maheshwari.

Armed force authorities said, “We have asked for a report from the airbase which is located close to 883 Battalion from where helicopters take off every day. Raising the height of the high tension line may create an obstacle for aircraft. So ,we are examining the matter and a final decision will be taken after the report comes from our airbase.”

133,['23/02/2020'],Police hunt down Salem stoneman,"This story is from February 23, 2020

Salem: A 20-year-old man has been arrested for bludgeoning three beggars and a security guard to death with stones to steal money to buy ganja. Three of the four crimes were reported in the city in the first week of this month, while the stoneman had his first victim in Velankanni in Nagapattinam district in December 2019.

City police commissioner T Senthil Kumar identified the accused as M Andisamy, of Sitheriyur village in Dindigul district. A school topper in Class X board exam in 2014, the officer said, Andisamy became addicted to ganja after he couldn’t pursue higher studies owing to the poor financial background of his family. “He had secured 428 marks out of 500 in Class X.”

The officer said Andisamy’s father Markandan and mother Nagammal had been living separately for the past few years after the former married another woman.

“After schooling, Andisamy took up some odd jobs in the village and started to use ganja at workplaces. He used to attack his mother for money. At one stage, he left home,” the officer said.

According to the city police commissioner, Andisamy’s first victim was an alms seeker in Velankanni whom he bludgeoned to death with a stone in December 2019 for money. “Fearing arrest, he then came to the city. He went on a murder spree in the first week of this month as he ran short of money to buy ganja.”

In Salem, his first victim was a 45-year-old alms seeker, who was found dead near the collectorate bus stop on February 1. The very next day, he took the life of another beggar, who was 60 years old, at Tiruvakkgoundanur area near Suramangalam in the city. On February 3, Andisamy claimed his third victim, this time an 85-year-old night security guard, near the old bus stand in the city.

The serial killings unsettled the city police, who noticed a similarity in all the three murders – the victims were bludgeoned to death with stones.

The city police commissioner subsequently formed 16 special teams under the supervision of deputy commissioner (crime and traffic) S Senthil to nab the accused at the earliest.

The teams collected CCTV footages from the crime spots and zeroed in on the suspect, who appeared to be in his early 20s.

Meanwhile, one of the special teams nabbed Andisamy on Tuesday (February 18). “While he confessed to have murdered all the three for money to buy ganja, we didn’t arrest him as there were some inconsistencies in his statement. We wanted to match his image with the CCTV footages. We sent them to the forensic labs Chennai and Bengaluru and they confirmed that the image captured in the CCTV cameras at the crime spots were that of Andisamy. We subsequently arrested him on Friday night,” the city police commissioner said.

On Saturday morning, Andisamy was produced before the judicial magistrate of Salem district court who remanded him in judicial custody. Later, he was lodged in the Salem Central Prison.

134,['23/02/2020'],Defence procurement process holds opportunities for MSMEs,"This story is from February 23, 2020

Coimbatore: In the last three to four years, defence procurement process has been made easy and accessible for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME), Lieutenant General S K Upadhya, master general of ordnance of the Indian Army, said here on Saturday.

Transparency and accessibility have been introduced in the procurement process, Upadhya, who was in the city to take part in an interactive session with members of industrial associations, said. “Previously, the trend was that when we faced a problem which we could not solve, but we knew solutions were available in the market, we were bogged down by various procedures. Ultimately, the problem used to fester and remain,” he said.

But now, defence procurement has become proactive. “In the last three to four years, things have moved hugely. Now, we are proactive. Now, if we face a problem, we must find a solution and for that, look at who can do it. If there is someone who can do it, then I must enable him to do it for me,” the general said.

While earlier industrialists who wanted to supply to the sector did not know whom to contact, now a website has the contact details of point persons, Upadhya said. “To handhold startups that have ideas and want to cater to the sector, there is the Innovations for Defence Excellence (iDex) scheme of the Defence Innovation Organisation. If startups that come up with bright ideas don’t have a corpus, we have the iDex scheme to fund them.”

Since defence procurement will not be bulk or frequent, MSMEs can also seek to export their products, the officer said. “Previously, we couldn’t export defence goods. Now, the Centre has set a target for the ordnance factory board for exports.”

Defence procurement officials interacted with industrialists and took note of their issues at the session, organised by the Coimbatore District Small Industries Association (Codissia) and the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).

Experts admitted that lack of air-spray facilities allowed locusts to spread to a wider area

JODHPUR: Government will now prepare strategy according to the social study of the impact of locust mayhem, behaviour changes of locusts and weather conditions, which led to the disaster. Based on the observations following the field visits and discussions with the farmers in locust-affected areas, a Central team said this during the review meeting with the administration.

Headed by Atish Chandra, joint secretary (agriculture and farmers’ welfare), the team warned against over-reporting of the assessment of the damage caused by locusts, in order to draft an actual and correct strategy.

It may be noted that the team, in its two-day field visit of the locust-affected areas in Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Barmer, Sriganganagar etc, also emphasized the need of making the farmers and the local community the first responders. “These are the farmers and the local community who are the first responders in the face of any calamity like a locust attack. There was a pressing need for public awareness and intensive training programmes for them,” said Chandra.

He, however, expressed satisfaction over the planning and efforts adopted in dealing with the locust attack in the region, in coordination among the state government and the district administrations.

“Communication plan for disaster management had been finalized in May last year with the arrival of the locusts. Locust control was quite successful from May to November,” said Chandra adding that understanding the change in pattern of weather and locust behaviour, locust menace was controlled on ground level by making the best use of available resources.

Directions were given in the meeting to always keep the physical resources ready and to be apprised of the pesticide mapping with a view to provide quick response in case of a similar threat. “Based on the pesticide mapping, we have come to the conclusion that 1,000 hectare area could be covered with one sprayer machine, we need 10 sprayer machines for every prospective area in future,” he said.

The experts admitted that lack of air-spray facilities allowed locusts to spread to a wider area. Highlighting the importance of aerial spray mechanism of the pesticides, the team underlined the importance of advanced drone technology. Experts said that based on the recommendation of the team, now the government can consider employing helicopters and drone technology.

NEW DELHI: Having earlier told the interlocutors appointed by the Supreme Court that it was police, and not them, who had blocked one carriageway at Shaheen Bagh , anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protesters on Saturday told senior lawyer Sadhana Ramachandran , one of the mediators, that the apex court should ensure their safety in case that carriageway was opened to traffic. This was among some demands that the protesters made in their interaction with the mediator on Saturday.When Ramachandran visited the agitation site, where mostly women protesters have occupied the road and closed it to traffic for the past 69 days, she assured the women that the dialogue was not to have to the sit-in dispersed, but to resolve the issue of the blockaded GD Birla Road .The protesters declared to the interlocutor that if the carriageway opposite to the stretch occupied by them was reopened for traffic, they would need a Supreme Court order on their security. They said aluminium sheets should then be placed between that section of the road and the protest site to provide safety to the demonstrators. The carriageway in question carries traffic from Noida to Delhi.The second demand of the protesters was the revocation of the cases registered against anti-CAA agitationists at both at Jamia Millia Islamia and Shaheen Bagh. The protesters also asked for an inquiry into the incidents that have taken place in the last two months during the protests at these sites.The protesters, however, were firm that they wouldn’t move away from the present sit-in spot.On Friday evening, the mediators — Ramachandran and lawyer Sanjay Hegde — had taken note of the road from Noida opening briefly in the morning, and suggested to the protesters that the route could be opened to traffic. The duo said that the Supreme Court had to informed that the road and opened and shut again and whoever had done it was answerable to the court.At one point, the two lawyers told the crowd, “Who has occupied the other carriageway? We need clarity from you.” The unanimous response was that it was the cops who had barricaded that carriageway. Ramachandran probed further and when she asked, “Are you saying that you are sitting here and the other side has been shut by Delhi Police and you are okay with it as you feel you feel safe that way?”, a protester responded, “Delhi Police has closed the other side of the road.”Hegde wanted to know if anyone from the police was at the site. The SHO of Shaheen Bagh police station stepped forward and assured that police were willing to provide the protesters adequate security if they cooperated. He disclosed that this request had been made earlier too. “Hamari taraf se jo security hai woh poori denge (We will provide adequate security),” he asserted.In one voice, the crowd had asked police to give in writing that they would keep their promise, and in case of an untoward incident, everyone from the police commissioner to the beat constable would face the consequences. But many still expressed distrust of the police force. “Delhi Police beat up Jamia students and one of them lost an eye.

The Abbakka Queen cruise boat at Old Port in Mangaluru

Mangaluru: Abbakka Queen Cruise (AQC), which can accommodate 250 people at a time, is the biggest among three such cruises operating in Mangaluru. The cruise was started a month ago by Sweekrath B P, Laxman Kunder and Charan. According to the trio, they started this unique venture only to give a fillip to cruise tourism, which has not seen any development over the year, even though there is demand and a conducive atmosphere.

The two other cruises are both named Cruise and Dine , each of which accommodates about 100 guests. All three cruises operate from Old Port in Mangaluru.

“Most of the time, to get an experience of cruise dining, Mangalureans have to travel to Kerala, Goa or other places. We failed to cash in on similar opportunities available in this region. So we came together and started this venture,” says Sweekrath, adding that cruise dining is an altogether different experience for guests.

Laxman explained that the cruise boats sail on the Nethravathi River, which is close to the Arabian Sea, every Saturday and Sunday, and also on other days, depending on the bookings. It specially serves authentic coastal delicacies, especially fish items, on board.

“On Saturdays and Sundays, we sail on the Nethravati River, which starts at 8pm, and return to shore around 11pm. We also sail on other days, in the day or night, depending on bookings. One can celebrate any event on the cruise like birthdays, bachelor parties, company events, group outings and family get-togethers,” says Laxman.

One of the cruises, which was called as floating restaurant, capsized during the monsoon, a few years ago. The cruise dining concept commenced in 2011, and was operating without any competitor till 2019. The Captain Cook, which could accommodate 40 guests, was started a few years ago, but was discontinued.

Laxman said that so far the demand is good, and the cruise boats get packed on weekends.

Swarna Sunder, a hotelier, reacting to the increasing number of cruise boats with dining facilities, said that he has been pushing for the same to boost tourism in coastal Karnataka from the past two decades.

“As a member of the Dakshina Kannada Hotels and Restaurants’ Association and Tourism Advice Committee, I had always suggested for such inclusion to bolster tourism. However, it was never considered. Suggestions were restricted to meetings only, and never materialised. Currently they are getting wings and it’s a good sign,” he said.

Friday night rain has exposed the shoddy work done by the authorities

BAREILLY: The condition of roads in Bareilly has become bad after recent rainfall which has worsened the already damaged roads in several city areas. The slightly damaged roads are now marred by bigger potholes while the stretch connecting prominent junctions has become dangerous. Accumulation of rainwater on roads and movement of heavy vehicles at night deteriorated the condition of roads further.

Several shopkeepers and locals in Choupla-Biharipur area alleged that the roads in the area were already damaged but heavy rainfall on Friday night further deteriorated the state of roads. Resident of Civil Lines Sumit said, “The road connecting Choupla with Biharipur and Civil Lines had many potholes but condition of that road has now worsened.”

Among the severely damaged roads is the Choupla-City Station-Quila flyover Delhi road where potholes have become deeper due to vehicular movement. Resident of Quila Chawni Mohammed Asid said, “Commuting on the road has become dangerous now as the potholes on the road near City Station have become deeper due to movement of heavy vehicles.”

He added, “The road connecting Mini Bypass to Izzatnagar and Pilibhit Bypass is also in a similar condition.”

Resident of Quila AN Khan said, “The recent heavy rainfall in the city has exposed the shoddy work done by the authorities to fill the potholes on Quila flyover, service road and the Choupla stretch. Now, fillings in the old potholes have been washed away making them wider. New ones have also developed making it risky for the commuters.”

Several other roads including inner city areas of Civil Lines, Biharipur, Vikas Bhavan road and the outer areas such as Hartmann flyover, Bisalpur road and Pilibhit Bypass road are also lying dilapidated.

Bareilly municipal commissioner Abhishek Anand said, “The repair work of city roads has to be jointly taken up by Public Works Department (PWD), Municipal Corporation, zila panchayat and various other departments. Currently, flyover construction is in process at three prominent city areas due to which repairing of roads will be tough as traffic movement would be restricted at these places. The damaged roads will be mended by the departments concerned.”

UDUPI: Tourism minister C T Ravi on Saturday said that he has not announced the opening of casinos in Karnataka . However, he said casinos are common in foreign countries.

“People from Karnataka spend money in casinos in Goa and foreign countries, generating good income for them,” he said, adding that casinos play a big role in developing tourism.

“But I have no plans to open casinos in Karnataka. As Indians splurge money at casinos in Goa and Sri Lanka, India is losing out on foreign exchange revenue. If there is any option to stop this, I will extend all help. We need to create jobs here,” he added.

“Though I had mentioned that village tourism and heritage tourism, media highlighted only the casino aspect of tourism. There are no plans to set up a casino or a pub. Our department has not taken any decision in this regard. It needs permission from the home ministry too,” he explained.

The minister said he has no information about the staff of Koti Chennaiah Park in Karkala not being paid salary.

“The local administration is supposed to manage it. If it has not, I will look into the issue,” he said. Speaking on the sedition issue, Ravi said a particular section of people raise ‘Pakisthan Zindabad’ slogans, and they are encouraged by a some vested interests. “Who are they? Living here, they hail another country. It’s a serious issue, and the authorities will take strict action against them,” he said.

They realized that the house had been burgled when they returned from Gurvayur around 10.30pm. “The family said that locks to the main gate and front door were intact and they came to know about the theft only after entering the house,” said a police officer.

According to police, the back door of the house was forced open by the burglars, seemingly with an iron rod, to enter the house. The house was found completely ransacked when the owners returned. “Clothes were seen lying around and two wardrobes in the house had been broke open. Gold ornaments in both the wardrobes went missing. It is estimated to weigh around 40 sovereigns,” said a police officer.

A police team, including rural SP K Karthick and Angamaly CI Mohammed Riyas, inspected the spot. Police have collected CCTV footage from the area as part of the investigation. Sources said that a suspicious looking car was spotted in the area during the time when the theft is suspected to have happened. An investigation is on to find the culprit, police said.

Angamaly police registered a case under Sections 380 (theft in house), 461 (breaking open receptacle containing property) and 461 (trespass or house-breaking in order to commit offence punishable with imprisonment) of the IPC.

Aluva-Angamaly region has witnessed a handful of major burglaries in the recent times. On January 15, 2018, as much as 100 sovereigns of gold and Rs 1 lakh was stolen from a house at Aluva.

On February 17, 2019, a major robbery was reported from the house of a doctor at Athani area of Aluva when two men entered her house, attacked her and decamped with 60 sovereigns of gold and silver along with a sum of Rs 75,000.

Around 5 pm, two youths joined the occasion and started firing bullets in the air in which Pankaj, the host’s nephew, and an 11-year-old boy, Himanshu, the grandson of the host, received bullet injuries, the police said.

As Pankaj sustained an injury on his chest, local doctors referred him to a higher centre in Dehradun, whereas Himanshu is said to be out of danger and recovering at a private hospital in Laksar.

People present in the party nabbed one of the shooters and handed him over to the police, whereas another escaped.

149,['23/02/2020'],Court junks Nirbhaya convict’s ‘illness’ plea,"This story is from February 23, 2020

New Delhi: A court on Saturday dismissed a plea filed by a Nirbhaya convict seeking better psychological treatment. The CCTV footage submitted by the Tihar Jail authorities was not suggestive of any anomaly in his behaviour, the court observed, adding that general anxiety and depression were obvious in case of a death-row convict.

Additional sessions judge Dharmender Rana was hearing a plea by Vinay Sharma, one of the four death-row convicts in the Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case. Sharma had sought better treatment owing to his mental condition, including schizophrenia, and head and arm injuries.

After the hearing, the judge ordered, “I do not have any plausible reason to disbelieve the report of two responsible medical experts. I have also seen the CD provided by the jail authorities where the convict is seen conversing with his counsel and family members.” Sharma’s “apparent” tone and tenor was not suggestive of any abnormal behaviour; rather it convincingly corroborated the opinion of the medical experts, he added.

Sharma’s counsel, advocate A P Singh, had claimed his client couldn’t recognise people, including his mother. While visiting Sharma on the request of his family, Singh told the court, he had found that the convict had a grievous head injury, a plaster in his right arm due to a fracture, and was suffering from “insanity”, “mental illness” and “schizophrenia”.

Handing over the CCTV footage to the court, special prosecutor Irfan Ahmed, however, said Sharma had “self-inflicted superficial” injuries and was not suffering from any psychological disorder. Refuting the claim of him being unable to recognise people, Ahmed said, “Sharma had already spoken to his mother and his counsel over the phone. So that submission is wrong.”

Psychiatrist Dr Vivek Rustagi, who was present in the court, said he was meeting all convicts every day. A report by Dr Rustagi and Dr Akash Narade showed that the convict had occasionally shown anxiety, agitated behaviour and restlessness. The court was also informed that Sharma’s conduct was suggestive of deliberate disruptive behaviour. The medical opinion also highlighted that the convict was asking for the specialist psychiatry for legally favouring himself to get the death sentence commuted.

Dismissing Sharma’s plea, the court directed the Tihar Jail superintendent to ensure adequate care of all convicts as per rules.

The court had on February 17, for the third time, issued fresh death warrants for March 3 to hang the four death-row convicts — Mukesh Singh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Sharma (26) and Akshay Kumar (31) — in the Nirbhaya case.

Namakkal: Fire broke out on Bodhamalai hills near Rasipuram here for the second time this week in the early hours of Saturday, destroying around 10 hectares forest land. While officials are yet to ascertain the cause of fire, they suspect it to be a man-made one.

Forest officials, along with fire and rescue services personnel, have been working to bring the fire under control since morning, but with little success.

A senior official attached to Rasipuram forest range said, “Nearly 10 hectares of forest area has already been destroyed in the incident. We have taken precautionary measures to contain the spread of fire to more areas.”

The official said fire had broken out in the same area on Tuesday (February 18) and that they had put that out on Wednesday. However, fire once again erupted on Saturday morning.

The forest officials have strictly warned the people living at the foothills of Bodhamalai not to venture into the forest to chop trees and their branches. “Violators will be prosecuted. We suspect that people might have set fire to trees to make charcoal,” the official said. tnn

JAIPUR: The court of the commissioner for specially-abled persons again wrote to rural development and panchayati raj department and the department of local self government consider making a policy decision to provide reservation for PwDs (persons with disabilities ) in urban/local bodies . It also directed the departments to inform in 15 days about the status of execution of the orders.

In its letter to Additional Chief Secretary (ACS) rural development and panchayati raj department and secretary local self government (LSG) department, the court cited the centre's order which stated, ""It is requested that the state governments may consider making a policy decision to provide reservation for PwDs in urban/local bodies."" Hence, the departments have been asked to reply to the court in 15 days with respect to the same.

""When the first letter was written to the panchayati raj department, it replied saying there is no such provision as per panchayati raj act,"" said Hemant Bhai Goyal, national vice-president of Divyang Adhikar Mahasangh.

Deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot’s office had earlier written to additional chief secretary (ACS) rural development and panchayati raj department, Rajeshwar Singh, forwarding a letter by Hemant Bhai Goyal on the issue of nominating persons with disabilities (PwDs) as panchayati raj body members. Singh has been asked to take appropriate action after examining the matter.

In a representation to Pilot, Goyal, had urged him to nominate one person with disability as a member/councillor in every gram panchayat, panchayat samiti, zila parishad, nagar palika, nagar parishad and nagar nigam just like in Chattisgarh.

Earlier, the court of the commissioner for specially abled persons had directed local self government (LSG) department and the rural development and panchayati raj department to nominate one PwD as member/councillor in every panchayati raj institution and urban local body.

In an order, dated November 29, addressed to ACS, rural development and panchayati raj department and director, local self government, the deputy commissioner for specially abled persons has directed them to “Nominate one divyang person as councillor/member in each gram panchayat, panchayat samiti, zila parishad, nagar palika, nagar parishad and nagar nigam.”

Goyal had also mentioned in its representation that Chhattisgarh cabinet had decided to amend the Panchayati Raj Act and nominate disabled persons as councillors in every gram panchayat. He further stated that around 40 lakh persons with disability and 16 lakh families will benefit by this move.

He had raised this issue with chief minister Ashok Gehlot during the pre-budget dialogue with NGOs, civil societies and consumer forum. He also raised the issue pertaining to giving status of BPL category to the families of PwDs.

153,['23/02/2020'],Kerala: Tourist boat involved in collision gets stop memo,"This story is from February 23, 2020

Tourist boat Bay King collided with a Ro-Ro vessel at Fort Kochi boat jetty on Friday.

KOCHI: The Kerala Maritime Board (KMB) has issued a stop memo to tourist boat Bay King, restricting its further operations, on Saturday. The tourist boat had collided with a Ro-Ro vessel at Fort Kochi boat jetty on Friday. KMB chairman V J Mathew and Kerala Inland Vessel (KIV) Rules chief surveyor Renjith M J inspected the tourist boat and the Ro-Ro vessel.

In the detailed inspection, they found that boat navigator (srank) did not have an inland vessel licence issued by the Government of Kerala. Government licence is mandatory to operate tourist boats carrying passengers.

“The navigator holds a licence issued under the harbour craft rules. It permits him to operate fishing boats, and not passenger boats. It is also found that the tourists were not provided life jackets after the collision. Despite the accident, the boat sailed forward without stopping, which has made the issue even more serious. Coastal police had to follow them and bring them back,” said Renjith. He said the tourists on board the boat were asked to alight at Fort Kochi jetty and were brought to Ernakulam mainland by road.

Regarding operations of tourist boats in Kochi’s shipping channel, Renjith said the Cochin Port Trust has not issued any rigid regulations restricting movement of tourist boats in the channel.

Meanwhile, Fort Kochi police said that the navigator of the Ro-Ro vessel has been booked under IPC Section 280 for rash navigation. The tourist boat owner and the Ro-Ro vessel crew are asked to present themselves before the KMB on Tuesday as part of further investigation.

At the same time, Fort-Vypeen Janakeeya Samithi representative Majnu Komath said tourist boats should not be allowed to move closer to Ro-Ro vessels.

“Tourist boats and fishing boats frequent the shipping channel, and there are no restrictions imposed on the movement of these vessels. The district tourism promotion council, which is responsible for the operations of tourist boats, are not doing enough to ensure the safety of tourists,” Komath said.

On Friday, tourists and commuters had a narrow escape at Fort Kochi when the boat collided with the Ro-Ro vessel.

NEW DELHI: With a new cluster of coronavirus infected cases emerging in Wuhan and some countries reporting a sudden rise, India has revised its travel advisory asking people to avoid all non- essential travel to Singapore. The government also extended screening of passengers from four more countries - Kathmandu, Vietnam , Malaysia and Indonesia from Monday, in addition to six countries earlier.

The decisions were taken in a high level review meeting chaired by the cabinet secretary on Saturday.

Currently, passengers from China, Hong Kong, Thailand, South Korea, Singapore and Japan are screened at 21 designated airports in the country for a possible exposure to the novel coronavirus.

“In furtherance to the travel advisory issued earlier, citizens are advised to avoid all non-essential travel to Singapore,” the health ministry said.

As on date, 21,805 passengers have been brought under community surveillance. In addition, 3,97,152 flight passengers and 9,695 travellers at sea ports have been screened, it said.

After a detailed review, in addition to the screening as per earlier advisories, universal screening at airports is now being planned for flights from Kathmandu, Indonesia, Vietnam and Malaysia from Monday, the ministry said.

Secretaries of ministries of health, civil aviation, defence, information and broadcasting (I&B), representatives from external affairs ministry, home ministry and other related departments were present in the meeting.

Even as China reported a sharp fall in deaths from cases of the coronavirus on Saturday, world health officials warned it was too early to make predictions about the outbreak as new infections continued to rise in other countries.

Chinese authorities said the mainland had 397 new confirmed cases on Friday, down from 889 a day earlier. The numbers surged elsewhere, though, with outbreaks worsening in South Korea, Iran , Italy and Lebanon.

In total, China has reported 75,569 cases and 2,239 deaths to the World Health Organisation due to the virus since December.

The disease has spread to some 26 countries and territories outside mainland China.

Mangaluru: Efforts are on to upgrade the Coastal Development Authority set up in 2008 into either a board or a corporation. Vested with development of basic infrastructure in the three coastal districts of Uttara Kannada, Udupi and Dakshina Kannada (DK), keeping in mind aspirations of people of these districts, the proposed upgrade of the authority will bring in more funds and manpower to execute the same, said CDA chairman Mattar Rathnakar Hegde .

Interacting with media after being formally installed in the position by Nalin Kumar Kateel , state BJP chief and DK member of Parliament on Saturday, Hegde said the authority for now is striving to meet aspirations of people within financial and human resource constraints. Its upgrade will naturally bring in more funds and staff that are essential to carry out a wide range of activities in diverse geographical locations within these districts, he said.

“We have made out a case for devolution of powers to the authority from various agencies that execute work that we propose with government approval,” he said. This will help the authority execute the work as per its vision, plan and speed rather than be dependent on other agencies who take their own time, Hegde said, hoping that chief minister B S Yediyurappa will act and given more powers and autonomy to the authority to carry out its mandate.

Noting that various projects approved by senior IAS officer Shalini Rajaneesh, who headed the authority in the interim, before he took over, are already in the pipeline, Hegde said the officer has suggested that the authority take up unique projects to carve a niche for itself.

In line with this, plans are afoot to set up a tourism centre at Kaup Light House and exploit its natural scenic beauty with a light show that attracts tourists to it in a big way.

Discussions will be held with deputy commissioners, chief executive officers and heads of agencies such as Nirmithi Kendra and PWDs of the three coastal districts on taking up projects related to tourism, fisheries and infrastructure development, he said. A plan to hold an exclusive investor meet for the coastal districts is on the anvil, he said, adding the authority will also plan a mega job mela to push for employment of locals.

Earlier, Nalin suggested that the authority could focus on tourism – religious, beach and jungle (in the Western Ghats), entrepreneurship activities and agri-based industries, including fisheries-based processing units. Carry out a carrying capacity study for the projects – short-term and long-term—that the authority proposes to the government, and obtain financial clearance, he said, assuring full support of the party and the government for its future endeavours.

According to Gupta, about 75% of the repair work based on the IIT Madras report has been carried out on the flyover. “Only a load test will help us determine the strength of its beams.”

Samuel Anbu Thomas, director of Bengaluru-based STUP Consultants, said a load test will help measure the structure’s stability. When there is suspicion regarding the design or quality of construction of new bridges, the general practice is to conduct a load test, he said, adding that load testing is an acceptable engineering process which helps us understand structural stability. “In every stage, we measure computed deformation and actual deformation. If the actual deformation is more than 10%, we discontinue the test. The deflection-acceptance criteria are based on the recovery of deflection at 24 hours after removal of test load,” he added.

Kerala government contractors association president Varghese Kannampilly said that the Palarivattom flyover was executed under a written contract. “There occurred some major defects in construction. The defect-liability period is part of all contracts. The Rs 27 crore project was completed at a cost of Rs 26 crore. The contractor pointed out the defects and asked the government to bill him for getting them rectified. The Roads and Bridges Development Corporation directed the contractor to carry them out,” he said.

Anil Joseph, structural consultant, Geo Structurals, spoke about the studies and repair schedules presented by IIT Madras under the guidance of prof P K Aravindan in January 2017. In the report submitted by regional officer, ministry of road transport and highways on March 16, 2018, it was stated that there was distress at some points and suggestions were put forward to conduct NDT and load tests, if required. Later, DMRC principal adviser E Sreedharan came out with a report stating that no strengthening was required for the foundations and piers. In October 2019, pointing out the discrepancies noticed in the IIT report, Sreedharan suggested dismantling the RCC girder spans and replacing them with pre-stressed girders for increasing the life expectancy of the bridge.

Kanpur: Police arrested one more person on Saturday for fanning violence in the city during protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in the month of December.

Police identified the accused as Aqeel, who had sustained gunshot wounds in his leg on December 20 following violence in the Babupurwa area during protests against the CAA. ""He was named in an FIR lodged in the aftermath of violence at Babupurwa police station. After attaining normalcy following treatment, he was evading police arrest. Acting on a tip-off, we arrested Aqeel today,"" said SP (East) Raj Kumar Agarwal.

To recall, police had arrested two people on February 6 for fanning violence in the city during protests against the CAA in December.

A massive protest took place in the city's Babupurwa and Yateemkhana areas on December 20 and 21. Police had to resort to force and open fire in the air to disperse the crowd. Three protesters died of bullet injuries in the violence on December 20 in the Babupurwa area.

Jaipur: A fact-finding team of Dalit activists has demanded security for the two persons who were beaten, humiliated and sodomised in Nagaur on February 16. It raised serious question on the role of police as the incident took place on February 16, while the FIR was lodged on February 19.

“We met families of two victims . Just because they were scared as they were threatened of dire consequences, they did not gather courage to file FIR soon after the incident happened on February 16. In this case, the police have not taken any step on their own. Despite the fact that the video went viral, the police did not bother to act on their own,” said Satish Kumar, a Dalit rights activist.

The team was sent by Centre for Dalit Right who reached Nagaur on Friday and spent the whole day to find facts about the case. It also claimed that the police have not made a strong FIR as they did not include Section 327 of the IPC for voluntarily causing hurt to extort property or to constrain to an illegal act.

It has demanded to include Section 34 of IPC for all the persons present at the site of crime shall be liable for that act in the same manner as if it were done by him alone. Moreover, the fact-finding team advocated to include 120(B) (criminal conspiracy) and 326-B (punishment for attempted acid attacks) and 326(A) for causes grievous hurt by throwing acid on or by administering acid.

Seven accused have been arrested in the case. However, the fact-finding team claimed that there were nine accused. “Seven have been arrested. The fact-finding team demanded to arrest two more accused who are still at large.

The fact-finding team demanded that the investigations should be without any loopholes. “It has already been seen that in serious cases such as mob lynching, the investigation is done so poorly that the accused get benefit of it and get acquitted. Proper, fair and strong investigations with proper evidences should be done,” said Kumar.

The also demanded from the government to present challan in the case as early as possible and the government should deploy special public prosecutor, who has the power to prove his case.

163,['23/02/2020'],Residents to get free Wi-Fi facility at 30 main crossings,"This story is from February 23, 2020

Net Connect

Kanpur: Residents of Kanpur will get free Wi-Fi facilities at 30 prominent crossings to know about the traffic situation in the city.

The service will be available for 30 minutes so that people may access the traffic live through the Google map and witness the traffic situation at the main routes and select a safe and smooth route for their destination. Moreover, the residents can also lodge their complaints regarding road jams and give suggestions on the police app.

The service has been started at 30 prominent crossings of the city under the Smart City project. The officials claimed that if the results were found favourable, then it could be implemented in the entire city.

The crossings which will have this facility are Bagahi crossing, Chawla Market, Company Bagh, Deputy ka Padao, Devki Talkies, Double Puliya, Fazalganj, Ghantaghar, Gopala Tower, GPO Bada Chauraha, Green Park stadium, Haleem College, Jhakarkatti, Kargil Park, Kidwai Nagar, municipal corporation parking, medical college, Namak Factory crossing, Nandlal crossing, Naveen Market, Neer Ksheer crossing, Padam Tower, PPN Market, Sales Tax crossing, SBI main branch, SPV office, Taat Mill crossing, Vijay Nagar and Jareeb Chowki crossing.

If a resident uses the Wi-Fi at a crossing for more than 30 minutes then charges would be levied at the rate of the telecom company. In the absence of any information, residents often find themselves in trouble due to road jams or traffic diversions, said an official of the traffic department.

Pooja Tripathi, incharge of the Smart City project said the facility is especially for the people of the city. They have to register their number at any crossing equipped with Wi-Fi and then can use the app or the Google map to know the traffic situation of their route.

After the Wi-Fi service, they could use the Google map or traffic police app to know the traffic situations at their routes. They are not required to open their mobile data at 30 crossings but will have to open their Wi-Fi option and get connected directly to the net. Thereafter, they would connect with the Google map or the traffic police app, the official added.

Last year, the traffic police had launched a traffic police app which was connected with the Google map. The idea was to provide ambulance and crane services at the time of the accident but the people did not use it properly. According to a survey conducted by the Tech Mahindra under the Smart City project, people are not using the app due to the costly internet pack. Now free Wi-Fi would encourage them to use the Google map and the traffic police app to know the traffic situation of the city.

Pune: The Toy Trade Association, Pune, in a letter to the ministry of commerce, appealed to the government to roll back the recent import duties on toys.

Around 85% of the toys are imported and the steep hike in duties will lead to the shut down of toy businesses in the city, the association stated.

The association’s president Pramod Chavan on Saturday told TOI, “Earlier, the customs duty on toys was 20%, which after the latest budget was increased to 60%. This will result in an increase in toy prices, making them unaffordable for some children,” he said.

Rahul Chheda, owner of Ambika Toys on Laxmi Road, said, “Toy manufacturers in India are yet to produce good-quality electronic and battery-operated toys. So, we depend on imports. Ever since the hike on import duty, the prices of toys have gone up by 30 to 40% and may increase if this continues. This has also resulted in decrease in demand for toys by 30 to 40%,” he said.

165,['23/02/2020'],US consulate in Ahmedabad at top of Gujaratis’ wishlist,"This story is from February 23, 2020

AHMEDABAD/GANDHINAGAR: Amid a strong buzz about the opening of a US consulate office in Gujarat, there is no formal intimation from the US government or the Union ministry of external affairs regarding the same. Government of Gujarat had made an official request for the establishment of a US consulate office in the city.

“We are yet to get any formal intimation about the establishment of US Consulate in Ahmedabad; but we are still hopeful,” said a state government official privy to the development.

Gujarati community is the largest chunk of Indian diaspora in the US and people willing to go to the US are forced to travel to Mumbai to obtain their visas. “The state government has urged the Centre to ask the US government to consider this long-pending demand of Gujarati community to set up a visa facilitation centre and US consulate in the state. This will also benefit various senior citizens who apply for visa to meet their families,” the official further added.

At present, USA embassy and consul-general operates from New Delhi, Chennai, Hyderabad, Kolkata and Mumbai. C K Patel, president, Vishwa Gujarati Samaj (VGS), said, “It is a long-pending demand of Gujarati community to have the US consulate office in Ahmedabad. People will have to spend days in Mumbai, Delhi for the visa processing and thus, an office in Ahmedabad will make it extremely convenient for Gujaratis.”

Praful Nayak, president (India), Association of Indian-Americans in North America, said, “Gujarati community in the US has always supported the Trump administration. President Trump’s family supported in organizing ‘Chalo Gujarat’ event when it first began in 2008. With such a large Gujarati diaspora in the US, it is our humble request that a US consulate be set up in Ahmedabad or Gandhinagar. Various investors and businessmen from the US regularly visit Gujarat and vice-versa. Thus, a consulate would be a win-win situation.”

The association had conducted a signature campaign for this in which over 8,000 Gujaratis living in the US had supported the campaign, Nayak further added. Industrialists have also voiced their support for the initiative.

“Alongside the consulate, it would be great if a US business and trade promotion centre is also set up. This will expand the potential for boosting the bilateral trade between Gujarat and the US.” Chintan Thaker, co-chair, Assocham Gujarat chapter

“A full-fledged embassy will pave way for setting up of a large-scale trade office. With several Gujarati students opting for higher education in the US, the embassy can facilitate establishment of centres here that can help students make informed career choices and applying to US-based universities.” Sunil Parekh, board member, Indo-American Education Society

Vinay Sharma

NEW DELHI: Nirbhaya gang rape and murder convict, Vinay Sharma , tried to injure himself by swallowing staple pins inside his cell on Thursday. Jail officials managed to stop him and got him treated at the jail hospital thereafter.

On Friday, the jail authorities also served a notice to the family members of Vinay and Akshay for their last meeting with the convicts.

Tihar sources say that Mukesh and Pawan already had their “last meeting” with their families on January 31, ahead of the earlier date of execution. “We have asked Akshay and Vinay to indicate their date of last meeting. Apart from this, the regular mulaqat of twice a week is continuing for all of them,” said a senior jail official.

According to the jail officials, Vinay’s behaviour had turned violent ever since the date of execution was announced.

Jail authorities told TOI that since the time Vinay has been in prison, his health and mental condition, however, has been stable.

“The convicts are on round-the-clock surveillance and officials are also keeping an eye through the CCTV cameras,” said an official.

Jail sources said that all four of them are consuming food, although in reduced quantities. Drastic change has been seen in Vinay’s behaviour ever since the new date of execution was given by the court.

During the last meeting, three or more members of the family get a chance to meet the convict and hold them.

NEW DELHI: Three members of a Mewat gang have been arrested. The gang was behind the spate of ATM thefts in the city over the past one month. Lately, they had uprooted an ATM at Tughlaqabad and then at Naraina where they had to dump the machine midway and flee. Three members were caught in south Delhi before they struck again. It was found that they travelled to Delhi every night and stole an SUV, which they used to keep the stolen ATM.

Atul Kumar Thakur, DCP (south) said, “The accused have been identified as Talib (26), Shamim (22) and Shabbir (37) also known as Kala. Seven cases of ATM thefts in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana have been solved with their arrest.

Police said they had received information about the movement of the accused. When a team of officers spotted the SUV in which the accused were travelling, they were signalled to spot, but they did not stop and instead rammed police officers with the vehicle. They were later overpowered and a countrymade pistol, spray paint and a wire cutter were seized.

Madan Kaushik

DEHRADUN: Uttarakhand cabinet under the chairmanship of CM Trivendra Singh Rawat took a slew of important decisions on Saturday, primary among which was approving the Uttarakhand Aerospace and Defence Industrial Policy to boost investment in the defence manufacturing sector. This policy will be on the lines of Centre’s “Make in India” scheme under which the state government will give a 10% (or Rs 10 crore) grant on movable property in case of an investment of Rs 100 crore or above in the defence manufacturing sector.

Any new industry in the defence manufacturing sector will get an exemption from power surcharge for a period of five years. Further, the new policy aims at establishing dedicated industrial parks to attract investment in this sector.

The cabinet also gave its approval to the excise policy for the fiscal year of 2020-21. This policy sets the overall revenue target at Rs 3,500 crore, about 15% more than the last fiscal.

Sources said that liquor prices are likely to decrease by almost 20%, after the new excise policy comes into effect. This dip will make liquor bottles in Uttarakhand cheaper than what they cost in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh. The sources added that the new policy also gives the power to issue bar licenses to district magistrates.

The cabinet also approved the setting up of a committee headed by a minister for the merger of Jal Nigam and Jal Sansthan. During the meeting, the cabinet gave its nod to the annual budget, which will be presented during the assembly session to be held at Gairsain from March 3. According to officials, the state government is going to present a budget of Rs 53,000 crore this time.

The cabinet also approved new 116 posts in the transport department, including the posts of four RTOs and four ARTOs. The number of posts in the state planning commission has also been increased. Further, it was decided that the head of the Gairsain Development Council will be the housing development minister instead of the assembly speaker.

170,['23/02/2020'],"Airbus: 200 PW engines replaced, 100 more to go","This story is from February 23, 2020

NEW DELHI: India’s tough stand on replacing Pratt & Whitney’s (PW) unmodified — and snag-prone — engines with modified or upgraded ones for the Airbus A320 Neos is paying off.

IndiGo, the world’s largest A320 Neo customer, and GoAir, have 150 Neos with PW engines between them.

“Each (PW-powered Neo) in India now has at least one modified engine. PW has so far replaced 200 engines on Neos. Now, only 100 more unmodified PW engines for Neos — which also meet all standards and are perfectly safe — remain to be replaced,” Anand Stanley, president and MD of Airbus (India and South Asia ), told TOI on Friday.

Following a spate of PW engine snags on A320 Neos last year, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) had said no Neo with even a single unmodified PW engine would be allowed to fly after May 31, 2020.

Airbus and PW’s in past few weeks have logged a replacement rate of one engine daily after that directive. Asked if this deadline will be met, Stanley said, “We are fully committed to complying with the DGCA directive on replacing the engines and are making rapid progress towards that goal.”

Ashmita Sethi, who recently took over as the MD of PW (India), told TOI in her first media interaction: “With the ongoing deliveries of upgraded engines for replacement, the number of engines to be changed is decreasing every day. About 200 engines have already been replaced till now. Only about 100 remain. Very rapid progress is being made,”

With India being the world’s biggest A320 Neo market, PW is now working to set up a maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) unit here and is tying up with AI Engineering Services Ltd for this.

The 100 unmodified engines awaiting replacement mean 100 Neos of IndiGo and GoAir have one modified and one unmodified engine under their wings while 50 have both modified engines. Stanley dismissed any safety fears over Neos with one unmodified engine.

“There have been teething issues (with PW engines for Neos) which are resolved. Last year we say two new issues with the gear box and low pressure turbine third stage. Fixes have been found for both,” Stanley, an engineer by training who started his aerospace career with PW, said.

The modified PW engines come with those fixes and Airbus says it has not seen the snags recur on this version on Neos being used in India and abroad.

“The unmodified engines have got the gearbox fix and have put in additional procedures to improve durability of this engine. While the issues with this engine have caused undesirable inconvenience to both airlines and passengers which we regret, Airbus Neos with these engines are also completely safe. At no time is safety negotiable for Airbus, ever. An Airbus aircraft is released only when it meets all safety standards, irrespective of the power plant on it,” Stanley said.

171,['23/02/2020'],‘Always an honour to perform at classical dance festivals’,"This story is from February 23, 2020

Bhopal: A versatile actor, who has deftly carved a niche for herself in the warp and weft of South film industry, from Malayalam to Tamil, Telugu and Kannada, twice national award-winner and Padma Shri Shobana Pillai’s Bharatanatyam performances are equally enchanting. As she took centrestage on day three of weeklong Khajuraho dance fest in Chhatarpur district on Saturday, the danseuse spoke about a divided world, artiste’s dilemma, dwindling audience base at classical fests and more.

As a glamorous actor, Shobana is a star attraction at Khajuraho and every major dance fest. Yet on other days at many of these fests, attendance is not really encouraging. Does it demotivate the young dancers? To this Shobana replied, “Dance festivals promote classical arts; it is an honour for anyone to perform here. These days, people are specially designing their performances for social media, so if the attendance dwindles at times at classical events, you know that people will watch it on social media as most of these events are webcast. I watched a Kathak performance on Friday and I can vouch that it was an ethereal experience. But when it comes to general thinning of audience, if the entire package of music, act and presentation is right, it will reach out to larger audience. You have to interact with them for greater connect.”

Having staged live shows across the globe, Shobana confessed that she still prefers to perform for desi audience. “Nothing beats presenting classical act at home turf; I find it easier to present the mythological stories here. Western audiences are very polite but they don't understand our ancient epics.” The celebrated dancer said she doesn’t believe in adding new-age messages to classical dance forms to motivate the new generation. She explained, “You can connect with youngsters even through Ramayana and Mahabharata. They need to be told over and over again, but the narration has to be interesting for youngsters to enjoy it.”

In the evening, Shobana started her act with Vishnu Aradhana and took the audience on a divine journey with her portrayal. Later, Suprava Mishra's Odissi dance and Bharatanatyam by Ananda Shankar Jayant added to the mystique of the evening.

BJD delegation meets AIIMS director Gitanjali Batmanabane

BHUBANESWAR: The BJD on Saturday upped ante against the controversial circular of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Bhubaneswar. The circular advocates use of Hindi in official communication.

A BJD delegation, led by Puri MP and party’s leader in Lok Sabha Pinaki Mishra, met AIIMS director Gitanjali Batmanabane , seeking withdrawal of the directive, citing it arbitrary and discriminatory.

The delegation also submitted two memoranda, addressed to the director, AIIMS, and Union health and family welfare minister Harsh Vardhan.

The BJD memorandum said AIIMS Bhubaneswar, is a public institution. It said people receiving treatment from AIIMS speak Odia and by imposing Hindi on the people of Odisha , it is jeopardising the interests of patients, their attendants and the stakeholders of the society in Odisha.

“Such imposition of Hindi language is discriminatory, arbitrary and in gross violation of norms which will adversely affect thousands of people of Odisha, who seek healthcare in AIIMS,” read the memorandum.

Briefing reporters after meeting the AIIMS director, Pinaki said, “The AIIMS director clarified that the circular will not affect the patients visiting the premier healthcare institute.”

The patient care services will continue in Odia and English. The circular does not mean that the patients visiting AIIMS need to learn Hindi. The director clarified that since the language committee of Parliament pulls up them for not meeting the target (on using Hindi in official communication), they have issued such a directive for their internal communication. Those having proficiency in Hindi would use the language in their internal noting, said Pinaki.

The Puri MP said they have urged the AIIMS authorities to give priority to Odia and demanded three-language (Odia, Hindi and English) formula in all signages.

The AIIMS directive on use of Hindi was issued a day before the International Mother Tongue Day on Friday triggered controversy with opposition parties targeting the Centre.

Clearing the air, the AIIMS director said most of their signages are either in Odia or English.

“Whatever we are talking about (the directive) is an internal memo, which was circulated because there is something called as Official Language Act. We are supposed to comply with the law. The directive is meant for those people, who are proficient in Hindi,” said the AIIMS director.

She said the order clearly says that it is for persons concerned which means those people, who are conversant in Hindi and not meant for everyone. “Even I don’t know Hindi. I can’t read Hindi neither can I write. So, this circular is also not meant for me too. Somehow it has been misinterpreted,” she said.

On BJD’s demand for three-language formula, the AIIMS director said they have assured the ruling party that they will use Odia as the first language in all signages followed by Hindi and English.

She further said they have started teaching Odia language in first year of MBBS so that the students will be able to talk to patients in Odia by the time they reach the clinical years.

In a letter to all the district collectors, social security department secretary Bhaskar Jyoti Sharma has asked them to distribute specific duties among the top district level officials, who will conduct periodic checks and suggest measures for regular monitoring and improvement of such schools.

“You are aware that at present 103 special schools for different categories of children with disabilities are functioning in the state under grant-in-aid fold to provide special education. Those special schools are both residential and non-residential,” read Sharma’s letter to the district collectors.

Sharma further mentioned that the provisions of Rights to Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, provide for quality services, safety and security of those children. “It is necessary to monitor those institutions regularly by developing a suitable mechanism at district level by involving field functionaries and departments concerned,” he said.

Sharma asked the district collectors to involve additional district magistrates and sub-collectors by assigning them specific responsibilities.

The Right to Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, asks to monitor participation, progress and attainment level of children with disabilities. It asks to provide transportation facilities to such children.

It says every child with disability between the age of 6 and 18 shall have the right and access to free education in a neighbourhood school or in a special school of his or her choice in an appropriate environment.

Respective monitoring mechanisms will be devised for respective districts, an official of the social security department said.

174,['23/02/2020'],‘Spirituality key to cutting litigation’,"This story is from February 23, 2020

AHMEDABAD: A local court has prescribed an out-of-the-box solution of spirituality to reduce the burden on judiciary. The court has advocated spirituality to people as a remedy to curb civil litigation, which essentially is a result of greedy, cruel and sadist nature of humans.

A judge at the city civil court, Tarun V P Ahuja, earlier this week opined in an order that the ancient sages in our scriptures taught us altruism for happy and content society. He cited a verse ""Sarve bhavantu sukhina: Sarve santu niramaya: Sarve bhadrani pashyantu: Ma kaschit dukh bhagbhavet” from 'Brihadaranyak Upnishad' which means “May happiness, prosperity shower on all, may good health inform all, may all see auspiciousness, no human being may suffer”.

“These thoughts wished by sages may become a reality if no one of us snatches wealth from others, if no one dispossesses another of his rightfully owned land and no one evicts a rightful owner from his house.”

“But unfortunately, human beings are greedy, cruel and sadist and that is the cause of all civil litigation. If spirituality envelopes each of us, then greed, cruelty and sadism will vanish from our minds. On the other hand, there should be control on the persons who are irresponsible and senseless regarding their rights, claims and interest in property.”

The judge made these remarks in a land suit slapped by a family against the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC). Six descendants of one Kalubhai Gohel filed the suit to restrain AMC from vacating the family from the house in an open plot behind the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro). They claimed that the land was given by Isro to their grandfather, who was its permanent employee. They are living on the land for last more than 40 years.

On the other hand, AMC wants the family to vacate the land because the space is to be used for public utility and road in the Vejalpur town planning scheme. The family was offered an alternative accommodation, but they did not find it comfortable and rejected the proposal. The family did not shift and approached the court demanding that its ownership on the land be declared and AMC should be stopped form evicting the family.

After hearing the case, the court said that the family cannot be termed as the landowner in absence of evidence. It further said that AMC cannot dispossess the family of the land without following due process of law.

PUNE: An expensive gift bait cost a woman Rs 17.74 lakh.The woman (30), a quality assurance engineer in a leading software company, was duped by her virtual friend and his accomplices between July and October 2019.The initial investigation revealed that the woman transferred the amount to eight bank accounts in New Delhi, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh.The Airport police booked the man and his accomplices on Friday under sections 419 (punishment for cheating by personation) and 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) of the Indian Penal Code and the relevant sections of the Information and Technology Act.The fraudster had sent the woman a friend request on a video- and photograph-sharing social networking site in July last year and she accepted it.The woman, who is from Nagpur but is currently residing in Pune, in her FIR stated, “The fraudster introduced himself as a Brazil national working as a marine engineer in London. We shared our numbers and started chatting.”The man informed her that he would be sending her a gift parcel comprising gold ornaments, handbags and foreign currency notes to her address in India. He even posted photographs of the articles he had purchased for her on the social networking site.“Later, the woman received eight calls from fraudsters impersonating as customs officials in New Delhi. They told her, her parcel dispatched from London had reached India. They told her to pay refundable income tax of Rs45,000 to receive the parcel. The woman transferred the required money to a bank account that was provided to her.”The complaint stated that she received calls from the fraudsters telling her that she would have to pay more tax because the parcel comprised excess goods.“The fraudsters again demanded money to seek police clearance, among other reasons. The engineer ended up transferring Rs17.74 lakh via netbanking to various bank accounts as customs duty and other charges,” the complaint stated.An officer from the Airport police said, “The woman realized she was tricked after the fraudsters started demanding money again for some or the other reason. She then filed a complaint application with the cybercrime police station on November 22.”The officer said the cybercrime officials had frozen Rs5 lakh debited to the fraudsters’ bank accounts. “They conducted a preliminary inquiry and transferred the investigations to the Airport police,” the officer said.“We shall collect details of the account holders from the various banks and conduct technical investigation to detect the fraudsters at the earliest,” the police officer added.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74262621,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-149816,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/gift-lure-from-virtual-pal-costs-engineer-rs-17-74-lakh/articleshow/74261777.cms

177,['23/02/2020'],BMC to crack down on vendors littering the streets,"This story is from February 23, 2020

A vending zone near Kalinga Stadium

BHUBANESWAR: From now on, Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC) will show zero tolerance towards vendors found littering the streets. BMC commissioner Prem Chandra Chaudhury said street vendors are not showing responsible behaviour despite awareness and as a result the civic body has decided to act tough.

“There will be zero tolerance for street vendors encroaching upon roads. This is the first offence. The second offence is that they are littering waste and do not care to put up a dustbin and gather the waste at one place to help the BMC sanitation workers,” Chaudhury said.

He said there will be no prior notice and those violating the norms will be evicted by the enforcement squads. “Why should they litter on public space. Can’t they spend some money to keep the public space clean by putting up some dustbins,” the commissioner added.

Officials said BMC spends a lot of money to maintain sanitation in the city and because of the irresponsible behaviour of vendors, the public space is rendered an eyesore.

Usually, street encroachers are given prior eviction notice, which helps them remove their belongings. But it exposes BMC workers to resistance and the civic body has to use its resources and deploy more manpower to evict them. “There will be surprise raids on street vendors who encroach upon roads and litter,” said a BMC officer.

The civic body has also decided to seal commercial establishments that violate building plan norms. Once the Odisha Development Authority (ODA) court passes an order to seal a commercial unit, there will not be any prior notice. The ODA court functions both in BMC and BDA office. The BMC and BDA officers are empowered to hear the proceedings of the ODA court, which mostly hear cases of building plan regulation, and pass orders for sealing or demolition.

On Thursday, the BMC had sealed a commercial complex in Patia for using the mandatory parking space for commercial purpose.

178,['23/02/2020'],Manohar Parrikar School at GU may not open this academic year,"This story is from February 23, 2020

Panaji: The Manohar Parrikar School of Law , Governance and Public Policies at Goa University is unlikely to become operational from the upcoming academic year 2020-21, as expected earlier. The foundation stone for construction of the building to house the new school was recently laid at the Goa University campus.

While the new block will take at least another year-and-a-half to complete, the university does not have the space a tpresent to begin the new programmes under the school.

“Also, the approval for faculty positions for the new institute has not yet come from the state. After the approval comes, it will take some time to complete the process of filling up the posts etc,” said an official.

It was decided to set up the Manohar Parrikar School of Law, Governance and Public Policies, in memory of the former chief minister. The state government has already sanctioned Rs 10 crore to construct a new block to house the school. The new block will come up in land within the Goa University campus.

It was expected that new programmes could be offered under the school from the 2020-21 academic year itself.

Under the school, a number of programmes are set to be introduced for the first time in the state.

A master’s programme in public administration will be offered at the Manohar Parrikar School, where government officials can also enroll, to upgrade their administrative skills. This programme is expected to have an intake of 30 students and will be open to graduates of any social studies subject. Already this PG course is offered by all major universities in the country, but was not available until now at GU.

An MA programme in disabilities studies and another MA in tribal studies, each with an intake of 15 students, will be introduced at the new school, while a doctorate in law will also be offered.

Presently, a centre for the study of social exclusion and inclusive policy already exists at Goa University, which was established with support from the University Grants Commission, but is currently operating with just one faculty member. This centre is now proposed to be brought under the Manohar Parrikar School of Law, Governance and Public Policies.

Similarly, the existing women’s studies department is also likely to be absorbed by the new school.

179,['23/02/2020'],"Pune: Poor infrastructure, negligence turn stretch into pedestrians’ death trap","This story is from February 23, 2020

Pedestrians jaywalk on the busy Katraj-Dehu Road bypass

PUNE: Just a hop, skip and a jump away from the Wakad subway, pedestrians are often spotted running across the ever-busy six-lane Katraj-Dehu Road bypass to reach the other side of the road, resulting in accidents and loss of lives.

This spot in Wakad is one of the many locations on the 40km-long stretch where people can be seen indulging in similar acts of daredevilry to save a few minutes of their time or overcome the lack of pedestrian facilities, regular commuters said.

“I don’t know much about the other spots on the bypass, but in Wakad, pedestrians can very well use the subway to reach the other side of the highway, which they seldom do. The authorities have installed a pump at the subway to drain out water, especially during the monsoon. It is also well lit. Still, people continue to risk their lives,” a caretaker for the Wakad subway said.

Prakash Gupta, a regular traveller between Baner and Dehu Road, said he could see people running across the road at least at four spots along his route. “The first spot is the turning at MITCON in Balewadi where I see people running across the road, jumping the median and landing directly onto the road waiting to cross the other half. Next location is the Hinjewadi flyover where there are no pedestrian facilities. Similar situation prevails at Wakad bus stop and a little beyond Tathawade. Last is the entire stretch between Kiwale bridge and Dehu Road, which lacks even railings,” Gupta said.

He said at many of these spots, people tend to occupy the entire third lane of the bypass while waiting for buses or cars.

Commuters said the situation was no different at Chandni Chowk, Sinhagad Road and even Katraj. “This is a National Highway but is treated like a city road by many. People also need to be more responsible. There are vehicular and pedestrian underpasses at several locations across the bypass, which are seldom used,” Vaibhav Phadke, another regular commuter, said.

Based on observations along the bypass, the Hinjewadi police have already raised some infrastructural issues with the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) about pedestrian safety. “About three months ago, we had communicated with NHAI officials regarding infrastructural interventions along the bypass in the areas under our jurisdiction,” Sunil Dahiphale, inspector of the Hinjewadi traffic division, said.

When contacted, SD Chitnis, general manager of NHAI, Pune, said, there were several underpasses or subways along the bypass. “The service roads have also been made across the stretch of the bypass for use by pedestrians. People, however, prefer to run across the bypass. There are several punctures along the stretch, which we will seal. We urge people to use the underpasses,” Chitnis said.

180,['23/02/2020'],Biomining begins at Ariyamangalam yard,"This story is from February 23, 2020

Trichy: Biomining process has begun at the dump yard in Ariyamangalam although not in a full-fledged manner as the high tension (HT) electricity for the project has not been provided yet. The contractor has taken up the land restoration process utilising an alternative source.

As there has been considerable delay in sanctioning the HT connection, because the civic body applied only recently for HT connection with Tangedco, Trichy Corporation and the private contractor utilised the existing power supply at the defunct IL&FS plant to power the biomining plant. At present, only 800 MT of waste will be processed by the biomining plant, the quantity will be increased to 1,400 MT once HT connection becomes available.

“Once the HT electricity connection is facilitated, the biomining process will gain pace,” an official with Trichy Corporation said. The processed waste is being sent to their respective destinations for freeing up the dump yard’s land. The waste is segregated separately as soil, combustible waste and recyclable waste using trommels, combustion separator and air density separator.

The soil recovered from the waste mounds are used for landfill, while combustible waste is sent to cement factories as refuse-derived fuel. Plastics and glass particles are sent to recycling plants. “Soon, manure at free of cost will be made available for farmers from the dump yard. Shredded biodegradable waste can be used in farms but farmers have to bring their own vehicles,” a source at the biomining plant said.

The plant will function round-the-clock and is likely to reclaim the dump yard site in two years. Trichy Corporation said that a shelter is being constructed to cover the biomining plant to continue the process even under rain. Officials added that HT power connection will be facilitated soon.

181,['23/02/2020'],Pune: Teachers blame technology for killing the art of handwriting,"Representative image

PUNE: Cursive writing, with its elegant loops, curls and flourishes, was once a rite of passage for schoolchildren, but not any longer. With gadgets occupying a greater part of their lives, kids these days feel at home swiping on tablets and punching keyboards rather than using their hands to write.Not surprisingly, teachers find students loath to doing extra work that involves putting pencil or pen to paper. Increasing use of digital screens has impacted their ability to write clearly and legibly, they said.With young students having easy access to gadgets, their motor skills remain underdeveloped leading to poor letter formation, said Amruta Prabhu, principal, The HDFC School, Pune.Prabhu said that the fact that developing handwriting skills is nowadays considered an after-school activity spoke volumes about the weightage given to penmanship. Keeping this mind, many schools have started making handwriting an integral part of academic and holistic development.Some schools, such as The Orbis School, have started rewarding students with certificates for good handwriting. “We have started displaying notebooks with good handwriting during parent-teacher meetings to encourage parents to motivate their children to write neatly,” said Nalini Samuel, principal, The Orbis School.The problem is more apparent among students of Class IV and above, said Shilpa Gore, a teacher at an unaided government school in Khopoli , Raigad district. “They are more comfortable typing than writing,"" she said. Moreover, since board exams are written tests, students should not be casual about their handwriting, said educators. “Students who fail to write their papers legibly end up losing marks,” said Namrata Majhail, principal, The Orchid School.With many students grappling with handwriting problems, ‘handwriting improvement’ classes have sprung up across the city. “In Wadgaonsheri alone, there are some 15-20 classes,"" said Radhika Thipse, a tutor.Preeti Deshpande, who has been conducting such classes in Aranyeshwar for the past ten years, said, ""Even among older children, I have noticed that they do not know how to hold the pencil correctly.”When Thipse started handwriting classes around five years ago, there were only two-three students. “Now, I conduct two batches comprising 15-20 students in each,"" said Thipse. According to a rough estimate, there are 100 such tuition classes across the city.With students not writing as much as they should, it is no surprise that some of the letters scribbled by them hardly appear legible.“I recently came across a Class XII student whose ‘r’ looked like ‘s’ and ‘v’ looked like ‘n’,” said home tutor Sarika Lele.But some educators said that it is unfair to single out students and teachers are equally to be blamed. ""These days, not just students, even the handwriting of teachers needs improvement. When students see that their teachers have good handwriting skills, they try to emulate it,"" said Vasant Kalpande, former director of education.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74264443,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-508151,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/teachers-blame-technology-for-killing-the-art-of-handwriting/articleshow/74261787.cms

PUNE: Shilpa Apte , the aunt of the engineering student Pranav Galgale (21) who was killed in an accident on February 16 on Ambegaon on Katraj-Dehu Road bypass, said the latter had donated half of his liver to his mother and not a kidney.

“The liver transplant happened in April last year and Pranav had restrictions on driving two-wheeler only for six months,” she told TOI.

The Bharati Vidyapeeth police on Friday had said Pranav had donated a kidney to his mother and he was not permitted to ride two-wheelers.

Apte said Pranav’s parents and the entire family was in deep grief after the death of the all-rounder young member of the family. “He was a scholar. His fifth semester engineering exam’s results were out last week, and he had scored 80%,” she said.

She said Pranav was a good singer. He loved horse riding. “When the accident occurred on February 16, Pranav was going to see a horse show,” Apte said.

She said the grief-stricken family wanted to thank Jeevan Dighe for his efforts to take Pranav to a hospital in an autorickshaw. She sought display of phone numbers of nearby ambulance service and well-equipped hospital along major roads.

The Bharati Vidyapeeth police have launched a search for the container driver for causing Pranav’s death. Assistant sub-inspector Mohan Deshmukh said, “We are collecting CCTV footage from the establishments along the bypass to identify the route the driver took.”

Picture used for representational purpose only

TRICHY: Poor knowledge of techniques on storage and distribution is responsible for 30 to 50% of post-harvest losses in banana cultivation, said experts at a four-day international conference organized by National Research Centre for Banana here. Since India has attained the required volume of production of food grains and fruits, the focus should be on value chain management in banana to increase farmers’ income, they added.

NRCB is organizing the conference in association with Biodiversity International and Society for the Promotion of Horticulture, here to discuss the opportunities and threats faced by the banana industry and help them develop mitigating strategies. Though India is the largest producer of bananas, all of it is not consumed or exported. “Bananas should be handled with care like a child during storage and distribution. Farmers should be trained on these two techniques to minimize their post-harvest loss and increase revenue,” said K Alagusundaram, deputy director general (agriculture engineering), ICAR, New Delhi. Food Corporation of India (FCI) has been storing 74 million tonnes of foodgrains. To store this much volume, the government is spending a lot of money, he added.

Chief guest at the event Dr A K Singh, deputy director general (Horticulture Science) ICAR, said there was high demand for banana in western countries which were promoting it in schools.

BHUBANESWAR: “Air India is not making profit . The Government of India is also not making profit. Will you wind up the government because it is making losses?” asked BJP leader and Rajya Sabha member Subramanian Swamy while delivering the 18th Nalco lecture series on ‘Relevance of PSUs in shaping new India’, here on Saturday.

Swamy said Air India was making profit till 2004. “Unlike private airlines, Air India serves the country in different situations. Recently, employees of this airline bravely airlifted Indians from Wuhan in China and saved them from possible coronavirus infection. It also rescued nationals of other countries. These tasks cannot be done by private airlines,” Swamy said.

He said PSUs should move beyond profit making and focus on multi-dimensional objectives. “There are certain sectors that can be explored and developed by public sectors only. PSUs also need to be ready to compete in terms of commercial principles. Government should give freedom to the PSUs to take decisions,” he added.

He said the country should give priority to agriculture because it is the bedrock of our economy . “A public sector unit should be established to prepare good seeds for farmers and package agriculture produce for proper marketing.”

Talking about the economy, Swamy said, “Our country’s economy should grow by 10 per cent per year. Even 7 per sent GDP growth is not enough for India. We need a new outlook for development of our country.”

Talking about Odisha, the BJP leader said the Centre should help the state government resolve unemployment issues. “The Centre can set up more PSUs in the state. Research institutions should be established here. Micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) need to be set up in the state for generation of employment. Loans with lower interest rate should be given to these MSMEs,” he added.

Nagapattinam: A section of Muslims at Therizhanthur in Kuthalam taluk in Nagapattinam district have withdrew money from their savings bank account with Indian Overseas Bank, in protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

As per the decision taken by the Muslim Jamaath, the members of the jamaath who have accounts with Therizhanthur branch of the Indian Overseas Bank have withdrew their entire money from the savings bank accounts a few days ago as part of expressing their opposition to the CAA.

After the move, the bank authorities have approached the Jamaath heads and appealed to reinstate their balances as it would affect the deposit of the bank. The Jamath heads conveyed to the bank officials that their anguish was against the Act, and not against the bank. They also appealed to the bank authorities to take the issue to their superiors. One of the members of the Jamaath, Nassir Ahamed, said they withdrew their deposits to show their opposition against the Act in a democratic way. “Despite repeated appeals from the bank authorities, we are firm on our stand,” he added. Meanwhile, people at Muthupettai in Tiruvarur district continued their sit-in protest for the 9th consecutive day on Saturday.

PUNE: Schools and junior colleges in the city might be spreading awareness about traffic rules and road safety to discourage students from riding two-wheelers, but underage driving continues unabated.

Several citizens said the sight of students in school or junior college uniform riding two-wheelers was common across the city. Junior colleges are also a part of many schools.

Businessman Devendra Mehta said hundreds of two-wheelers parked outside school and junior college campuses were a clear indication that the students were riding two-wheelers without licences.

Principals of junior colleges admitted to the fact that many students rode two-wheelers in violation of the traffic rules.

Ravindrasinh Pardeshi, principal of Fergusson College, said, “After the admissions for Standard XI are through, we address the new batch of students at the beginning of the academic year. We advise them to use bicycles to commute, as using two-wheelers at their age is illegal. Also, bicycles are better for the environment. We do try to spread awareness, but it is difficult for us to cross-check how each student is commuting.”

Abasaheb Garware College principal PB Buchade said, “I believe that not many minor students of our college use two-wheelers to commute. But we do try to spread awareness about the underage driving. I remember having a conversation on this with some Pune traffic police officers in the past as well.”

While colleges were finding it difficult to track how their students were commuting, Teresa David, principal of Laxmanrao Apte Junior College, said that in many cases, the youngsters parked the two-wheelers outside the campus.

“Parking on our campus is not allowed. Many students park their vehicles outside, mostly in the nearby lanes and then walk to the campus. It is difficult to question each student walking in that how he or she reached the institute. If the students had tried to park on the campus, we could have done something about it,” she said.

David said the college authorities had informed parents and students that underage driving was illegal and students must refrain from using motorcycles.

“Many children have to travel for various coaching classes before and after college hours and parents find it convenient to provide their wards with a two-wheeler to commute. We have repeatedly told them that minors riding two-wheelers is illegal,” she said.

TRICHY: Residents of Keelakalkandar Kottai near Thiruverumbur resorted to a road blockade on Saturday condemning the Trichy Corporation’s proposal to establish a sewage treatment plant (STP) in their vicinity. They reiterated their demand to relocate the propose site stating that the sewage will pollute the groundwater and nearby agriculture land. However, as the corporation was firm on going ahead with the project at the same place, the residents said they will approach the court.

Residents resorted to the protest after the revenue department, which had promised to hold talks with them on Saturday to discuss the relocation, did not conduct it. On information, the Thiruverumbur police rushed to spot and pacified the protesters. A peace talk was subsequently held at the Thiruverumbur taluk office in the evening in which officials from the revenue department and corporation participated.

The residents expressed fears over a possible environmental impact if the STP was permitted to function. “We demanded the corporation to relocate the site to a barren land in other parts. But the officials told us that they do not have suitable site elsewhere,” J Mathivanan, a representative of Keelakalkandar Kottai residents said. As the civic body told the residents that work for the STP will go ahead at the proposed site, the residents walked out of the peace talk. “Residents must understand that the STP will not harm the environment. Proposed STP will keep the added wards of Trichy Corporation hygienic by covering the area including Thiruverumbur under sewage network,” a corporation official said.

RAJKOT: After a shocking video of primary school girl students of Upleta-based Rajmoti primary school accusing three teachers of subjecting them to castiest slur and discrimination went viral, the trio have been transferred with immediate effect.Chairman of Upleta education committee Nikul Chandravadia has ordered the shunting of the three teachers — Jignesh Sojitra, Rasila Sojitra and Laxmi — who were specifically named by the girls studying in Class IV and V of the school to be behind the caste-based atrocity.The local education committee of Upleta municipality doesn’t have the authority to transfer teachers to other districts. According to Chandarvadia, the committee investigated into the allegations and later forwarded the application recommending transfer of the three teachers to other districts as punishment postings to the Rajkot district education officer (DEO).Vijay Solanki, a local Dalit leader said, “The DEO should also start a departmental inquiry against these three teachers and take strong action like suspension.”The girl students are seen expressing their angst at being subjected to discrimination and physical torture inside the classrooms before Bala Dumiyani, a local Dalit leader, on Friday morning. They said the three teachers — Jignesh, Rasila and Laxmi — are totally biased against the girls as they belong to the ‘Harijan’ caste.From not being allowed to attend any religious feast along with the other classmates to being thrashed if anyone dared to disobey their ban, the teachers would also pointedly poke fun at these girls by asking them embarrassing questions of their food habits. “We go there to study and not to answer their questions,” one of the students was heard asserting in the video.One of the afflicted girl students was seen particularly aggrieved by the female teacher who would love to inflict corporal punishment on these girls without rhyme and reason. She would slap them first before asking the any question and resort to using the cane even for petty mistakes during games, she alleged.In Video: Gujarat: 3 teachers shunted after Dalit students allege discrimination in viral video",rajkot,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74263309,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-184437,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/three-biased-teachers-of-upleta-school-shunted-out/articleshow/74261310.cms
191,['23/02/2020'],Manipur Univ VC sacked over ‘irregularities’,"This story is from February 23, 2020

NEW DELHI: Dismissal of Adya Prasad Pandey, vice chancellor of Manipur University on Friday, made him the fourth VC to be given marching orders by the NDA government. The government has been acting tough on allegations against VCs of central universities with 10 VCs having to face action so far. In all, seven VCs have been either sacked or have resigned following inquires being set up against them by the MHRD.

President Ram Nath Kovind , who is a visitor to central universities, gave his assent to a proposal moved by the HRD ministry to remove Pandey, after a probe set up by the ministry found that there was substance in the allegations of administrative and financial “irregularities” made against him.

Pandey was appointed as VC in October 2016 and has been at loggerheads since the first year of his term with the Manipur University Students’ Union, teachers and staff unions demanding his removal over alleged administrative, financial irregularities and dereliction of duty.

Following widespread protests, the state government also requested the Centre to take note of the situation citing law and order concerns. Pandey was put under suspension and was showcaused by the inquiry committee set up to probe charges against him in July 2018.

According to HRD sources, Pandey had stayed away from the university for 189 days between October 2016 and May 2018. Despite his reply to the showcause notice, there are enough reasons for his removal, such as making purchases without inviting tenders and other financial and administrative irregularities.

Among the sacked VCs two were UPA appointees. In 2016 the then President Pranab Mukherjee had given his approval to remove Pondicherry University VC Chandra Krishnamurthy over allegations of plagiarism and misrepresentation and Visva Bharati VC Sushanta Dattagupta.

The other VCs who received marching orders were Jawahar Kaul of Hemawati Nandan Bahuguna University. Kovind accepted the resignations of Motihari ’s Mahatma Gandhi Central University VC Arvind Kumar Agarwal in November 2019, VC of Tripura University, Vijay Dharurkar , in September 2019 and Allahabad University VC, professor Rattan Lal Hangloo in January 2020.

Thol Thirumavalavan

TRICHY: Accusing the BJP government of attempting to destroy the Constitution of India to impose ‘Sanatana’ rule in India through the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), VCK chief and MP Thol Thirumavalavan has called upon the democratic forces to come together to safeguard the Constitution and religious harmony in India.

“Religious fanatics are hell bent on destabilising the Constitution and pushing the Sanatana rule under the Sangh Parivar. It is ignorance that Muslims and Dalits will only be affected but it is a threat to the country, democracy, social and religious harmony,” said Thirumavalavan at the end of the ‘Save Nation’ rally at Crawford here on Saturday evening.

Thirumavalavan said the central government should repeal the CAA and abandon the process of taking survey for National Population Register (NPR) and National Register of Citizens (NRC). Citing that NRC left 6% of the total population of Assam stateless, the VCK MP raised apprehension that around eight crore people will be rendered without citizenship if it is implemented across the country.

He also took a dig at the Centre’s plan to construct 26,658 detention camps at a cost of Rs 12 lakh crore which would account for 9% of the country’s GDP. “The government that is expressing its inability to spend on basic things such as food safety, noon meal etc is ready to spend on detention camps to keep the non-citizens caged. The Tamil Nadu and central governments should reconsider their stand and look for reviving the falling Indian economy by abandoning CAA, NRC, NPR,” said Thirumavalavan.

He also said that his party will take part in the anti-CAA rally to be organised by Prakash Ambedkar in Delhi on March 4.

Criticising both the AIADMK and BJP over the CAA issue, Thirumavalavan said, “He (EPS) is taking sides with the BJP to uphold the ethics of alliance principles and is trying to justify his wrong decision (of voting for CAA). It will give a setback not only to the BJP but also to the AIADMK.”

The three-hour long rally in which more than 20,000 VCK cadres participated, commenced at Ramachandra Nagar and ended at Crawford. The rally threw traffic out of gear in the stretch.

TRICHY: It was a self-discipline lesson of sorts for these college students as they cleaned up a government hospital here on Saturday. after being handed a novel punishment by the judiciary for rioting and clashing on the campus.

Abiding by the directive of the Madurai bench of Madras high court on February 10, a group of 28 students of Oxford Engineering College in Trichy cleaned the old obstetrics and gynaecology ward in Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital (MGMGH) from 9 am to 4 pm on Saturday.

“They have been assigned to clean the old OG building. They cleaned the windows, wall and dusts in the ward before shifting outdoor to collect the dried leaves on the campus. The students took it sportively and were happy being part of the hospital work,” MGMGH dean Dr K Vanithamani told ToI.

On completion of their assignment, the hospital administration provided them food, and later the dean took them with her for rounds in the hospital wards. The dean said that the visit to the wards made them realise the uncertainty of the lives of human.

“Showing them the accident patients in the wards, I explained to them the ordeal of the patients affected in road accident. A person healthy is bed-ridden after an accident and it is the reality of the life. So, fighting with each other is unnecessary and not the purpose of life,” the dean said.

Superintendent Dr R Yeganathan said that the students were given an hour-long counselling by a woman psychiatrist of the hospital. “The counselling was aimed to teach the values of life and what society expects from the students,” Yeganathan said.

Surprising the doctors, four of the students, J Ponnithyanandham, S Muruganandham, D Surya and N Guna, volunteered to donate blood and they did. Dean issued the certificate of appreciation to the four students for voluntary blood donation.

Residents in the wards of Tuant, Sonarbhat and Quegdovelim said that water is released once every eight days and this has affected their daily household activities.

Recently, Reis Magos residents had submitted a memorandum to PWD over the issue, and were assured that the problem will be resolved.

“Earlier we used to receive water every alternate day. However, in the past two months, it has worsened,” a local Edwin Fernandes told TOI.

Thiruvananthapuram: Vending zones that operate day and night are set become a reality before March 31, with probable spots being named in 10 days. Food trucks will function in these zones from 10pm to 5am.

The zones will offer free Wi-Fi and part-time jobs for students. The local self-government department issued a directive to the city corporation on Thursday to identify suitable spots within 10 days.

The directive was based on a Cabinet decision, last Wednesday, that cleared the proposal for night life in city centres and the pilot project in the capital city.

The corporation will allot zones for food trucks and vendors with FSSAI licence. There are proposals to provide licensing for night operations either during the weekends or on all days.

The civic body will have to consider a few factors while choosing the spots. They should have sufficient parking facilities, foot and cycle paths.

Special focus will be on implementation of the green protocol and sanitation. Police and security staff will oversee security arrangements. LED street lights and free Wi-Fi will be other requirements in these zones.

A meeting will be convened by mayor K Sreekumar comprising town planning committee, senior officials of city corporation to finalise the spots.

One of the prime objectives of implementing the project is tourism promotion. Besides, it is expected to create new employment opportunities, not just for hoteliers but also the entertainment sector and small-scale traders. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, the other day, emphasized the need to encourage part-time jobs among students and has mooted changes in the working hours of educational institutions.

Day-night vending zones will be open to students willing to take up part-time jobs, an order issued by Sarada Muraleedharan, principal secretary of the LSG department said.

It will be quite a task for the corporation to zero in on probable locations within ten days. The town planning committee has its job cut out to identify locations which fit into the criteria laid down by the LSG department.

The government plans to replicate the scheme in other cities by April.

Pregnancy unnoticed?

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

BENGALURU: A 16-year-old girl , who gave birth to a child while she was mopping the floor at her employers’ house in Bengaluru, has told investigators she was gang-raped in Odisha in early 2019. The child birth happened in November 2019.The pregnant girl, who was squatting while mopping the floor, was suddenly found in a pool of blood. She had a spontaneous delivery. The girl and her baby were then rushed to a government hospital, where they were stabilised and details of the alleged rape were revealed. The case was brought before the district Child Welfare Committee ( CWC ) and a police case was registered under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act.The girl, an illiterate, told police she was gang-raped in Odisha in early 2019 and that she arrived in Bengaluru in August 2019. She lived with her cousins, who also worked as domestic helps, in an apartment complex in south Bengaluru.CWC sent the girl and her child to an NGO and established contact with her parents in Odisha. She was reunited with her parents and she took away the newborn with her in January 2020. Committee members said the survivor not showing any pregnancy symptoms and having a spontaneous delivery was shocking.Anjali Ramanna, chairperson, CWC, told STOI the girl was stabilised along with the newborn at an NGO for over two-and-a-half months. “Her parents arrived from Odisha and were keen on taking their daughter and granddaughter home. The girl refused to give away her child for adoption and wanted to take care of her. Odisha police have registered a Pocso case and investigation is on,” Anjali said.The case was also brought to the notice of the labour department. The Bengaluru couple who had employed the teenager are also facing the music for hiring a minor, which is a violation as per Child and Adolescent Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, the CWC chairperson said.Officials who handled the case said the girl’s employers had noticed she’d gained weight, but she apparently told them she’d started eating well after working in Bengaluru. “She claimed she hardly had access to three square meals when she was in Odisha. No one knew about her pregnancy till she delivered,” an official said.According to Dr Sripada Vinekar, a city-based gynaecologist, either the girl was hiding her pregnancy or she may have been ignorant of it. “For many girls, soon after puberty, the menstrual cycle is not regular. The girl hid details about the rape. She was either ignorant about being pregnant or didn’t reveal that too. She must have experienced pain while delivering the baby,” said Dr Vinekar.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74262596,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-448329,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/gang-raped-in-odisha-minor-gives-birth-while-mopping-floor-in-bluru/articleshow/74261709.cms

The leopard that had entered the Rajkot Municipal Corporation-managed Pradyuman Park zoo

Rajkot: The leopard that had entered the Rajkot Municipal Corporation-managed Pradyuman Park zoo and killed a deer on Sunday night was captured on Friday by the forest department. It will be released in deep forest. However, the forest officials are yet not clear if the leopard was inside the zoo for the past five days or if it moved out of the zoo.

Talking to TOI, Rajkot zoo superintendent R K Hirpara said, “It is a male leopard aged 5 to 6 years. The forest department will decide where to release it.”

“We do not know about the movement of the leopard for the past five days as there is no no evidence like pug mark or droppings to prove its presence in the zoo,” he added. The leopard had entered the zoo on Sunday night after jumping the backside wall and later preyed on a deer in an open area. Forest officials believe it had come from Hingolgadh near Jasdan or from Chotila side.

The zoo authorities are also planning to take steps to prevent such incidents in the future. The zoo has 39 cameras installed inside the premises and the authorities said that more cameras will be installed to monitor movement of animals.

Forest officials said that the height of the zoo’s back wall is 12 foot. They said that leopard may have climbed a tree and then jumped inside the zoo premises. The zoo officials plan to remove the trees on the back side of the zoo and also ask PGVCL to remove the electric poll so that no other wild animals can jump inside again.

PUNE: A constable with the Pune police was dismissed from service on Friday as he failed to report to work for five years after being trapped in a graft case.

The constable was caught in a trap by state anti-corruption bureau (ACB) five years ago, following which he was suspended from work, police said, adding that after the suspension period, he was moved to Bhosari police station.

Despite his suspension period being over, he did not report to work.

Thiruvananthapuram: A day after being discharged from hospital, Vava Suresh was back to doing what he does best. On Saturday, he caught an Indian cobra from a house in Kalathara near Aruvikkara.

Suresh had been advised a few more days of rest on being discharged from the Medical College Hospital on Friday evening. Though he refrained from taking phone calls while in hospital, he couldn’t resist them once he was back home.

Over the years, his phone number has become an SOS helpline for many in the district and neighbouring areas.

Suresh suffered a snakebite in Pathanapuram while trying to catch a viper and was subsequently hospitalised. The snake bit him on the middle finger of his right hand. He was rushed to Government Medical College Hospital Kollam from where he was shifted to the MCH Thiruvananthapuram.

His condition was critical and a special medical board was formed under M S Sharmad to co-ordinate the treatment procedure.

Preliminary inspection revealed swelling on the right hand and signs of poisoning. Blood samples also confirmed the presence of poison. He was admitted to intensive care and administered anti-snake venom.

He was also placed under round-the-clock observation. Health minister K K Shylaja directed authorities to ensure free treatment.

Vijayawada: The Krishna district administration has decided to consider the objections raised by the farmers against land acquisition for the affordable housing project . The district administration, which faced criticism for acquiring assigned lands from farmers, has now decided to first convince the farmers and offer them a higher compensation.

Acquiring the required land for the affordable housing project scheme under Navaratnalu has emerged as a Herculean task for officials, who have identified around 2.71 lakh eligible beneficiaries for it. Around 80,000 beneficiaries have been identified in Vijayawada city alone.

The government decided to give one cent of land to beneficiaries in urban areas and 1.5 cents of land to beneficiaries in rural areas.

As per estimates made by the district administration, around 4,570 acres of land is required for the scheme. Revenue authorities, who started the land acquisition in November, have acquired around 2,000 acres of assigned, government, and private land till date. Further problems arose when several farmers refused to part with their land. Many among them, who till assigned land, had begun agitating with the support of Left parties.

In the wake of these protests, Krishna district collector A Mohammed Imtiaz conducted a meeting with farmers’ associations recently and announced that the government would not compel farmers to part with their land if they do not want to. The collector directed officials to first try and convince the farmers and offer them good compensation so that they voluntarily come forward to give their land.

“The government has come forward to give houses to all eligible people. We have identified land in several locations and are working hard to complete the plotting and layout exercise. We hope the farmers will be convinced and give us their lands,” Imtiaz said.

Meanwhile, farmers’ associations have raised the demand that assigned land be excluded from the land acquisition exercise.

CHENNAI: Woman employees cannot be allowed to misuse the Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, and harass someone with an ‘exaggerated or non-existent allegations’, the Madras high court has said.“Every office has to maintain a certain decorum...The administrative head or the chief has every right to extract work and he/she has his/her own discretion and prerogatives. If a woman employee is discriminated against due to her inefficiency or for any other official reasons, the recourse for her is not the one taken by this complainant,” a division bench of Justice M Sathyanarayanan and Justice R Hemalatha.Though the Act is intended to have an equal standing for women at the workplace and to have a cordial workplace in which their dignity and self-respect are protected, women employees cannot be allowed to go scot-free without completing their assignments, said the judges. Referring to the present case, the judges said: “It gives an appearance that instructing a woman employee to do something officially or even scolding a woman employee itself is sexual harassment.”Observing that a solitary allegation of intemperate language against a woman employee does not constitute an offence under the law against sexual harassment of women at workplaces, the bench quashed a Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) order against V Natarajan, deputy registrar of trademarks and GI, Chennai, saying the tribunal had erred in arriving at the decision. The case relates to a woman officer’s complaint dated December 2, 2013, to the registrar and controller general of trademarks and GI, patents and design, about the ‘high-handedness’ of Natarajan and the ‘hurt to her self-respect due to his arrogant behaviour’.The registrar constituted an internal complaints committee on sexual harassment at the workplace. Later she lodged another complaint narrating many incidents about the ‘rude behaviour’ of Natarajan. In this complaint she mentioned “sexual harassment” several times. She also wrote a complaint to the Tamil Nadu State Commission for Women saying the internal committee may not render justice.The district social welfare officer, who conducted the inquiry, found a prima facie case was made out under Section 3(2)(iii)(iv)(v) of the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013. The CAT, petitioned by the woman challenging the formation of ICC, ruled that a complaint against him can be probed only by a Local Committee. Assailing the findings, Natarajan moved the high court.The bench quashed both the orders and found several procedural violations, such as non-serving of copies to Natarajan, in the proceedings. It then went through the complaints written by the woman official to various authorities and said: “The original complaint dated December 2, 2013 was generic in nature. It elaborated upon how Natarajan was authoritative and biased in his action and decisions. This is in sharp contrast to the written complaint dated February 17, 2016. The latter, though did not mention the date and sequence of events, talked about physical advances made by Natarajan and also his lewd remarks on her physical appearance. While the original complaint does not even give an iota of what is stated in the latter, the committee concluded that there is a prima facie case. One complaint repeatedly mentions the word ‘sexual harassment’ without describing it.”The bench said: “The complainant, it appears, made a futile attempt to settle her personal score with the petitioner (Natarajan).”",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74262564,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1165484,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/extracting-work-is-not-sexual-harassment/articleshow/74261823.cms

Panaji: Through oral health programmes conducted by Goa Dental College and directorate of health services, the directorate of education (DoE) has found that the compliance of the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act (COTPA) 2003, is low by educational institutions.

As part of an outreach programme, the dental college carries out oral health check-ups across the state, while similarly, the directorate of health services sends a fully-equipped mobile van across Goa to provide dental treatment.

“During the dental camps, it was observed that there is a steady increase in the use of tobacco. It is also noted that many children and adolescents do not understand the nature of tobacco addiction and are unaware of, or underestimate, the health consequences of tobacco use,” director of education Vandana Rao said in a circular.

As per COTPA rules, management of an educational institute has to ensure that no tobacco products are sold within an area of 100 yards from the school premises. The head of institution is also authorised to collect a fine for violation of the prohibition on sale of tobacco and tobacco products within the 100 yards of the premises.

DoE has now provided schools with questionnaires to check their compliance with COTPA regulations.

“The compliance of educational institutions to COTPA Act 2003 and relevant rules remains low. Hence it becomes necessary to focus on tobacco in schools and among youth. To take corrective measures and bring about reversal/abstinence of tobacco, compliance is to be sought in adherence to COTPA,” Rao told schools.

In September 2019, DoE had reminded schools that they need to launch awareness programmes afresh against the use of tobacco and tobacco products due to new and emerging products like e-cigarettes posing a challenge. Schools were told to not allow the use of tobacco products within school premises by any teacher, staff member and school bus drivers.

It is also stated that school assemblies can be used to administer a pledge against tobacco-use and various competitions can be organised to discourage such habits.

JAIPUR: Over 20 lakh college students will have to mandatorily volunteer for social causes from the coming academic session.

Cleaning their campus or teaching slum children will fetch students’ academic credits under the state higher education department’s programme ‘Anandam’ aiming to sensitise students towards social service. The programme designed by Shuchi Sharma, secretary, higher and technical education department, is also connected with enhancing the happiness index of students.

Divulging details of the programme, she said, “The central premise of the programme is ‘joy of giving’ by involving the human resource of close to 20 lakh students studying in degree and technical colleges in both government and private colleges. These students are required to engage in a voluntary work or in a project purely made for social cause in a group of up to 30 or individually. They will earn two credits for displaying their commitment which will be reflected in their progress card.” The voluntary work may include working with NGOs, civil society groups or government campaigns like Swachh Bharat Abhiyan .

The department has made a list of voluntary works for students like helping or assisting pensioners, running computer literacy programme for underprivileged ones, helping self-help groups in maintaining accounts, plantation drives, teaching their expertise in government schools to name a few. The programme is divided into two parts — the first being the social service while the second part will be writing down their own good deeds in a notebook on a daily basis. The good deeds will be discussed on a daily basis either on an extended period tagged with every subject so every teacher must be involved in the process.

“The good deeds like feeding a poor, buying pen and pencil to one student, given lift to an elderly, giving away his/her seat to women or elderly. Every day 8-10 students will share their good deeds in the classroom without any judgement or remark by the teacher. The idea is to recognise and acknowledge the good work of and by the students to create positivity among them.

Outlining the outcome of the programme, she said, “Under this programme, students will develop a great sense of understanding towards social issues which will remain with them forever. It will also nurture a sense of civility, humility, mutual respect, admiration and make them better citizens.”

Jayant Patil

PUNE: Developers of all upcoming projects in Pune, Mumbai, Nagpur and other parts of the state will have to give a “compulsory” undertaking from this year to recycle water if they want to get their building permissions cleared or else they would be denied the occupancy certificate from their respective local authorities, state water resources minister Jayant Patil said.

With a mandate for compulsory 30% recycling of water from urban and rural bodies, industrial and agriculture departments as per the integrated state water plan, Patil directed its strict monitoring at a recent meeting in Pune held under the Maharashtra Water Resources Regulatory Authority. Last year, the state government had cleared the integrated state water plan headed by the then chief minister. The plan, readied by the department, is a voluminous 4,000-page document, which assessed the water precipitation, current usage of drinking water and commercial use and the water shortage that the state will face by 2030.

IS Chahal, principal secretary, water resources and urban development department, told TOI that it took four years to ready the data. “As per the state integrated water plan approved in June 2019, there shall be 30% recycling of water from all concerned departments, which will have to make budgetary provisions in the current budget,” he said.

“If the department heads do not adhere to these norms, they will face dire consequences and can be suspended too,” the principal secretary said, adding that the respective heads of all local bodies, either the municipal commissioner, metropolitan commissioner or collector, will have to ensure that recycling of water is executed in both new and old projects. “Over the next five years, these departments will have to show how much water they have saved,” Chahal said.

The developers’ body said there should be faster clearances for their projects and the local bodies should help them set up these recycling plants as well.

The integrated water plan assessed the state’s six main river basins -- Krishna, Bhima, Tapi, Narmada, Godavari , Konkan -- and 68 sub-basins after assessing the data of these dams for 70 years.

Currently, there are 3,256 dams in the state and additional 313 dams are being constructed. The plan includes structural, operational, watershed management and demand management measures, such as water conservation, scarcity scheduling and use of efficient technology. The plan also covers water pollution control measures and monitoring which will ensure comprehensive sustainable management of water resources and equitable distribution of water.

According to the Maharashtra Water Resources Regulatory Authority, out of the total 225 lakh hectares of cultivable land in the state, almost 40 per cent are severely drought-prone. Of the total five river basins, 55 per cent dependable yield is confined to four river basins, namely Godavari, Krishna, Tapi and Narmada.

More than 60 per cent of the rural population depend on these river basins for livelihood through agriculture. Interestingly, almost 45% of the state water resources is confined to west-flowing rivers, which are monsoon dependent, and emerge from ghats to flow into the Arabian Sea. Along with the consolidated state water plan, the government has also ensured that every plan should factor in anti-pollution measures..

NMC education officer Priti Mishrikotkar said over 3 lakh students from various schools participated in the competition. “The campaign successfully reached students and accomplished its purpose,” she said.

Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi, chairman of NMC education consultative committee Dilip Diwe, vice-chairman Pramod Tabhane, member Pramila Manthrani, DM Panchbhai from PDKV, Ram Chauhan from state’s education department, deputy education officer Umesh Rathod, Ketan Mohitkar from IT Cell and other officials were present.

216,['23/02/2020'],Sense of insecurity created among the poor: Ex-SC judge,"This story is from February 23, 2020

Vijayawada: Former judge of Supreme Court Justice Aftab Alam expressed concern over the Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAA) as it virtually lets out the Muslim population from the country. Speaking at the 10th national conference of Indian Association of Lawyers (IAL) as chief guest, Justice Alam observed that a sense of insecurity has been created among the poor because of some errors made by those who drafted the legislation. “It is the duty of the courts and advocates to protect the values of democracy,” Justice Alam said.

He said that common people feared that they might lose their citizenship because of the National Population Register (NPR) and National Register of Citizens (NRC). Justice Alam pointed out that several lakhs of names have disappeared from the citizen register in Assam. “It is an unfortunate situation where the people of this country have to prove their citizenship because of these laws,” he said.

Justice Alam further said that it is the role of the courts and lawyers to protect the civil liberties of people. He said, “We, the Indians wrote our constitution and it was very well documented by safe guarding the interests of all citizens and the courts are a place of guaranteeing such rights. If the courts failed to deliver it, it is the duty of the lawyers to step up and ensure justice is delivered to the poor people.”

The former Supreme Court judge observed that the word criticism has become an ugly word and those who criticise the government are being branded as anti-national. “People are being put behind the bars for merely criticising the government, he said.

Highlighting the present tendency of the judiciary, he observed that the law is being diluted or mediated by low level officers like police constables. “In this connection, it is the duty of the lawyers to rise to the occasion and safeguard the democratic values of the country,” Justice Alam said.

Another former judge of Supreme Court, Justice PB Sawant said that today’s citizens are facing a lawlessness situation. The present government is a ‘manuvadi’ and only promoting ‘Manu’ and ‘money’.

A judge of Andhra Pradesh high court, Justice AV Seshasai said that our constitution is compilation of Bhagavatgita, Bible and Quran. He said the courts and lawyers should strive for protecting the rights of people guaranteed under constitution.

Rajkot: A carcass of a lioness was found from Piplva village of Tulsishyam Khambha range in Gir (east) forest division on Saturday. This was the fourth lion death reported from Gir east division in past one week.

According to a forest official, the lioness was 12-14 years old and was found dead in the sanctuary area.

“The senior officials and field staff after observing the body and scanning the surroundings did not find anything suspicious,” a statement by forest department read.

Earlier, one lioness was found dead in Anida village on February 16. A lioness carcass was found in Jasadhar range a day after while another lioness death was reported in Dhari forest area on Friday. The forest department has denied any suspicious activity over the deaths.

218,['23/02/2020'],Walled City’s heritage school crumbles under government apathy,"This story is from February 23, 2020

Crumbling walls of the school premises

JAIPUR: The city might have obtained Unesco’s heritage tag, but a lot needs to be done to preserve and restore Walled City’s dilapidated structures. Government Saraswati Kund School is a testimony to the administration’s callous approach towards the city’s rich legacy.

Dampened walls, dilapidated structures, heaps of garbage, broken furniture and classrooms under a tree, greet visitors at the Saraswati Kund school, which served as a ‘kund’ (water reservoir) during the Maharaja’s reign. The school was recently upgraded to senior-secondary level, but without taking note of the building’s condition.

Over 200 enrolled students still climb down the stairs to reach their classrooms in the ‘kund’. It also has a tunnel that reaches the Nahargarh fort, but it has been closed for security reasons.

The history of the spot, however, is of little significance to the students as the structure has never been restored or renovated for many decades, sources said.

Anita Arora (name changed), a teacher at the school, said, “The ceiling is falling apart in a few classrooms. The roof is damp and due to constant fear of the roof crashing down, we teach students out in the open. The government has never paid any heed towards getting the building renovated, while it needs urgent attention.” District education officer, Ramchand Pilaniya claims that the state government will soon fix the school building.

“As the school has been upgraded, we will start the repair work under Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan (SMSA) by April. Our priority is to renovate the schools and the work will be completed soon,” Pilaniya said.

One of the reasons for the delayed response from the government is the long-pending court case with one of the neighbours, who is claiming ownership over the ‘kund’. “Does this give an excuse to the government to run away from its responsibility?” asked a parent of a student from the school.

There are just five classrooms and the government has upgraded it to higher secondary school.

“Three classrooms are already rickety, while others are so crammed up that there is hardly any space for the kids to sit. We must combine different classrooms into one. Shortage of furniture is another problem that was never paid attention to, by the state authorities, albeit the school is situated right in the middle of the market,” said a teacher on condition of anonymity.

Indore: Devi Ahilya Vishwavidyalaya’s (DAVV) Khandwa road campus has become a breeding ground for druggies and peddlers.

The lush green campus has so many isolated spots that are used by students for illicit activities like drinking and smoking even during broad daylight and due to lapses in security, even outsiders get involved.

Students who are involved in such activities find it convenient as most of the places are easily accessible to all and have no security arrangements.

Apart from cannabis (marijuana and ganja), heroin (brown sugar, hash) and cocaine are also made available for druggies by peddlers.

The situation has gone from bad to worse in terms of usage of drugs and other illicit activities on campus, said one of the senior professors of DAVV.

“Even outsiders have started doing such activities in daylight on campus, but we have stopped intervening as it depends on upbringing, society is not enforcing values and teachers are not doing their jobs properly. The situation of the hostels is even worse,” he added.

It’s easy to get weed on campus, one just needs to know the right people to get it, said one of the varsity students who on a regular basis gets the ‘stuff’ from peddlers.

While at present there are no checkpoints to restrain these activities happening on campus, vice chancellor, Dr Renu Jain plans to make stern rules to enter the campus and not permit anyone without identity card.

Though there’s a complete ban on sale of tobacco or any such products within 100m from any educational institute, there is a tapari right outside the campus that provides a variety of cigarettes to students and outsiders.

220,['23/02/2020'],Rajasthan budget gives 1% less to education sector compared to last year,"This story is from February 23, 2020

The highest budgetary allocation of 19% was made in 2009-10

JAIPUR: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot ’s first full-fledged budget has been projected as one that focused on education but the figures say otherwise.

Budgetary allocation on education sector has recorded less than 1% growth which is lowest in the last several years.

Data says that budgetary allocation of Rs 40,017.45 crore under the segment of education, sports, art and culture comes around 17.73% of the total budget for 2020-21.

The previous year allocation in the same segment was Rs 40,014.09 crore which constituted for about 18.34% of the total budget presented in 2019-20. The exact rise of budget is dismal less than 1% than the previous year. The highest budgetary allocation of 19% was made in 2009-10. The poor rise in the education budget comes in sharp contradiction with the new education policy draft which suggests to double the education budget in the next five years.

Raising concerns over the dismal budgetary allocation, Damodar Goyal, educationist says, “The rise of 0.1% budgetary allocation than the previous year will make it impossible for the state to meet the series of announcement made by them since they assumed power. How they will meet the additional cost of 50,000 teachers to be recruited, mostly this year, new schools and colleges, infrastructure, payments made against the Right to Education Act (RTE).”

State has opened 47 new colleges in the last academic year which are running in the makeshift campuses requires huge funding for its construction. Gehlot focussed his budgetary speech on seven resolutions including quality of education. Nesar Ahmed of Budget Analysis Rajasthan Centre Trust expressed that projection of slow economic growth with availability of less funds in the coming financial year will put a restriction on the government to introduce new programs and initiatives. “Even in the outgoing financial year, the state has yet to spend close to Rs 4000 crores due to different reasons, primarily being less funds from the centre and poor revenue generation from its own sources,” said Ahmed.

Forecasting the implications of the budget, KB Kothari, former policy planned UNICEF, New York says, “With this budget, the state is not likely to spend anything other than meeting the salaries of its staff in the segment—education, sports, arts and culture. Quality of education has always been a concern but I don’t see any scope for investing funds for teachers training, investing funds on developing new teaching pedagogies or

Reports say that Rajasthan spends close to 89% of its budget on salaries of its teachers, which is among the highest in the country while 2% of the grants on learning and teaching material which is among the lowest in the country.

Vijayawada: A first-year engineering (E1) student created flutters in IIIT Nuzvid after he entered the ladies’ hostel and stayed there overnight.

The incident, which took place on February 16, came to light on Saturday after a few students released the video clip of the boy in the ladies’ hostel.

Nuzvid police said, a 16-year-old boy entered a room , shared by five girls, in the ladies hostel by breaking the wire mesh on the window. The boy stayed the night in the room.

During their inspection, security personnel saw the boy in the ladies hostel. They immediately caught him and complained to the college management, who in turn informed the parents of all the students involved.

Education minister Adimulapu Suresh, who was apprised about the issue, directed officials to look into the issue and take stringent action against the people guilty of impropriety.

The IIIT management on Saturday constituted a disciplinary committee to probe the issue and is likely to conduct a counselling session for the girls.

222,['23/02/2020'],Plans in place to improve traffic flow in old city areas,"This story is from February 23, 2020

Kolhapur: The Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) is going to install traffic signals at seven chowks for better control on vehicle movement, especially in the congested old city areas.

One of the seven traffic signals will be installed at Mukt Sainik Vasahat along Shiroli entrance. The main entrance to the city from Shiroli to Dasara Chowk has traffic signals at Lishan Hotel Chowk, Tararani Chowk, Dabholkar Corner Chowk, Rajaram Maharaj Putla Chowk, Venus Corner and Dasara Chowk. All these signals along this major route have been synchronised.

The locals from Mukt Sainik Vasahat had demanded installation of traffic signal to control the rapidly moving vehicles in the residential area.

In addition to this, one of the busiest traffic junctions in the city, Dasara Chowk, will get a new signal. The signals will come up at Madhuri Bakery Chowk, near Bindu Chowk, Bagal Chowk. Shenda Park chowk will also get new signal along with Sai Mandir Chowk and Chiwa Bajaar Chowk.

KMC’s chief city engineer Netradip Sarnobat said, “The total cost of installing the new traffic signals will be around Rs 60 lakh. The signals will help reduce the traffic congestion at the junctions. At some places, the signals were there but were removed during the road construction work done a few years ago. The work of installing the traffic signals will be completed in the next three months.”

The decision to install the traffic signals has been taken after studying traffic movements during the last six months. Traffic chaos was observed not just at the junctions but all along the approach routes. The residents and traders from Lakshmipuri, Rajarampuri and Shahupuri had to face inconvenience due to repeated halting of traffic.

After installation of the traffic signals, the KMC will take up the task of synchronising the signals along Takala to Bindu Chowk road, the major road connecting old Pune-Bengaluru National Highway. The traffic approaching from eastern sides of the city, mainly visitors from Karnataka, use this route to enter the city.

“Signals will be synchronised properly. We have studied the peak hour traffic movement. The traffic is high at all times of the day. Accordingly, the signals will be synchronised so that there are very few traffic policemen on the road,” added Sarnobat.

223,['23/02/2020'],"PU’s justification on fees hike is a set of lies, says students’ council","This story is from February 23, 2020

Puducherry: Pondicherry University students' council termed the justification given by the university to hike fees for all courses as a 'set of lies’. The members of the council, who are on an indefinite strike demanding rollback of fees hike since February 6, said the university has made a desperate attempt to 'cover up the real issues by propagating false claims through media'.

The council condemned vice-chancellor Gurmeet Singh and the administration for making ‘an unethical attempt to propagate lies that the fees hike for most of the courses after 10 years was in the range between 25% and 50%’.

“The highest fees hike has been imposed on MCA, MSc/MTech (computer science) and MBA courses and the hikes are unimaginable with a 132.3%, 124% and 95% respectively. The placement opportunities in the university are comparatively limited in terms of the reputation of the employers and salary packages. The fee hike undoubtedly is not to establish or renovate the infrastructure in the university but to repair the financial crisis, which is a result of the incompetence of the administration. It is unacceptable to throw the burden of this incompetence on to the students,” the council said in a statement.

The council pooh-pooed the university claim that there was no protest on fees hike in the last 10 months and suddenly the council of 2019-20 in February this year started staging protests demanding rollback of hike in fees. The council pointed out that the vice-president and executive member of the students' council 2018-19 staged a fast in July last year urging the university to roll back the hike in fees following which the university partially rolled back the hike in fees for a few courses and constituted a grievance committee to resolve the issue.

""The students' council 2019-20 took up this constant struggle against the anti-student policies of the administration. Even though the council representatives consistently raised these issues in the grievances committee, the administration continued its reluctant attitude towards them,"" said the council.

The council also rubbished the university's claim that it has jumped 50 points in NIRF rankings. ""...the NIRF ranking of Pondicherry University has dropped from rank 11 to 54, which proves the decline in the academic quality of the varsity. From the evaluation criteria of this ranking, it is clear that the declining reputation of the university is a result if the incompetency of the administration,"" the council said. The council said it never welcomed the university's decision to offer a 20% fee reduction for students from economically weaker sections as claimed by the university.

Chennaiyin broke several Goan hearts during the 2015 final at Fatorda

PANAJI: FC Goa have been handed a massive boost to add the Indian Super League ( ISL ) title to their historic AFC Champions League group stage spot.

Goa finished their league engagements on top with their best points tally and secured a prized Asian spot. Now, the organisers have confirmed that the ISL final will be played at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda on March 14, an announcement that is likely to spur the league toppers.

“FC Goa has been the most consistent team over six years. A fantastic team, and it's such a joy to watch them. Goa deserves to host the final. There is no denying that Goa loves its football,” Nita Ambani , chairperson of Football Sports Development Ltd (FSDL), the body that organises ISL, told TOI on Friday.

Goa last hosted the ISL final in 2015, when Zico’s boys were only a few minutes away from the title. Leading 2-1, at the fag end of the match, Goa, quite unexpectedly, conceded two goals in the last three minutes as Chennaiyin FC snatched the title 3-2 from right under Goa’s boots.

Several fans, many of whom had paid five times the actual price of tickets to find a seat at Fatorda, were left in tears, while the team boycotted the prize distribution ceremony.

Things turned from bad to worse when the Margao police arrested of Chennaiyin captain Elano Blumer for an alleged assault on the FC Goa co-owner.

Since then, much has changed. Goa now have new owners and another chance to win the ISL for the first time.

Goa, however, will be aware that in five ISL editions, the champions have never won the trophy on home soil. Goa (2015), Kerala Blasters (2016) and Bengaluru FC (2018) all made it to the final and were favourites to clinch the trophy on home soil, only to be left bitterly disappointed. The two other finals have both been held at two different stadiums in Mumbai, a neutral venue.

The Super Cup champions are waiting to know their semifinal opponents and will face either Bengaluru FC or Chennaiyin FC – both of whom have defeated Goa in previous finals – who will finish fourth. While Goa defeated Chennaiyin twice this season, their only win against Bengaluru, now the defending champions, was in 2017.

Rajkot: The members of Commission Agents’ Association associated with Rajkot New Market Yard on Saturday decided to continue their indefinite strike till the police accepted their demand to withdraw cases against them.

On February 17, about 50 traders of the market yard staged a chakka jam (road block) on Rajkot-Morbi Highway and burnt tyres and when cops tried to disperse the mob, they started pelting stones on them which injured five cops. Nearly 32 of them were booked for rioting and preventing cops from performing their duty.

According to the association president, Atul Kamani, the traders at the market yard were protesting against the alleged inaction by Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC) to end menace of mosquitoes. “We have been suffering from the mosquito menace for the past five years. Hydrilla and water hyacinth in the still water of a stream that eventually flows into Aji River has become a breeding ground for mosquitoes. The dirty water of gutters in Rajkot is released into this stream,” said Kamani.

Kamani said that after several representations before the RMC failed to yield any result, they were left with no option, but to take action.

Meanwhile, the RMC has started weeding out hydrilla and water hyacinth from the stream. “Now that the RMC has begun its work to clean up the stream, we appreciate it and demand that the police drop cases against the agitating members,” said Kamani.

New Market Yard chairman D K Sakhia requested the association members to call off the strike, but the members said the strike would continue till all the police cases against them were withdrawn.

Sakhia told the reporters that a delegation of the market yard office bearers would go to Gandhinagar next week to meet chief minister Vijay Rupani to request him to withdraw the police cases against the association members.

The ongoing strike has badly affected business of traders, commission agents and farmers incurring the loss of crores of rupees.

HYDERABAD: Telangana Congress president Uttam Kumar Reddy on Saturday demanded that the state government immediately implement revised payscales for government employees, teachers and pensioners.

In a letter to CM KCR, Uttam said nearly seven lakh employees, teachers and pensioners were desperately waiting for new PRC payscales. “Teachers and employees had played a crucial role during statehood movement by risking their jobs by participating in the 42-day long Sakala Janula Samme. They expected a better future and financial growth after formation of Telangana. Neither the employees nor teachers benefited in the last six years,” Uttam said.

Stating that new PRC is due from July 2018, he said the government extending the term of PRC by another six months has caused mental agony among employees. He said corporate hospitals were denying treatment to the employees as government has not cleared dues of Rs 1,200 crore.

CHARMINAR: The All India Majlis-e-Inquilab-e-Millat on Saturday filed a police complaint against AIMIM leader Waris Pathan for ‘ hate speech ’ during a public meeting in Karnataka . Waris Pathan had said that 15 crore Muslims can dominate 100 crore Hindus.

In his complaint, joint secretary of All India Majlis-e-Inquilab-e-Millat, Rahmath Ali, said that Waris Pathan made an objectionable and inflammatory speech during a public meeting in Gulbarga district . “The hatred speech made by Waris Pathan not only hurt the sentiments of the people of a community, but may also instigate Muslim community to take law into their hands,” the complainant stated.

All India Majlis-e-Inquilab-e-Millat president Syed Taraq Quadri demanded that AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi expel Pathan from party post. Quadri said the inflammatory language used by Pathan was condemnable. “Owaisi should have stopped Pathan’s speech, but his silence on stage when Pathan was spitting venom is questionable,” he said.

Gopal Rai

NEW DELHI: Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai visited a sewage treatment plant at Delhi Gate on Saturday and said cleaning the Yamuna and eradicating water pollution in the next the five years were the government’s priorities.

Apart from air, water pollution is a major environmental issue in Delhi, a senior official said, adding that the river suffers from heavy pollution due to untreated sewage from various water sources across the city that run straight into the river.

There are around 35 STPs across Delhi, which are working on eliminating pollutants from these waterbodies using technologically advanced mechanisms. “These plants are working on purifying untreated water, generating gases that run these plants and extracting waste from water, which can be made into compost. Our focus is solely on eliminating water pollution from the city,” Rai said.

The newly-appointed minister also pointed out that the treatment of Najafgarh and Shahdara drains was under way. “These two drains contribute about 60% of the total pollution load, which is discharged into the river. Under the treatment process, Delhi government is implementing the interceptor sewer project (ISP) in six packages under which the waste water flowing in these drains will be trapped and diverted to STPs. The ISP is likely to be completed by March 31,” he said.

Rai suggested that close interaction should be held with DJB to ensure the waste water trapped in ISP get treated to meet the standards observed in the STP at Delhi Gate, which is meeting BOD level 6-8 mg/litres, less than 10 mg/litre, for which it was designed. This will help ensure establishment of good quality water treatment mechanisms across Delhi in the long-run, he added.

“Our primary focus is cleaning the Yamuna and eliminating waste from the local waterbodies across the city in the next five years. Once successful, we will work on developing the riverfront,” he said.

Earlier, the minister had chaired a high-level meeting with the officials of the environment department and Delhi Pollution Control Committee to formulate action plan to resolve environmental issues in the city. Several meetings and visits have been planned over the next few days to oversee the functioning of pollution monitoring bodies. A roundtable conference with experts will also be held at Delhi Secretariat on February 27.

The TRS govt said that no permission was given to erect the statue.

HYDERABAD: Various parties and civil society groups have decided to approach the National Commission for SCs and STs seeking action against the TRS government for removing a statue of BR Ambedkar at Panjagutta crossroads. At an all-party meeting here on Saturday, members of Congress , BJP , TDP , TJS and others unanimously decided to write a letter to the commission against the TRS government for not only removing the statue but also shifting it to the Goshamahal police station.

The members will also write a letter to chief secretary Somesh Kumar to announce within a week as to when the statue would be installated, failing which the opposition parties will hold a dharna in Hyderabad during the assembly session starting in the first week of March. It was also decided that members of various parties and civil society organisations will go to Delhi and stage a dharna when Parliament is in session.

Vijayarama Rao of BJP, M Kodandaram of TJS and L Ramana of TDP said statehood for Telangana became a reality due to Article 3 of the Constitution. “Ambedkar is the architect of the Constitution. How can his statue be shifted to a police station?” they wondered. The TRS government had earlier stated that the statue was removed as no permission had been granted for installation.

KOLKATA: KMC will roll out a single-window system for sanction of building plans for high-rises from March 1.A month ago, mayor Firhad Hakim had announced that the civic body would introduce a single-window system to spare land owners as well as developers the unnecessary hassle of multiple visits to various government and civic departments to obtain no-objection certificates from each of them to get their building plans sanctioned. The KMC top brass have decided to do away with the multiple NOCs and integrate the functioning of all the departments so that applicants can opt for the single-window system. A common application form (CAF) would be available on the KMC website, an official said, adding that if all the papers were found to be genuine, the civic body would sanction the plans within a month. Under the new system, any land owner or developer, who wants to build a house of at least 15.5m height (six stories) or on a plot not less than 550 sqm is eligible. Currently, plan for a high-rise is sanctioned not before 330 days of application.A civic buildings department official said the task of integrating software of different KMC departments, such as survey, water supply and drainage, was over and work was currently underway to integrate government departments, like fire services, land registration, KMDA, KIT and the pollution control board. The official said after the March 1 roll-out, the system would be monitored for a month to solve the teething problems that might crop up in the initial stage. “We will invite applications from land owners and real estate developers from March 1. We will observe how the system works. We may need a month to clear our doubts about the functioning of a single-window system,” an official said.But central government agencies, like BSNL and Airports Authority, are not part of the single-window system.Under the new system, the KMC buildings department will depend on architects and licensed building surveyors to deliver on time. “Primarily, architects and licensed building surveyors will be responsible for checking details of all documents, including the registered deeds. Once they clear the documents on behalf of their clients, the KMC buildings department will take over,” said a senior civic official.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74263642,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1023951,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/software-integration-boost-for-kmc-bldg-sanction-plan/articleshow/74261839.cms

US Air Force C-17 aircraft at the Jaipur airport on Saturday

JAIPUR: A US Air Force Globemaster landed here on Saturday with ground-handling equipment needed for the safe landing of US President Donald Trump in case Air Force One fails to land in Delhi because of weather issues on Monday.

Jaipur airport authorities including the Air Traffic Controller were on high alert when the US Air Force C-17 aircraft arrived at 9.30 am on Saturday. “It landed at our airport with ground-handling and other equipment required for landing of Trump’s aircraft,” said a senior officer of the Airports Authority of India (AAI), Jaipur.

According to airport sources, equipment required for the landing of Air force One, a customised Boeing 747, was not available at the Jaipur airport. “As a precautionary and standby measure, the US authorities brought the C-17 aircraft to Jaipur with the necessary equipment for the safe landing of the US president,” an officer added.

After leaving the equipment, the aircraft took off at 10.30 am. “We were not informed if the aircraft had gone to Ahmedabad or to Delhi due to security reasons,” the officer added.

Sources added that an aircraft of the US Air Force is likely to land here at 1pm on Sunday which will ferry security personnel and other staff that would be on standby mode if Trump lands in Jaipur. “Our airport has been kept as an alternative airport in case the weather in Delhi plays truant at the time when the US president’s aircraft is scheduled to land. We can’t share the finer details due to security reasons,” said Jaideep Singh Balhara, director, Jaipur airport.

237,['23/02/2020'],"Happiness curriculum: No textbooks, only pleasant thoughts on the way to imbibing skills for life","Manish Sisodia at a happiness class

NEW DELHI: Sunil Kumar Joon has been teaching English in a government school in Ghitorni in south Delhi for several years. But it is only after taking classes for the happiness curriculum for the past year and a half that he feels he has come to know his students better. He is now even acquainted with the families of many of them.Joon’s new perspective on teaching would gladden the heart of Manish Sisodia , Delhi’s deputy chief minister and the man who, as education minister, oversaw the implementation of the happiness curriculum in government schools . “The world is curious to know what we are doing in happiness class . It is essentially a curriculum to keep children’s minds focused on work and enable them to live harmoniously with family and society, while, importantly, developing a holistic outlook on life,” said Sisodia on Saturday during a visit to a government school in West Vinod Nagar.“The happiness class offers a ‘solution’ to all hate and narrow mindedness. Education is meaningless without happiness,” Sisodia added. This socially important aspect of education has piqued curiosity across the world, and US First Lady Melania Trump will be present at a happiness class during the Trumps’ tour of India.The curriculum was launched in 2018 by Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama. A committee comprising teachers from Delhi government schools, principals of District Institutes of Education and Training, NGO members and Directorate of Education officials prepared the curriculum over six months.The effort has paid off. Joon testified, “In the happiness class, everything is free and nice and the children open up and enjoy themselves.”The stories and activities prescribed are designed to “convey pleasant thoughts” to students and make them think logically and creatively. Vivek Pandit, a 10-year-old student of Class VII in the Ghitorni school, revealed, “There are no books, syllabus or homework, only activities. Before the class begins, we have a mindfulness session for some time. We sit, close our eyes and listen to the sounds around us.” This process of mindfulness is conceived to make the students aware of the atmosphere, thoughts and feelings.The stories in the curriculum are not just about happiness. The story called 'Who's the real thief?', for instance, is about how a minister punishes both a thief who steals from a rich man and the rich man himself for “stealing” from the poor and amassing disproportionate wealth. Another called 'Who will bring about change?' tells of a woman who sweeps the lanes — she may not be making a huge difference, but still earns the respect of her neighbours.The activities are meant to make the children “aware of themselves, their role in nature and the social system”. Normally, on Saturday, teachers ask the students some questions that will make them introspect over the weekend. Activities include, for example, the “My mother, my life” exercise for students of classes III-V which involves groups of them describing the work their mothers do in a day and discussing whether household work is less strenuous than other tasks or who takes up the load when the mother is unable to. Students of classes VI-VIII recall their happy moments in the “What is happiness?” module and discuss what it means to be happy.Rajesh Kumar, the chairman of the curriculum team, said they were now working on developing assessment tools to see how successful the programme has been and to address minor lacunae in the implementation. “Has there been change in the student’s heart, action and self? Behaviour analysis by teachers is important and this data has to be collected from the teachers,” said Kumar, who is also the principal of the District Institute of Teachers Education, Daryaganj.Teachers are already happy about how the curriculum has reduced truancy and given them flexibility in teaching. “Students enjoy these classes, so do we,” said a teacher at a school in Kalkaji, adding, “We are always under pressure to complete the regular subjects syllabi. The happiness curriculum is designed to give us the freedom to navigate at our own pace. Because of this we get to interact with each individual student in the class. There are many whose voices I heard for the first time during these classes.”",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74263152,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-80128,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-textbooks-only-pleasant-thoughts-on-the-way-to-imbibing-skills-for-life/articleshow/74261840.cms

Political science of the XIIth board is a scoring subject if studied in detail. It is important to clearly understand the concept of each lesson. Political science is not just a subject but a concept which joins us to our country, to our history and to our culture.

The weightage is more on three chapters — legislature, executive and judiciary. In legislature, studying about the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha and the election process can be very helpful and beneficial.

In the executive chapter, it is better to learn the duties of ministers. It is advised to learn the selection processes very well. In judiciary, studying the qualifications, appointments and tenure of the judges of high court and supreme court can act as a score-boosting point. Learning all the differences carefully can indeed be very helpful.

Application based questions should be written with one’s own views. Social movements and terrorism should be answered in brief where the most important are the writs. Taking not more than thirty minutes for objective questions and short answer type is advised. Long answers should be completed within two hours. For brief answers, do not forget to add an introduction and conclusion.

To score more marks, solve the entire paper by staying calm. Sleep well the day before the exam and eat right.

CM Ashok Gehlot

JAIPUR: In a scathing attack, chief minister Ashok Gehlot said that 22,000 houses of the Rajasthan Housing Board (RHB) remained unsold during the time of previous BJP government . However, the government continued to construct houses. Gehlot was speaking during the ceremony to unveil the statue of late Dwarkadas Purohit who was a freedom fighter and founder chairman of RHB.

The CM said, after coming to power, our government took a policy decision and gave the responsibility of selling the pre-built houses to the board officials to benefit the consumers.

Gehlot said, “We are making efforts in order to provide roof to poor, lower middle and middle class. Directions were given to the board to launch such schemes in which houses could be made available to the common man at a cheaper rate.” He also urged the banks to come forward and cooperate in this regard.

Speaking on the occasion, urban development and housing (UDH) department minister Shanti Dhariwal said the previous government had turned RHB into a defunct entity.

As RHB witnessed immense success in filling its coffers through e-auction of unsold flats, the minister praised the efforts of the officials. During the real estate slump, the RHB earned Rs 166 crore by selling 1,011 flats and houses across the state.

Criticising the previous BJP government, Dhariwal said, “The last government failed to utilise the manpower and infrastructure resources of the RHB and made it defunct. Our efforts have revived the hopes of strengthening the board and we successfully sold flats.”

BJP MLA from Sanganear constituency Ashok Lahoty who was present on the occasion also praised the chief minister for his works. He said, “Across the country, Gehlot has Gandhian and zero corruption tolerance image.”

An official said minister has assured to bring amendments in the RHB Act 1970 which will empower the Rajasthan Housing Board to remove encroachments from its land and boost infrastructure.

Meanwhile, a team from the Crime Branch will visit Tihar Jail on Sunday to interrogate Chawla. He would be quizzed to identify who all he was in touch with during the match-fixing scam. The cops would have to recreate each and every sequence narrated by Chawla since there is little technical evidence available against him, apart from the call he had made to Hansie Cronje .

Chawla has been lodged in the jail number-3. Jail sources say that Yadav too is lodged in the same jail.

In his complaint, Chawla told the jail superintendent that he had met Yadav at the corridor outside his cell last week during which Yadav introduced himself to him and later he started asking for the money. When Chawla refused, Yadav threatened to eliminate him within the jail premises.

Jail sources say that the matter has been taken up for an inquiry. The police would also be asked to conduct a probe. Chandrabhan might be shifted to another ward following the complaint, added the sources.

KOLKATA: A day after police arrested a surrogate mother, who had left in the sixth month of her pregnancy after willingly deciding to lend her womb for invitreo fertilization (IVF) for a childless couple in return for money, she claimed the foetus had died. Cops said it was not clear whether it was a miscarriage or she underwent abortion.

New Alipore police said Kashmeera Mollah from Dolarhat in South 24 Parganas claimed she “went untraced” as she was unsure of receiving the Rs 6 lakh that she claimed was promised to her. “She insisted she did not destroy the child. Rather having received only Rs 50,000 for the job, she could not take care of the child. We do not believe her. We still have not ruled out the possibility of her undergoing an illegal abortion,” said an investigator.

Police will again speak to the couple about Mollah’s claims, which they have so far rubbished. Cops have been questioning one of the doctors. “The doctor said she had merely impregnated the surrogate mother, according to established medical norms,” said an officer. The cops visited the New Alipore clinic on Saturday to question the staffers.

However, it is the claims of another surrogate mother — who is bearing the child of an Asansol-based couple — that has led cops to believe that a racket was in operation. “Mollah was in touch with this second woman, who is being cared for in Asansol. She claimed Mollah was paid much less than what she was promised and that Mollah was not a first-time surrogate,” said an officer.

“Molla is only a small player. There are at least seven others involved,” said a source. It started when a couple from Rashbehari Avenue approached the clinic for fertility treatment. The main doctor formed a board and it was decided to take help of a surrogate mother. The family spent close to Rs 6 lakh. A few months later, after they spent more money and the pregnancy was at an advanced stage, Mollah, left saying she would not be able to deliver the child.

245,['23/02/2020'],"Govt defends data bill, says it has adequate safeguards","This story is from February 23, 2020

NEW DELHI: The government has strongly defended provisions in the draft data protection bill to allow the Centre to utilise anonymous data for improving public services and exemptions to law enforcement in processing personal data under prescribed safeguards and oversight.

The contentious issues, which have been criticised by Justice Srikrishna , who headed a panel that examined data issues, are seen as reasonable requirements that go along with a detailed framework that gives individuals a consent framework and differentiates between critical and non-critical data as also compensation harmed by breach of data.

Section 35 of the draft bill, currently being examined by a joint parliamentary committee, states the central government can, in interests of security of the state, exempt any or all provisions of the proposed Act “to any agency in respect of processing personal data subject to safeguards and oversight”.

The view in the government is that the formulation balances the practical requirement of law enforcement agencies with the enabling provisions laid down by Supreme Court in its verdict holding that right to privacy is a fundamental right. The government draft differs with the Sri Krishna committee which said processing of personal data shall not be permitted unless pursuant to a law and in accordance to procedure. It also said this should be proportionate to security interests.

The provisions are likely to be subject to a lively discussion in the JPC and the government has made a case that the scale, reach and anonymity of internet platforms needs a quick law enforcement response.

The view in government is that it is possible for just about anybody to participate from anywhere in the world to post information and while this is an empowering attribute, it also provides anonymity for mischief makers to propagate hate, fake news and dangerous rumours. The bill seeks to obligate large social media entities be classified as significant data fiduciaries and provide categorisation of users.

The bill, sources said, is however conscious of the need to protect individuals and Indian interests and will look to create and promote concepts such as consent framework, purpose and storage limitation and data minimisation. They will be required to collect data required for a specific purpose with consent of the individual who will also be notified about any transfer or processing of that data.

The draft bill seeks to grant the data principal (individual) the right to obtain a summary of data and thereafter correct or even erase it. It will incorporate an individual’s right to be forgotten too. Taking note of the argument that mandatory placing of servers in India may be impractical, the bill says Centre has the right to notify “critical personal data” to be processed here.

Panaji: Indicating the disconnect between Congress MLAs and the party’s organisation leaders, several block presidents and office bearers held an urgent meeting on Saturday and demanded that the party should fight the zilla panchayat elections on party lines.

At a Congress Legislature Party (CLP) meeting, the party’s five MLAs decided that the party would not to contest the coming zilla panchayat elections on party lines. The decision has upset the party’s workers and office bearers who had already geared themselves up to fight the ZP elections.

“The BJP has played a dirty game by delaying the reservations and maybe because of that the CLP decided not to contest the elections on party lines. But to accept defeat and not to contest on the symbol, we will lose relevance in Goa,” said former MLA and Congress spokesperson Agnelo Fernandes.

State Congress vice-president Sankalp Amonkar, who chaired the meeting of the office bearers and block presidents, demanded that the party’s executive committee meeting should be convened to take a final decision. Of the party’s 20 blocks in North Goa, 16 block presidents attended the meeting.

“The executive committee should have been in the loop so that we could have discussed it. Today, with the CLP’s decision, all our Congress workers are hurt and they feel that their relevance in the party is gone,” said Amonkar.

The local Congress leadership is expected to meet on Monday or Tuesday to deliberate on the issue, which has given the party another reason to be internally divided.

The Congress office bearers are worried that if the party does not contest the ZP elections, it would cede ground to not just the BJP but other political parties too.

“It is better to be defeated knowing that you are part of the game. Not going into the fray is giving opportunity to the other people, like Aam Aadmi Party. If we don’t give (voters) an option then others will get a chance,” said Pratima Coutinho.

Animal activists’ group alleged that 10 captive elephants in Goa’s spice farms are being used illegally for en... Read More

PANAJI: People for Animals (PFA) has approached the high court with a public interest litigation against the forest department for continued use of elephants for entertainment purposes.

TOI had reported on January 12, 2020 that a couple entered their wedding venue atop an elephant .

“They have to walk on roads, face loud music, bursting of fire crackers. Hence, we decided to file the PIL so the cruelty to these gentle giants is halted,” PFA president, Norma Alvares said.

The Performing Animals (Registration) Rules, 2001 have been notified under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960. Accordingly, Section 3 prohibits the exhibition or training of any animal as a performing animal without being registered under these rules.

There are 10 captive elephants in Goa’s spice farms . The PFA alleged that all these are being illegally used for performances and entertainment purposes without any such registration.

Alok Hisarwala Gupta, who manages the elephants’ rights campaign of the Federation of the Indian Animal Protection Organisation, said that in December 2018, the forest department seized these elephants but since there is no separate elephant sanctuary here, they left them to custody of private owners. “However, the illegal commercial activities using the elephants continue even when they’ve been seized by the forest department and are in custody of the private owners,” he said.

The PIL demands that the forest department should ensure that commercial use of the elephants seized is immediately stopped. Also, to depute a large-animal veterinarian, along with a forest warden, to conduct monthly reports on the upkeep and well-being of the elephants.

“The court needs to set up a committee to plan a stable future for elephants. Goa is a progressive state, it must take the lead and end animal captivity. We want it to be the first state to be free of captive elephants,” Gupta said.

The forest department confirmed that they have received a copy of the PIL.

249,['23/02/2020'],Bid to sway courts dangerous: Prasad,"This story is from February 23, 2020

NEW DELHI: Disapproving the campaign by some people on social media to try to influence outcomes of judicial verdicts and thereafter start criticising if the judgment is not in their favour, law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said that such ""sinister trend"" needed to be curbed and judges must be left independent to decide the case as per the law.

Speaking at the International Judges' Conference, the law minister said that dissenting points of view and populism are needed in democracy and the government welcomes divergent opinions but it becomes problematic when it impinges upon well-settled constitutional principles.

Praising the Supreme Court's landmark verdict declaring right to privacy as fundamental right, the minister said that the terrorist and the corrupt have no right to privacy.

""It also becomes a problem when those who were rejected in popular mandate become the biggest flag bearers of populism....Governance must be left to those elected by people to govern and obviously they have to be accountable to Parliament and in many ways judicial decision and to the people. What is challenging is that populism is seeking to have greater accountability as to what kind of judgment should be passed. I am a great supporter of social media and freedom and I know it is empowering. But it is a dangerous trend. Judges must be left completely independent to give judgment as to what they think correct as per the rule of law,"" the law minister said

""This sinister trend is developing globally and in our country also as some people start campaigning as to what they expect and if the judgement is not as per their accord then they unleash all kind of force of criticism...Some kind of norm has to be maintained if our rule of law has to be maintained,"" he said.

Referring to the right to privacy, Prasad said that it is part of fundamental rights but terrorists and people indulging in corrupt practices cannot be allowed to shield themselves by claiming the right. He said that the government is committed to gender justice and elevation of poverty.

""The Supreme Court verdict on right to privacy is a beacon globally. It is a wonderful judgement and we are proud of it as privacy flows from Article 21, that is right to life. But the courts have also stated that the terrorist and the corrupt have no right to privacy. Right to privacy has acquired critical proportion in the wake of digital landscape expanding globally,"" the law minister said.

He said that the government is using technology as a tool for uplifting life of people below poverty line and benefits of welfare schemes are directly transferred to bank accounts.

Prasad also said that around 370 million bank accounts have been opened in which about Rs 9.2 lakh crore has been transferred and the government has saved Rs 1.7 lakh crore which was earlier taken away by middlemen.

250,['23/02/2020'],Govt rectifies amendment on open spaces in industrial estates,"This story is from February 23, 2020

Panaji: Four years after the government promised to free up vacant land in existing industrial estates, Goa Industrial Development Corporation ( GIDC ) will finally be able to allot 7.5% of the land classified as open spaces in industrial estates to industries.

The Town and Country Planning (TCP) department amended the Goa Land Development and Building Construction Regulations, 2010, on Thursday, eight months after issuing draft guidelines for the reduction in open spaces.

Amendment of rule 12.4 of the 2010 regulations allows GIDC to “re-align, revise or reduce” open spaces in existing industrial estates or industrial areas from the earlier 15% to 7.5%. Once implemented, GIDC could get access to around 3 lakh sqm of land in various industrial estates.

“The open space area that may be available to be released over and above the requirement of 7.5% of the total area shall be deemed to be zoned as industrial area,” the notified amendment states. The draft regulations were released for public suggestions on June 20 last year.

In September 2018, the Goa Regulation of Land Development and Building Construction Regulations were amended to permit reduction in open spaces to 7.5% in only new industrial estates.

“The objective of this amendment is to maximise land utilisation by freeing up open spaces. The idea of the government was to free up vacant spaces, but the way the notification came out, the legal interpretation at that time was that the reduction in open spaces would be applicable only to newly acquired industrial estates,” said chief town planner (administration) and joint secretary, TCP, James Mathew.

In 2016, then industries minister Mahadev Naik announced that open spaces in industrial estates would be reduced to 7.5% as the state faced a shortage of industrial land.

According to officials, when GIDC wrote to the TCP department to amend the Goa Regulation of Land Development and Building Construction Regulations, it failed to specify that the reduction in open spaces should be applicable to existing industrial estates. “The purpose of the notification was not served, that is why a revised amendment has been issued, which makes the reduction in open spaces applicable to existing industrial estates,” said Mathew.

251,['23/02/2020'],BJP to announce candidates for ZP polls from next week,"This story is from February 23, 2020

Panaji: The BJP will begin announcing its list of candidates for the zilla panchayat (ZP) elections from next week.

On Saturday, the party embarked on a consultation process with its MLAs and mandal core committees to finalise candidates for the polls that will be held on March 22.

Chief minister Pramod Sawant and state BJP president Sadanand Shet Tanavade along with the party’s core committee members have begun meetings to shortlist the names.

Speaking to TOI, Tanavade said they have concluded the consultation process in the ZP constituencies of Valpoi, Poriem and Dabolim.

Before the names are sent to the state election committee which is headed by the party president, the mandal core committees hold meetings in their respective constituencies to discuss probable candidates.

Tanavade said that once the names are sent to the state election committee, the party invites MLAs and other office bearers to Panaji for final discussions. He also said that if there is more than one name, then the party consults other people in the constituency to get clarity on the probable candidates.

“Once we complete the consultation process, we will announce the names of candidates from February 26 in at least in three phases,” he said.

Sources said that there is more than one aspirant in every ZP constituency and it would be challenging for the party to convince all of them not to enter the fray.

There are also some BJP workers who have made up their mind to contest the polls even if they are denied the ticket, sources said.

Reacting to the Congress legislative party’s decision not to contest ZP polls on party lines, Tanavade said that this shows that Congress is not confident of contesting the elections and has accepted defeat even before they fight the battle.

The model code of conduct for the elections came into force on Friday with the state election commission declaring the poll schedule. The elections will be held on party lines using ballot papers.

Physics is a fascinating natural science that has contributed greatly to understand the concept of technology and functions. Maharashtra board physics exam is supposed to be studied and appeared for in a calm and relaxed manner to score more and better. The question paper will have four different sections — A, B, C and D.

Section A, being divided into two separate questions with a total of 18 marks, has ten multiple choice questions and eight very short answers, including numericals. Section B comprises 12 questions, with a choice of solving any eight, of two marks each. Section C contains 12 questions, again with a choice to solve any eight, each question being of three marks each.

In the concluding section, three questions of four marks each are to be solved in which two marks carry theoretical answers and the remaining two carry solutions to a numerical.

Memorizing basic questions and mastering the concepts can act as a golden step in solving the paper. Derivations too hold a very important space in the question paper and studying all of them correctly is very important in physics.

While reading any physics problem, identifying the given piece of information is very necessary and helpful, which further helps in determination of the pathway to solution follows. Units too are very necessary and must be learnt well. All the minute details should not be avoided and must be studied well before the paper.

Take note of new words, units of physical quantities, general principles, basic equations and other concepts. This will be beneficial in following the conceptual theory. Practising equations is another important point to be noted.

K Chandrashekar Rao

SECUNDERABAD: With summer round the corner, residents of Secunderabad Cantonment are hoping that chief minister K Chandrashekar Rao ’s decision on the revision of water tariff for Cantonment areas will bring them much-needed relief.

Details of the issue were submitted to the CM by the Municipal Administration & Urban Development (MA&UD) department, a few weeks ago.

“In August 2018, we revised the tariff to improve SCB’s revenue, but faced opposition from residents. Most of them do not pay the bills due to the abnormally high charges. Presently we charge Rs 13.50 per kilo litre (KL) for domestic and commercial connections. The Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) collects Rs 7 per KL for domestic connections and a separate tariff for commercial category. We want to align our rates with the water board’s ,” SCB vice president, J Rama Krishna told TOI.

“Members of all eight civilian wars had mounted pressure on MA&UD to revise the water tariff on par with the tariff implemented by the water board in GHMC and its peripheral circles. We are awaiting CM’s nod on the matter,” Krishna said.

The inconsistency in the tariff was brought to the notice of MA&UD minister, KT Rama Rao, who assured that changes would be made. A ward member, Pandu Yadav, said that the CM’s on the matter will have an impact on the ensuing SCB polls.

Residents say the tariff must be revised on priority to help a large section of people. “Poor families cannot afford to pay the current rates. The CM must address the matter immediately,” said Vamshi, a Bowenpally resident.

Kolkata: An ardent Mohun Bagan supporter, Tinku Das , who would not miss even one match of his favourite team in spite of his disability, was found hanging from a tree on Hospital Road close to Victoria Memorial early on Saturday. He was found draped in the football club’s flag.

A double amputee , Das lived at Beltala and ran a chowmein stall. “Hastings cops on patrol spotted him hanging. He was taken to SSKM Hospital, where he was declared brought dead. No external injury was found on the body. No suicide note was found from the place of occurrence,” said an officer. Though his family wondered how a disabled person could climb up a tree, cops said the post-mortem showed it was a suicide. “He had picked up his child from school and last spoke to his wife around 7pm on Friday,” said an officer.

Supporters are the biggest strength of any football team and ones like Das are extra special. The Mohun Bagan fan was popular in the Kolkata Maidan. Being a double amputee, he used to come to the team’s matches and training sessions in a hand-cycle. Das transcend all rivalries and the news of his passing shocked the football fraternity in the city, with supporters and fans’ groups of both Mohun Bagan and East Bengal condoling his death on social media. Das used to play for a local club, Bhai Bhai Sangha, as a goalkeeper but that was cut short in 2012 after he met with a train accident.

Representative image

HYDERABAD: At least 50% of the children aged less than two years who have epilepsy do not have any clear symptoms (like abnormal movements seen in older children and adults) which makes it difficult to identify the patients.

This was pointed out in a recent study conducted by neurologists at a private hospital in the city and the researchers said that it was easy for parents to miss out the symptoms. Untreated epilepsy can impact development of the children. It was also found that 89% of the children (of the 179 children in the study) had epilepsy before they turned a year old and more male babies have epilepsy than female babies.

“The lack of any data on epilepsy in this age group prompted us to carry out the study. It was found that the symptoms were easy to miss in half of the cases. For eg. the infant staring straight for a few minutes or not responding at all. Parents need to be extra careful in monitoring infants as there was no stiffening of limbs of uncontrolled movements like in older children. Epileptic episodes in infants below 2 years lasted barely for a few minutes (less than 5 minutes). Another peculiarity seen in this age group was that these episodes (staring and no response) were repeated episodes in the same day, which is called clustering, unlike in older kids,” said Dr Ramesh Konanki, paediatric neurologist, Rainbow Hospitals and the research guide for the study.

Epilepsy accounts for half of the paediatric neurological problems. Infants affected with epilepsy often had delayed development and required hospital admission for frequent seizures. “About 56% children did not have any cause. Among others, structural and genetic causes accounted for majority of cases. Perinatal complications like asphyxia and hypoglycemic brain injury were the acquired risk factors for epilepsy in the age groups. Family history of epilepsy was present in about 20% cases,” found the study conducted by Dr Smilu Mohanlal, under guidance of pediatric neurologists Dr Lokesh Lingappa and Dr Ramesh Konanki.

By: Triveni RangarajanWhen an art lover wanted her Van Gogh copy of ‘First Steps’ to go into good hands, she posted it on Swap!, a WhatsApp group , and it was snapped up in five minutes.In at least 20,000 similar exchanges in the past three months conducted on the group’s 10 branches and with 25-30 posts every day, some 1,200 people who want to declutter and those who want to acquire are seeing the sense in exchanging household items, plants, homegrown veggies, homemade food items or items within the wardrobe.Akshay Singh, Firdosh Roowalla, Punam Dharkar and Purnima Joshi from Kalyaninagar founded Swap! in April 2019 to encourage individuals towards decluttering through donation, exchange or sale of pre-owned household items.“The spirit of giving through exchange (Swap!ping), donating or selling at nominal rates, pre-owned household items for reuse, is mutually satisfying both to the receiver and the giver,” says Singh.Joshi said she helped some Korean teacups and a tea set change hands between two persons in Kalyaninagar. “Ujjwala Gokarn, the giver, was going minimalistic and was grateful that the objects she had bought in all her travels were finding a place with people who would cherish them equally,” she added.The group’s philosophy is based on reuse, reduce and recycle for sustainable living. It involves new families that need household stuff, old families that want to give away theirs, community volunteers looking for good bargains, and others looking to buy pre-owned stuff. In the process, individuals make connections, share ideas, and special skills.Kalyaninagar resident 11-year-old Vihaan got Rs 450 after selling his toys, books and puzzles on the platform. A woman exchanged fresh ‘papdi’ beans for an image of Mahalaxmi, another swapped Snapchat caps for some ajwain cuttings. A second year student acquired a violin posted for three months’ use on the group and joined music classes.When a post about a laptop to be given away surfaced, Gauri Shinde, a cook, sought it for her 12-year-old son. Sachin Holkar, another member, reformatted the laptop and installed a basic software and handed it over to the boy.Prathamesh Katkar from Baramati wanted an old UPS for his computer and got it through a donation from Sarbjit Singh.At first, the founders brought items from home and traded them for other items within the community. Yard sales were organized in restaurants, garages, temple premises, and community centres. People discovered friends among their neighbours, got recipes and swapped ideas. More joined the quartet and a group of curators was formed.Dharkar and Singh monitor all the posts closely to ensure that the group's guidelines and philosophy are followed. Roowala watches out for the objective of the group while Joshi encourages people to share interactions as Swap! Soul Stories.The administrators disallow posts related to pets, vehicles, business posts and forwards. There can be no posts seeking funds even for NGOs, no promotion of NGOs except requests that help with decluttering homes. Requests for old clothes, newspapers, bedsheets, and mattresses can be posted, said Singh.Members have to fill the details of the items in a format and be honest about repairs the items would need. “Sometimes, people miss out on the suggestion to serve the first person to respond which has led to a few disappointments,” Singh said.The administrators said members are also vigilant and state their displeasure over wayward posts, Joshi added. A request to delete an unwanted post goes out quickly.According to Dharkar, a probable threat is from copycats, where the philosophy and guidelines of Swap! may be followed unscrupulously.Roowala agrees that an open source chat platform cannot have specific guards against duping. “But, we appeal to the goodness of people to keep the interactions honest and come across as people who are in service to others as the group is about building close-knit local communities,” he adds.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74264775,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-555838,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/spark-joy-with-outer-order-and-inner-calm/articleshow/74261865.cms

Manpur police registered a case of murder against unidentified person and investigation is on in the case.

Mhow SDO (police) Vinod Sharma told TOI that Ravi was a truck driver and was living with wife Kavita alias Jwala and two children in this house but she along with the children had reportedly gone to her aunt’s house, when the incident happened.

A still from ‘Kharvas’, one of the films to be screened at the festival

Nagpur: Cinema reflects society. Watching a film on the big screen stimulates a rush of myriad emotions. In a time when the issue of gender equality is becoming increasingly relevant, a film festival exclusively showcasing movies on the theme will be held for the first time in the city.

‘Sambhav, A Travelling Film Festival on Gender Diversity’ is an initiative by Men Against Violence and Abuse (MAVA), wherein films based on gender equality and wider spectra will be screened from March 2-3.

“(MAVA) has pioneered efforts in India to engage youth, boys and men to address issues of gender equality by interrogating the existing dominant masculinity.There will be an array of extraordinary films, which will address various issues,” said Harish Sadani, organizer of the film festival and a member of MAVA.

The film festival will host movies from a bunch of renowned filmmakers.

Dishant Soni has directed the film ‘Wave’, which highlights the bystanders in gender-biased violence on women. “The film narrates the story of a young girl who is inhumanly ignored by society while facing sexual assault amid a heavy traffic jam,” Soni said.

Mitali Trivedi from Delhi has directed the film ‘Please mind the gap’, which narrates the story of a transgender who is continuously reminded by the society that they fall nowhere between the spectrum of man and woman. “This story will touch hearts of many. The title of the documentary will remind people about Delhi Metro, as that’s where the story originated,” said Trivedi.

Lalita Krishna, who has directed a documentary titled ‘Untying the Knot’, said, “My film chronicles the life of a domestic violence survivor. Citizens will surely enjoy such sensitive films, as they showcase the reality of society.”

Aditya Jambhale’s national award-winning film ‘Kharvas’ will also be screened at the two-day fest. “ Kharvas narrates the pain and trauma of a mother who gives birth to a stillborn child. It's for the first time that my films will be screened in Nagpur. It is in Marathi and has already been screened in other parts of the state,” said Jambhale.

Vibha Bakshi’s ‘Son Rise’ offers a glimpse into the patriarchy-ridden society of Haryana, and also won the national award recently. “This film is about ordinary men from the interiors of Haryana, who are actually fighting for equality and women’s rights. We shot this movie over two years and in 45 villages,” said Bakshi.

For filmmaker Rinchin from Bhopal, it is very exciting as the citizens of Nagpur would see her film about three women, and their story of love and humanity for the first time. “I am looking forward to the film festival. I hope the audience will take away some good thoughts from the film. My film talks about the love and human relations between three ladies,” said Rinchin.

Indore: BJP city wing on Saturday protested against divisional commissioner’s ‘dictatorial’ decision of dropping ‘around 200 resolutions’ passed by outgoing council and alleged that since taking charge as IMC’s administrator, the official has disrespected elected public representatives and public. The official in charge has cited limited budget for giving priority to ongoing works only.

“Corporators of both major political parties — BJP and Congress — had proposed different works of development in their respective wards, which were passed by the council. Cancelling over 200 of these proposals without examination shows ‘dictatorship’ of the administrator, who has been appointed by state government after completion of council’s tenure,” BJP city president Gopikrishna Nema said.

He added that such a decision had happened in history and it is clear disrespect to public representatives and people of the city. “I am requesting administrator to keep his ‘assertiveness’ aside and reconsider the said works in public interest,” Nema said.

Tripathi said IMC has limited budget and thus, important and ongoing works should be given priority. “Seeing financial condition of the civic body, we have decided to first complete ongoing works before starting new projects. The works, which have not been started yet, will be taken up based on its importance in next budget,” IMC’s administrator told TOI. He added that planning is important to ensure that all works, which are meant to serve the public, is completed in set deadline to meet the purpose.

Panaji: The efforts put in by the Carnival screening committee, to ensure that good quality floats are on display at the parade, seem to have borne fruit. Many revellers called Saturday’s float parade in the state capital a good experience and reflective of the floats of the 90s.

“I am happy with this year’s float parade. It was a good experience with many of the floats reflective of the quality that used to be showcased in the 90s. The Carnival is one of the oldest forms of live entertainment for people of Goa which makes it necessary for the floats to be of great quality,” said Mumbai resident Lionel Gonsalves.

The parade was flagged off with King Momo proclaiming his decree of fun and merriment. Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant participated in the float parade along with South Goa Congress MP Francisco Sardinha and Panaji mayor Uday Madkaikar.

Keeping with the theme of traditions, the festival saw tableaux depicting a Goan Catholic wedding, a traditional brass band, preparation of Goan masalas and Sao João festivities. Traditional trades such as carpentry, farming, masonry, weaving, coconut tree climbing, fishing, pottery and making of Ganesha idols were also on display.

The Sports Authority of Goa promoted the upcoming 36th National Games Goa 2020 with a tableau displaying the various sports and athletics activities that will be held at the event.

And while culture ruled, raging environmental issues such as protection of marine life and aquatic animals and the hazards of plastic pollution on marine life also found adequate display.

Some floats highlighted social concerns such as the importance of following traffic and the perils of alcoholism. Breaking gender stereotypes, one float had participants dressed like members of the transgender community.

“I got to know just a day prior that Carnival parade showcases different Goan traditions. All states should replicate this so that people can visually learn more about their own culture, while also being entertained,” said Delhi-based Pawandeep Singh.

Indore: A man barged into a girls’ hostel at Bhanwarkuan and beat up a student after an argument broke out between the neighbours and hostellers regarding the latter’s behaviour in public.

The incident took place barely three months after the residents of the locality staged a series of protests alleging that students residing in hostels near the university campus had been creating nuisance in the area and behaving in an objectionable manner.

On Friday night, the argument blew out of proportion as the residents and hostellers exchanged heated words. A video of the incident was being circulated on social media, a day later. A man was seen barging through the hostel gate and beating up a girl, who was objecting the allegations against her and her hostel mates.

The 23-year-old complainant, who is pursuing MBA from a college in Indore, told police that a man in the neighbourhood, backed by other residents, barged into the hostel hurling abuses before trying to smother her. He grabbed her hair and pushed her to the ground before kicking her, the complaint said.

“We have arrested the accused and booked him for trespassing, thrashing the girls and stalking,” Bhanwarkuan police station in charge Sanjay Shukla said. The neighbours were objecting to a girl of the hostel standing on the road with her male friend before the argument broke out, he said.

The residents’ association had earlier raised an objection to a large number of unregulated hostels coming up in the area around the Devi Ahilya Vishwavidyalaya’s Takshshila campus on Khandwa Road.

Association president Parvinder Singh Bhatia, who had started a campaign said, “The hostellers have been creating a lot of nuisance in the area which is affecting the residents here. They stand in front of our houses in an objectionable way and when asked not to do so, they misbehave with us.”

But he was against the accused using violence against the girls. “He should not have thrashed the girl, he could have spoken to her parents about it,” he said.

The association members believe that the hostels should develop waiting lounges where the girls can meet their friends instead of standing on the roadside or in front of the houses of the residents. “A model code of conduct should be prepared and police officials should hold talks with the hostel authorities and ask them to make students follow it compulsorily,” he told TOI.

HYDERABAD: After the Telangana high court came down heavily on the Telangana State Board of Intermediate Education (TSBIE) for allowing colleges to function without fire NOCs, the special chief secretary of education, Chitra Ramachandran on Saturday said that no college will be granted affiliation without submitting the fire NOC from the academic year 2020-21.

In a meeting with the managements of private colleges, Ramachandran said that the fire NOC is mandatory to issue affiliation and directed the colleges to shift to a new building and produce a NOC. She said that the fine to be levied against erring colleges will be decided after the court delivers its verdict.

“No college will be allowed to function from a building which is not compliant with the fire department rules,” said Ramachandran.

TSBIE officials said that college managements were briefed about the high court orders and were informed that the list of colleges who failed to submit a NOC during the last academic year was submitted to the court.

“It was submitted that several colleges failed to produce the fire NOC and instead submitted an affidavit saying that they will shift to another building by next year. But they failed to shift to new premises and continued functioning from the same building,” read a release issued by the TSBIE.

They informed the managements that the court issued an order to initiate action against the erring colleges and submit a report by February 25. They also asked the managements to find a way to comply with court orders.

“Submission of fire NOC is a mandatory condition for grant of affiliation to colleges. It is important in the light of the Supreme Court’s guidelines with respect to fire safety. Colleges cannot put the lives of children at risk,” said Syed Omer Jaleel, secretary, TSBIE.

The representatives of college managements have assured that they will follow the board’s instructions and orders of the high court. They, however, requested the board to give them time until the end of the intermediate exams to comply with the rules.

For the academic year 2019-20, 79 colleges were not granted affiliation for want of fire NOC. Out of these, 44 colleges went ahead and admitted students.

Hyderabad: Colleges failing to offer focused-courses on emerging technologies encouraged online platforms that emerged as an alternate for many students seeking employment in areas such as artificial intelligence , machine learning, data sciences among others.

In Hyderabad, apart from Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad (IIT-H) that has 20 seats in a full-fledged BTech course in AI, there are only 84 seats in two colleges affiliated to Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Hyderabad (JNTUH) that offer a dedicated BTech in AI.

“Colleges have still not made the shift to adopt courses in emerging technologies since they are grappling with an acute demand-supply mismatch. Under such circumstances, we provide online courses that are curated by faculty members from top universities from across the world,” said Raghav Gupta, managing director, India and APAC, Coursera, a US-based online learning platform, that is all set to collaborate with private colleges in Telangana to offer digital courses.

Similar courses are also offered by other online learning firms such as TalentSprint, which offers six months programmes in AI, internet of things, blockchain, quantum computing and other emerging technologies. “The programmes offered by TalentSprint in association with the Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad, are designed for college students who are keen to build expertise in AI and other emerging technologies,” said BS Murthy, director of IIT-H.

In order to increase the number of seats in emerging technologies, the JNTUH is all set to grant affiliation to colleges in four new bachelor programmes i.e. BTech in AI, computer science and information technology, computer science and business systems and information technology and engineering from the academic year 2020-21.

Mohali: Two gangsters wanted for murders, extortion, carjacking, and bank robberies in Punjab, Haryana, and Himachal Pradesh were caught here on Saturday with a cache of arms and ammunition, besides heroin.

Arun Kumar ‘Mani’ of Una in Himachal Pradesh was arrested first and then this disclosure led police to his aide, Sandeep Kumar ‘Mundi’ of Garhshankar near Hoshiarpur. Superintendent of police (SP) Harmandeep Singh Hans said: “Their arrest has solved seven cases of murder, extortion, and carjacking reported in Mohali, Hoshiarpur, Yamunagar, Una, and Phagwara.

Deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Bikramjit Singh Brar said: “Police have seized 110-gram heroin, a .30-bore pistol with 5 live cartridges, a .315-bore pistol with 10 live cartridges, and a .12-bore country-made pistol with 2 live cartridges from the duo, besides recovering a Hyundai Accent car and two mobile phones.”

The seven cases police claim to have solved are Vishal’s murder in Una, house robbery in Una, aiding a prisoner’s escape in Una, a Yamunanagar robbery, carjacking in Mohali, a murder in Garshankar, and an Arms Act violation in Phagwara.

Superintendent of police Hans said the crime investigation agency (CIA) of Kharar had arrested Arun from Mohali’s Phase I on a secret input from a drug runner. He carried a pistol.

The Mohali police secured his custody and, on the basis of his disclosure statement, seized another pistol with ammunition.

Hans said: “Arun also told us he was part of Ravi Balachauria’s gang and partnered him in shooting Vishal Kumar of Una. Sandeep had tracked Vishal’s movements for Arun and Ravi. Ravi was caught in Gujarat two days ago and we plan to bring him over to Mohali on production warrant.”

274,['23/02/2020'],Chandigarh municipal corporation fund crunch hits road re-carpeting work,"This story is from February 23, 2020

Friday’s rains have spoiled the hope of an early re-carpeting of roads

CHANDIGARH: The engineering department of the Chandigarh municipal corporation is struggling to kick off the road re-carpeting work, as bills of road contractors amounting to over Rs 2 crore are lying pending with the civic body for the re-carpeting work they did in the past.

What is making things difficult for the corporation is the small number of contractors available for the road re-carpeting work. As a result, the road contractors, who had worked for the civic body earlier and whose payments have not been released due to financial constraints, have bagged the tenders again. Now, they are putting pressure on the civic body to release the previous payments, before they start work on the new contracts.

According to information, the road contractors met senior officers of the municipal corporation recently in this regard, and citing their bad financial condition, they requested for an early release of the pending money, so that they could start new works. The officers concerned are believed to have assured them of an early release of the money and asked them to initiate the newly allotted works as soon as possible.

Currently, the corporation has allotted road re-carpeting works worth over Rs 50 crore. Work on these roads have been pending since the last financial year, and those are envisaged to be completed by next month.

“Since the road re-carpeting was not done in 2018-2019 and 2019-2020, first these pending works will be done and then the new estimates will be prepared. We have been talking to the contractors, assuring them to make their payments very soon, so that the pending works can be started soon. Since we have just three to four road contractors for the re-carpeting works, we have to take works from them only,” said a senior officer in the engineering department of the civic body.

When asked, one of the road contractors, who has bagged contract this time round, said, “Only if the corporation keeps releasing money on regular basis, we will be able to do the works without break. Since we have to arrange labour and give salaries to them regularly and also arrange raw materials and related things, we need payments at regular intervals.”

276,['23/02/2020'],Nagpur: Another sandalwood tree stolen from NMC garden,"This story is from February 23, 2020

This is the fourth such incident which hints at a gang's involvement

NAGPUR: In fourth such incident within seven months, unidentified persons entered, cut and decamped with sandalwood tree from the Nagpur Municipal Corporation ’s (NMC) garden.

The incident took place at NMC’s Shivaji Nagar Garden, which is situated in middle of residential buildings. Though responsible to conserve all trees across the city, the civic body is unable to protect trees, especially sandalwood which is high-risk tree, on its own premises.

Deputy municipal commissioner (garden) Amol Chorpagar told TOI that it seems a gang is involved behind all the incidents. “NMC has appointed security guards at all its garden. There was a security guard inside the garden when the sandalwood tree was cut and taken away at 3.15am on Saturday.”

“In his statement, the guard said he heard noise of tree felling and ran towards it. He saw three persons running towards the compound wall on Ravi Nagar square side. He said they climbed the wall and fled. It seems a gang, probably from South India, is involved in all the cases as it is very difficult to identify a sandalwood tree. Also, it needs daring to cut it inside the gardens,” he said.

There were five sandalwood trees inside Shivaji Nagar garden of which four are situated in one area near the sewage treatment plant while the other is behind the bamboo library, which was was stolen. By the shape of the leftover trunk, it is clear that the miscreants used machine to chop it.

Chorpagar said show cause notice has been issued to agency — Super Security — asking why its contract should not be terminated and cost of sandalwood tree not be recovered. “The NMC will terminate the contract and engage an efficient private agency,” he said.

Chorpagar also said a survey will be conducted to count and label all sandalwood trees situated in NMC-run gardens. “We are planning to fence sandalwood trees so that it cannot be cut by machines,” he said.

The team from NMC’s garden department led by garden inspector Ananta Nagmote conducted panchnama and registered a complaint at Ambazari police station.

The tree was around 20ft high and its trunk was 2ft in diameter. There were some cables over the tree which came down after it’ felling. It takes time and also make noise when a tree is cut using a machine.

On July 28 last year, two sandalwood trees were stolen from Ambazari garden where too security guards were present. In this case, the NMC had terminated the contract of Unity Security Private Ltd and replaced it with MESCO.

Two more sandalwood trees were chopped down and taken away on August 9 and 10 last year from the garden situated inside NMC’s head office at Civil Lines despite the presence of two security guards of MESCO.

In the first three cases, the NMC’s garden department had recovered compensation of Rs25,000 per tree from security agencies. In these cases, Ambazari and Sadar police stations are yet to identify and arrest the culprits.

DCP Vinita Sahu did not respond to TOI’s call and message.

Green activist Jaydeep Das said four such incidents raise a big question on NMC as well as police. “The NMC has no control over the trees across the city. But it should at least secure sandalwood and other high-risky trees. Sandalwood trees are guarded with 10ft-high tree guards in forest areas but nothing is being done in the city,” he said.

“Many green areas in the city have sandalwood trees. Police too are to be blamed as the incidents could not have increased had they taken stringent action. A committee should be constituted immediately to identify sandalwood trees across the city, count and label them for security purpose,” he added.

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

KOLKATA: A professor of anatomy at NRS Medical College and Hospital , Abhijit Bhakta, was on Saturday accused of inappropriate behaviour by second-year nursing students, who lodged a complaint with the principal, seeking action against him.According to the complaint, one of the second-year BSc students was walking towards her hostel on Thursday afternoon, when Bhakta’s car stopped in front of her. Bhakta allegedly asked her uncomfortable questions, including about her vital statistics, before forcing her to get into his car. She was taken to a tailor to take measurement for a dress, apparently at the behest of someone the doctor knew, said the complaint, which stated three clinical tutors had witnessed Bhakta talking to the victim before making her board the car. Bhakta allegedly shooed away the three tutors. The victim, on returning to the hostel, narrated her ordeal to her friends, following which they collectively decided to lodge a complaint, raising questions about their security and dignity.“This is an absolutely fabricated story to malign my image and a conspiracy by people with vested interest to remove me from my position,” Bhakta told TOI.According to sources, Bhakta holds a powerful position in the Trinamool-backed Progressive Doctors’ Association (PDA) and is known to be close to party leader Nirmal Majhi, who was recently replaced by Santanu Sen as the chairman of Rogi Kalyan Samity at NRS. A section of doctors feels the allegation against Bhakta might have to do with the recent change in the dynamics at the hospital. “This professor flaunts his political links and not many in the medical fraternity like his attitude. But right now, two lobbies on the NRS campus are at loggerheads. It is possible that some people are trying to implicate him to clip his wings,” said a PDA insider. Sources at the hospital also said Bhakta was very vocal against the killing of 16 puppies on the campus in January last year, in which some nursing students were accused.“The principal has learnt about the complaint. Since he was not in office on Saturday, he should receive the formal complaint by Monday and decide on what the authorities would do about it,” said a senior NRS Hospital official.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74261880,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-246611,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/nrs-nursing-students-accuse-prof-of-harassment/articleshow/74261880.cms
278,['23/02/2020'],"With arterial DB Marg off limits, traffic backs up on internal stretches","This story is from February 23, 2020

Traffic jams were witnessed in the city much before the parade began

PANAJI: This year’s Carnival festivities in the state capital seem to have ticked all the right boxes where the quality of floats was concerned, but failed miserably in terms of traffic management.

A diversion created due to single-laning of roads resulted in a serpentine queue of vehicles seeking to enter the city from Patto to Mala and from the old Patto bridge. Several motorists complained of having been stuck in the jam for over an hour.

Also, the cordoning off of a large part of the arterial Dayanand Bandodkar Marg for the parade led to heavy traffic movement on internal routes like Atmaram Borkar Road and 18th June Road.

After being flagged off from the Santa Monica jetty, the floats occupied one lane on D B Marg while the other was used by people attending the festival. This lane also served as a passage of emergency vehicles. However, after the parade culminated at Kala Academy, the floats switched lanes and halted on the road leading to Miramar. Several revellers subsequently began huddling around some of the tableaux for selfies, creating trouble for motorists who were forced to manoeuvre their vehicles through a sea of traffic.

North Goa additional collector Gopal Parsekar said traffic congestion in the city began only towards the end of the parade. “This was bound to happen because everyone began leaving for home. We will be better prepared next year,” he said.

The Panaji police and traffic cell of the Goa police had given their nod to the route following a meeting with the North Goa collector, Corporation of the City of Panaji and the mayor on Thursday.

The previous two years saw the Carnival parade being held on Jack Sequeira road in Miramar.

279,['23/02/2020'],Over 8 lakh MSEDCL meters declared faulty,"This story is from February 23, 2020

Nagpur: Even as finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman wants to replace all existing electricity meters with smart meters, MSEDCL is unable to get bids for them since the last two years.

It had installed radio frequency (RF) meters, a less advanced type of smart meter, but lakhs of them have become faulty and had to be replaced. The cost of these meters was Rs124 crore and it will be recovered from hapless consumers by way of higher power tariff

A source in MSEDCL said that the discom had purchased and installed about 26 lakh RF meters in last two years. “These meters belonged to HPL, Genius, Rolex and Flash companies. Of these, 8.27 lakh meters of Flash and Rolex companies have become faulty and have been replaced,” he added.

“From 2018 onwards, we started receiving large number of complaints from consumers that these meters were either slow or fast. We checked these meters and found that the complaints were genuine. As a result, we decided to replace them. We have blacklisted Flash and Rolex,” he further said.

The official said that if central government went in for replacement of all existing meters by smart ones, all the discoms may face a similar problem. “There are limited suppliers of smart meters in the country and quality of many of them is not up to the mark. This is the reason why we have not been able to find smart meter suppliers since the last two years. The government should first encourage manufacture of smart meters in the country and then think about replacement,” he added.

“The storage area was a tin shed that was used to store thinners, spirit etc. We are unsure as to what caused the fire. It could be due to short circuit,” said station fire officer, Mohan Rao.

Three fire tenders were used to douse the fire over a period of three hours. According to officials, items were stored carelessly in the shed. “We used water and foam to douse the fire. The flames were high and most of the items were gutted in the accident,” added the official.

281,['23/02/2020'],Govt wants MIDC to supply power directly to industries,"This story is from February 23, 2020

Nagpur: Industries minister Subhash Desai wants to reduce the power tariff of industries in the state as it is much higher as compared to those from the neighbouring states. He recently held a meeting of top officials of industries and energy departments to chalk out a plan to achieve this objective.

A source in MSEDCL said that Desai wanted that Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) should provide cheaper power to industries located in its estates.

“Desai told us that the state’s industrial tariff was between 25% and 35% higher than that of states like Gujarat and Karnataka. Industrial associations in the state had urged him to reduce it so that they get a level playing field,” he further said.

The minister directed the officials to prepare a detailed report on industrial power tariffs in various states, power supply quality problems in the state and steps required to solve them.

The officials suggested that MIDC should become a distribution licensee and buy and sell power directly. It can also go in for solar power plants. Desai asked the officials to include these suggestions in the report.

The source said that MIDC could become a licensee on the lines of the Maharashtra Airport Development Company (MADC). “The company is the licensee in Mihan and its power tariff for industries and commercial enterprises is far lower than that of MSEDCL,” he added.

MADC buys power from private players and sells it to Mihan units. As it is a separate distribution licensee, its consumers do not have to cross subsidize farmers and lower end domestic consumers. Consequently, the tariff is far lower than that of MIDCs.

The previous BJP-Shiv Sena government had reduced the power tariff for industries in Vidarbha, Marathwada and North Maharashtra. This was however, done through budgetary subsidy. The government pays about Rs1,000 crore to MSEDCL annually to supply power to industries in these regions at a lower rate.

The source said that as MSEDCL’s industrial tariff has increased every year this concession to industries has not made much of an impact. “If industries in the state are to survive, they will have to freed off the burden of cross subsidizing farmers,” he added.

He said that the country is ""rapidly encouraging"" participation of women in all walks of life and enrolement of girls now outnumbered boys in educational institutions. ""India is among the few nations of the world which have ensured the right to vote for women since independence. Today, after 70 years of independence, the participation of women in elections is at its highest level ever. Now India of 21st century is rapidly encouraging such participation in other walks of life too.

For the first time in India, the enrolment of girls in educational institutions is more than boys. This is on account of successful programmes such as Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao,"" he said.

""Similarly, the government has brought about many changes, whether it be appointment of women in military service or in the selection process of fighter pilots or regarding their freedom to work in the mines at night.

Colva: South Goa collector Ajit Roy on Saturday permitted Margao’s Carnival float parade to be held along the Opinion Poll road, in Fatorda, on Sunday. This comes after the high court of Bombay at Goa restrained the collector and other state authorities from entertaining applications from the Margao Carnival committee for finalisation of a route contrary to the one approved by the Margao Municipal Council (MMC)

The Carnival committee had allegedly sought to hold the parade on the traditional route from Holy Spirit Church to the MMC building via Hospicio. The Margao council, on the other hand, had unanimously approved the route from the old market circle to Lake Plaza at Fatorda.

After a series of meetings, Roy said the parade would be held from the district and sessions court to the Fatorda junction via Ravindra Bhavan. The traffic cell said the entire stretch from the old market circle to Fatorda junction would be closed for all types of vehicles on Sunday. It also said that vehicles from Ponda and Raia would be diverted via the eastern bypass towards Margao.

Meanwhile, 12 MMC councillors lodged a complaint with the collector against chairperson Pooja Naik, alleging fabrication of a resolution regarding the parade. They said that while they had proposed that the floats travel on the traditional route, the resolution placed before the high court by the MMC stated that the parade be held along Opinion Poll road. They sought an FIR against Naik for falsely creating a backdated resolution. Roy said he hadn’t got any communication from the councillors.

285,['23/02/2020'],Heritage church adds to Kasba Peth’s diversity,"This story is from February 23, 2020

The original structure is untouched. The church's members collected Rs 1.25 crore for the renovations

Kasba Peth, according to written history and archaeological evidence, is one of the three tiny hamlets where Pune was born. It is also the place where the city finds its heart beating, in the vibrant Ganeshotsav, in the lanes of tradesmen, Shaniwarwda, wadas, old temples and mosques, with history and geography merging and mixing.

Yet another gem of diversity is nestled in a tiny bylane of Kasba Peth , a gothic-style church that stands tall with its 350-strong membership.

“Some members of the Christ Church in Rasta Peth moved out in 1962 and started visiting different churches while scouting for a new space. The Scottish Mission handed over the structure to us in 1967 and since then, the structure at Pavle Chowk is Brother Deshpande Memorial Church,” Raju Christy , a member, said.

The church was named in the memory of Ramchandra Prahlad Deshpande who spent his life spreading Christianity and serving those in need. “As per records that I could trace, Deshpande was at Christ Church between 1927 and 1947. He worked hard for the welfare of the downtrodden. His sermons were interesting and people looked forward to listening to him. Londe had spent time with him and was mentored by him at Christ Church. Thus, when the Church membership split and we found this structure, Londe named it after Deshpande,” Christy added.

According to Ravindra Gaikwad , caretaker of the church since seven years, Deshpande, who hailed from a village near Nagpur, moved to Pune in 1917.

“He came from a staunch Brahmin family and met a lot of opposition when he embraced Christianity. Deshpande had an in-depth study of the Bible, which made him change faith. He moved to Pune and devoted his life for Christianity and social service. He died in 1949, many years before this structure was even converted into a church,” Gaikwad said.

When the structure was first acquired, a school named St Peter’s School – affiliated to the Zilla Parishad, was run on the premises in the morning while sermons and services were held in the evenings.

“The school was shut down over a decade ago and the premises have been converted into a full-time church. We also have a hall and sufficient outdoor space which we provide for weddings in the families of our members,” Gaikwad explained.

According to him, the Brother Deshpande Memorial Church was also once the place of worship for the Korean expatriate community. “The members of the Korean community living in Pune used the Church for worship as well. They even ran a Sunday school for children from their community over here. However, they stopped coming to this church about 5 to 6 years ago as they dispersed to different localities in the city,” Gaikwad said.

The church is a Grade II heritage structure by the Pune Municipal Corporation. “We undertook large-scale renovations at the church in 2018, during which the roofing and interiors were changed and the entire place was polished. We had to seek permission to undertake renovations since this is a heritage structure. The original structure is untouched. We spent almost Rs 1.25 crore on the renovations, collected from our members,” Christy said.

From the outside and inside, the church looks like any other, with wooden pews on either sides of the aisle. Stacks of the Bible, printed in Marathi, are neatly lined up on a window sill to the right side of the Church.

However, inside the church sits another astonishing artefact which is as old as the Church – a black piano resembling a large harmonium with its peculiar lid and carvings on the rear. According to Gaikwad, the piano is still used during Mass and prayers. “Some snags had developed with the pedal of the piano but we got it repaired recently,” he said.

According to Christy, almost none of the members of the church live in Kasba Peth. “ They live in different parts of the city- Katraj, Wadgaon Sheri , Rasta Peth and many others. The distance has never deterred our members from attending the church every Sunday morning. Since inception, the local residents have been welcoming and supportive of the church and our members,” he said.

Gaikwad said the church is carrying forward the work done by Deshpande. “We help anyone who comes knocking on our door. Be it providing food or monetary help, the church has been trying to help those in need. Youths, who have run away from home, have sought support and we do whatever we can to help them,” Gaikwad said.

Mohammed Azmathullah Shareef

HYDERABAD: A 37-year-old man from Hyderabad has gone missing in Dubai and his family in Jahanuma has no clue about his whereabouts. The worried family has sought the help of the ministry of external affairs (MEA) to trace Mohammed Azmathullah Shareef , who last spoke with them a year ago.

Jabeen told STOI that they had tried to find out her brother’s whereabouts through a friend in Dubai but without success. “The last time Azmathullah had called up home was on February 1, 2019, to enquire about his father’s health,” she recalled. He had gone to Dubai 10 years ago in search of a job. Azmathullah is reportedly working in a construction company.

But, it remains a mystery as to why the family has waited all this while though the last contact with Azmathullah was made a year ago.

Jabeen said they are not in a position to understand as to how he could have gone missing. “My father had met with an accident last year and has been bedridden for nearly 10 months. We could not pursue with the authorities about my missing brother,” Jabeen said. She said she could not hazard a guess as to what would have happened to Azmathullah.

The worried family has written to external affairs minister S Jaishankar and the Consulate General of India in Dubai to help trace Azmathullah. In the letter, father Mohammed Asadullah Shareef said both he and his wife are ailing and urged the authorities to find their only son.

Jabeen said they are five sisters and Azmathullah is their only brother. He discontinued his degree course and went to Dubai in 2010. He came to Hyderabad only once during August-October 2014 in the last 10 years. “He was in touch with us. But, the call he made on February 1, 2019, was his last,” she said.

KOLKATA: Milk supply in parts of the city and adjoining areas continued to remain affected on Saturday with Mother Dairy struggling to restore normalcy. Areas in Salt Lake , Kestopur, Newtown, Paikpara, Dum Dum Road remained dry. A few areas in Howrah were also affected.

“We are trying to restore supply using our own fleet of vans. But that is yet to compensate the shortage created after some distributors failed to supply milk,” a Mother Dairy official said.

Dairy officials tried to plug the gaps where distributors turned non-cooperative. “We are hopeful that the situation will be brought under control in the next few days. But we may face fresh troubles during the lean season for milk that begins in April-May,” an official said.

The state-run dairy, which supplies mainly to Kolkata and adjoining areas, has around 250 outlets. Earlier this month, some of the distributors had sent a 10-point charter of demands to Mother Dairy chief general manager Susmita Mukherjee.

The dairy, which has so far been running independently and generating its own financial resources, was also hit hard after raw milk suppliers demanded more money. Distributors have also demanded enhanced incentives while many of them are yet to clear arrears to the dairy.

Nagpur: Despite a court order the Bhim Army meet did not appear to be mere gathering of its rank and file. Standing a few metres from Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh’s (RSS) main centre touching the Reshimbagh grounds, Chandrashekar Azad Ravan, founder of Dalit outfit Bhim Army, called for a ban on pro-Hindutva fountainhead. He also challenged RSS Sarsanghchalak (chief) Mohan Bhagwat to an open debate on reservations.

Bhim Army had got high court’s permission to hold a meeting at Reshimbagh grounds on the condition that it would only be a workers’ meet. The court had directed the meet should not turn into a public protest and not be used for political purposes. Bhim Army had moved the court challenging the police denial of permission to hold rally at Reshimbagh ground citing law and order reasons.

Addressing a crowd of over 10,000, Azad also gave a Bharat Bandh call for Sunday against the recent supreme court ruling on reservations and warned the ruling party to beware that the regime may change soon. Muslims attended the meet in large numbers and speakers made direct reference to being with anti NRC-CAA struggle of the community. “A Bahujan government may soon come and the BJP will pay for its deeds,” said Azad.

There have been attempts to include other communities like Dalits, Marathas and OBCs into the movement that has largely got a response from Muslims in the city so far.

“The police had refused permission to hold the meeting at Reshimbagh on the grounds that it would lead at to a clash of two ideologies. Yes, the ideologies differ. They believe in Manusmruti and we believe in Indian constitution,” Azad said pointing towards RSS building in the background.

“The country is run by the constitution and not Manuwad (reference to right wing ideology). Manuwad would only end after RSS is banned,” he said.

“It is an open secret that the BJP is run by RSS. That is why the prime minister comes down here and briefs Mohan Bhagwat with folded hands,” he said.

Also targeting the MVA government, he said it was in state government’s hands to reject the NRC and NPR. “If the Maharashtra government is indeed concerned about the masses, we request it to reject the law. Else, we may exercise our right to protest against state government too,” he said.

“Bhagwat keeps saying reservation needs a review. I challenge him for a debate over the it right here from Nagpur. They want to see the figures, I have the figures for last thousands of years of persecution,” he said.

Azad put up a demand for reservations on the basis of population of backward communities. “Let that happen and we’ll see who achieves on the basis of merit and who gets it due to hard work,” he said.

“We want Samata (equality) not Samarasta (harmony),” said Azad. Samrasta is a word often used by Bhagwat in his speeches to stress on oneness in the country.

Challenging the RSS to directly fight elections instead of having BJP as a front, Azad claimed it was the Bhim Army that would finally hoist the tricolor at Reshimbagh.

Meanwhile a little distance away at Sakkardara Chowk, over 1,000 gathered at a pro-CAA meet organized by a RSS leaning organization Lok Jagruti Morcha.

289,['23/02/2020'],Kolkata: Water lost during supply in city enough to cater to 15 lakh people,"Open taps are major trigger for wastage of water in the city

KOLKATA: Augmenting water supply will not be enough to meet the city’s requirement unless effective measures are taken to curb wastage, mayor Firhad Hakim said on Saturday. As much as 30% of the city’s water supplied by the Kolkata Municipal Corporation , enough to serve 15 lakh people, is wasted daily.During a talk-to-mayor session on Saturday, a senior citizen from Behala raised the issue of water wastage. He lamented that while KMC was trying to supply potable water to areas where people faced acute water crisis, sheer waste of filtered water was making the mission difficult. The caller identified himself as a well-wisher of the civic body and advised the mayor to intervene so that the water wastage could be minimized.Mayor Firhad Hakim acknowledged the issue and conceded that at least 30% of potable water is wasted every day across 144 KMC wards. “Thank you for raising such an important issue. We shall definitely try to take effective steps so that colossal waste of filtered water is minimized,” Hakim said. The mayor later asked senior officials to conduct a survey on the wastage of water and plug the holes by taking effective measures.According an official, the volume of wasted water is a matter of concern for the civic engineers. “It can be as high as 30% of the total production or even more. We have not measured the loss systematically,” he said. A year ago, the KMC — with help from Asian Development Bank — started a water-loss management programme under Kolkata Environment Improvement & Infrastructure Project (KEIIP) for areas such as Dum Dum, Cossipore, Belgachhia and Paikpara. According to a preliminary report, the water loss in the areas was as high as 50%-60%. “We supply filtered water for at least 16 hours to residents of these areas. Naturally, a majority of the water goes to the drain,” the official said.The KMC is now planning measures to prevent wastage of filtered water. The matter was discussed after mayor instructed the water supply department officials to ensure that loss of water was made minimum.“There are two ways to prevent water loss in the city — fix a ball cork in the water reservoirs of the households which acts as a cistern and prevents water loss and install water meters at the households, which will make the property owners more accountable,” another official said.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74262562,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-723093,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/water-lost-during-supply-in-city-enough-to-cater-to-15l-people/articleshow/74261886.cms

The re-examination was carried out after TOI reported the drop in immunization coverage this year pointed out in the Lok Sabha. However, with the new findings, Telangana has gone from being the second worst in terms of immunization coverage in the country to being in the top ten states.

The immunization section of the ministry, issued an office memorandum to the effect stating that the mistake on part of the government was on account of ‘clerical error’. “It has been found that in the annexure I to the answer for question, the figure of full immunization coverage for 2019-20 Tamil Nadu and Telangana has been inadvertently mentioned as 148.71% and 54.20% respectively due to clerical error. On re-examination, the figures of full immunization coverage for the states of Tamil Nadu and Telangana were 84.95% and 94.89% respectively,” read the office memorandum.

Nagpur: The Nagpur University (NU) has refused to place before the senate the information regarding appointment of private agencies, expenses incurred on registrar post advertisements, data on results and revaluation claims in the last five years during the upcoming meeting on March 6.

Senate member Sarita Nimbarte had forwarded a list of nine questions regarding the above issues in her letter to the NU on February 6.

Replying to Nimbarte on February 20, the NU administration categorically refused to place the information on record citing “confidentiality, disruption to general administration, doubtful and unspecified” as reasons as per common statutes issued by higher and technical education department last year. The questions were rejected by vice-chancellor SP Kane.

The NU had been reluctant to part with information on the pretext of similar reasons even under the Right to Information (RTI) Act. In many cases, the RTI applicants dragged it to state information commission before the NU was ordered to provided information.

Nimbarte said the issues she is trying to raise can’t be called confidential in nature but only attempts to fix accountability and bring “misdoings” in public. She categorized her queries into three parts on invovlement of private firm Promarc in NU functioning, NU’s failure in appointing a full-time registrar despite spending on advertisements, selection process and examinations.

The first three questions on private companies, if any, and Promarc don’t suggest any breach of confidentiality as she restricted them to knowing names of the NU departments where they were appointed. Regarding Promarc, she asked how many works have been assigned to the private agency while the NU has never disclosed its dealings with it.

She also sought the copy of MoU, if any, signed with Promarc. The agency has occupied a big space at the NU exam section. The last question in this category is whether any space has been allotted to Promarc.

On registrar’s appointment, Nimbarte raised questions which are likely to bring to fore the NU’s expenses incurred and the status of the recruitment process even as it is unable to take the process further.

The queries on exam, she said, should ideally have been available on the website but for reasons best known to NU officials, these were kept “confidential”.

“This is nothing but an arbitrary administration in-charge of a public institution. If not these, then which questions should we ask? The university must answer these questions but they say don’t ask questions which will pose problems for the vice-chancellor and Promarc. Why should we not ask questions concerning students and public at large? Is there anything bigger than Kohchade scam which the university is trying to hide?” asked Nimbarte.

Kane didn’t answer to TOI’s calls.

HYDERABAD: After considering the request of conjoined twins Veena and Vani, the Telangana education department has decided to allow them to appear for the secondary school certificate (SSC) (class 10) examination separately.

Initially, officials were not sure whether to consider the girls as one or two individuals given that they are joined at the head. Medically, however, it is well established that conjoined twins are two separate individuals who are born physically attached.

B Venkata Narasamma, district education officer of Hyderabad, said that they will be issued separate hall tickets and provided with scribes, if needed, to assist them in writing the examination. “In November 2019, we had written to the state government for its direction on Veena and Vani’s case,” said Narasamma, adding that the decision, however, was made finally at the district level itself.

“The twins were keen on appearing for the examination separately. So, we have decided to go ahead and issue two separate hall tickets,” she said. The hall tickets will be issued in the first week of March.

However, district child welfare officer K Jhansi, who is taking care of the conjoined twins, said that they were yet to receive any communication from the education department. “We did not receive any information on whether the twins will be issued one or two hall tickets,” said Jhansi.

The conjoined twins, who are children of M Murali and Nagalakshmi from Mahabubabad district , spent a major part of their lives at Niloufer Hospital. At the age of 12, the 2003-born twins, were shifted to a state home in the city.

The education department has deputed teachers at the state home to prepare Veena and Vani for the SSC examinations.

Nagpur: Municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe has used the platform of social media to justify his stand on the controversy between him and office bearers on the Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s (NMC) financial condition. He found support in many of his followers.

Adopting a system of expenditure only at par with the revenue, Mundhe had stopped execution of new works approved by office bearers citing huge financial liability on the civic body. Mundhe’s decision irked leaders of the BJP-led ruling party in the NMC.

During the NMC general body meeting on February 20, corporators from all political parties had demanded execution of all works approved by the standing committee. Mundhe had justified his decision giving figures of revenue and liability in the house. Mayor Sandip Joshi had directed Mundhe to withdraw his decision and start execution of all approved works.

On the following day, on February 21, Mundhe tweeted, “The Urban Development trajectory must follow sustainable approach, focusing on Resilience. Sound and sustainable approach for achieving the developmental aspirations of citizens is sine qua non. The vision and mission has to work in tandem, not otherwise, finances being core of it (sic).”

Mundhe posted reports of two newspapers along with his statement in the tweet. One of the two media reports highlighted how Mundhe is facing the ire for controlling unnecessary expenditure while the other supported him by saying the new works aren’t possible as the NMC has liability of Rs800 crore.

BJP city president Pravin Datke said that the office bearers have anything against Mundhe and that they intend to work with proper coordination for the city’s development. “We work for public. So, we will not keep silent if works meant for providing civic amenities to people are stopped. We hope Mundhe will resume all approved works. I have never witnessed such a situation in the NMC, despite the BJP being in power here. We appreciated Mundhe when he started execution of policy framed by the general body for removing encroachments. We expect that Mundhe will comply with all the resolutions passed in general body as they are all meant for welfare of the city,” he said.

HYDERABAD: The Telangana government, on Saturday, announced the launch of an action plan to rehabilitate all beggars in Hyderabad as part of a national campaign rolled out by the Union ministry of social justice and empowerment. The first phase of the drive will be simultaneously flagged off in 10 cities including Mumbai, New Delhi, Kolkata, Bengaluru among others, said officials.As a first step towards implementing the National Campaign for Comprehensive Rehabilitation of People involved in Begging, the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) will identify the beggars, create a database and subsequently roll out a rehabilitation plan. As per rough estimates, the city has around 4,000 to 5,000 beggars.“The Government of India (GOI) will provide Rs 10 crore for the project,” said R Subramanyam, secretary, department of social justice and empowerment while urging the officials and stakeholders to prepare plan that can been implemented from April.A similar rehabilitation programme for beggars was taken up in 2017, ahead Ivanka Trump’s visit to Hyderabad for the Global Economic Summit. During the initiative, GHMC and police officials had randomly picked up beggars from the city and shifted them to GHMC shelter homes. Sources said they were released after two or three months.“In 2017, around 1,000 beggars were shifted to my ashram. We counselled them for two months and sent them back. Beggars were also shifted to Anand Ashram in Chanchalguda Central Prison but it did not yield any result,” said Gattu Shankar, founder of the Amma Nanna Anada Ashramam, Choutuppal.This year GHMC claims that project will ensure sustainable livelihood to every beggar identified as part of the drive. Stakeholders in the project claimed that action plan will include skill development programmes for these people. “Types of skill development programmes that will be taken up by civic body can only be rolled out based on the needs of beggars and their health condition. Survey and identification of beggars, setting up of shelter homes, health care facilities, education to children and skill development training will be taken up,” said a GHMC official.Reiterating this, Radhika Chakravarthy, joint secretary, department of social justice & empowerment said: “Specialised activities shall be taken up for physically handicapped, senior citizens, women and children involved in begging,” while MAUD principal secretary Arvind Kumar urged various stakeholders to suggest viable economic options to be taken up for uplifting the persons involved in begging.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74262860,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-242223,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/state-launches-drive-to-rehabilitate-beggars/articleshow/74261460.cms

The school has given memorandum to state home minister Anil Deshmukh highlighting the problem faced by girls

NAGPUR: To deal with the menace of molestation by both footpath vendors and anti-socials gathered there, students of Tata Parsi Girls High School decided to resort to Gandhigiri as their last option.

Accompanied by faculty and members of a social organization named Center for Education of Human Rights Research and Advocacy (CEHRRA), the girls, on Saturday morning, were ‘armed’ with roses and placards to deter encroachers who set up a chor bazaar (flea market) on the pavement and the mischief makers who gather there.

However, with considerable police presence and advance notice of the planned event, all the street vendors decided to abstain from setting up shop on Saturday.

Shanoor Mirza, principal of Tata Parsi Girls High School, said, “The vendors opposite the school pose a security problem for our girls. Lewd comments are passed. Many times, people standing there stare at these kids which is an horrible ordeal. When the school’s managing trustee Thrity Patel was informed about this predicament, she decided to deal with it head on.”

Through CEHRRA, of which she is also the president, Patel planned a Gandhi-style awareness campaign to apprise all stakeholders of the ordeal the young school girls were facing.

Patel said, “Gandhigiri was the only thing we could do as all other options had been exhausted. We had complained to the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and they took action against vendors but within a few days it was all back to square one. Same thing with the cops. Though the police always responds to us, the moment they go, the nuisance makers are back.”

She added that there have been instances where the anti-social elements have moved beyond molestation. “We have been informed about cases where these girls have been inappropriately touched. This is sickening and we are praying that authorities now take some strong action,” said Patel.

Around a hundred students, along with secretary of CEHRRA, Reuben Ray, held placards with “Don’t Stare at us”, “Beti Bacchao Beti Padaao” etc written on them. The school management has also gave a memorandum to the state home minister Anil Deshmukh highlighting the problems faced by the girls. TOI tried reaching out to city police commissioner BK Upadhyay for a statement, but he did not respond to calls.

NAGPUR: A watchman in his 60s was found murdered in a seated position on a chair with grievous injuries on his head outside a steel factory at Chikhli on Saturday morning. A hard and blunt stick with blood smeared on it was found near the body.

Kalamna police said that the victim, identified as Namdeo Bawane, was likely murdered between 1am and 1.30am when the power supply was snapped. Cops could spot some indistinct movements by a suspect in the CCTV footages, but the power disruption deprived them of the complete chain of events.

The motive behind the murder is not clear but police have ruled out robbery or theft as one of the possible reasons. Zonal DCP Neelotpal said hard-core goons avoid committing crimes at places having buildings on either side with CCTV cameras and guards deployed around.

The suspect after killing Bawane is seen pulling down the scarf wrapped around the victim’s head to cover his face. The body remained on the chair with face covered, giving an impression to onlookers that the man must be sleeping.

Another guard, who is posted nearby, had come to warm his hands in the fire lit in front of Bawane in the early hours of the day. He too did not realize that there was a dead man on the chair.

The murder came to light after some passers-by, who were baffled on seeing the blood smeared stick beside the motionless man, tried to wake him up.

Sources in the locality said that Bawane was staying with his widowed daughter at Gulshan Nagar for the last three months. The suspect captured in the CCTV footage had been coming to meet Bawane for the last couple of days, they said.

One of the guards with Bawane had even asked the suspect about his whereabouts and reasons behind his visits. Bawane had then stated that the suspect was perturbed over his family matters and was coming there to share his problems with them.

Kalamna police, who have registered a murder case, are trying to trace the suspect on the basis of human intelligence and CCTV footage. In the CCTV footage, the suspect is seen approaching Bawane, like he did in the last couple of days, at around 11pm and remained with him till the murder.

NEW DELHI: Hitting out at opposition Congress over its scepticism about US President Donald Trump ’s visit to India, BJP on Saturday asked the rival party why it was unhappy when the country’s stature is being raised globally.

Addressing the media here at the BJP headquarters, party spokesperson Sambit Patra said Trump’s visit will be a landmark moment in terms of Indo-US relationship and advised Congress to “start taking pride in the nation’s achievements”. “This is a meeting of the world’s largest and oldest democracies and it should be celebrated,” he said.

Underlining that Trump himself has said multiple times that India is a hard bargainer, Patra said Congress should not be worried about India’s interests.

With PM Modi ’s hard work, India’s relations with other countries have further strengthened from Sochi to Mallapuram, he added.

JAIPUR: Eighteen students of a government school at Kesarpura in Ajmer district were admitted to JLN Hospital on Saturday with complaints of nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting and stomach cramps after having milk , which was served as part of the midday meal.

Though the health department claimed that all the kids, aged between 4 and 11 years, were stable, the headmaster and midday meal in-charge of the school were suspended.

The incident took place at Arjun Pura Khalsa School where the students were given milk soon after classes began at 10am and aloo sabzi and roti (potato curry with chapatti) at lunch.

Sources said two students complained of stomach ache soon after having milk. When more children came up with similar complaints, the school administration immediately informed health department officials, who rushed them to the hospital in ambulances.

A few children, who were admitted to the hospital initially, said they felt stomach cramps soon after consuming milk. But, cases of vomiting and stomach ache kept pouring in even after children reached their homes around 4.30pm.

District collector Vishwa Mohan Sharma, who visited the hospital, said all the children were stable. “We have asked the education department to take disciplinary action,” Sharma said.

Acting on Sharma’s order, district education officer Devi Singh Kacchawa suspended two school staff. “Action has been taken against headmaster Khoob Chand Maghani and midday meal in-charge Meena Sharma,” Kacchawa said.

Teams of the district administration and the health department are camping in the village and monitoring the health of the children. “Eighty kids who had midday meal are under observation. If more kids complain of nausea and vomiting, they will be immediately provided treatment,” said Ajmer chief medical health officer Dr KK Soni.

The health department’s food safety officers have collected samples of milk, aloo sabzi and chapatti for laboratory test.

HYDERABAD: Days after University of Hyderabad ( UoH ) fined three students for organising Shaheen Bagh night, the student union demanded that fine be revoked. They said that the students will not bow down to autocratic and undemocratic administration and assured that they will take every possible step to safeguard democratic interests of students. “The student union would like to assure the student community that these intimidation by administration will not be successful in suppressing the voice of dissent and protest on the varsity campus,” read the statement issued by the student council.

Abhishek Nandan, president of student union, UoH, said they have sent the statement to registrar and dean of student welfare. “If the varsity fails to revoke the fine, we would stage a protest in front of the admin block,” said Nandan, adding that an arbitrary circular barring events and protests within specific time and venue decided by administration is not acceptable and shall not be followed.

Meanwhile, varsity spokesperson Vinod Pavarala said they have not received any representation from students. He added that UoH acknowledges the right of recognised student bodies to organise meetings and protests in designated spaces and in a manner that is not disruptive of academic and administrative activities and residential life of teaching and non-teaching staff on the campus.

KOLHAPUR: The activists of Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) held demonstrations against Congress MLA Praniti Shinde in Solapur , demanding an apology from her for her recent remarks.

VBA workers have threatened to intensify their agitation if Shinde did not tender an apology and withdraw her statement.

Shinde, a three-time MLA from Solapur, had three days ago, asked where the ‘blood of Ambedkar’ was when the country was fighting against Citizenship Amendment Act. Praniti had made the remark while addressing party workers.

While Shinde did not specifically name VBA chief and Dr B R Ambedkar’s grandson Prakash Ambedkar, VBA activists gathered at Hutatma chowk on Friday and held demonstrations.

VBA leader Anand Chandanshive criticized Shinde and said she did not have any right to speak about Ambedkar, he said.

Shinde’s criticism assumes significance as her father and former Union home minister Sushilkumar Shinde lost the Lok Sabha election from Solapur against BJP candidate in the presence of a VBA candidate, who received significant votes.

Praniti also won the assembly election with a narrow margin because of presence of VBA candidate in the fray.

Citizens were afraid of shifting of Khed-Shivapur toll plaza somewhere in the Satara district

KOLHAPUR: Taking a cue from Khed-Shivapur agitation against toll plaza in Pune district, the residents of Satara district will be taking out a march to Aanewadi toll plaza on Sunday to exclude them from toll collection.

While no official organisation has come forward to bring together the citizens, a message has become viral on social media, asking the people to gather at Aanewadi toll plaza on Sunday morning. Two months ago, the Satara citizens had held a similar agitation against bad roads of Mumbai-Bengaluru national highway in the same fashion.

The message read, “Citizens of Satara district must be excluded from toll collection at Aanewadi like Khed Shivapur in Pune district. People living in Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad, and district, are excluded from toll collection at Khed Shivapur after they launched an agitation on February 16.”

The message further read that the Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad was 30 km and 50 km away from Khed-Shivapur, respectively while Aanewadi toll plaza was only 17 km away from the Satara city limits. “The government cannot discriminate among the citizens over the issue and Satara people must be free from toll at Aanewadi.”

In December, a group of citizens, led by Shivendrarje Bhosale, had met transport minister Nitin Gadkari , on the poor condition of roads and delay by the contractor to execute the work. They discussed the issue of exempting Satara citizens from the toll.

Citizens were afraid of shifting of Khed-Shivapur toll plaza somewhere in the Satara district. A delegation of people from Khandala taluka recently met Makrand Patil MLA and submitted him a memorandum to stop the possible move. Patil promised that he would not allow it to happen. The delegation pointed out that the district has al two plazas and third would hamper the growth of the area.

File photo of Hyderabad CP Anjani Kumar

HYDERABAD: Amid continuing anti-CAA protests across the country, Hyderabad commissioner of police Anjani Kumar said Shaheen Bagh-type protests will not be allowed in the city.

In response to a query as to why no case has been registered in the wake of reports that some persons are planning to organise a Shaheen Bagh-kind of sit-in, Anjani Kumar said: “Nothing like Shaheen Bagh will be allowed in Hyderabad.”

At a press conference here on Saturday, he said: ``In Hyderabad there is no Shaheen Bagh kind of protest. Hyderabad is best city in India and Hyderabad will further improve. Do not compare Hyderabad with places where all these negative things are happening. We take pride in Hyderabad. Nothing like Shaheen Bagh will be allowed. Impossible.”

He also said that no one had approached him for permission to hold a Shaheen Bagh-kind of protest till now.

He said political protests are important but law and order is more important. He clarified that Hyderabad police are not against granting permissions to those who approach them in a proper manner and whose protests do not affect others. “There are some important areas, grounds and public places in the city where we had never denied permission. If there is a denial, there is a reason.”

Anjani Kumar pointed out that more than 200 anti-CAA protests and rallies had been organised in Hyderabad. “There have been burning of vehicles, firing and people sitting for a month on dharnas in other places. But in Hyderabad, such things are not happening. We are more concerned about safety, security and comfort of common public,” he said.

The CP said some persons with vested interests had gone to court. “Court guidelines are supreme and we are imposing conditions as per the court guidelines. On Friday, two protests were allowed at Seven Tombs and Chandrayangutta,” he explained.

Anjani Kumar, however, warned that the city police would take legal action if the common public is put to inconvenience, especially those obstructing traffic movement. “In public places, sitting and causing traffic problems is not good. People who are in emergency will be affected. There is every chance of anti-social elements trying to take advantage of the situation to create a problem. That is why protesters can apply permission legally and we will definitely give permission. Our objective is not to deny permission but to facilitate protests through a proper procedure,’’ the CP added.

The SUV was pulled out from the water on Saturday afternoon

HYDERABAD: Days after three bodies of a TRS MLA’s family members were discovered in a canal in Karimnagar after they had gone missing for three weeks, bodies of three persons, including that of a village sarpanch’s husband, were fished out from a lake in Yadadri-Bhuvanagiri district on Saturday, several hours after they had gone missing.

Police said an SUV driven at a high speed went off the road and fell in the lake on the outskirts of Yellanki village in Ramannapet mandal , 68 km from Hyderabad. The trio was in the SUV when it plunged into the waters. Police said the SUV was not visible from the road surface as it fell deep into the lakebed.

It was when the cops were searching on the village outskirts, they chanced upon the SUV’s tyre skid marks. The deceased were identified based on their last call location. The SUV was pulled out from the water on Saturday afternoon.

The accident occurred at around 4 pm on Friday.

The deceased have been identified as Darne Madhu (38), husband of D Rani, sarpanch of Seerinigudem village, their 10-year-old son D Manikantha and car driver Sridhar Reddy. Police said the mishap occurred when the victims were on their way back home. Ironically, Sridhar ventured into the water to wash the SUV at 11 am.

“The SUV was driven in a rash and negligent manner. As a result, Sridhar lost control. Even though the accident occurred on Friday, no villager saw the car plunging into the lake,” DCP, Bhuvanagiri, K Narayana Reddy said.

Rani filed a missing complaint when her husband and son did not return home. “The SUV’s skid marks were found near the lake and we sspotted the vehicle in the lakebed at a depth of one ft from the surface water level. All the three were inside the car when it was taken out of the lake,” the DCP said.

Police also recovered their cellphones. The bodies were handed over to the family after an autopsy. The case was altered from a missing case to section 304-A (causing death by negligence) of the IPC.

AHMEDABAD: Those arrested for illegally booking and selling railway tickets were fined Rs 5 ,000 and made to sit in the courtroom for a day.

In the last couple of months, at least six such agents were fined with Rs 5,000 each for their illegal acts. One of them was Vipin Kurmi, who was arrested on August 24, 2019 and the Railway Protection Force (RPF) lodged a complaint against him under Section 143 of the Railways Act. He was booked after a preliminary inquiry revealed that he had illegally booked and sold 17 tickets, though he was not an agent authorized by the Railways for booking and selling tickets.

The investigation revealed that the unauthorized agent used to earn Rs 100-150 as commission on each of the tickets that he used to sell illegally. He used to eke out his living by illegally selling tickets. When the chargesheet was filed against Kurmi, he denied the charge and faced the trial.

However, after the witnesses were examined, the accused expressed willingness to pay Rs 5,000 fine, which is the maximum fine prescribed upon conviction. The offence also attracts imprisonment for one month and Kurmi requested the court to show leniency to him. He was ordered to sit in courtroom for a day towards punishment apart from payment of fine

314,['23/02/2020'],Discover hardly sung &amp; rarely heard ragas,"This story is from February 23, 2020

Rewa Natu, a Pune-based classical singer trained in the Gwalior gharana, has been digging out hidden gems and ... Read More

The Hindustani classical music firmament has ragas often overlooked on the concert circuit and overshadowed by the weightier and stellar ones. But, these lesser-known ragas are no less vibrant in their musical richness.

Rewa Natu, a Pune-based classical singer trained in the Gwalior gharana , has been digging out such hidden gems and presenting them through her YouTube channel.

“The idea struck me after I participated in a programme titled dha-dha-dha (10-10-10) in Pune in 2017. It involved presenting 10 ragas in 10 different taals, the duration of each raga being 10 minutes. Tin taal is generally in 16 matras (beats), but I sang in 15, 18, 11½ and 9½ matras. The programme was widely appreciated and people came to know about lesser-known taals and ragas. Then we thought that these ragas should reach the people,” she said.

While presenting the programme, she found the audience attentive for around 10 minutes while listening to ragas. “Then the attention span begins to waver. So, we kept the average length of each YouTube video at nine minutes,” says Natu, a singer with the All India Radio.

Every week, she posted one raga on YouTube with an explanation in English by her student and linguist Mrinal Dhongade. “So far, I have posted 8 ragas such as Hemavati, Triveni, Gopibasant, Lachchasakh, Prabhatbhairav, Durgakalyan, Sajgiri and Lachari Todi on YouTube under “offbeat ragas”. These ragas are hardly sung, except by a few people. But they are the treasures of Indian classical music nonetheless,” she says.

Natu came across these ragas while doing her sangeetaacharya (doctoral studies) from the Akhil Bharatiya Gandharva Mahavidyalaya, Pune. “I had to study all these ragas. Then, I thought I should bring these ragas before the people, especially for those who intend to study music and take it up as a profession,” she adds.

After she posted the videos on YouTube as well as on her Facebook page, many people contacted her asking about the ragas. “A Punjabi gentleman from Canada found the videos so enriching and authentic that he requested me to teach him on Skype. I also received enquiries from Japan , Malaysia, Australia and the US. Now, I have started giving lessons on Skype,” Natu adds.

What made her happy was that people were taking a keen interest in lesser-known ragas. “It is actually a fulfilment of my goals. I wanted to reduce complexities surrounding the ragas. People get scared when they hear of a raga called Lachchasakh. A raga is nothing but swar (musical notes). If one can understand swar, it is easy to sing any raga,” she says.

After hearing her rendition of Lachchasakh, many people approached her to sing Ramsakh and Devsakh. “Now, I am thinking of singing a few sakhs,” she says.

In the next edition of “offbeat ragas”, she plans to come up with eight lesser-known ragas. “Among them are Chaitigauri and Basantpancham. I am yet to decide about the rest,” she says.

In order to reach out to the masses, Natu has done a couple of theme-based programmes. Among them is one called alankruta (a lady bedecked in jewellery). “For that, we selected some semi-classical compositions on jewellery worn by women, such as payal (anklet), kangan (bangles), tanmani (necklace) etc. We used visuals of jewellery for the programme, which was performed across seven cities in Maharashtra,” she saÿs.

The next one that she intends to do is on architecture and music. “Both have many things in common, such as rhythm, texture, harmony, proportion, and dynamics. Basic concepts in architecture such as space and form are equivalent to sur and taal in Indian classical music. For centuries music flourished in raaj darbars and temples. We want to highlight this through visuals and compering,” she says.

The singer also has plans to set up an archive of Indian classical music. “This is something that I have always wanted to do. Hopefully, I will be able to do it one day,” she says.

Malati Banjare murder case was finally solved by investigators with the arrest of Ajit Kurre

AHMEDABAD: It was a blind murder for the Balaudabazaar district police near Raipur in Chhattisgarh – a woman associated with a political party, was found murdered, with her clothes dishevelled, behind a school in November 2015.

The Malati Banjare murder case was finally solved by investigators with the arrest of Ajit Kurre, 30, a resident of the same town, along with an associate, for the crime. Kurre was brought to the Directorate of Forensic Sciences (DFS), Gandhinagar , for a narco test in 2019.

DFS officials said based on the crime scene, police started investigating different angles including sexual assault, personal enmity and the involvement of unidentified persons. “With the passing of years, it was getting difficult for investigators to find the reason for the murder. The husband of the deceased was first brought for narco analysis. His involvement could not be established,” said a DFS official.

Based on evidence, Kurre emerged as the major suspect and police sought permission for his psychological tests. Sources at DFS said that during the narco analysis, it was revealed that Kurre developed animosity towards Banjare for two primary factors – Banjare had developed a relationship with the husband of Kurre’s sister and she knew about an affair of Kurre’s.

Chhattisgarh cops pursued the leads and established that Kurre had met Banjare before the incident as he had called her up on some pretext on November 6. When she reached the spot, Kurre’s accomplice hit her on the back of her head. As she fell down unconscious, Kurre allegedly strangled her with his hands and dishevelled her and tore her clothes to give the impression of sexual assault.

Investigators in a press release said that Kurre even wrote a suicide note ascribed to Banjara, and wrote the names of several of his adversaries. Forensic analysis of the note proved it was Kurre’s handwriting.

HYDERABAD: Apart from major firms or well-established start-ups, students, some as young as 17-year-old, too are developing safety devices for women that cost no more than Rs 500. Their prototypes were on display at the World Education Summit on Saturday.N Shashidhar Raju, an intermediate second-year student of Rajiv Gandhi University of Knowledge Technologies (RJUKT), for instance, showcased his device ‘SthreeBal’, which looks like a watch. When activated it generates a shock of more than 1,000 volts that can leave a person paralysed. “When I heard about the 2012 Delhi gangrape, I wished to create a device for women. Back then, I was in school and had no resources. After joining the institute, I shared my idea with the faculty and they encouraged me to pursue it,” said Raju, adding that he spent about Rs 450 to create a prototype.“All I needed was a watch, an old mobile phone battery, switch, and high-voltage generator,” said Raju, who ordered the high-voltage generator from Rajasthan. “The high-voltage generator alone cost me Rs 420. I used my watch, got the battery from an old phone. If the high-voltage generator can be procured at low cost, the prize of the prototype/device can go down,” he said, adding, “The idea is to keep the manufacturing cost as low as possible so that more people can afford it. The device can be activated with the press of a button and it won’t harm the victim as it is insulated.”Students from the institute also developed an app ‘Swarasthr’ that is automatically activated when it detects a scream. “When a woman or child in danger screams, the app registers panic in their voice and automatically sends out SOS texts or calls to people, which are pre-loaded on the app,” said VB Amrutha, a third-year computer science engineering student, who was part of the four-member team that developed the app. The SOS text will contain the longitude and latitude information of a person in distress along with a message that would say that he/she is in danger and needs help immediately.Another device created by a second-year electronics and communication department student, B Lakshmi Prasanna, also works on similar lines.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74262793,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-137538,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/for-rs-500-students-develop-safety-gadgets-for-women/articleshow/74261488.cms

Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao

HYDERABAD: The state government has found that many collectors are not aware of their powers even after implementation of Telangana Municipalities Act , 2019.

On the advice of chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, who is keen to vest more power in the collectors, the municipal administration department conducted an orientation programme for them here, last week. The government has given powers such as having overall control of supervision of urban local bodies and forming special task forces to initiate stringent action against illegal buildings and other irregularities to the collectors.

Sources in municipal administration said government could remove ward members or a special officer if they fail to ensure 85% survival of saplings in their jurisdiction. The collectors can suspend chairpersons of municipalities or any member if they create ruckus during council meetings or attack officials. They can also suspend any resolution of the municipality.

“Generally, after the council meetings, it takes a few days to approve the minutes of the meetings. As per the new Act, the minutes should be approved by the elected body and commissioner within 48 hours. The collectors can take action if they fail to do so. The elected bodies have no role in approval of tenders and administrative approval can be given by the municipal commissioners,” a senior official explained.

Officials said collectors do not have enough time to even set up a special task force at district level to detect, monitor and stop unauthorised constructions. “The collectors have not taken any initiative to check illegal constructions in 20 municipal bodies in and around Hyderabad,” said S Chandrasekhar, founder-member of India Against Corruption Volunteers’ Association.

On their part, some collectors said they are busy implementing government’s schemes and have little time to supervise day-to-day activities of ULBs.

KMC has not yet developed the parking facilities at 12 sites it had reserved in the development plan in 2001

KOLHAPUR: The Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) has not yet developed the parking facilities at 12 sites it had reserved in the development plan in 2001.

On Friday, district guardian minister Satej Patil visited some of these sites and ordered the KMC to draft the plan and initiate the process in a month to develop these parking facilities. KMC officials claimed that they have acquired most of the sites, which were owned privately. They claimed that land acquisition is a long process and took time, leading to delay in developing the parking facilities.

For two of the 12 sites — Central Bus Stand and Saraswati Talkies — the KMC has proposed multi-level car parking. It has repeatedly issued the tenders for the last eight years. However, none is ready to take up the work to develop the facility on public-private-partnership basis.

Narayan Bhosale, assistant town planner of KMC, said, “The tenders for these two sites have been floated again. Development of the multi-level car parking at Venus Corner will start through the Mahalaxmi Temple Development Plan, for which, funds are expected from the state government. There is some opposition from the locals to parking facilities, which needs to be resolved.”

Officials are hoping that with Patil’s intervention, two sites will be developed — one for a truck terminus and another for bus terminus. This will address the issue of parking heavy vehicles.

Recently, activists met district collector Daulat Desai suggesting that the government offices be shifted to reduce congestion.

Ramesh More, one of the activists, said cars are currently parked at the spaces acquired by the KMC. However, multilevel-parking facilities could help accommodate more cars. “At some places, KMC staff is not able to manage the parking lots properly and the visitors are not treated well. Consensus needs to be built with the locals and the auto-rickshaw drivers around Central Bus Stand to develop the multilevel car parking facility,” he said.

324,['23/02/2020'],‘Current situation like Raktbeej…the devil never dies and keeps haunting women’,"This story is from February 23, 2020

Associate professor Madhulata Vyas has spent most of her 24 work years in a rural area, at Rewaben Patel Girls College in Bhandara, where she taught at the only women’s college. In 2016, Vyas was nominated as probationary officer of the Internal Complaints’ Committee (ICC) of the Maharashtra State Women’s Commission. In the aftermath of the Hinganghat lecturer Anikita Pissude’s brutal killing by her stalker, Vyas spoke to TOI about the challenges women face, especially in villages, and the remedy.

Excerpts from an interview ...

Q. What measures are you taking to prevent harassment of girls?

A. Our college is located in a rural area and till date, girls have never filed written complaints with the ICC. Yet, on and off they keep sharing stalking incidents in buses or on their way to college. Even when I was not on the committee, girls would tell me their harrowing tales. We counsel them and stress on the fact that there is no reason to be afraid of anyone. We tell them to keep talking about such issues to get rid of the fear. In recent years, Damini Squads started reaching out to them. They keep asking if we are facing any kind of sexual harassment. The movement of Damini Squad cops and officials from the women and child development department on the campus have ensured a safe environment for our girls. The point is we have never pressured our girls, but we always asked them to be vocal about their concerns. If they don’t speak up, they will live in fear.

Q. What if the girls are not forthcoming?

A. Precaution is better than cure. So far, we have never let things go out of hand. We keep a close watch on the behaviour of girls. Once, in college, we spotted a girl talking on the phone the entire day in college. We immediately sensed trouble. On enquiring, we learnt that the phone was her boyfriend’s. We immediately counselled the girl to not get lured by such things.

Q. Why do women, especially the working ones, prefer to keep mum?

A. The soft corner in a woman’s heart forbids her from taking stringent steps against men. She is even ready to suffer violence or face fire. Another reason is the family culture where women are taught to stay silent. But now, it’s necessary to take hard decisions and be bold for self-protection and for equality. Unless women start taking their own decisions, their safety can’t be ensured. I would like to add that a fair representation of women is a must. Though competition among men and women is intense in every field, the fact is that it’s a male-dominated world. Institutions exclusively for women are opened but are they really being run by all women? No. Participation of more women is needed, right from the security guard level to the principal.

Q. What can women do?

A. The society has resigned to the fact that crime against women is normal and that they will have to live with it. Women will have to take tough decisions. When you are wounded, you take first aid though it is painful. Somewhere, women need to convey the message that they too can retaliate. What’s the use of reading the history of Rani Jhansi if we can’t be courageous. Why should women always fear men? Why should women always fight for justice? Why don’t men stop other men? When men stop other men from committing crimes against women, it will give a good name to the male fraternity.

Q. What role should the media play?

A. The media has only portrayed women as the weaker lot, losers. Headlines should enrage women and not demoralize them. Titles like ‘Eventually, she lost’ or ‘Lecturer loses battle’ should have been avoided. The reportage should fire up women to start a mass movement.

Q. Is death sentence the solution?

A. Punishment should bring about a change in society. Rakthbeej, the devil, used to be killed but it kept on returning until he was finally slayed by Goddess Durga. The current situation is the same, where the devil never dies and keep returning to haunt women. Finally, Durga had to kill him. Similarly, unless women empower themselves and decide to kill the devil in the initial stage itself, we will not lose anymore Anikatas or Nirbhayas.

Q. What are the other factors that are making women weak?

A. One major factor that’s weakening girls is the neglect of their physical fitness. During our days, we had hockey and football teams. Girls represented the university. These days, we rarely find women sports teachers. Universities must revive sports for girls. Sports not only give women a fair chance, but also instill in them the confidence needed to take on any challenge.

HYDERABAD: Agriculture is becoming unsustainable as a profession and there is an urgent need to make it more attractive and sustainable, Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu said here on Saturday.

Naidu also emphasised on the need for crop diversification and value addition through food processing at the inauguration of the second edition of Agritech South conference and exhibition organised by the Telangana chapter of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) and Prof Jayashankar, Telangana State Agricultural University.

“Farmers need to diversify to other allied sectors like dairy and poultry to make agriculture more sustainable. Sericulture, horticulture and fish/prawn culture too are in great demand and farmers should venture into them along with agriculture,” said Naidu.

While stressing on the need to preserve and conserve traditional water bodies, Naidu lauded the Telangana government for taking up major irrigation projects.

Pointing out that agriculture and allied sectors are the backbone of the country, Telangana minister for agriculture, cooperation and marketing Niranjan Reddy said the state government has brought several farmer friendly schemes to support the farming community in the state.

He, however, rued that despite a doubling of the per hectare yield in recent years, several factors have contributed to depleting farmers’ income.

KOLHAPUR: The water supply department of the civic administration has recovered tax dues of Rs 9.47 lakh in one day, on Saturday.

The Kolhapur Municipal Corporation has taken measures to recover the tax dues.

The KMC has deployed five teams to recover the dues and snap the water connections of the defaulters. It is the highest tax collected in one day in Kolhapur.

“We have focused on the tax recovery from the defaulters with dues more than Rs 10,000. There are 20,000 defaulters. We have set the target of Rs 63 crore and we have collected Rs 35 crore from water tax so far. The drive to recover the dues will continue on holidays as well,” said Prashant Pandat, water tax superintendent.

Recently, the corporators had slammed the civic administration for poor tax recovery. They had demanded to focus only on tax collection.

Responding to the demand, the civic chief, Mallinath Kalshetti, has asked the officials to keep offices and citizen felicitation centre open on holidays, till late night, to recover the tax dues.

Over Rs 200 crore as tax dues is yet to be collected in the remaining 40 days of the current financial year.

Most of the other departments are lagging in tax recovery. The town planning department which had set the target of Rs 40 crore, has collected Rs 26 crore so far. The officials said that due to the floods and heavy rains last year, the development activities have been halted and very few construction projects started.

The property tax department has started sealing the properties for which the tax dues are pending for the last several years.

On Saturday, a property from Maharana Pratap Chowk was sealed.

The officials said that the property tax of Rs 5.07 lakh was due for the property. A senior official of the department said that the property will be sold to recover the taxes. “We have given a week to the owner to pay the dues. If he fails, we will auction it after scrutinising the legal issues. We have issued notices to over 250 defaulters asking them to pay the dues or else their properties will be sealed,” said Sanjay Bhosale, property tax superintendent.

Nagpur: After 45 years of age, people focus a lot on non-communicable lifestyle-based diseases like diabetes and hypertension. But, neither patients nor general physicians discuss about ‘sexuality’ which is one of the most important aspects of sound health.

On Saturday, sexologist Dr Sanjay Deshpande shared valuable tips with men and women above 45 years of age about sex life of aging couples.

“After 45, sex is like a therapy that can improve your complete health profile. This therapy comes with ‘use it or lose it’ tag,” he said. Dr Deshpande spoke at length about the changed form of sex after certain age and misconceptions and stigma about it, especially in Indian social set-up.

“At 45 plus, it’s injustice to expect sexual drive of 25 or 30 years from yourself. Instead, one should understand the changes in sexual response cycles in both men and women. Frequency of sexual desire may reduce, but aging couples can have more enjoyable sex,” he claimed.

According to him, elderly couples are more likely to know each other very well, so they can have more enjoyable sex even if less frequently. Dr Deshpande advised that seniors need more private time to get sexually active and they should get separate bedrooms in homes which is rarely in practice in cities like Nagpur. The lecture was delivered as part of 12th two-day annual conference of Association of Physicians of India (API) Vidarbha Chapter “VAPICON 2020” that began on Saturday.

This year, VAPICON is focusing on approach to various common clinical problems in day-to-day practice, said organizing secretary Dr Vinod Khandait. Scientific committee head Dr Ramesh Mundle said that 500 delegates from Vidarbha and neighbouring states are attending this conference. On first day, Dr. Shivkumar Utture, Chairman of Maharashtra Medical Council, Padmashri Dr Ashish Satav, and Dr Mangesh Tiwasekar, secretary of API national body attended conference and guided doctors. Veteran physician Dr B G Waghmare was felicitated with Dr B S Choubey eminent teacher award.

Bhopal: A versatile actor, who has deftly carved a niche for herself in the warp and weft of South film industry, from Malayalam to Tamil, Telugu and Kannada, twice national award-winner and Padma Shri Shobana Pillai’s Bharatanatyam performances are equally enchanting. As she took centrestage on day three of weeklong Khajuraho dance fest in Chhatarpur district on Saturday, the danseuse spoke about a divided world, artiste’s dilemma, dwindling audience base at classical fests and more.

As a glamorous actor, Shobana is a star attraction at Khajuraho and every major dance fest. Yet on other days at many of these fests, attendance is not really encouraging. Does it demotivate the young dancers? To this Shobana replied, “Dance festivals promote classical arts; it is an honour for anyone to perform here. These days, people are specially designing their performances for social media, so if the attendance dwindles at times at classical events, you know that people will watch it on social media as most of these events are webcast. I watched a Kathak performance on Friday and I can vouch that it was an ethereal experience. But when it comes to general thinning of audience, if the entire package of music, act and presentation is right, it will reach out to larger audience. You have to interact with them for greater connect.”

Having staged live shows across the globe, Shobana confessed that she still prefers to perform for desi audience. “Nothing beats presenting classical act at home turf; I find it easier to present the mythological stories here. Western audiences are very polite but they don't understand our ancient epics.”

At the time when the entire society is divided in two extremes — right and left, nationalist and liberal — can artistes help create a balance between? Shobana got philosophical and said, “There will always be left and right extreme; artistes can do their bit by adding positivity. One of my acts is called ‘Trance’ through which I have explained the basics of Hinduism, using Sufi chants and episodes from Bible. This is the maximum I can do. If you tell a genuine artiste that the world is coming apart, so it is your responsibility to fix it, I don’t think an artiste can perform under that stress. I did it, because I like the music, tones and tints of different philosophies.”

The celebrated dancer said she doesn’t believe in adding new-age messages to classical dance forms to motivate the new generation. She explained, “You can connect with youngsters even through Ramayana and Mahabharata. They need to be told over and over again, but the narration has to be interesting for youngsters to enjoy it.”

In the evening, Shobana started her act with Vishnu Aradhana and took the audience on a divine journey with her portrayal. Later, Suprava Mishra's Oddisi dance and Bharatanatyam by Ananda Shankar Jayant added to the mystique of the evening.

Union home minister Amit Shah

HYDERABAD: A public meeting will be organised by the Bharatiya Janata Party when Union home minister Amit Shah visits the city on March 15 in the run up to the GHMC polls.

In tune with its aim of coming to power in Telangana in 2023, the saffron party has laid out its plan to generate political mileage through the GHMC elections.

The party is upbeat about its position in the state after the recent urban local body elections, that it fought alone.

Shah’s rally is expected to focus on the construction of a grand Ram temple in Ayodhya, the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and National Register of Citizens, devolution of Central funds for urban development in the state and corruption in projects executed by the TRS government.

The Union home minister may also try to convince the electorate that Asaduddin Owaisi’s All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen is steering chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao-led TRS government.

“KCR announced that he would organise a meeting of chief ministers and also pass a resolution in the state Assembly against CAA under the pressure of MIM. The TRS-MIM is an unholy nexus which needs to be exposed in front of the people of Telangana,” said a BJP leader.

“The Congress is on the verge of sinking in the state. Though the BJP had won only 4 of the total 150 seats in 2016 GHMC pols, it has improved its performance and voting share since then. If there is any state in south India, after Karnataka, where BJP can come to power, it is definitely Telangana,” the leader said.

“Amit Shah has given a clear message to the party to focus on Telangana with the mission 2023—i.e. coming to power in the state,” another senior BJP leader said.

334,['23/02/2020'],Made-in-India valve fitted in 70-yr-old,"This story is from February 23, 2020

Nagpur: For the first time in Central India, a ‘made-in-India’ mitral valve was transplanted in a 70-year-old patient in the city on Thursday. In this procedure done at New Era Hospital, an imported mitral valve present in the patient’s heart was replaced using minimally invasive technique.

The ‘made-in-India’ valve is manufactured by Vapi-based company Meril India. It costs almost half of the imported valve.

“The patient, Moreshwar Bhave, had underwent an open heart valve surgery in 2012. The imported valve fitted in his heart started deteriorating few months back. When he came to New Era Hospital, senior cardiologist Dr Nidheesh Mishra diagnosed severe leakage in the valve,” said Dr Anand Sancheti, one of the directors of the hospital.

As the patient was 70-year-old, it was difficult to go for an open heart surgery. So, doctors decided to replace this valve through angiography. “We suggested the patient to use made-in-India valve . It saved at least Rs2 lakh only on the valve expenses,” said Dr Sancheti.

“Such minimally invasive surgeries of replacing already fixed valve are regularly conducted in Nagpur. This technique is best in case of fragile patients with advanced age. But patients are sceptical about using made-in-India valves. We are thankful the patient and his relatives gave their consent,” Dr Sancheti said.

Dr Needhish Mishra said heart patients should not ignore any symptoms. “This patient started having progressive shortness of breath even after slight exertion some two years ago. He was hospitalized five to six times for heart failure symptoms in the last two years. In view of age and other co-morbid conditions, he was initially managed with medications. Repeat open heart surgery would have been a high-risk factor in this case,” he said.

Doctors decided to go for comparatively novel technique of percutaneous valve replacement. This doesn’t involve any cut or incision and is done via femoral route under transesophageal and fluoroscopic guidance. The procedure was done successfully via transeptal route Mitral valve in valve replacement under general anaesthesia.

“There was no leakage immediately after the procedure. Post operation, the patient is doing well and was discharged on Friday in good health,” said Dr Mishra.

Wedding street offers 7,000sqft space and props

CHENNAI: During Pongal this year, when the whole family gathered to celebrate the festival, Praveen Kumar decided to put the holidays to good use, and arrange a pre-birthday shoot for his child. But instead of whipping out the camera, or heading to a regular studio , the family made its way to Madras Prop Store in Jafferkhanpet, Ashok Nagar.

""We plan to use the photos at Arit’s first birthday party, both for decorations and as a slideshow, so we wanted them to be really special. And they have a studio and a huge variety of props ,"" says Praveen, who also roped in two photographers to click photos of his eight-month-old, as well as family photos along with his wife, parents, and two brothers. Now, they have an album full of photos of a beaming Arit sitting in a tiny plane, posing next to a yellow crescent moon and on a wooden bench.

With high-tech mobile phones on the market, studios have long become passé. But now, with the need to make moments Instagrammable, entrepreneurs have come up with store-cum-studios, which offer a studio space as well as a variety of props that can be used for baby shoots, pre and post wedding photography , and family shoots.

Food stylist Jofy Abraham started out selling props and backdrops for food photography in 2016. Later, seeing an increasing demand, she launched Madras Prop Store which now offers props for food and baby styling as well as fashion backdrops. ""By December 2018, we also began offering studio space for the shoots,"" says Jofy, adding that 90% of her clientele hires the studio for baby shoots, and the remaining 10% for food and product shoots. ""With infants and babies, parents prefer indoor shoots. College students come to do food shoots as part of their projects.""

Wedding Street on OMR, on the other hand, offers about 7,000sqft land, and more than 100 props. ""It is an open area, with lawns and trees, and we offer props such as autorickshaw, swing, and a traditional thinnai set-up,"" says BJ Britto, general manager, Wedding Street, a one-stop shop for wedding planning. ""People can come and do creative photoshoots, usually pre and post wedding, though we do get many baby shoots too,"" he says, adding that they also have tie-ups with photographers.

""People prefer these spaces as Chennai doesn’t have too many options — it’s usually beaches, farmhouses and resorts. Here they don’t have to go to 10 different locations and can finish the shoot in one day in one space,"" says Britto, adding that they get five to 10 bookings a day.

The spaces are rented out in fixed time slots. ""We charge Rs4,000 for four hours during weekdays, and Rs5,000 on Sundays and other holidays, and this includes access to all props,"" says Britto.

Madras Prop Store charges Rs3,850 for two hours for the studio, and Rs1,000 per extra hour. ""They have access to all props; for two hours you get eight backdrops and for every hour after that you get two more backdrops,"" says Jofy, adding that they also rent out props

Some photographers rent the props for their shoots. Amrita Samant, who runs Mommy Shots by Amrita, rents props from the store as she has her own studio space. ""All parents would like to use a few props in their shoots, though I do tell them that too many props can take away from the child; the focus should be on the baby,"" she says, adding that size and safety of the prop is very important in baby photography. ""Many parents love to see their babies in baskets and buckets, but they have to be sturdy, and we have to ensure that the finish is clean and there are no splinters or sharp edges.""

For clients, it’s all about capturing picture perfect moments for posterity. Srimathy Venkat, for instance, did a photoshoot with her daughters — three-and-a-half-year-old Sahasraa, and nine-month-old Sahana in May 2019 before she did their tonsuring ceremony. ""I wanted to have photos of them with their hair,"" says Srimathy, who had the girls posing with a wooden windmill, park bench and moon in the backdrop. ""We picked the backdrops and props before choosing their dresses and fixing a date for the shoot. These photos are forever and we will always cherish them.""

Bhopal: Piplani police are searching for the accused who, on Friday night, fired shots at a 24-year-old MTech student while he was standing alongside three to four friends in Indrapuri area.

According to police, the incident was a fallout of an almost six-month-long dispute between two groups of engineering students allegedly over “proving supremacy” in their hostels. Cases were registered against both the groups at Piplani, Bilkhiria and MP Nagar police stations, but no action was taken to end the dispute.

Piplani police said that they are suspicious over the names of accused revealed by the MTech student as the location of one of the accused was traced to Patna, Bihar, at the time of the incident. The accused Ujjwal Rai was also wanted by MP Nagar police in connection with a brawl which took place between the group of students at district court on January 24.

Piplani police said that the victim Deepak Raghuwanshi, 24, a native of Shivpuri, did his BE from Bhopal and is presently pursuing MTech at a private college here. The incident took place around 8.30pm when Raghuvanshi was standing outside his SUV near a hostel at B-Sector, Indrapuri in Piplani. He told police that accused Ujjwal Rai and Shubham Sharma reached the spot on their bike and fired two shots at him. One bullet missed while other passed through his leg injuring him badly. Piplani police registered an attempt to murder case against Rai and Sharma and launched a manhunt to nab them.

While tracking Rai, ASP Sanjay Sahu said that police found him to be located in Patna. This raised suspicions over the incident, with the police claiming that the shots may have been fired by some unidentified accused and Rai was being framed in a false case.

Telangana municipal administration and urban development minister KT Rama Rao

HYDERABAD: The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) Act is likely to come into effect soon after the bill is presented in the upcoming budget session in the Assembly in March. The move follows the enactment of the Telangana Municipalities Act, 2019, in all 141 municipalities and 13 municipal corporations in the state. The GHMC Act will be applicable in Greater Hyderabad.

“Major provisions that were incorporated in the Municipalities Act, such as transparent building permission, speedy citizen services, focus on sanitation and greenery, would also be replicated in the new GHMC Act,” said municipal administration and urban development minister KT Rama Rao, while reviewing the new Act with municipal and GHMC officials on Saturday.

The present GHMC Act includes provisions from Hyderabad Municipal Act, 1955. It was revised with minimal changes when the Greater Hyderabad corporation was created in 2007.

Officials said the Building Permissions Approval and Self -Certification System (BPASS) would be incorporated in the new Act. After this, no permission would be required for construction of building within 75 sq yards and self-certification would be enough for buildings proposed up to 600 sq yards.

KTR also said that through the new Act, elected representatives and officials would be made accountable and people would get hassle free services. “Even zonal commissioners have to take initiative, not only for sanitation work but also for projects such as SRDP, construction of 2 BHK houses, public toilets, maintenance of parks, junction improvement and establishing basti clinics,” KTR said.

He added that stringent provisions, such as demolition of illegal buildings without providing a notice to owners or developers, will also be enabled through the GHMC Act.

PATNA: Siddhu Koda, one of the top CPI-Maoist leaders in Bihar and Jharkhand, was arrested along with an accomplice from Dumka district in neighbouring Jharkhand late on Friday night, police said. Koda, who carries a reward of Rs 1 lakh on his head, is said to be a “lieutenant general” of an armed squad of the outfit.

Siddu’s accomplice, Md Illiyas Hembram, was wanted in over a dozen Naxal-related incidents in Jamui district on the Jharkhand border. An AK-47 assault rifle, an Insas rifle and live cartridges were seized from their possession. Jamui SP Enamul Haq described Koda as a “prized catch” for the state police.

According to sources, a joint team of the special task force of the state police and Dumka police conducted a raid at Koda’s hideouts on the outskirts of Dumka town late on Friday night and arrested him. He had reportedly gone to Dumka to collect extortion money.

Koda’s armed squad was active in Jamui in Bihar and Giridih district in Jharkhand. A member of the special area committee of the proscribed CPI-Maoist, Koda was responsible for the attack on security forces at Mahulia on the Jamui-Nawada border in which 11 security personnel were killed and their weapons looted. His name also figured in the attack on the Sono police station, which left four cops dead and several others injured.

Koda’s armed squad had carried out another major operation near Lakhari in Jamui district in which an assistant commandant of CRPF, Heera Kumar Jha, was killed. He was involved in blowing up of the Khara block office.

Police sources said Koda had demanded extortion money from a contractor of a government hostel for SC students in Jamui recently. His involvement in the attack on Jha Jha GRP has also come to light in which a constable was killed and weapons looted.

Several villages under Chakai police station in Jamui district were considered to Koda’s stomping ground. Similarly, his armed group was also operating in the hilly terrain of Bhelwa Ghati in Jharkhand’s Giridih district.

Rights have to be enjoyed as a whole and it does not confine them to the right to education

MADURAI: Tamil Nadu Commission for Protection of Child Rights ( TNCPCR ) has taken serious note of involving children aged below 18 years in the anti-CAA protests and any protest in future. Members of the commission observed that children were being used in protests intentionally or otherwise which also posed threat to their safety.

The members told TOI that children are used for sloganeering, holding placards against the government and indirectly used as the first line of defence which made them vulnerable to harm. They were too young to be used for protests and wrongly influenced, especially against governments and some leaders.

TNCPCR member Meera Shankar recalled teenage protester Snowlin getting killed in the police firing during the anti-Sterlite protests in Tuticorin . She said that children were also badly injured in the incident that claimed 14 lives.

About the anti-CAA protests, they observed that most children accompany their mothers, wherein they join them at the protest site after school hours. At some places they are even forced to bunk classes.

On Friday, TNCPCR member A Ramanathan along with officials from police, district child welfare committee and the district child protection units of Madurai and Sivaganga went to the protest venue at Jinnah Thidal in Mahaboopalayam to ask the organisers not to bring children. “Of the nearly 300 people who took part in the protest around 50 were minors,” he said.

The team managed to get a written undertaking that they will not engage children in protest. Protesters initially objected the officials from interfering and raised slogans against them. The officials then held talks with a 15-member committee comprising the key organisers of the protest.

“We have made it clear that we are not against the right to expression,” Ramanathan said and added that they explained that organisers as well as parents who bring children to the protest site will be punished under section 75 (Punishment for Cruelty to Child) of The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015.

District Child Protection Officer (DCPO) of Tirunelveli B S Devananth said that the offence is punishable with three years’ imprisonment or fine of Rs 1 lakh or both.

However, executive director of Madurai-based human rights organisation People’s Watch Henri Tiphagne strongly condemned the TNCPCR. “Children have all rights that you and I have. They include right to express and protest. Rights have to be enjoyed as a whole and it does not confine them to the right to education. Here they are participating in the protest as the Act will affect their parents and them as well,” he said.

Stating that UNICEF and UN Special Rapporteurs have taken a position on it, he added that “unfortunately we have totally uninformed functionaries of child rights institutions.” He said that the safety of children should be ensured in protests.

After independence and with the emergence of local bodies, the government of Tamil Nadu entrusted the management of minor irrigation tanks with less than 40 hectares capacity to the respective panchayat unions and the bigger tanks to the PWD, said the then collector B Chandra Mohan’s foreword in the atlas. These were identified with the help of land records, which feature names of the tanks and the area of their existence.

It had been compiled over a period of 8-10 months by the officials from the various departments including revenue, rural development, survey, PWD-water resources organization and agricultural engineering. Each water body has been given a unique alphanumeric code. This code details the characteristics of each water body. With more than 7,000 pages, this atlas can be obtained from the Madurai district website https://madurai.nic.in/water-bodies-in-madurai-district/. Right to Information (RTI) activist, K Hakkim said that as the district administration has taken this initiative to put up such elaborate details of the water bodies online, people like him need not seek details of water bodies of Madurai district using the RTI. Madurai district collector T G Vinay said that he had got atlas uploaded on the district website as it will serve as a source of info.

Kolhapur: The security of Mahalaxmi temple is all set to be beefed up with all the four entrances set to be equipped with the digital screens and modern speakers .

The funds for the same have been sanctioned by the central government to the temple administration and the work in this regard will begin soon.

Mahesh Jadhav, president of Paschim Maharashtra Devasthan Samiti (PMDS) said, “The security of devotees that visit Mahalaxmi temple is always our priority. The footfall of the devotees at the temple increases during summer and winter season when school vacations are in progress and during Navratri and Christmas. We have initiated steps to increase the security cover of the temple by increasing digital watch around the temple that will help to keep watch on any untoward incident in and outside the temple premises. The work is likely to be completed within one month.”

The central government has made provision of Rs 1.5 crore to the PMDS for this. According to the steps taken by the PMDS, four speakers and four LED screens will be installed on all the four entrance gates of the temple that will do the live coverage of the activities in the Mahalaxmi temple through the CCTV cameras connected to these screens.

This will help the security agencies and the police to monitor the routine activities from the temple and be alert if any untoward incident happens in the temple.

347,['23/02/2020'],Rights panel moves high court over lack of dog-bite compensation,"This story is from February 23, 2020

Bhopal: Taking note of how victims of street-dog bites have been struggling to get compensation for more than past four years, the Madhya Pradesh Human Rights Commission (MPHRC) has moved the MP high court.

The court issued summons to the state government in the case which has its next hearing on March 16.

Speaking to TOI, MPHRC chairman Justice (retd) Narendra Kumar Jain said, “The number of street dogs is increasing menacingly and the human rights of the victims should be protected. We have sought the help of the high court for their compensation.”

In an order passed in May last year, the commission had recommended the formation of a Dog Bite Victim Compensation Scheme (DBVCS) in this regard or make amendments in the revenue book circular (RBC) of the revenue department within three months.

The commission had also recommended, “Till new rules are formed, the victim’s family — in case of death — may be paid Rs2 lakh as interim relief, and Rs10,000 to Rs1 lakh in case of injury. An inquiry should be done before compensation is paid to the victim.”

The 20-page order dealt with the merits of the case and looked into why compensation should be given to victims.

When MPHRC first took up the case of death of a Khargone girl due to a stray dog bite in 2016, and highlighted that there was no provision of financial assistance in the RBC in case of loss of life by animals, the revenue department in January 2017 had said there were no such provisions even in the neighbouring states of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chattisgarh.

The commission has now recommended the government to make necessary amendments in the relevant sections of the RBC to compensate victims.

The Commission had also urged the government to form a Dog Bite Victim Compensation Scheme (DBVCS) for compensating the victim in case of death or injury by street dogs. “You may give a different name to the scheme and may form it with the help of Crime Victim Compensation Scheme, 2015. The victim of dog bite may be compensated immediately or at the most within two months of the incident of dog bite after holding an investigation,” it had stated.

As an alternative to the DBVCS, the commission recommended to “make necessary amendments” in Section 6 (4) of the RBC.

349,['23/02/2020'],"15 yrs on, MWRRA frames public outreach policy","This story is from February 23, 2020

Aurangabad: The Maharashtra Water Resources Regulatory Authority ( MWRRA ), which has quasi-judicial status, has announced a public outreach policy , laying the road map for reaching out to the public and creating mass awareness.

A committee, headed by the member (law), will be constituted by the MWRRA. The chairman would nominate other members to the committee for the overall policy implementation.

Providing society and the public at large true, correct and transparent information as well as knowledge regarding various decisions taken by the authority, creating information and knowledge platform, building awareness and motivating the users for action regarding the efficient use of water and minimization of wastage are some of the objectives the MWRRA has spelt out.

The policy also speaks of achieving the involvement of the public and society at large in the process of judicious, equitable and sustainable management, allocation and utilization of water resources and in fixing the rates for use of water for agriculture, industrial, drinking and other purposes.

The MWRRA, by way of outreach policy, will also be organizing contests, institute awards and hold functions.

“The authority is of an opinion that continuous process of awareness building for the conservation of water, minimization of wastage, community ownership of resources, need for keeping the water resources pollution-free, the laws, rules, regulations and interventions made by the authority is essential for achieving the various objects of the Act. It is also essential to build a certain degree of consensus for bringing change in prevailing water-use practices by way of mass awareness,” the MWRRA has said.

It adds, “The authority, having considered its role and responsibilities in its discharge of functions, powers and the duties under the Act, felt it prudent to have transparent policy for media, public outreach, mass awareness, communication, publication and publicity policy and accordingly decided to frame and adopt policy guidelines governing the clear and transparent policy.”

The water regulator was established under the provisions of the MWRRA Act, 2005 and has been entrusted with various functions, powers and the duties for the regulation of water resources in the state. The MWRRA has the final say in facilitating and ensuring judicious, equitable and sustainable management, allocation and utilization of water resources besides fixing the rates for use of water for agriculture, industrial, drinking and other purposes.

The water regulatory body has also been shouldered with the responsibility of the Maharashtra State Groundwater Authority and is supposed to facilitate and ensure a sustainable, equitable and adequate supply of groundwater.

Stakeholders have welcomed the MWRRA’s move to reach out to the masses even if the step has been taken by the water regulator almost 15 years after its formation. “Better late than never. Such measures are the need of the hour as water requirements are likely to intensify conflicts between the regions. If implemented in letter and spirit, the MWRRA’s outreach policy will have far-reaching and positive effects,” said water rights activist Abhijit Dhanorkar.

350,['23/02/2020'],Green murder in Kukatpally: 55 trees axed for water sump,"This story is from February 23, 2020

The site from where about 55 trees were axed in Kukatpally.

HYDERABAD: The mass felling of 55 trees — all of them at least 10-years-old — at a gated community in Kukatpally , has left residents and environmentalists fuming. The trees were axed to make way for a water tank.

While the incident occurred in December, the matter came to light only on Saturday after a resident lodged a complaint with Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC), alleging that the green cover of the complex was damaged beyond repair at the behest of the current executive committee of Indu Fortune Fields Gardenia Apartments. “After being chopped in December, the tree stumps were left unattended till recently. There were all between 25 and 30 feet high and no permission was sought before cutting them,” said K Dasaradhi, a resident and former president of the committee. He claimed that his repeated appeals to the current committee, to seek permission for felling as well as replacing them, fell on deaf years.

As per rulebook, all parties must procure a permission from the Tree Protection Committee, which falls under the forest department’s purview, if more than five trees are to be cut or translocated.

Sreedevi Saraswati, forest range officer of Dulapally, confirmed that the department had not issued any permission to the complex for felling. The committee’s claims about the trees being translocated to KBR Park were yet to be confirmed by the official. She said that her department had not given the go ahead to this either. “We have carried out an inspection of the site and are yet to ascertain how many trees and which species have been lost. We will also visit KBR Park to assess whether the translocation was done,” Saraswati said.

The allegations were, however, countered by Rajendra Prasad, president of Indu Fortune Fields Gardenia Apartment Owners Association, who maintained that 36 “flowering plants” had been successfully translocated. When asked for the permission letter, Prasad said that GHMC was consulted before the plants were cut to set up a water storage sump. “They said these plants do not constitute trees by virtue of type of plant and the kind of girth/stem size,” he said, adding, “With summer approaching, we could not obtain a written permission, as the GHMC person who inspected (the premises) said that GHMC won't give that kind of permissions (sic) as these trees don't fall under their purview.” While Prasad said the translocation was carried out on February 9 and 10, the letter sent to R Shobha, principal chief conservator of forests, informing her about it is, incidentally, dated February 20 (STOI has a copy).

Environmentalist Captain J Rama Rao said that the probability of a tree stump surviving was slim, especially in current weather conditions. “Even with adequate water, it is tough for translocated trees to survive in the summer,” he said. His words were echoed by Subba Rao, former advisor, climate change, Engineering Staff College of India, who said, “The lack of moisture in the soil during this season could be the final blow for the trees.”

Sri Meenakshi temple administration said the shops and other smaller establishments were sealed

MADURAI: Two theatres constructed on encroached land belonging to Sri Meenakshi Sundareswarar temple, which were retrieved by the temple administration recently, are to be converted into marriage halls.

About 2.7 acres belonging to the temple which had been encroached for more than 75 years was retrieved and sealed by the temple administration after it approached the high court. Two of the buildings which had been constructed on the encroached land near Crime Branch office were theatres. While shops and other smaller establishments were sealed, the temple administration that surveyed the theaters found that the buildings are strong and hence decided to utilize them. As they have vast space, it was decided to convert them into marriage halls. They will be known by names Meenakshi-Chokkar Thirumana Mahal and Swami-Priyavidai Mahal.

Joint commissioner of the temple N Natarajan said they had given a proposal for the conversion of the theatres into marriage halls to the town planning division of the Madurai corporation. Work on renovation and alteration of the buildings would be initiated after getting the approval.

Similarly, about 30 cents of temple land near the ancient Kasiviswanathar temple in Simmakkal which also belonged to the Meenakshi temple, had been misused by people to whom the temple had leased the land about 20 years ago. While some of them had constructed shops on the land and rented them out, one of them had divided a portion of an ancient stone mandapam in the temple with a wall and constructed bathrooms and toilets and collected fees from users. These encroachments were also cleared with the help of police by the temple authorities on Friday.

Bhopal: The Madhya Pradesh Special Task Force (STF) has registered 50 more FIRs in the ongoing investigations into one of the biggest ever gun racket licence in the state, involving the high and the mighty based in Satna district. Recently, the STF had registered 25 FIRs on the same issue.

STF officials clarified that their investigation currently revolves around some government employees who had issued fake weapon licences, increased quota of ammunitions without government’s approval and extended permits fraudulently and that those named in the list are only ‘victims’ of the fraud. Licences issued after 2004 are being examined, said sources.

ADG Ashok Awasthi told the media that action is being taken to curb black marketing of ammunitions and a case has been registered in compliance with the government’s assurance in the cabinet. He said a special investigation team (SIT) led by SP Rajesh Bhadoria was set up to investigate the matter and records were seized from the arms licence wing of the collectorate. More than 100 gun licences are under the scanner.

SIT officials said the licences issued by the Jammu & Kashmir government were registered and renewed in Satna without government’s approval. It may be noted that J&K arm licences are already under scanner of the CBI and links between MP-based gangs and the notorious Mohammad Zuber gang are also being investigated.

Bihar CM Nitish Kumar

PATNA: Chief minister Nitish Kumar on Saturday said NDA would win more than 200 seats out of 243 in the state assembly elections slated to be held in October-November this year.

Addressing a meeting of the JD(U)’s block and district presidents at the CM’s residence here ahead of the party’s proposed workers’ rally at Patna ’s Gandhi Maidan on March 1, Nitish said, “The party workers should not be worried about votes. People of Bihar are capable to differentiate between right and wrong. The NDA will win more than 200 seats in the assembly elections.”

Nitish, who is also the JD(U) national president, assured them that the party would not compromise with its ideology even in adverse situation. “The party has been running on certain principles since its inception. We will not compromise with those ideologies at any cost. In Bihar, there is no scope of discrimination based on religion, sect, caste or gender,” he said.

Without taking the name of Lalu Prasad’s RJD, Nitish said the opposition party in the state has neither any solid issue nor programme for public. “Some people’s main job is to create confusion among the public by saying absurd things. There is no need of paying attention to their words,” Nitish told the party’s grassroots leaders from all the 38 districts of the state.

Nitish asked the party’s block presidents to share their experience and peoples’ issues. He listened to them for three hours.

Recognizing the important role of grassroots leaders in the organization, Nitish said, “They are the actual identity of JD(U). Today, JD(U) has its president and secretary at each of more than 72,000 polling booths across the state. It is not an ordinary achievement of the party. This organizational strength should now be used to inform and educate people about the good works done by the state government in the last 15 years and the social campaigns launched by the JD(U),” Nitish said.

The JD(U) chief further asked them to install party’s flag at their homes. “It will send a very positive message among not only the party workers but also common people,” he said.

JD(U) national general secretary (organization) RCP Singh said the party has a strong army of ‘matchless’ workers along with a ‘matchless’ leader. He further assured Nitish that more than two lakh workers would reach Patna on March 1 to attend the party’s event. Singh also announced to hold a three-day special training programme for the block presidents after March 1.

State’s energy minister Bijendra Prasad Yadav, party’s leader in the Lok Sabha and Munger MP Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan Singh and state president Bashishtha Narain Singh also addressed the meet.

Nagpur: With the doctor-patient relationship now termed ‘consumer and service provider’, incidents of patients or their relatives coming with complaints against doctors in case of complications are on the rise. This will be more rampant in coming days and complaints against doctors will become the norm. In such cases, proper documentation is the only option that can be saviour for doctors, said Dr Shivkumar Utture, President of Maharashtra Medical council (MMC) on Saturday.

“Patients allege that doctors these days ask for unnecessary diagnostic tests. Many of them comment that new generation of doctors have lost the clinical acumen our seniors used to have. But, we follow evidence-based practice and we must do all possible investigations before proper diagnosis,” he said.

“Get proper documentation of every investigation and why it was needed. Get proper consent in written form from the patient before the investigation and surgical procedures. This will help you stand in the court of law in future,” Dr Utture advised to the doctors.

Dr Utture was addressing the inaugural function of VAPICON 2020 — annual conference of Association of Physicians of India (API) Vidarbha Chapter. VAPICON is the most important event in the academic calendar of API Vidarbha Chapter. The theme this year was “We make healers”

The conference focused on approach to various common clinical problems in day to day practice. There were case-based discussions on various topics and also lectures by eminent faculties on wide-ranging topics.

Organizing Chairman of the event Dr Prabhakar K Deshpande, organizing Secretary Dr Vinod Khandait, treasurer Dr Suhas Kanphade were on the dais.

Twix, the labrador, who inspired TailTale’s journey in gourmet dog food

CHENNAI: Four-year-old Arima loves his chicken, sweet potato, and pomegranate breakfast. ""It’s a champion’s meal,"" says his parent. Cookie’s parents watch his diet, which is why there’s always kale in his food . Twix, an older, more active child, on the other hand, can’t get enough of his high-protein trail mix.

Arima, of course, is a Rottweiler; Cookie a beagle, and Twix a Labrador . And their gourmet doggie bowls give a pretty good insight into the silent revolution that’s taking place in the pet food market. Subscription meals, door-delivered homemade food, farm-sourced, lab-tested, hypoallergenic… why there is even a Kerala veg meal option for the doting parent.

""The pet food market in Chennai isn’t just being revolutionised, it’s being ""humanised"","" says chef Samir Singla, CEO of Chennai-based TailTale which makes dog food that’s indulgent and healthy — bon bons of brown rice to moringa leaf fortified Kerala veg meals or seaweed oat meals. ""The food we make for dogs can be eaten by humans as well,"" says Sam, who occasionally snacks on his Twix’s trail mix, a blend of peanut butter, pumpkin seeds, cranberries and coconut. Every meal and snack sold by Singla’s company lists out ingredients and mentions whether it is vegan or gluten-free. ""The idea came when I started researching what went into Twix’s dry food and found it was full of preservatives. I wanted to give my dog a more wholesome meal.""

Market studies pit the size of the Indian pet care industry at more than Rs25,000 crore and growing at a rate of 17%. The pet food market forms more than 70% of that market, says research, fuelled by the rising number of nuclear families in cities with disposable incomes.

City-based Oscar Daisy has found a niche in the ‘pet food subscription service’ business, door delivering freshly cooked food, customised to the diet of pooches. ""No one owns a pet anymore, we are all pet parents,"" says Praveen M, its owner. ""We all want the best for our child.""

Praveen, like Singla, was unhappy with the packaged food he was giving his dog, and so in consultation with his veterinarian, came up with all-natural balanced meals. Enter the sweet potato instead of the carb-high potato, chia seeds for antioxidants, and lamb for protein. ""It’s food I would eat,"" says Praveen, who says his food is fit for human consumption.

AURANGABAD: Former BJP district chief Kishanchand Tanwani ’s supporters surrendered before the Kranti Chowk police station on Saturday noon after a complaint against them was registered by the party’s state vice president and Maharashtra Development Board chairman Bhagwat Karad .

Karad blamed Tanwani and his aides for pelting stones at his house and damaging a vehicle parked outside.

The stone pelting incident took place on Friday evening at Karad’s hsopital cum home located in the Nutan Colony. Some people threw stones at his official vehicle and damaged it. Karad and his party workers were present at the hospital at the time of incident.

Soon after, Karad and his party office-bearers, including MLA Atul Save and several other supporters, approached the Kranti Chowk police station and staged a sit-in agitation demanding immediate arrest of Tanwani’s close aides. Bhagwat gave a written complaint to the police and named three of Tanwani’s close aides. Accordingly, an offence was registered late on Friday night.

On Saturday afternoon, Rangnath Rathod (42) of Jatwada and Santosh Sure (39) of Surewadi turned up at the police station and surrendered. They were accompanied by Tanwani. The duo was produced before a local court, following which they were granted conditional bail. Karad had also named Sachin Zaveri, one of the close aides of Tanwani, in his complaint, but he submitted CCTV footage to prove his innocence.

Tanwani told TOI, “Political leaders should abstain from using unparliamentary language while referring to any political figure in public. I believe that the words used by the BJP leader for me might have hurt my supporters.”

Claiming contradictions in the statements given by Karad, Tanwani said that this is nothing but a political stunt ahead of the civic body elections.

Police said that the stone pelting has damaged a glass of Tanwani’s official vehicle. The incident has resulted in serious tension in the locality falling under the limits of the Kranti Chowk police station.

Police authorities were checking if the incident is a reaction to any political statement made by Karad in the recent past. On Saturday, police teams were scanned CCTV footages for finding specific clues about the suspects.

Representative Image

NAGPUR: The CBSE 12th board’s psychology paper tested the psyche of students in the true sense of the term. Some termed the paper a tough nut to crack because it was too lengthy, while a few said that it was on expected lines. Another section felt the questions were unusually indirect.

Mousumi Aich of Centre Point School, Katol Road branch, is an expert in the subject. After doing the analysis, Aich came to the conclusion that the paper was kind of challenging. “It wasn’t too easy and neither was it too difficult. It was somewhere in the middle. In other words, it was a mix of difficult and easy questions,” said Aich.

Some questions were based on situation and application. “Repetitive reading of the paper, twice or thrice, would have certainly helped students to solve it better,” added Aich.

The content of the paper was entirely from the textbook prescribed by NCERT . “None of the questions was beyond the syllabus. The question about distribution was a bit tricky,” she said.

For examinee Amrit Kaur Kamboj, this year’s paper was more application based compared to ones in the years gone by. “I found a few questions confusing, but the lengthy ones were easy. Some questions were the ones that we didn’t get a feel of, either in the school exams or in the sample papers,” said Amrit.

For a 70-mark test, the paper was quite lengthy as many students wrote right down to the last minute.

Granthika Sharma was content with her performance. “I was expecting the paper to be easy. Though it was quite lengthy, I somehow managed to do well,” she said.

For Ayesha Sardaria , indirect questions made the going tough. “Though I was hard up for time due to the lengthy paper, I increased my speed and ended up attempting all the questions,” she said.

Going with the flow, Azaan Ahmed , too, was expecting something not very tough. “It was quite challenging and lengthy, something unexpected. I did not expect so many indirect questions,” said Azaan.

359,['23/02/2020'],Students accept comprehensive learning,"This story is from February 23, 2020

Madurai: Classes X to XII students are warming up to learn comprehensively and understand concepts, rather than memorising and reproducing answers, as it will help them score well in competitive exams also. The change, from the earlier blueprint system which encouraged rote learning, also means that it will not be easy to score high marks, which is perhaps good, say teachers. The blueprint system allowed teachers and students to selectively learn or omit portions from textbooks based on the marks they would fetch in the board exams.

From this academic year onwards, Class X state board students are not getting blueprints from this academic year onwards, while Class XI and XII students have not been getting them for two years now. “Any new change introduced will have challenges. Previously, we could ask students to study selectively and still score high marks. Students who were used to the system would find it difficult now at first, however, in case of Class XII students, I’m seeing an improvement this year because this batch who have cleared a similar system in Class XI have got used to it,” said headmaster of a government higher secondary school.

Teachers claim that students can still pass the exams and score up to 50% by studying a minimum portion, which would mean that even late bloomers won’t be left behind. Government school teachers reiterated that stopping blueprints would help students move towards making their presence felt in competitive exams. “Students will get used to it, especially if it is continuously implemented from lower classes. Even from government schools, we’ve seen only those who rely on reading and learning rather than mugging up concepts, to be successful later in life. This way, even government school students can be shaped to have a bright future in the competitive world,” added the head master.

However, the absence of a blueprint have students worried. “It’s like we have to hope and pray for questions to come from a particular chapter or in a particular format and everything is more of luck,” said Aswin K, a Class XII student. Students feel that there is also an increased pressure on them this way especially if they have to also separately prepare for entrance exams.

“Blueprint gives an idea of what kind of question will be asked from which chapter. It does not have to be done away with because it leads to confusion as students won’t know how the question will be framed. Already, I’ve seen how students struggle when they shift from Samacheer to the new syllabus,” pointed out Ramachandran V, who runs a private tuition centre for higher secondary school students. He added that designing question banks and guide books has been difficult without the blueprint. “There won’t be any clarity in such books and instead would only overwhelm students,” said Ramachandran.

Madurai: Proper vaccination measures and increased awareness about Japanese Encephalitis (JE) have kept the disease in check in the district, said health officials and doctors on ‘World Encephalitis Day’ commemorated on Saturday.

“We have vaccinated children between ages of 6-11 in the district. During the past year, we have vaccinated around 46,000 children across Madurai,” said a senior health official. SA-14-14-2 type of JE vaccine is usually given to the children as a single dose. Japanese encephalitis, a zoonotic viral infection, is the most common cause of viral encephalitis in India, mainly spread by JE vector mosquitos. Recently, JE has been prevalent in the northern states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh and has resulted in mortalities.

“Last year, there were hardly 2 cases of JE here. When it comes to encephalitis, bacterial meningitis and TB meningitis are more common and these are mostly curable. I would say awareness about encephalitis is definitely better now,” said Dr Murugan, head of the department, Neurology at Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) in Madurai. Encephalitis means an inflammation of the brain. Symptoms of JE include fever, headache, vomiting, altered level of consciousness and even seizures in severe cases.

There is no specific treatment or cure for JE and is treated mainly by supportive therapy which may include hospitalization, respiratory support, and intravenous fluids. “Children and the elderly are more vulnerable and mortality is more among them. For those patients between 20-50 years of age, the disease can often be controlled with anti-viral drugs,” added the doctor.

CHENNAI: Last week’s protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) on Mannady Street in George Town have disrupted underground sewage work being carried out by the Chennai Metro Water and Sewerage Supply Board (CMWSSB), leading to sewage overflow on a few streets, say residents.

Protests against CAA intensified after February 14, spread to other parts of the city including Mannady, Pudupet and Alandur. “Work for the underground drainage had begun last Wednesday. But, because of the protest the contractors are not visiting and there is sewage stagnation on nearby Nainiappan Street, Sembudoss Street and Jones Street,” said a resident.

A junior engineer said pumping vehicles could not be pressed into service last week due to the protests. “We are laying sewer lines in Mannady. One stretch is complete. By tonight, all stagnated sewage will be pumped out. After ensuring that there will be no more protests, we will begin work on the other stretches to ensure the work is completed without any hindrance,” he said.

But another Metrowater official said there was only minor inconvenience because of the protests and admitted that it was not the only reason for the sewerage stagnation. “Work can happen only during the night and we have to wait until evening to begin pumping. That is why there is stagnation. We have the machinery in place and the pumping work has begun,” the engineer told TOI.

Some other residents said the protests were being used as an excuse. “We know how government machinery works. It is unfortunate that protesters are being tainted,” said Ramiz Raja, who runs a shop in Mannady.

AURANGABAD: The Nanded police’s local crime branch (LCB) has booked three people and seized banned cigarette worth over Rs 41.47 lakh from a godown located in the city, making it one of the biggest seizures of banned imported cigarettes in the region.

According to police, the raid is part of an ongoing drive against illicit businesses discreetly operating in the limits of Nanded.

The action was taken after an offence in this regard was registered with the Wazirabad police station late on Friday, catching the traders and consumers by surprise.

LCB inspector Dwarkadas Chikhlikar said that the action was initiated following a specific tip-off about imported cigarettes being stored in a godown. Son after, a team rushed to the godown and raided the place.

Considering the seizure of huge stock, the LCB has been directed to bust the entire chain, including those assisting in illegal importing of such banned products.

363,['23/02/2020'],Govt launches ‘Super 100’ to grade co-op societies,"This story is from February 23, 2020

Bhopal: Taking a cue from Bihar’s ‘Super 30’, the state government has launched a new initative called ‘Super 100’, but with a twist. The ‘Super 100’ of MP is not for students, like it is in Bihar, rather it is meant to grade the best cooperative societies in the state.

The cooperatives department started the exercise following its drive against housing societies that have cheated lakhs of people worth thousands of crores. Officials said that the aim of the exercise is to win back confidence of people and to inform them that not all cooperative societies in housing or other sectors are bad and there are societies that are doing a commendable job.

Societies in different sectors would be summoned to the state capital where their work would be reviewed regarding documentation and publication. After selecting the best societies, other societies would be asked to visit the chosen societies so that they could replicate the best practices. Staff of laggard societies would be trained to improve their functioning.

There are over 5000 societies in the state, including housing, marketing, industrial, fisheries, district cooperatives bank, cooperative sugar factories, district agriculture and rural development bank, public cooperatives bank, district cooperatives association, district forest produce government association, district bidi government cooperatives association, fruit, flower vegetable marketing cooperative society, primary milk producing cooperative societies, primary consumer cooperative store, among others.

Officials said the schedule for presentation by every cooperative society has been finalised. The exercise started on February 12 and will continue till March. After selecting the top five societies in every sector, they would be awarded at a state-level function on the Independence Day.

Commissioner of cooperation MK Agrawal said that a many societies are doing good work in the state, but get shadowed by societies involved in irregularities. The idea of ‘Super 100’ is to identify the good cooperative societies in all sectors and reward them, he said.

It all started after the government received around 3000 complaints against the housing societies in Indore, Bhopal and other major cities in the state during the recent war on land mafia. Apart from the direct complaints, public hearings were conducted at district administration-level to get complaints from victims regarding housing societies’ fraud. FIRs have been registered against more than 200 housing societies so far. The drive against mafia was launched after chief minister Kamal Nath ordered crackdown on syndicates that run land rackets, drug rings and are involved in mining and cooperative sectors. The drive began in Indore in December and soon spread to the entire state.

CHENNAI: The anti-CAA protesters at Chennai’s Shaheen Bagh in Washermenpet are facing the heat for pilfering power from junction boxes.

The anti-CAA protests that gathered momentum after police action on February 14 in Washermenpet is continuing for the ninth consecutive day on Saturday.

Electricty board officials have collected details about the malpractice committed by the organisers, who they say pilfered power using a separate cable from the EB junction boxes in the neighbourhood. An EB official said the organisers connected a cable and drew power to operate pedestal fans and lights at the protest site. “We have taken photographs and videos on Sajja Munusamy Third Lane, the EB junction box near Ashwin tea shop on Ajeez Mohammad Gouse Street, the EB box behind the protest stage on Dr Vijayaragavalu Road, Ajeez Mohammad Gouse Street, and Muthial Maestry Street.” The EB officials will issue receipts to the organisers. A senior EB officer said, “I was not informed about the power theft. If we confirm it, we will slap a case and fine the protest organisers.”

The protesters denied the allegation. “We have kept a generator to illuminate the whole area,” said Jannath M, a protester. Stressing on their self-sufficient demonstratio-ns, she said, “A Hindu friend is bringing food every day at noon. We are taking turns to prepare our children for school every day.”

PUNE: Senior NCP leader and minority development minister of Maharashtra Nawab Malik on Saturday said the Maha Vikas Aghadi constituents would hold a meeting soon to finalise the draft of the questionnaire for the National Population Register in the state.“The NPR (National Population Register) questionnaire was drafted in 2010 but the Union government included some additional questions. We shall examine them and take a decision after consulting the governments in the non-BJP states,” Malik said.The present NPR questionnaire has 21 questions as against 15 in 2010.On chief minister Uddhav Thackeray ’s statement on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), Malik said its implementation was the responsibility of the Union government. Thackeray assured that nobody should be afraid because the NPR and the CAA were central government directives, the senior NCP leader said.Iterating that “no citizen would be troubled”, Malik said adequate care would be taken to exclude unnecessary questions after the consultation. “We can decide it only after our discussions,” he told TOI.Several states had requested to delete the additional six questions, including the place of birth of parents of citizens, during the NPR survey later this year. But the central government did not budge from its stand, stated government officials in the know of the drive.The six new parameters in the new NPR form that poses 21 questions includes Aadhaar number of residents, Voter ID, PAN, driving licence number, cellphone number, the date and the place of birth of parents, and the last place of residence. In the last NPR exercise in 2010, there were only 15 questions. The additional questions were added to the list when the database was updated in 2015.Experts pointed out that the Union government had not spelt out why the additional parameters were added to the database. It is being speculated that most of the additional questions would let the government bodies cross-refer to this database.According to the government officials, the question on the place of birth of parents would help the government get a clearer picture when it upgrades the database into a citizenship register.“As of now it seems that data will be collected on all the 21 parameters in the new NPR form,” said an official.Officially, the government has sought to delink the NPR from the National Register of Citizens (NRC). “But the government gets the power to build and update the population register from the Citizenship Act, and the rules and regulations notified under this law,” stressed some experts.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74264906,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-311736,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/npr-questions-will-be-finalised-after-discussions-among-mva-constituents-nawab-malik/articleshow/74261602.cms

Aurangabad: A senior police inspector attached to Itwara police station of Nanded district, about 250 kilometres from Nashik, has been suspended for failing to perform his duties.

The orders in this regard have been issued by Nanded range’s special inspector general of police Manoj Kumar Lohiya.

Nanded superintendent of police Vijay Kumar Magar told TOI, “After frequent failures on the end of police station in-charge, I prepared a detailed report about three different incidents and forwarded it to the range IGP, who has suspended him.”

Sources in the police department informed that the officer came under the scanner, after he failed to register an offence on time against a hate speech during a CAA protest at Nanded-based Shaheen Bagh.

When contacted, suspended senior inspector Pradeep Kakde claimed innocence and said, “I have not committed anything wrong. After my seniors summon me, I will place my case before them and seek justice.” He refused to elaborate on the charges mentioned against him in the internal report submitted by the Nanded police to the range IGP.

The alleged hate speech was delivered on February 1, but the officer reportedly registered the offence only on February 3 and later arrested the accused. This delay in reacting to the alleged incident and also failing in bringing the matter to notice of the higher ups, was concluded as a gross violation of the laid down SOP within the police department. Also the communication gap between the police and those associated with the agitation, resulted in to chaotic situation, which was looked up as an adverse thing.

In addition to this, the crime branch recently had carried out a raid in the jurisdiction of Itwara police station and busted a gambling den. Questions were raised about the inspector’s failure in keeping a check on illicit businesses in his limits, this too didn’t go down well with the higher authorities.

Another incident that caught the higher officials attention was that his junior subordinate, a police sub-inspector attached with the same police station, was caught by anti-corruption bureau while accepting bribe.

367,['23/02/2020'],Upper Lake water at summer-safe level,"This story is from February 23, 2020

Bhopal: Here is some good news for city residents ahead of the summer season. The water level in the Upper Lake, the lifeline of the state capital, is better than the same period last year.

As of now, the level is about 10-feet more than the last year, according to Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC). On Saturday, the level stood at 1665 feet. The water level has gone down by over 3 feet since October, despite the civic body pumping out 10 MGD more water daily as compared to the last two years.

According to BMC water works wing in-charge Rakesh Nigam, the situation is comfortable, owing to the bountiful monsoon last year that lasted almost till the beginning of October. It was for the first time in over 13 years that Upper Lake had reached its lowest level in the month of May last year. The water body is a source of drinking water for 40% of the city residents.

The Upper Lake dead storage level is 1652 feet and in mid-February last year it was at 1655.34 feet, Nigam said.

The Upper Lake water supply connects to Bada Mahal, Bairagarh, Karbala and Bhauri pumping stations. Around five zones out of 19 BMC zones are dependent on water from the Upper Lake which amounts to almost 7 lakh people living in the state capital. The Upper Lake water supply also feeds BHEL and Indian Railways.

According to BMC estimates, water from the Upper Lake can be drawn up to 1645 feet, but last year this level was breached when around 19 MGD of water was pumped out to meet the water needs of Bhopal. “Since September, we are supplying about 28 MGD from the Upper Lake on a daily basis,” said Nigam.

Earlier, during a meeting of the district coordination committee, representatives from various communities had cited the need to chalk out plans to meet water needs during summer. A plan has been finalised to cater to the water needs of the city. It relies on pumping more water from Kolar, Narmada pipeline and Kerwa reservoir.

AURANGABAD: With Maharashtra recording the highest number of missing cases of women and children in the country, the state police are preparing for a special drive to track down the missing/kidnapped persons.

Authorities said the drive follows a high-level meeting chaired by the state home minister on February 10.

As per the latest communication from the Prevention of Atrocities against Women (PAW), a special cell of the director-general of police, a month-long drive will start on March 1. The authorities have received the letter signed by special IGP Pratap Dighavkar, who currently heads PAW.

An officer deployed with PAW maintained that abuse, in any form, is one of the key reasons for women and children to flee home. “Women and children fleeing home are most vulnerable to trafficking and other abuses, making it a concern for the law enforcement agencies as well,” said the officer.

As per the directive issued by PAW, all the cases related to missing and kidnapped women ageing above 18-years, between the years 2015 and 2019 will be probed afresh in the month-long drive, across the state. To ensure that the drive yields results, all the superintendents as well as commissioners of police in the state have been asked to ensure that the drive-related data and developments (if any) are updated to the state police headquarters-based control room by 9 pm every day.

As a preparation for the drive, the authorities have been asked to get police station-wise data of missing women and children, and accordingly, make advanced preparations. All the data on these missing and kidnapped persons have to be compiled by February 29, before the drive kicks off.

As per the data published by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) in the year 2016, as many as 28, 316 cases of missing women were reported from Maharashtra. In 2017, the number rose to 29, 279, while in 2018, the number reached 33, 964. Though the figures for 2019 have not been released yet, considering the average surge in the cases of missing women in the state, the number is likely to increase.

Following the directives, respective unit commanders are forming special teams across police stations to work on these cases. Also, the crime branch and other special cells have been directed to assist the special squads at the police station level.

Chandigarh: Three students were killed and two injured when a fire tore through an illegal paying guest (PG) accommodation in Sector 32 here on Saturday.

Around 10-12 girls out of 30 residing in the two-storey residential building were in their makeshift rooms when the blaze broke out on the first floor owing to a suspected short-circuit around 4pm. A caretaker’s relative claimed they rescued some girls but failed to find the three as the fire intensified and the rooms got filled with smoke.

The victims were identified as Riya (19), a resident of Kapurthala, Punjab, Prakshi Grover (20), a resident of Kotkapura, Punjab, and Muskan (21), a resident of Hisar, Haryana. Muskan was a MCom student in SD College, Sector 32, and Prakshi a BBA student in the same college. Riya was pursuing a course from Alliance Francaise in Sector 36.

Their friends Jasmine and Femina were on the second floor when they heard cries for help. “We tried to go down but there was only one exit point and that too was engulfed with fire,” Jasmine said. Realising they would be trapped, the two jumped from the balcony of the second floor into the backyard of the adjoining house to escape the blaze. Both received injuries.

Manpreet Kaur, a resident of Noida who had come to meet her sister Babbu, the caretaker at the PG, said when the fire broke out, she and her sister rescued five to six girls from the first floor and called up police helpline 112.

Four fire tenders took almost one-and-a-half hours to douse the flames. The first floor was gutted. Amarjit Singh, a firefighter who was the first to reach the spot and entered the first floor, said, they recovered Muskan and Prakshi from under a bed and Ria from the washroom.

MEERUT: Police in Meerut zone are leaving no stone unturned to prevent any untoward incident on the occasion of Bharat Bandh called by Dalit outfit, Bhim Army, on Sunday. “Keeping in mind the happenings of social media driven Bharat Bandh violence that occurred on April 2, two years ago, we are definitely on high alert and our eyes are on potential troublemakers. Besides, social media monitoring is on in full swing,” said Prashant Kumar, ADG Meerut zone.

Police are conducting meetings with leaders of all Dalit outfits, particularly in Saharanpur, which has a strong Dalit presence.

Speaking with TOI, Dinesh Kumar P, SSP of Saharanpur, said, “We are keeping close contact with all outfits and are in continuous dialogue with them. We have explained to them that a peaceful protest is their democratic right but they are not to take the law in their hands or else we will be forced to take strict action.”

Meanwhile Sanjiv Suman, SP, Hapur has cancelled the leaves of all police personnel in order to have adequate police force available for Sunday’s Bharat Bandh.

The Bharat Bandh called in April 2018 had turned violent, resulting in the death of nine people, including one each in west UP’s Meerut and Muzaffarnagar districts. Besides, largescale violence was witnessed as the protesters went on the rampage, burning vehicles and vandalizing property.

While Chandrashekhar, chief of Bhim Army, could not be reached, a source close to him revealed, “The bandh is being organized to protest against Citizenship (Amendment) Act, unemployment, repeated attempts to dilute reservation policy and other issues. On February 12, Chandrashekhar had tweeted, ‘All friends should prepare for Bharat Bandh on February 23. I appeal to all political parties to give their support’.”

371,['23/02/2020'],200 persons booked for criminal trespass on Neyyar project land,"This story is from February 23, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: Despite a government order to hand over around six acres at Neyyar to Kerala Water Authority (KWA) for the construction of a 120 MLD (million litres/day) water treatment plant, land acquisition is stuck due to protest by residents.

On Friday, defying the collector’s order and ignoring the deployed policemen, residents celebrated Shivaratri at a temple located in the area selected for the project at Marakunnam near Kallikkad.

Based on the complaint filed by Kattakada tahsildar (LR) Madhusoodanan Nair, Neyyar dam police registered a case against 200 persons, of which 50 are women. Police said members of RSS, BJP and Hindu Aikya Vedi, who led the protest, were booked under non-bailable charges for unlawful assembly, criminal trespassing and obstruction of duty. Police said the crowd manhandled Nair.

The Neyyar water supply scheme is a crucial project for KWA as the city is facing a serious drinking water crisis. The work envisages an additional 100 MLD for city, while the remaining 20MLD will be distributed to Maranalloor, Malayinkeezhu, Vilappil and Vilavoorkal panchayats.

In 2016, that KWA’s MD approached irrigation department to acquire 5 acres in Neyyar for the project. The department agreed to give 3.62 acres that was earlier in the possession of Sree Rama Dasa Mission Ashram, Chenkottukonam. The department then cleared encroachment. Later, KWA demanded an additional 2.38 acres for the project. Thus, on Tuesday, a government order was issued to hand over six acres of irrigation land to KWA for the project.

Six months ago, a KWA wing had awarded the project to city-based Chicago Constructions International Pvt Ltd. But, the contractor was unable to begin works due to land acquisition issues. Residents raised claim over the unused temple at the location.

“The land, which was on a kuthakapattom lease, under which there is a restriction on sale of land, was purchased by one Sree Rama Dasa Mission some years ago. That land was identified for Neyyar water supply scheme and irrigation department decided to give the land to KWA. Soon, Sri Rama Dasa Mission raised objections. Their plea was disposed by RDO in January 2018 and land was given to KWA in June 2019. Now, when we cleared the land, a group led by RSS raised protest,” said sources in KWA.

Swami Brahmanpadananda Saraswathi of Sree Rama Dasa Mission said that the ashram had purchased the land at the time of Swami Sathyananda Saraswathi around 28 years ago. “We have been conducting puja at the temple. We approached HC when government decided to hand over the land to KWA. A decision is pending in this case. Residents want to conduct a fest there on Shivaratri. It is unfair to deny their right to religious practices,” said the swami, who is undergoing treatment in Ernakulam.

The organization approached the high court in December 2019. Sources said the court had asked the RDO to hear the ashram too before handing over the land. CPM district secretary Anavoor Nagappan said BJP and RSS workers were purposely trying to create communal tension at Kallikkad. “The project is aimed at provide drinking water to thousands of people. But, BJP and RSS want to sabotage this initiative,” he said.

Nagpur: A 22-year-old engineering student was duped of Rs83,580 by two tricksters on the pretext of selling him a second hand two-wheeler in October last year. The trickster allegedly posed as army personnel.

Sumanraj Ankari, who hails from Chhattisgarh, is a student of electronics and telecommunication engineering at a college in the city. He lodged a complaint at MIDC police station on Friday.

According to police, Ankari, a resident of Mhada Colony, wanted to buy a two-wheeler for commuting to college. He identified a vehicle an online application on October 28, 2019. The vehicle owner Ashish Khandelwal was selling it for Rs20,000.

When Ankari called up Ashish, the latter allegedly said that he is an army man working at the Nagpur airport. Ashish asked Ankari to send Rs1,000 as token amount for booking the moped, which he did, said cops.

On October 29, Ashish called up Ankari to Mangalmurti Chowk to get delivery of the bike but after waiting for a long time the former did not show up. After some time, Ashish called Ankari and asked him to send Rs2,020 needed to bring the vehicle out of the airport. When Ankari transferred the money, Ashish asked him to call his friend Pravin Kumar to get the vehicle’s delivery.

When Ankari called Kumar, he first sought the remaining money for the vehicle. Ankari sent Rs17,000 but Kumar again demanded money claiming some difficulties in bringing the two-wheeler out of the airport. Ankari sent Rs83,580 in total before he could realize that he has been duped.

The same day, Ankari filed a complaint with the cyber complaint cell (C3) of city police. Sources said the cyber cell officials did not take cognisance of the matter that time.

C3 officials had been regularly claiming that if a person is duped and he approaches them the same day, they can help him get the money back.

This is not the first time when the tricksters have posed as army men to dupe people.

Dehradun: The meat sellers of Dehradun on Saturday protested at the office of the district magistrate before issuing a memorandum in which they listed the problems they are facing in their business due to inspection drives carried out by the FDA and DMC officials.

The traders said that “the biggest headache” for them is a FSSAI norm that states that they can’t slaughter live poultry in their shops and they have to possess only the raw meat which gets slaughtered in an authorised slaughterhouse. Naseem Ahmed, a protester and a local meat seller, said, “There are no slaughterhouses for birds in Uttarakhand, so from where should we get our raw meat? The government should first come up with an authorised slaughterhouse before they ask us to abide by the rules.”

AGRA: The tryst will last just a couple of hours. But like an anxious, eager-to-please lover, Agra is going for a hurried beauty therapy. With barely 48 hours left for the rendezvous, the likely route of the US President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania to the Taj Mahal, is being waxed, body-scrubbed and face-lifted into shape.

Sewers are being cleaned. Roads have been widened, ornate flower pots placed on dividers. A rusty over-bridge of the colonial era was being spray-painted in metallic silver grey on Friday evening. Pavements encroachments have been removed and electric poles installed with Tricolor LED lights. An army of municipal workers have been nabbing stray cattle and sending to gaushalas. The WhatsApp joke doing rounds is that Trump should visit Agra more often, just to breathe life and activity into the somnolent civic authorities.

This will be Agra’s third dalliance with a US President. Dwight Eisenhower (1959) and Bill Clinton (2000) too were seduced by the charms of Taj Mahal, generally acknowledged as the world’s greatest monument of love.

This is Trump’s time. The city is teeming with monster banners welcoming the US President and the First Lady. There are also direct proclamations to the US President’s yaarana with PM Narendra Modi.

One of them picturing the two says, Do mahaan desh, ek bemisaal dosti (Two great nations, one matchless friendship). Another one goes, Bhagwan Shri Ram ki Dev Bhoomi mein aapka swagat hai (Welcome to the holy land of Lord Shri Ram). A third says, “Heartiest welcome to the land of Lord Krishna.”

Last year the Ardh Kumbh had turned the walls of Allahabad into an open-air art gallery. Parts of Agra now has the same feel. Hundreds of cultural, religious and modern motifs have been painted on boundary walls. One of them fawns over the US President showing him in a red tie and black coat, with the words, Atithi devo bhava. (The guest is like God). Closer to Taj Mahal, trees have been washed, their barks painted in white and brown.

As in Delhi’s Connaught Place during the 2010 Commonwealth Games, signboards of hundreds of shops on the scheduled route now sport a uniform white and brown look. “Eight days ago, they took away the old signboards at night and replaced them with new ones a few days later. The shutters in all the shops have been painted in cream and the steps in bright yellow,” says Iqbal Khan of Mesco Tailor. His shop is located close to the Kheria Air Base where Trump will land on Monday. Stationery shop owner Charantjit Singh admits that Agra’s state of cleanliness has improved due to Trump’s visit. “His visit has resulted in a series of developmental activities,” he said.

On Monday, about 25,000 school students will line up on either side of the road and wave US-India flags. At least 3,800 artistes from UP’s different regions will perform folk dances such as Rasiya, Saira and Dhubiya. Over 3,000 cops have been pressed into action for security. All leaves have been cancelled till Feb 26.

Kulwinder Kaur, who runs a stationery mart, is also impressed by the positive changes that the US President’s impending visit has brought to the city. About 500 kgs of silt has been taken out of the Yamuna river. About 950 cusecs of water is being released to provide the river with a brimful look and to remove the stench that affected the nearby areas.

But Kaur also has a question. “Why do you have to wait for Trump to clean up the city? We get so many tourists from abroad every day. Don’t they deserve a clean river and a clean city?” It is a question that the UP state government and local civic authorities can best answer.

AGRA: With the US President Donald Trump’s visit to the city of Taj hogging all the limelight of late, two women - Poonam Yadav and Deepti Sharma - from Agra made India proud on Friday. Their stellar performance against a formidable cricket team like Australia during Team India’s opening match of T20 World Cup ensured an upset win Down Under.Chasing only 133, Australia, the four-time champions of T20 World Cup, was cruising at 67 for two in 10th over, when 5.1 inches tall leg-spinner Poonam’s googlies demolished their tall batting order. The 28-year-old’s staggering four for 19 helped India coast to a relatively comfortable victory by 17 runs. Earlier, all-rounder Deepti had struck an unbeaten 49 in 46 balls which also proved to be crucial for the World Cup encounter.“Poonam caused havoc with her googly. In just 11 deliveries she took three wickets. For more than a year, she has been working hard on her googly, which was her weak point. She was guided for her bowling techniques by the former coach Ramesh Powar. Later, Narendra Hirwani worked on her googly skill,” said Poonam’s coach Manoj Kushwaha.Kushwaha added, “Her performance against Australia is also important because she underwent surgery of index finger of her left hand only one-and-a-half month ago. It was her first match after the injury and she came out with flying colours.”“Being just 5.1 inches tall with small size palm it’s very difficult to bowl leg spin, but Poonam used her structure to her strength. Now, she bowls well flighted deliveries and this has become her weapon now,” he also said.Daughter of retired Subedar Major Raghuvir Singh, who is now lecturer in Hathras-based Inter College , Poonam is the second youngest among four siblings which include two brothers. “Since childhood Poonam was good in sports. Initially, like every Indian parents coming from humble background, we too hesitated in sending her to sports, but when her coaches - M K Afghani (late), Manoj Kushwaha and Hemlata Kala - showed immense confidence in her, we decided to support Poonam in her endeavour,” said Raghuvir.Before her debut in international cricket in 2013, she joined Indian Railways as junior clerk in 2011 in Agra division of North Central Railway from sports quota. Currently, office superintendent of railway’s record department, the leg spin bowler is Uttar Pradesh ’s first woman cricketer to win the Arjuna award. After Friday’s performance, Rajeev Chaudhary, the general manager of north-central railway zone, congratulated Poonam.Meanwhile, Sumit Sharma, the elder brother of 22-year-old Deepti Sharma, said, “She has done fabulous work with the bat. The entire family is proud of her!”Former cricketer Sharma who currently runs a cricket academy said, “Deepti is a hard worker and never gives up. For nearly a decade, we both have worked hard to achieve what we have now. We use to practice 8 to 9 hours a day.

AURANGABAD: The Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) has decided to take Delhi’s model of developmental work to Maharashtra households , said state unit party president Ranga Rachure.

Rachure was in the city to see the party’s preparations for the upcoming Aurangabad Municipal Corporation election due in April this year.

He said that the AAP has already launched the campaign which would conclude on March 23.

A cellphone number has been given on which people can give a missed call to join the campaign to keep the country above petty politics, Rachure said.

He said that the Delhi model of AAP has proved by connecting with the people and addressing their basic issues.

He said that within 24 hours of announcing the cellphone number, the party received 11 lakh missed calls from different parts of the state.

The Delhi government has effectively provided basic amenities like electricity, water, education and health services. These services are lacking in their effectiveness in other states, he added.

Sugrive Munde, the Marathwada unit chief of the party, said that the party was getting an overwhelming response from the people in Maharashtra. During the campaign, the party was comparing Delhi’s successful development model of AAP with the other systems in the state so that people could see the difference. Munde also said that the party is planning to contest the civic body elections and that the implementation of Delhi model was not difficult if people cooperate with the AAP.

CHENNAI: Two people including an autorickshaw driver were murdered in separate incidents on Friday and Saturday, police said.

In an incident at Otteri , an autorickshaw driver N Dhanraj, 32, was murdered by a gang outside in-law’s house on Friday. The gang had an enmity with Dhanaraj’s brothers-in-law — Vigneshkumar, Rajeshkumar and Yogeshkumar, who were allegedly into illicit sale of liquor — over ‘mamool’ money. A few days ago, the brothers orally complained about the men to the Pulianthope police, when the gang came to know about it they landed at their home. Since the brothers were not present, they attacked Dhanraj and his wife Sabari, who managed to escape into the house.

Dhanraj was rushed to Government Stanley Hospital, but died without responding to treatment around 11.30pm. Police registered a case and secured six suspects — K Samuel, 20, A Paul Praveen, 26, R Vinoth, 24, R Vicky, 21, K Thilakraj, 23, B Ajay, 19. They were remanded in judicial custody and a hunt has been launched for the rest.

Separately, a man, who was found dead near Koyambedu flyover, has been identified as Dhanasekar, 42, of Madurai. Police arrested 19-year-old Jayakumar based on his call records. Investigation revealed the duo had recently become friends and would often smoke ganja together.

Since Jayakumar did not have a phone, he gave his mother’s number to Dhanasekar to contact him. Dhanasekar kept calling the teenager’s mother at odd hours and began making lewd propositions to her.

When Jayakumar came to know about it he invited Dhanasekar to their regular spot. Jayakumar along with his friend Karthik attacked him with a bottle and strangled him to death, dumping his body on the roadside. Jayakumar has been remanded in judicial custody, a hunt is on for Karthik.

Thiruvananthapuram: Two fishermen , who set out for fishing from Veli in a motorized boat, had a close shave when their net got tangled in a cargo vessel that passed by and they were forced to tag along for some distance. Jerry (53) and Aloysius (54) from Veli and Vettucaud respectively are the fishermen, who went through the ordeal.

The incident happened on Thursday evening around 7pm, 33km off Valiya Veli coast. The men had left around 4pm. After reaching their spot, they cast their net and dozed off. They woke up sensing the boat’s unusual rocking movement and found themselves being dragged by a ship. They found it hard to maintain balance and sustained minor injuries crashing on to the boat’s side. They screamed and tried to raise an alarm and after a while people on the ship noticed them and cut them free.

Vizhinjam coastal police said that the incident came to light on Friday morning when the duo returned ashore. They went to the general hospital and took first aid.

Vizhinjam SI E Shanibas said as per the GPS of the fishermen, the incident happened in international shipping channel. The vessel involved in the incident was going from Kollam to Kanyakumari. “No case was registered as there was no collision. The fishermen as well as the boat are unharmed,” he said, adding that fishermen on small boats are not allowed to go beyond 12 nautical miles (22km) off the coast. But, many venture into international waters as catch is less in areas close to the shore.

T Peter, general secretary of National Fish Workers Forum, said there was mistake on both sides. Vessels often move close to the shore in order to stay within mobile phone network coverage. But, this puts the lives of fishermen at risk. “Fishermen who use small boats have to be careful. They must install metal rods on their boats so that radars of the ships will detect them and know their presence,” he said.

PUNE: The Savitribai Phule Pune University ’s move to increase the fee by Rs50 for answer sheet re-evaluation and photocopying has met with objections from multiple quarters.It is compulsory for students to apply for a photocopy of the answer sheet if they want to apply for re-evaluation. The department officials said that approximately 40,000 students apply for re-evaluation every year.“Why should the fee be different for professional and non-professional courses? When the student gets a change in marks because the university did not check the papers correctly the first time, they don’t even get a refund,” said Vivek Velankar, president of Sajag Nagrik Manch.He said that the citizens’ group has demanded a roll back in the fee revision and for parity in the fee for professional and non-professional courses. “We want the university to refund the fee in case of change in marks and strike down the rule that makes photocopying a must for re-evaluation,” he said.Various student organizations have also demanded striking down of the fee hike and have threatened to go on strike. “There have been too many cases in which evaluations have been faulty. If the university refuses to rollback the fee hike, we will protest in the management council meet,” stated members of a student organization.Mahesh Kakade, director, Board of Examinations and Evaluation said, “Around 40,000 students apply for re-evaluation per year. They are given an option of getting the photocopy in their mail as a soft copy or as hard copy from the department. When the students apply for photocopy, verification of the marks obtained is done by the subject expert before issuing the photocopy. This is helpful for students to decide whether to apply for re-evaluation or not.”Former director of the board Arvind Shaligram justified the fee hike. He said, “There has been no increase in the fee for the past 10 or so years. Meanwhile, all other costs have gone up by at least 30%. There is a difference in the re-evaluation fee for professional and non-professional courses because the remuneration given to the evaluators of professional courses is also higher than the non-professional courses.”",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74264008,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-127428,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/fee-for-re-evaluation-photocopy-up-by-rs-50/articleshow/74261623.cms

AHMEDABAD: Exactly two weeks after seven people were charred to death in a fire in Narol, the Ahmedabad Fire and Emergency Services (AFES) on Saturday recovered the bodies of three youths from a textile unit in Odhav GIDC area. The trio died due to asphyxiation, investigators say.

According to Ahmedabad Fire and Emergency Services (AFES), they got a call from the Lotus Label unit near Sachcha Sauda Petrol Pump in Odhav at 3.08pm. “Considering the intensity of fire and the nature of the area — several chemical and manufacturing companies are neaby — 14 vehicles were pressed into the fire-fighting operation. The flames were doused in about three hours,” said a senior AFES official.

M F Dastoor, chief fire officer of AFES, said that the three bodies were found in a cabin on the third floor. “The unit had a lot of yarn spools on the third floor, likely a storage area, which had caught fire and had caused a lot of smoke. It is likely that the trio inhaled a lot of smoke due to which they died of asphyxia,” he said. “The unit makes labels that are attached to readymade garments. The trio worked and lived on the premises.”

The deceased were identified as Kamesh Singh, Dayanidhi Khunti and Chinmay Khunti.

R G Jadeja, inspector of Odhav police station, said that they have initiated the procedure to register an FIR against the company officials under IPC Section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder). “Forensic science experts will be roped in to ascertain the cause of the fire and whether negligence had led to the fire.

Sources privy to the development said the fire had started on the lower floor and caused an LPG cylinder to explode, which led to the rapid spread of the fire. “There was no opening, just one entry point and a few windows, due to which the smoke was trapped inside,” said an AFES official.

PUNE: The civic body has devised a new plan to revive the stamping out of single-use plastic items from the city.The new order would remain in effect from February 25 to May 1 this year, a Pune Municipal Corporation ( PMC ) official said. The move can be seen as an attempt to resuscitate the erstwhile drive implemented in June 2018 by the Maharashtra government to phase out plastic usage.The PMC officials said the plan was to outlaw single-use plastic banners and standees in all the government offices, make “Say No To Plastic” announcements at religious places, Shivajinagar station, Swargate bus stand and Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited buses and theatres, among others. Plans are also afoot to make organizations like the retail associations, Indian Medical Association Pune and Pune Saraf Association, among others, take an “oath” against banned plastic items usage, another PMC official said.The official said soon the SWaCH workers would conduct a door-to-door collection drive. “Investigations against those selling plastic bags at signals and sidewalks in the city are also on,” the official said.The move comes after the state environment department told the civic bodies to impose a blanket ban on single-use plastic after May 1 this year, following a proposal submitted to the department on February 20.“According to the directive, a plastic waste management committee would be formed. The panel would comprise an official from the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board , representatives from educational institutions working in the field of environment, representatives from National Society for Clean Cities and National Chemical Laboratory, and plastic, hotel and grocery associations, among others,” an official from the PMC’s solid waste department told TOI on Friday.The official also said a separate committee would be formed in each of the five PMC zones in the city. “Each panel would be headed by the zonal commissioner and comprise ward officers, health officials, members of NGOs and Mohalla Samiti representatives. They would be responsible for acting against the violators through seizure and fines, ” the official added.In line with the state government’s three-stage penalty structure, the first-time offenders would be fined Rs5,000. It would double to Rs10,000 for the second offence. Third-time offenders would face Rs25,000 penalty and a jail term of up to three months.“We had created a squad to impose the plastic ban in Pune in June 2018. Fines amounting to Rs1.5 crore was collected from citizens and businesses,” the official added.Activists said the failure of the previous drive called for more serious measures to fix the loopholes that emerge during the implementation.“The previous attempt to eliminate plastic usage proved ineffective, as such items have resurfaced in the markets. The civic administration needs to provide alternatives for the items they plan to outlaw,” sustainability researcher Gurudas Nulkar said.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74262625,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-607964,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-to-revive-single-use-plastic-ban-drive-from-feb-25/articleshow/74261615.cms

BIJNOR: Residents of Bhogpur village in Bijnor ’s Najibabad area heaved a sigh of relief after learning that the leopard the villagers had killed on January 6 was the same which had claimed six lives from November 27 till the first week of January in the district. A report confirmed that the leopard killed was the killer after six weeks of investigation by the forest authorities.

As many as 80 villagers were booked for shooting dead the leopard after it attacked and killed a schoolboy at Bhogpur village.Though there is no official announcement of withdrawal of the cases, the villagers hope to be absolved of the charges of killing the big cat.

According to forest officials, the killer leopard was identified using camera traps and matching its picture and pugmarks with those of the dead leopard. Both matched, proving it was the same leopard the forest department was trying to capture.

Giving details, Bijnor divisional forest officer M Semmaran claimed, “The first death occurred on November 27 in Nagina Dehat area when a woman was collecting fodder. The second attack took place on December 17 in Prempuri of Najibabad, third in Alam Saray on December 19, fourth in Asgarpur on December 25, fifth at Mohandiya village (Bijnor tehsil) on December 26 and sixth at Bhogpur village on January 6. We have studied all the incidents and correlated them. Prima facie, we have found that the same leopard claimed six human lives.”

Since November, fear of attacks had gripped the entire district. Farmers feared venturing out to their fields to harvest their cane crop.

Interestingly, the report has put to rest the view that the leopards spotted at Mohandiya village area, where one person was killed, were killers. The forest department had set up several cages and installed camera traps in different places to capture the killerleopard. It helped them to rule out those big cats that had strayed near human habitations area and zero in on the killer leopard.

Another factor that helped forest officials to determine that the killer leopard was dead was that no human being has been killed in the district after January 6. As Semmaran put it, “After January 6, no casualty was reported from any village proving that theleopard killed by the villagers was the real culprit. There are many leopards in sugarcane fields but they are healthy and innocent. But our operation will continue. We have been urging all farmers to take precaution.”

An estimated 100 leopards are said to live amid the cane the fields in Bijnor. Normally, these shy big cats keep away from humans.

The DFO added, “We have already formed a leopard task force in the district for quick action to capture leopards if spotted near populated areas.”

The bodies are said to be in decomposed state. The girl, identified as Kanika, belonged to Dehradun while the other youth, Himanshu, was from Muzaffarnagar .

Himanshu’s father Sukhbir Singh said, “My son Himanshu along with his friends Nishant, Anmol, Srishti, Kanika and Harshit were travelling from Dehradun to Delhi. After the accident, Anmol and Harshit somehow managed to come out but the other four were washed away due to fast moving waters. While bodies of Nishant and Srishti were found a few km away a week later, bodies of my son’s and Kanika were untraceable.”

On Saturday, station in-charge of Sikandrabad police station, Dilip Singh, said, “We first spotted the body of a male who was identified as Himanshu. We then started looking for the other as well.

HYDERABAD: Now that the JBS-MGBS Metro route is on track, there has been a spurt in demand for running the service in various routes crisscrossing the city and extending it beyond the city. These demands have been made by residents of various colonies. The residents got a shot in the arm with people’s representatives and political parties also supporting their demand.Official sources said requests had come for providing Metro Rail connectivity from Paradise to Medchal, Parade grounds to Alwal-Bolarum, Miyapur to Patancheru, LB Nagar to Hayathnagar , Taranaka to ECIL and Nagole to LB Nagar. While Hyderabad is expanding in all directions towards Warangal highway, Medchal and Kompally and Sangareddy, the present Metro connectivity mainly covers core city. Locals also want Metro connectivity from MGBS to Falaknuma.Admitting that there have been many requests for expansion of Metro, HMRL managing director NVS Reddy told TOI, “The government is keenly examining phase II and chief minister will take a call soon.”Municipal administration minister KT Rama Rao had said that the state would take up phase II connecting Rajiv Gandhi International Airport in Shamshabad. The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation submitted detailed project reports (DPRs) on Raidurg-RGIA stretch, along Outer Ring Road covering 31km, BHEL-Lakdikapul stretch, via Hafeezpet, Kondapur, Rethibowli and Mehdipatnam extending to 26km, and the Nagole-LB Nagar stretch connecting the link between the two Metro Rail ends.While the government has got DPRs prepared for 62km in phase II, there have been demands for extension of connectivity to 80km. Officials in the municipal administration department said phase II would cost close to `20,000 crore. The project was delayed as government could not decide whether to opt for a public-private partnership or take up loans.There was also a proposal on Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) for IT employees.

PUNE: A PMPML bus hit four two-wheelers, an autorickshaw and three cars on Paud Road at Paramhans Nagar Chowk after its brakes failed on Friday evening.

The Kothrud police said a woman scooter rider, Aditi Kulkarni of Paud Road, sustained serious injuries in the accident. She has been admitted to a hospital.

The Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) bus was heading towards Paud Phata from Kothrud bus depot at around 6.30pm when the accidents happened and had around 15 passengers on board, police said.

Another scooter rider, Shachi Dandwate (20) of Kothrud, lodged a complaint with the police following which the PMPML bus driver was booked.

Police said the brakes of the bus, bound for Sukhsagarnagar from Kothrud, failed before reaching Paud Phata.

The construction work of the Metro project is underway on the road where the accidents occurred. Since the road was a narrow one, the bus driver did not have the space to manoeuvre the bus safely after realizing that the brakes were not functioning, a police officer said.

He hit three cars, an autorickshaw and, two motorcycles and two scooters before ramming the bus into the barricades at the Metro work site, where it finally came to a stop.

Police suspect that the driver initiated the bus journey from the Kothrud depot without checking the brakes. The bus has been impounded by the Kothrud police. It awaits a thorough inspection by vehicle experts at the RTO and PMPML offices.

Thiruvananthapuram: Last month, Tamil Nadu native K Abdulla, who settled at Kadakkal in Kollam, was in the news after he had donated an acre to the panchayat for constructing houses for the homeless under Life Mission .

A similar act of kindness followed from Attingal on Thursday when a couple walked into the office of chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan and donated 25 cents to chief minister’s distress relief fund ( CMDRF ) for the construction of houses for the homeless. Appukuttan Nair (80) and his wife Sukumari Nair (71) from Avanavanchery handed over the land documents to Vijayan.

The 25 cents the couple donated to the project is at Uzhamalakkal village in Nedumangad. The couple, who had worked in the US in the medical field, had bought the land using their savings. They now shuttle between Chicago where their children live and their house at Avanavanchery.

Sukumari said that it is not their first contribution to CMDRF as they had donated funds earlier too.

During the trip this year, they decided to contribute to CMDRF and thought about donating the vacant plot at Nedumangad. “The thought that the vacant plot would be beneficial for the construction of houses for the homeless people led us to give it as our contribution to CMDRF. We are just sharing what we received from God with others. We hope the many people will be benefit from it,” she said.

Mentioning their contribution to CMDRF, the chief minister in a Facebook post said that some incidents bring great happiness and solace, especially working with people who rise to the occasion, understanding the situation of the state. “I am happy to receive the land documents for CMDRF and thank them for their initiative,"" he wrote.

MUZAFFARNAGAR: With unrestrained breeding of street dogs in Muzaffarnagar district , cases of dog bites are also on the rise creating acute shortage of anti-rabies injection in district hospital so much so that chief medical officer’s (CMO) office has now pasted a notice on the hospital walls stating, ‘The department has run out of anti-rabies injections. They will be administered only after we get the fresh lot.’

Sources said the hospital is facing an acute shortage of injections for a long time but the hospital’s administration has claimed the injections have not been in stock for 10 days. While over 100 dog bite cases are being reported at the district hospital daily, the patients are being advised to purchase the injections from the market.

One such patient, Ravindra Kumar , who was bitten by a dog, said, “I came to district hospital after being bitten by a dog, but the doctor told me that anti-rabies injections have run out. Now, I have to buy from the market.” A seven-year-old girl was also sent back from the hospital without any injection on Thursday.

Sources further said that these anti-rabies injections, which should be provided soon after a dog bite, are available at medical stores in the market for about Rs 300.

On the latest shortage, chief medical officer (CMO) of district hospital Parveen Kumar Chopra said on Saturday, “We have demanded anti-rabies injections from Lucknow. We are yet to receive it. We will be able to provide these injections in the next 3-4 days.”

Notably, hundreds of stray dogs could be seen roaming on the streets across the district. These dogs mainly attack pedestrians or bike riders. More than 100 people are bitten by dogs every day here.

Nagar Palika executive officer (EO) Vinay Kumar Tripathi said, “We have formed a joint panel of the health department and Nagar Palika to deal with the issue. A meeting will be held next week.”

“We had a detailed discussion with the party’s functionaries on the chances we stand,” said Muzaffar Hussain while speaking to the media.

He said that the party has decided to contest the civic body polls on local issues. “The party workers discussed the organization of rallies in the city, the names of leaders to be invited for the campaigning.

Ahmedabad: An error in the spelling of ‘prescribed’ forced Gujarat University (GU) to issue fresh degree certificates to 2,200 medical students. The issue emerged when a medical faculty student complained that the degree certificate bore the word ‘prescirbed’ instead of ‘prescribed’.

Gujarat University immediately decided to withdraw all certificates, bearing the signature of the chancellor, issued to medical and dental students. GU statutes make the governor of the state the chancellor of GU.

Officials at GU said it seems no checks were performed performed before the certificates finally laminated and had security codes assigned to each. “It is the responsibility of the contracted agency to check for errors but in this case the agency failed to perform its duty,” the officer said.

Himanshu Pandya, vice-chancellor of the University, said, “We will have to withdraw 2,200-odd certificates. An agency is entrusted with the responsibility for checking but in this case the agency has failed. We will deduct money from the payment and will even initiate action. Many students are to go for higher studies and these certificates will be issued as soon as possible.”

The students even called on governor Acharya Devvrat and informed him of the error. University officials in their internal inquiry admitted that there was an error on their part as they too were to perform a check of the proof. Errors in names are acceptable but this is an error in all the certificates.

AGRA: According to Uttar Pradesh Police, recent arrest of some terrorists has revealed that Students’ Islamic Movement of India (SIMI) has link with Al Qaeda, and is a possible threat to Donald Trump and other US dignitaries.

Police have flagged neighbouring Aligarh district as the epicentre of their activities and claimed that SIMI’s motives are to abduct US authorities, diplomats in order to free Pakistani national Aafia Siddiqui from a US jail.

Siddiqui, a Pakistani neuroscientist with degrees from MIT and Brandeis University, was convicted of seven counts of attempted murder and assault of US personnel, and is serving her 86-year sentence at the Federal Medical Center, Texas.

Her name popped up on US wanted list during an interrogation of Pakistani Islamist militant Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. In 2008, she was arrested in Afghanistan and was accused of trying to shoot American soldiers and was sent for trial to New York .

According to police, SIMI operative Abu Faizal, who was arrested by Madhya Pradesh police a few years ago, had claimed that one of the motives of a designated terrorist organisation was to abduct US high ranking officials and diplomats in order to free Aafia.

After the Khandwa jailbreak on October 2, 2013 when some terrorists fled jail, UP Police claimed that Faizal’s friends who were part of SIMI are still at large.

The police also highlighted that nearly 25,000 Shia Muslims in Agra , who are angry over the death of Iranian major general Qasem Soleimani of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in a US drone attack, might stage heavy protest and asked its officials and policemen to maintain ultra-level of alert on any suspicious movement.

TOI has learnt that Trump will be accompanied by US Ambassador, US secretary (commerce), White House officials and others during his February 24 visit to Agra. A fleet of nearly 40 vehicles will escort Trump and the first lady to Taj Mahal.

According to police sources, nearly 600 duty points have identified where close to 3,000 cops will be deployed. A total of 3,200 cops, including 1,200 Agra policemen, will be deployed on the entire route for the umbrella protection of US President. The security perimeter will include around 250 NSG commandos, two anti-terrorism squads, nine superintendents of police, 18 additional superintendents of police, 55 circle officers, 132 inspectors, 450 sub-inspectors, 50 women sub-inspectors, 100 women constables, 2,000 constables, 10 each PAC and RAF companies and one flood company which will guard the Yamuna.

While there are products sold for making the laborious job easy, there are various farm processes where there is tremendous scope for mechanization. Tapping upon this need with a bottom-up approach, Ahmedabad-based startup, Sickle Innovations, identifies farm processes and exact needs of farmers and customises agriculture equipment for them.Past JourneyFounded by product design graduates from Indian Institute of Sciences (IISc), Bangalore, Nitin Gupta and Vinay Reddy, along with an MBA from Institute of Rural Management Anand (IRMA), Malik Kumar, Sickle Innovations was incorporated in 2014. Initially incubated at Centre for Innovation, Incubation and Entrepreneurship (CIIE), the company now manufactures an array of crop protection devices, machines used for weeding and sorting of crops.“Farmers of different crops have different requirements. It’s never a one-size fits all. We have a dedicated team for research which interacts with farmers and identifies their requirements,” said Gupta.The company is also working with several state governments.Sickle Innovations is also the recipient of the National Entrepreneurship Award in 2019, by the Union ministry for skill development and entrepreneurship. The company has manufactured and retailed some 10,000 units of various products, out of its 6,000 square feet manufacturing facility in Gandhinagar.Next StepsCurrently working with some 10,000 farmers across northern India in Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Haryana and Punjab, the startup plans to extrapolate its presence to other Indian states in the years to come. “Our expertise has been in the Himalayan states currently and we plan to expand to other states including those in the North East and Uttarakhand,” said Gupta.ChallengesPoor awareness about new technology is a challenge according to Gupta. “Creating awareness about the new technology is a challenge. Not many farmers are well-versed with new ways of farming and therefore, they need to be educated to do the same,” said Gupta.Secret to SuccessStriving to create value for the farmers is something that has worked for the company. “The core philosophy is to address farmers’ needs through innovation and not giving them a pre-designed product.

Dehradun: More than 100 people fell sick after consuming food at a feast in Basantipur area of Udham Singh Nagar district. Majority of the sick locals were admitted to a Gadarpur-based community health centre on Friday. The others were taken to private facilities by their kin. Doctors treating these people suspect it be a case of food poisoning.

A health department team led by district’s CMO Shailja Bhatt visited the site along with a district administration team to find out the real cause behind this mass illness but the food samples were already junked leaving no scope for inspection of the food served at the feast. “The food was served during the death anniversary of a local resident on Thursday night and the symptoms of sickness like vomiting and illness started surfacing by Friday,” Bhatt told TOI.

As many as 99 patients were screened by the health department team and administered treatment. “In all probability, the cause behind so many people getting sick was stale food. We have asked the patients and their family members to maintain hygiene standards,” added Bhatt.

Meanwhile, Basantipur’s gram pradhan has alleged that the villagers fell sick after consuming a Shivratri feast on Friday evening.

AURANGABAD: The cyber cell of the city police has cautioned citizens against downloading the mobile applications that facilitate online remote support and collaboration on the instruction of unknown callers.

Kailash Deshmane, the in-charge of the cyber cell at the Aurangabad police commissionerate, on Thursday said that such apps are used by fraudsters to steal money from online payment wallets, bank accounts, debit or credit cards etc, police said.

“In some of the latest cases, the fraudsters have been found to sending SMSes telling people that their online payment wallets would get blocked if they do not submit KYC details for the account. Or they offer help for activation of wallet apps. the fraudsters then ask their targets to download mobile apps for online remote support and collaboration. After following the further instructions, the targets end up losing money,” he said.

Deshmane said ‘TeamViewer QuickSupport’ mobile application was found to have been used by cybercriminals while stealing money online.

“The ‘TeamViewer QuickSupport’ allows remote control of mobile devices, allowing the next person on a call to access the device as if it was in his own hands. We would like to make citizens aware that this application is misused by fraudsters to access bank details through mobile phones. Never download the application on instruction from an unknown user,” he said.

Another mobile application ‘Blizz by TeamViewer’ has been also misused by fraudsters for committing online fraud, the police said.

A 52-year old man from Ramchandra Nagar was recently duped of Rs 49,999 by cybercriminals on the pretext of activating one of the popular payment gateways. In an FIR registered with the Jawahar Nagar police station, the complainant said that he received a call from phone number 6202469646 on February 9 and was asked to download ‘Quick Support’ mobile application to activate the wallet.

Representative image

AHMEDABAD: Gold and silver jewellery worth Rs 30 lakh was stolen from a locker of the IDBI bank’s Navrangpura branch. Interestingly, when the locker was opened with the help of a drill machine in presence of the owner, the bank officials found Rs 101 and an image of the Goddess Vaibhavi Laxmi.

The complainant, Trupti Mehta, 48, is a project manager with the environment department in Raleigh, North Carolina, in the US.

According to the FIR, Mehta has had the locker since 2016. “She had kept 14 gold jewellery articles and 22 silver articles in it before going to the US. In 2017, when she came back to India, she kept two gold bangles and a gold pendant of about 50g in it. At that time, all jewellery was still there,” said a police source.

Police said Mehta had kept about 600g of gold jewellery and 8kg of silver jewellery in the locker.

Mehta stated in her complaint that she came back from the US on January 1 this year and went to the bank on February 12. “Despite making several attempts to open the locker in presence of bank officials, she was unable to open it.

The bank requested her to come the next day so that they could break open the locker,” said a police official.

Mehta went to the bank the next day but the bank officials failed to open the locker with keys. Then it was decided to break open the locker.

Police have lodged a complaint under Sections 380 and 114 of the IPC, which means more than one person is involved in the burglary. “The thieves’ access to the locker room points towards the role of some insiders,” said inspector P B Desai of Navrangpura police station.

Mehta has stated in the FIR that while the bank employees were breaking open the locker with a drill, she saw scratch marks on the locker next to hers. “This means that someone had attempted to force open the locker,” said a police official.

Nine excavators, three gas-cutters and over 50 civic labourers and ward officials carried out the demolition in a day. The civic team had sought police protection.

Assistant municipal commissioner (K east ward) Prashant Sapkale said there were several complaints and unauthorised tour operators would stop private buses there, causing traffic jams.

“A shed was set up near the halt. We demolished the unauthorised extensions, which made the service road inoperative,” he said. He added that in some cases, advertising name plates were projecting onto the footpath area. Among the shops demolished, 44 were being operated by tour operators.

Advocate and activist Godfrey Pimenta said the marble shop-owners would many times park vehicles on the service road, which added to the congestion.

CHANDIGARH: Three students were killed and two injured when a fire tore through an illegal paying guest (PG) accommodation in Sector 32 in Chandigarh on Saturday.

Around 10-12 girls out of 30 residing in the two-storey residential building were in their makeshift rooms around 4pm when the fire broke out on the first floor owing to a suspected short-circuit. A caretaker’s relative claimed they rescued some girls but failed to find the three as the fire intensified and rooms got filled with smoke.

The victims were identified as Riya (19), of Kapurthala , Punjab , Prakshi Grover (20), of Kotkapura , Punjab, and Muskan (21), of Hisar, Haryana .

Four fire tenders took almost one and a half hours to douse the flames. The first floor was gutted. The PG was functioning since August 2018 when the house owner, Gaurav Aneja, had sub-let it to Nitesh Bansal to run the business. Police said action would be taken against the owner after an inquiry.

HYDERABAD: After considering the request of conjoined twins Veena and Vani , the Telangana education department has decided to allow them to appear for the secondary school certificate (SSC) (class 10) examination separately.

Initially, officials were not sure whether to consider the girls as one or two individuals given that they are joined at the head. Medically, however, it is well established that conjoined twins are two separate individuals who are born physically attached.

B Venkata Narasamma , district education officer of Hyderabad, said that they will be issued separate hall tickets and provided with scribes, if needed. “In November 2019, we had written to the state government for its direction on Veena and Vani’s case,” said Narasamma, adding that the decision, however, was made finally at the district level itself.

“The twins were keen on appearing for the examination separately,” she said.

However, district child welfare officer K Jhansi, who is taking care of the conjoined twins, said that they were yet to receive any communication from the education department. The conjoined twins spent a major part of their lives at Niloufer Hospital. At the age of 12, they were shifted to a state home.

VISAKHAPATNAM: The rythu bazaars in Visakhapatnam account for the sale of almost 12 tonnes of mango per day during the 45-day mango season every summer. According to estimates, close to 550 tonnes of mangoes are bought by customers just from the rythu bazaars alone. However, among the 13 rythu bazaars in the city, only one has a fruit ripening chamber, while the rest do not.

The largest rythu bazaars in the city are the MVP Rythu Bazaar, the Seethammadhara Rythu Bazaar and the Gopalapatnam Rythu Bazaar. All three account for roughly 50% of the fruit sales, especially mango. However, the ripening process is yet to be done in a transparent and scientific manner as only MVP Rythu Bazaar has a ripening chamber, which was inaugurated in 2015 on a pilot basis during the previous regime.

One of the many reasons why people fear buying mangoes from open markets and street vendors is because of the manner in which the ripening process takes place. According to sources in the wholesale market, almost all traders who take mango orchards on lease, use calcium carbide (CA C2) to ripen almost all the orchard fruits sold in the market. In case of mango, the usage is rampant and this chemical has arsenic and phosphorous, which are harmful to human beings.

“Most farmers who sell fruits in the rythu bazaars sell ripe fruits. In many cases, the ripening is done at the wholesale yards and sometimes even at the orchards, so that they can be quickly sold in the local markets. This means that the ripening process cannot be supervised,” observed a source in the Seethammadhara Rythu Bazaar.

There is also another issue regarding the usage of the ripening chamber, Nalla Maharaju, the estate officer of the MVP Rythu Bazaar said, “Most trader-farmers prefer not to use the chamber because the ripening process does not happen in one go and in a uniform manner. More importantly we charge Rs 2 per crate (20 kilos) and the traders try to cut costs, as a result they do not use the chamber extensively.”

Sources pointed out that if all major rythu bazaars in the city have ripening chambers, they could bring more farmers to use them and eventually press them to sell fruit, ripened in a proper manner.

Explaining the problem, M Kaleswara Rao, the AD said, “Space is a major constraint. Only MVP and Gopalapatnam have enough space for both cold storage and ripening chambers. In the case of Gopalapatnam, the cold storage is used chiefly by fish vendors.”

Sources in the department pointed out that the chances of another ripening chamber coming up are slim.

On a tip-off, Air Intelligence Unit officials on Wednesday intercepted Kumar who was under surveillance. They had information that an official was to take some contraband from a transit passenger in the toilet near gate 44 at the departure area. ""We identified the transit passenger who arrived from Dubai and was to fly to Bangkok and another who arrived from Bangkok and was to fly to Dubai. Many passengers, staff and officials entered the toilet and exited but an official from the immigration entered with a suspicious bag which strengthened our belief."" said an officer.

A check of the bag resulted in recovery of six gold peices weighing around 2.5 kg and worth Rs 91 lakh.

Officials said that nobody would to the toilet with a bag during working hours. The passenger too was arrested.

""Normally Immigration officers are not checked at the airport. So, some officers working there are getting involved in smuggling."" said a senior officer.

Stephen Anurag Prathipathi

VISAKHAPATNAM: For the first time, a student from Andhra Pradesh has been selected for the Clinton Global Initiative University scheme, which is for the next generation of leaders and social entrepreneurs. Vizag-based Stephen Anurag Prathipathi—who is currently pursuing MSc Public Policy and Management from King’s College, London—is one among the three selected for the global initiative from King’s College.

Stephen was selected for his inclusive approach to agriculture in the Rayalaseema region of Andhra Pradesh. Stephen said his aim is to sustain farming by supporting local farmers to introduce millet production alongside the cultivation of rice. Fellows are required to commit to addressing a pressing local or global challenge through a measurable project that would be developed either individually or with peers.

Speaking about his project, Stephen spoke about how he plans to make agriculture more sustainable in Rayalaseema. “Since Rayalaseema is a drought-prone area, it would be more sustainable to grow millets instead of rice as they require less water to grow. It is also a more nutritious crop,” Stephen told STOI.

The 26-year-old, who interned with the UN Information Centre for India and Bhutan, said: “This initiative should not affect the tradition of paddy growing. So, I will encourage farmers to cultivate millets in a small portion of their land and let them experience the difference and gauge market demand. I will also ideate and envision establishment of millets processing units to produce nutri-bars, jams, butter, bread, and the like, and develop export channels to international markets.”

Selected fellows will have access to training and mentorship opportunities, potential funding streams provided by partner organisations to help them deliver the project.

The fellows have also been invited to participate in an annual networking meeting. This year’s meeting, hosted by former US President Bill Clinton and CGI founding member Chelsea Clinton, will take place in Edinburgh in April.

The posters at the gates of Garden Enclave in Vasant Vihar, Thane, and Rasraj Heights, Borivli West

MUMBAI: In a show of support for the Centre’s amended citizenship rules, certain housing societies in Mumbai and Thane have begun to display banners endorsing CAA, NRC and NPR. The sentiment is fuelled, some say, by the prolonged dharna against CAA-NRCNPR in Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh.

Posters are visible in Gujarati-dominated Mulund, Borivli and Thane, and messages are being circulated on a few society WhatsApp groups. Plus, pro-CAA citizens in Bhayander have decided to take out a rally in Bhayander on Sunday to back CAA.

A couple of pro-CAA banners are strung on both gates of Shree Rasraj Heights, a highrise at Borivli West. The 17-storey building houses Gujarati and Jain members.

The society management was not available for comment when a TOI correspondent visited on Saturday. But one resident, Dipti Bhavik Shah said, “Yes, we are silently making a strong statement. If opponents of these laws can hold rallies and dharnas, can we not at least put up banners? Citizenship has several benefits. Outsiders keep coming to India without fear of being stopped. Why are their native countries not developed so they don’t feel the need to migrate? I agree some Indians will be inconvenienced by CAA too, but things will settle down in a few months.”

Former BJP MP Kirit Somaiya told TOI on Saturday that his party had conducted a ""good campaign"" during last few weeks to ""create awareness and commitment"" on CAA. ""The main thrust of the BJP campaign is to expose a strategic negative campaign by opposition parties and by a section of the society. What the opposition is doing is engineering a wrong campaign to create a myth, a fear psychosis among a particular community and so-called liberals,"" he said.

In Thane, a residential complex, Garden Enclave in Vasant Vihar, has expressed support to CAA-NRC and put a poster on its gate declaring its affiliation. Office-bearers of the society said there has been a lot of “misleading information” about CAA, and they felt the need to voice support. “Core members of our society committee decided to do so as we feel the issue has been politicised and given a religious angle on social media. The idea is not to (merely) put up a banner but to encourage healthy discussion among residents. We are also planning to hold a session to give more information about the Act,” said Viraj Deshpande, chairman of Garden Enclave Federation.

Organiser of the Bhayander residents’ rally, Suresh Patel of NGO Aadhaar Seva Sanstha, said they felt the need to endorse the “positive Act by the Centre in the face of anti-CAA sentiment.” “Ours is a non-political organisation so we will not carry party flags. We have prepared banners favouring the new laws.” he said. The Bhayander rally will start from Maxus Mall police chowky at 10am, onward to MTNL and 90 Ft Road and end at 11am.

Residents and shop-owners of a building on Babasaheb Ambedkar Road, Mulund West, received a video in Gujarati on their society WhatsApp group advocating CAA and NRC. The voiceover said, “I went to meet an old friend. The building watchman made me wait, opened a register and made me write my name, mobile number, time, number of the flat I wanted to visit, purpose, and took my autograph. He asked where I was from and called my friend’s flat to verify. It was after my friend approved I was allowed to enter the building. The process took 5 minutes. I realised that to meet an old friend, I have to provide basic information for the safety of that society. So if government seeks information from people who come from other countries and settle here, what is wrong in that... I support CAA, I support NRC.”

425,['23/02/2020'],Trump in India visit: Why India may be Donald’s trump card,"The US pivot to Asia has been almost a decade in the making. But for the past two decades, the more significant development has been the Indian pivot to the US. This change of direction, after almost half a century of “tilt” towards Russia, has meant that on a geopolitical level, India is quietly reorienting its approach, outlook and policies to reflect the growing convergence with the US.Donald Trump may be the most transactional US president till date, but he has largely upheld the traditional American understanding that India’s global rise is a good thing because a successful India would be a powerful democratic counter-balance to an expansionist and authoritarian China.This matches India’s own notion that it was the only natural balancing power to China in Asia. That was one of the reasons behind the US using its global heft in an unprecedented move to lift India’s nuclear pariah status. Since then, India has been integrating itself into the global technology regimes, which it had been denied. As former PM Manmohan Singh observed while returning from signing the deal in 2005, “The nuclear deal will do for India in strategic and technology terms what the 1991 economic reforms did for its economy.”When Modi came to power in 2014, his overt investment in the US could not be missed. He built a solid relationship with Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama and over the past three years, has assiduously worked on Trump. Going beyond the trade difficulties, the Modi government moved from crafting a joint strategic vision for Indian Ocean and Asia-Pacific in January 2015 to aligning their Indo-Pacific policies by 2019. In 2018, the Pentagon articulated what it called a “three-pronged” strategy of maritime cooperation with India — a shared vision on maritime security, upgrading bilateral maritime security partnership and collaborating to build regional capacity and improve regional maritime domain awareness. In the past few years, India has built its own complementary strategy.As Ashley Tellis points out in an article for Foreign Affairs, “The Trump administration’s focus on great-power competition, its designation of China as a strategic competitor, and its pursuit of a ‘free and open Indo-Pacific’ all gave India renewed importance.”What this showed was the growing convergence between the two asymmetrical powers on strategic affairs — as the US took on China in the South China Sea, India has been slowly but surely building up its own capabilities in the Indian Ocean, both with the aim of balancing China’s rise. India has been building its own alliances in the Indo-Pacific region — with France, Australia, Indonesia, Vietnam and Singapore, all with huge overlaps with the US. India’s closest strategic partner in Asia is Japan, which, together with the US, forms the core of the Indo-Pacific.India has also accommodated the US in its immediate neighbourhood, from Nepal to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, as both powers work to limit China’s influence. In the past few months, both the US and India have independently been reaching out to the Central Asian states, building networks that provide alternatives to Chinese expansionism — the US also wants to limit Russia’s influence, but India is happy to give Russia a lead position there. This flexibility has worked well for India, while the US is slowly learning to live with India’s independent strategic vision that includes Russia and Iran .Three areas — energy, defence, and people — provide the underpinnings for the new and improved India-US strategic partnership. India is diversifying its energy basket away from the Gulf by buying more oil and gas from the US. The US has become one of India’s biggest defence suppliers. Underlying this geopolitical convergence is the obvious affinity of the Indian people for the US, which has meant 4 million Indian Americans, 200,000 students who form the backbone of the strategic partnership. That is for any US administration to cash in, because it ties India closer to America in the most fundamental of ways.Tellis says, “India and the US are far from becoming formal allies. They are dogged by persistent trade disagreements, which India shows no inclination to settle. But given Trump’s record with other US allies, his administration has been surprisingly lenient when it comes to India’s uncompetitive trade practices. It has also kept mum about India’s feared drift toward illiberalism, enabling both countries to push ahead on strategic, especially defence, cooperation, which has always been the lodestar that guides US-Indian relations.”",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74262393,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-398155,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/why-india-may-be-donalds-trump-card/articleshow/74262391.cms

MUMBAI: The Mumbai Port Trust’s hospital at Wadala is all set for a revamp. A revamped super-specialty healthcare facility — Grand Port Hospital — with 600 bed is likely to come up by October 2024.Last week, the Mumbai Port Trust awarded a Rs 693-crore project to upgrade its existing 241-bed hospital into a state-of-the-art superspecialty hospital. The revamped hospital will have 300 beds and another 300 in a building which is slated to be built. The project envisages development of a medical college in the last phase besides further scope for expansion.The tender that was invited for this public-privatepartnership project has been bagged by M/s Ajeenkya D Y Patil Infra Pvt Ltd.MbPT chairman Sanjay Bhatia said the existing hospital will be restructured with various super-speciality facilities. He said it will have 40 ICCU beds, 10 dialysis beds, a 25-bed casualty/ emergency rooms and a operation theatre complex with five theatres and a cardiac cath lab. “All diagnostic facilities like CT scan, MRI, mamography , ultrasound, an advanced pathology department will also be made functional. The new firm will take over the hospital for the project from April 1,” he said.The hospital will cater to healthcare needs of not only MbPT beneficiaries but also the general public. With the Ro-Roservice and transharbour link coming up, the people in areas beyond linked by these services can easily avail the health facilities.“The present hospital acts like a tertiary care centre and refers patients to various super-specialty hospitals. Operations including those for fractures, knee replacement and cataract take place at the hospital but for cardiological, neurological and other critical ailments, patients are referred outside,” said an MbPT official.“The developer will have initial 30 years to earn returns on his investment followed by another 30 years provided further expansion is given. In the initial phases the existing 241 bed hospital is being developed into a 300 bedded super speciality hospital on PPP basis. In the next phase, development of separate 300 bedded super speciality hospital with all advanced super-speciality services will take place.

429,['23/02/2020'],"Krishna Bose, 3-time MP and Netaji kin, dies at 89","This story is from February 23, 2020

Kolkata: Three-time Lok Sabha MP and academic Krishna Bose passed away at a city hospital on Saturday. Krishna, 89, was suffering from age-related ailments. She is survived by sons Sugata and Sumantra and daughter Sarmila.

Born to constitutional studies specialist Charu Chandra Chaudhuri in 1930 at Dacca, now in Bangladesh, Krishna was married to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose’s nephew Sisir Bose. The latter drove the car in which Netaji made his ‘Great Escape’ on January 16, 1941.

Krishna was chairperson of Netaji Research Bureau. An expert on Netaji, she wrote quite a few books, namely ‘A True Love Story — Emilie and Subhas’, that throws light on the little-known facts about Netaji’s life. Her memoirs, ‘Lost Addresses’, portrays the story of her childhood, adolescence and young adulthood. The book vividly describes Calcutta (now Kolkata), Bengal and India in the 1930s and 1940s and the early years after Independence.

Krishna taught at City College for 40 years and then served as principal for another eight years. She was elected to the Lok Sabha on a Congress ticket from Jadavpur for the first time in 1996, then in 1998 and also in 1999 on the Trinamool Congress symbol. During her stint in Lok Sabha, Krishna served as chairperson of the committee on external affairs and was a member of a host of LS panels, namely the committee on official language, general purposes committee.

Chief minister Mamata Banerjee condoled Krishna’s death, calling her “the mother to the entire Trinamool family”. “I lost someone respected, loved and admired by me. Saddened and shocked to hear about the demise of Krishna Basu, ex-TMC MP & wife of freedom fighter Dr Sisir Bose. Being a part of Netaji's family, she was a revered social reformer, renowned poet & a courageous educationalist,” the CM tweeted.

Nobel laureate Amartya Sen expressed his profound grief and paid condolence to Sugata. Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar condoled Krishna’s demise, calling her a ”towering personality”. Krishna’s colleague and Trinamool leader in Lok Sabha Sudip Bandyopadhyay recalled her sterling contribution in Lok Sabha.

KOLKATA/SERAMPORE: The Polba carpool accident claimed the life of one of the injured kids, seven-year-old Rishav Singh, eight days after the vehicle — carrying 15 schoolchildren and travelling at a speed of 90 kmph — crashed into a ditch beside Delhi Road.Rishav, a student of class II, died of multi-organ failure at SSKM Hospital on Saturday morning, prompting cops to slap the charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder on vehicle owner Shamim Akhtar. Another carpool driver in Kolkata was found drunk while ferrying kids to school a couple of days after the Polba crash and one more accident involving a pool car on the same day, triggered a Kolkata Police crackdown.Rishav was admitted to SSKM Hospital on Friday itself and put on ventilation after sustaining multiple rib fractures and haemorrhage in the lungs. He had also swallowed mud and dirty water.SSKM Hospital medical superintendent and vice-principal Raghunath Misra said: “His lung damage was beyond salvation and other organs started failing gradually. A team of specialists from eight departments could not save him.”But the other seriously injured kid, six-year-old Divyansh Bhaghat, who was admitted to SSKM Hospital along with Rishav, was showing signs of improvement, doctors said. Admitted to the trauma care centre, he is now out of ventilation and is being fed orally.Rishav’s death has sparked a demand for greater monitoring of how carpools operate and their drivers behave on the road. “I never thought Rishav would leave us so soon,” his dad, Serampore Municipality councillor Santosh Singh, said.“Carpools will ply. But owners and drivers should not let business override safety,” he added.Serampore MP Kalyan Bandyopadhyay, too, stressed on the need for tighter surveillance. “There is an immediate need for stringent legislation to regulate and discipline carpool owners and drivers,” he added.Hooghly superintendent of police Tathagata Ray said that the driver, Pabitra Das, would continue to be under watch in hospital.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74262421,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-558503,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/7-yr-old-injured-in-polba-carpool-crash-dies-after-8-day-battle/articleshow/74262129.cms
431,['23/02/2020'],Kolkata: Milk prices set for another big jump,"Allowing imports of 50,000-1,00,000 MT of skimmed milk powder at the prevailing international rate of Rs 200/k... Read More

KOLKATA: Milk prices in the city look set to head further north this summer. Scarcity of raw milk coupled with a surge in the price of skimmed milk powder may lead to another round of hike in prices from April, traditionally the beginning of the lean period for raw milk production. The rise could be in the magnitude of 10%-15%, say industry insiders.Milk prices in Kolkata went up by Rs 5-6 in the first week of December, with toned and double toned milk selling in the range of Rs 40-43 per litre.Eastern India, particularly Bengal, is deficit in raw milk and is largely dependent on skimmed milk powder to keep the supply flowing. Most leading dairies in the state use skimmed milk powder to make up for the deficit in raw milk. However, there has been a 100% rise in the price of skimmed milk powder over the past three months.“The price initially went up from Rs 150/kg to Rs 350/kg but has now settled at Rs 300/kg. Most dairies have already revised prices by Rs 5-6 but are still incurring losses,” an industry veteran said. He pointed out that April-October is the lean period for raw milk production in the east and northeast, which is why high rates of skimmed milk powder will affect the region more.Interestingly, the global price of skimmed milk powder is down to Rs 200 following reduced demand in China in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. But the Centre has so far not allowed import. Amul, a cooperative brand managed by the Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation, is the biggest supplier of skimmed milk powder in India and is reportedly not in favour of import.Mayank Jalan, CMD of Keventer Group that owns Metro Dairy , said: “Due to erratic weather conditions we are facing an acute shortage of skimmed milk powder and prices have more than doubled in the last four months. It is critical in this time of shortage for the government to allow a limited quantity of import for a limited period of time. This will ensure price stability.”Pradip Mitra, general secretary of Mother Dairy (Calcutta) employees’ union, said the company is struggling to keep productions at an optimum level. The state-controlled company was the only one to refrain from hiking prices in December. “Our prices are much lower than that of competitors. We have asked the management to bring the prices at par with the competition,” Mitra said.ITC, which has recently forayed into fresh dairy in Kolkata, also admitted that availability of fresh milk is a challenge. “Our agri business division is currently working with farmers in Bengal to improve milk yields and our focus is on strengthening and scaling up the supply chain to ensure availability of fresh milk, which is currently a challenge for the entire industry,” a spokesperson for the company said.Amul, Metro Dairy, Mother Dairy, Red Cow, ITC are among the major players in the Kolkata milk market, with Amul being the leader.“Allowing imports of 50,000-1,00,000MT of skimmed milk powder at the prevailing international rate of Rs 200/kg can help regulate the price of the powder in the domestic market,” said a National Dairy Development Board official.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74263205,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-842822,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/milk-prices-set-for-another-big-jump/articleshow/74262120.cms

433,['23/02/2020'],ICSE nod to individual paper recheck,"This story is from February 23, 2020

Kolkata: Starting this year, the ICSE candidates for the subjects that have more than one paper, will be able to apply for a recheck of their individual papers instead of applying for the recheck of the subjects as a whole. Thus, for the science subject, the candidates will have the option of applying to recheck individually, for Physics, Chemistry or Biology. The same will apply for the subjects English and History, Civics and Geography.

In ICSE, students have to appear in 100 marks each for Physics, Chemistry and Biology examinations which are then clubbed together and awarded a combined weightage of 100 marks under the Science category. Similarly, History & Civics and Geography is of 200 marks which are clubbed together under HCG and separate examinations of English Literature and Language is put together under English subject with a weightage of 100 marks. Mathematics is a separate subject on another 100 marks.

“If a student now decides to recheck only a single subject paper after being dissatisfied with the marks awarded in the ICSE then they can do so. Earlier, it took the CISCE a long process since all the subject components have to be rechecked if a candidate applied for either Science, HCG or English,” said a principal who attended the meet.

Another teacher pointed out that even the time to recheck papers is likely to be considerably reduced with the decision of the Council.

This apart, after granting affiliation to more than 2500 schools, Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations which has its presence in foreign countries is set to open its first affiliated school in Italy, at Rome this year.

The decisions were announced by the chief executive and secretary of the CISCE at The Association of Heads of Anglo Indian Schools West Bengal branch’s meeting in the St. James School on Saturday.

This is also the first year when the Council has sent question papers to all affiliating schools to hold the annual examinations of classes IX and XI. Some principals added that on Saturday some of them requested Arathoon to send model answers as well as marking pattern for the annual examination question papers set by the Council. “The CISCE is, however reluctant, to do so since they would not want to turn the annual examinations similar to a board conducted examination,” the source pointed out.

The Council is also building a new office in Hyderabad which will be the nodal centre for schools in South and West of the country.

434,['23/02/2020'],Barrackpore corp move may unsettle political equations,"This story is from February 23, 2020

Barrackpore: The state government’s plan to bring eight municipalities under Barrackpore subdivision is likely to stall civic polls in this part of North 24 Parganas. The proposal was broached two months ago.

A look at the municipalities to be brought under the proposed Barrackpore Municipal Corporation (BMC) — Titagarh, Bhatpara, Naihati, Barrackpore, North Barrackpore, Kanchrapara, Halisahar and Garulia — throws up a political context. These were the municipalities that switched loyalties to BJP soon after Trinamool-turned-BJP leader Arjun Singh won the Barrackpore Lok Sabha seat in 2019. All these municipalities have returned to TMC.

The state government plans to include two gram panchayats in BMC — Mohanpur and Sewli, both run by TMC. Barrackpore SDO Abul Kalam Azad Islam has written to the heads of the municipalities and gram panchayats, asking them to furnish a detailed note on population, fund allocation, expenditure and how the civic bodies function. “The state government is all set to merge the eight municipalities and two gram panchayats into a corporation with headquarters at Barrackpore. The process will take a couple of weeks,” said TMC Panihati MLA and district observer Nirmal Ghosh.

Political parties in North 24 Parganas are back to their drawing boards, planning ways to address the emerging situation. The abolition of eight chairman posts and two pradhan posts is likely to create bad blood. BJP is eyeing the disgruntled while TMC is confident of overcoming the initial glitches.

435,['23/02/2020'],The perfect scam script: Railways job racket planned meticulously to con many over 10 years without cover being blown,"This story is from February 23, 2020

GHAZIABAD: A person posing as a doctor walking around the corridors of Delhi’s Northern Central Railway Hospital is greeted by a fake job agent and escorts a railway job applicant to an isolated spot to take blood samples. “We will do the rest,” the candidate is told.

As the backroom workings of the multi-crore fake railway jobs scam unfold, the meticulousness with which everything was planned — from stationery to medical tests and the real stipends they paid through the entire fake training period — was possibly why it went undetected for 10 years. “The stamps and letterhead could even be genuine, sourced illegally through railway employees. Railway employees may have been involved,” a police officer said on Saturday.

Working out the modus operandi of what appears to be an inter-state gang, police said the first phase of the operations was standard: “Emails, pamphlets and newspaper ads would announce job vacancies, with a contact number for those interested,” said Ramesh Rana, station house officer of Tronica City police station. They would be given a form to fill, the official part of things, and a bank account to transfer money to, the unofficial part of things. The understanding? A sum of money paid to these “job agents” would secure the job.

The money transfer would set the ball rolling on the rest. A forged letter from the Indian Railways , resembling the original down to the last detail, would inform the candidate that they should be “present personally for Medical Examination”. “Northern Railway Central Hospital, Basant Ln, Railway Colony, Paharganj, New Delhi”, for instance, was where applicants in Delhi would report. At the hospital, the fake doctor would take samples and set the candidate on their way.

But what if the medical test went wrong? The agency promised it would take care of that. For Rs 1 lakh. Or Rs 2 lakh. Depending on how badly you wanted it. A month after the medical test, candidate would get a training letter. Contact our associates, they would be told. The contact number would only be shared on email — no trail need be longer than it has to be.

Preparation for the “job” at hand would begin at a training centre set up near a railway station. Ghaziabad police said such fake centres have been traced in Delhi, Ghaziabad, Bengaluru and Chennai.

In batches of five, the candidates would go over things they “need to know for their jobs” with “professional trainers” — also part of the setup. “The trainer would talk about work management, the corporate sector and then go on to an overview of the Indian railways, its history, and a bit about trains and coaches,” he added.

The training would take two months. The full sum of money would only be paid, in cash or transferred to a bank account, after the training was over. “The accused used one SIM card for one candidate. When all of this was over, the number would just be switched off and go out of service, leaving no way to track them again,” Rana said.

In the 10 years that Hitesh ran the scam, he duped at least 300 people of Rs 5-8 crore. The going rate was Rs 20 lakh for the post of assistant station master, Rs 15 lakh for a ticket collector’s job and Rs 10 lakh for group C&D posts. Police put this together on the basis of a book seized from the accused, naming 330 victims.

The money would be collected in phases, as each step progressed — a tacit assurance on the part of the scamsters. “The candidates would be asked to deposit 40-50% of the money at the beginning. The rest would be paid later,” Rana said. For the “official” side of things, too, candidates would be given specific instructions. “The accused would also ask candidates to get their documents signed by gazetted officers when they came in for medical tests or the training,” Rana said. All in keeping with the appearance of protocol.

Every paper, every mail was an example of excellent forgery. “The fake documents and ads were all elaborate, which may have been why so many people fell for them,” Rana said. The advertisements or pamphlets, for instance, would be worded differently than the emails. The “official” documents, like call for medical examination or appointment letters, would be drafted well — the Indian Railways logo perfectly in place, no font and no sentence out of place. Police have seized the fake railway stamps, letter heads and envelopes.

The scale of the operations was also a reason the scam remained off the radar for so long. “Pamphlets were distributed in Bengaluru, Chennai, the accused told us … Training centres were across the country. So were medical centres,” said Rana. Each time the scam ran its course, the candidates may have approached police. But the cases would be so widely scattered that it would have been difficult to put them all together and draw the lines connecting them, police said. In fact, about 60% of the candidates were from southern India — Karnataka, Tamil Nadu , Kerala and Andhra Pradesh .

The accused have been booked for criminal conspiracy, cheating, counterfeiting government stamp, using as genuine a government stamp known to be a counterfeit, forgery of valuable security, forgery for purpose of cheating and using as genuine a forged electronic or paper document. Police said Hitesh, from Nagpur in Maharashtra, formed the gang in 2009. The purported leader of the gang, Vikar Ul, is from NCR and was arrested along with one more person on Friday.

KOLKATA/LUCKNOW: The Geological Survey of India (GSI) has said there has been no discovery of gold deposits of around 3,000 tonne in Sonbhadra district of UP, as claimed by a district mining official. “GSI has not estimated such kind of vast resource of gold deposits in Sonbhadra district. Such data has not been given by us,” GSI director general M Sridhar said on Saturday in Kolkata.

Sridhar added exploration for gold carried out in Sonbhadra region between 1998 and 2000 had not been encouraging. Sonbhadra district mining officer K K Rai had on Friday created a sensation when he claimed huge gold deposits had been found in Son Pahadi and Hardi. According to him, the deposits in Son Pahadi was estimated to be around 2,943.26 tonne, while that at Hardi block was 646.16 kg.

Sridhar said in its report after exploration in the district, GSI has estimated a probable category resource of 52,806.25 tonne of ore with 3.03 gm per tonne gold (average grade) for a strike length of 170m in Sub-Block-H, Son Pahadi. The total gold which can be extracted from the total resource is approximately 160kg and not 3350 tonne, as mentioned in news reports, the GSI clarified in a statement. The GSI DGM is likely to hold a press conference in Lucknow on Monday to clarify the issue.

‘Strange to see customers walk into our stores wearing masks’

It is impossible for the virus to enter our country through these Chinese products, say Doctors

It’s a busy weekday morning. But when we pull in to the usually bustling Jagadish market , the go-to destination for the city’s aam aadmi to get their mobiles fixed or snag the latest digital goodies, we’re surprised that we are able to find a parking spot rather easily. As we make our way through the market, we notice the shops are all lying empty; the shopkeepers are either busy playing PubG on their phones, chit-chatting or looking out into the street, bored and glassy-eyed.For a market that attracts over 30,000 customers every day, this is unusual. Anyone who’s been to Jagadish Market, Hyderabad’s largest wholesale mobile phone market in town, will know it’s almost impossible to hold a vendor’s attention for more than five minutes — such is the rush and demand. And yet today, the cacophony of bargaining customers is replaced by deafening silence. And no, the economy is not to be blamed this time. The reason for the sudden dip in business is as unusual as the sight of a deserted Jagadish Market — coronavirus Shop owners tell us that their business has dipped by a staggering 40 per cent in the last one month. Why? because people believe they might get coronavirus just by purchasing Chinese goods! “Aaj kal logaan aare ich nahi, sabko lagta hai Chinese products se corona waala virus aa jaayega,” Saleem, a shop owner tells us.The situation is just as bad at almost all wholesale and grey markets, including Gujarati Galli, Hong Kong Bazar and the many China Bazar stores spread across twin cities.Hyderabad Times speaks to reluctant shoppers and dejected shopkeepers to bring you the full story.Pehle se ich mera business kharab chalra tha. Par ab yeh corona ke chakkar main bahut zyaada nuksaan hora hai. One month ago, a woman walked up to my store and while buying something she said, ‘Isse woh corona waala virus toh aayega nahi na? Gharwaale mereko Chinese products mat khareedo bolre’. That’s when it struck me why our sales have dipped so drastically in recent times. Many have started avoiding our market thinking they will get infected with coronavirus because of it. On a normal day, 500 people would walk into our store, but now mushkil se some 50 come. Logaan aare ich nahi! – Mohammed Saleem, a shopowner at Jagadish market, who imports his products from Guangzhou ssscity in ChinaYeh WhatsApp main logaan galat news dere. Koi bol diya ki agar Chinese products khareed liye toh coronavirus aa jaayega! More than 40 per cent of my business has taken a hit because of such forwards. People look at me with a sense of fear, as if I too have been infected with the virus already and that I will infect more people by selling Chinese products. Padhe-likhe log bhi yeh sab cheeze maanre. Bahut takleef main hai hum logaan. – Aman Abdul, a businessman at the Gujarati GalliWhen the news of the virus was creating panic, even we were very scared since we live here amidst all these Chinese products. Jab se yeh coronavirus ka naam aaye hai, logaan China ka naam sunthe ich bhaag jaare. Hum log jhoot bolne lage ki hum woh samaan Mumbai se laaye, China se nahi. Par logaan phir bhi nahi maanre. There are hardly any customers willing to buy from us. For the last two weeks, we have decided not to import from China and depend on Korea and Hong Kong instead, but they are far more expensive. – Ajam Kareem, wholesale mobile spare part shop ownerA few days ago, two young women came to my shop wearing masks. When I asked them if they are suffering from the flu, they told me it is precautionary as they are visiting a ‘China Bazar’. Tab mujhe pata chala ki China main yeh coronavirus hua hai. I went into a total panic mode and contacted a doctor since we live here too. When the doctor told me that the virus does not get transmitted that way, I could actually feel myself breathing easy again. Par logon ko yeh cheez samjhaane main mushkil ho rahi hai!

438,['23/02/2020'],coronavirus: Coronavirus scare hits Chinese goods markets of Hyderabad real hard,"It’s a busy weekday morning. But when we pull in to the usually bustling Jagadish market , the go-to destination for the city’s aam aadmi to get their mobiles fixed or snag the latest digital goodies, we’re surprised that we are able to find a parking spot rather easily. As we make our way through the market, we notice the shops are all lying empty; the shopkeepers are either busy playing PubG on their phones, chit-chatting or looking out into the street, bored and glassy-eyed.For a market that attracts over 30,000 customers every day, this is unusual. Anyone who’s been to Jagadish Market, Hyderabad’s largest wholesale mobile phone market in town, will know it’s almost impossible to hold a vendor’s attention for more than five minutes — such is the rush and demand. And yet today, the cacophony of bargaining customers is replaced by deafening silence. And no, the economy is not to be blamed this time. The reason for the sudden dip in business is as unusual as the sight of a deserted Jagadish Market — coronavirus Shop owners tell us that their business has dipped by a staggering 40 per cent in the last one month. Why? because people believe they might get coronavirus just by purchasing Chinese goods! “Aaj kal logaan aare ich nahi, sabko lagta hai Chinese products se corona waala virus aa jaayega,” Saleem, a shop owner tells us.The situation is just as bad at almost all wholesale and grey markets, including Gujarati Galli, Hong Kong Bazar and the many China Bazar stores spread across twin cities.Hyderabad Times speaks to reluctant shoppers and dejected shopkeepers to bring you the full story.Pehle se ich mera business kharab chalra tha. Par ab yeh corona ke chakkar main bahut zyaada nuksaan hora hai. One month ago, a woman walked up to my store and while buying something she said, ‘Isse woh corona waala virus toh aayega nahi na? Gharwaale mereko Chinese products mat khareedo bolre’. That’s when it struck me why our sales have dipped so drastically in recent times. Many have started avoiding our market thinking they will get infected with coronavirus because of it. On a normal day, 500 people would walk into our store, but now mushkil se some 50 come. Logaan aare ich nahi! – Mohammed Saleem, a shopowner at Jagadish market, who imports his products from Guangzhou ssscity in ChinaYeh WhatsApp main logaan galat news dere. Koi bol diya ki agar Chinese products khareed liye toh coronavirus aa jaayega! More than 40 per cent of my business has taken a hit because of such forwards. People look at me with a sense of fear, as if I too have been infected with the virus already and that I will infect more people by selling Chinese products. Padhe-likhe log bhi yeh sab cheeze maanre. Bahut takleef main hai hum logaan. – Aman Abdul, a businessman at the Gujarati GalliWhen the news of the virus was creating panic, even we were very scared since we live here amidst all these Chinese products. Jab se yeh coronavirus ka naam aaye hai, logaan China ka naam sunthe ich bhaag jaare. Hum log jhoot bolne lage ki hum woh samaan Mumbai se laaye, China se nahi. Par logaan phir bhi nahi maanre. There are hardly any customers willing to buy from us. For the last two weeks, we have decided not to import from China and depend on Korea and Hong Kong instead, but they are far more expensive. – Ajam Kareem, wholesale mobile spare part shop ownerA few days ago, two young women came to my shop wearing masks. When I asked them if they are suffering from the flu, they told me it is precautionary as they are visiting a ‘China Bazar’. Tab mujhe pata chala ki China main yeh coronavirus hua hai. I went into a total panic mode and contacted a doctor since we live here too. When the doctor told me that the virus does not get transmitted that way, I could actually feel myself breathing easy again. Par logon ko yeh cheez samjhaane main mushkil ho rahi hai!

NAVI MUMBAI: A 40-year-old man from Mankhurd allegedly attempted to commit suicide by jumping from the Vashi creek bridge on Saturday morning. However, constable Ambadas Kedar who was on patrol duty near the bridge managed to rescue him.

Senior inspector Sanjeev Dhumal said, ""It was a reflex action by Kedar who rushed to the spot when he heard some people on the Vashi creek bridge shouting for help. Kedar saw a man about to drown in the creek right under the bridge and immediately got into the waters to save him. Kedar kept him floating till a fishermen with a boat reached them and both joined hands to bring the man ashore.""

Dhumal further said, ""The rescued man was taken to NMMC Hospital. Later, he revealed the reason for his drastic step. He claimed that he was having an extra-marital affair with a married woman in his locality and her husband had learnt about it. Hence, he was scared he would be harmed and tried to end his life.""

In another case, the Vashi police recovered the body of 19-year-old Vishal Mane, a Chembur resident, on Saturday, from Vashi creek, two days after he had jumped from the Vashi bridge .

Senior police inspector Sanjeev Dhumal said, ""Mane was unemployed and was habituated to consuming alcohol. On February 20, he had jumped from the Vashi creek bridge. We fished out his body after two days of search in the waters. He was upset after his mother married a second time and committed suicide due to embarrassment. We have registered an accidental death case.""

440,['23/02/2020'],Ghaziabad stamps department to recover duty on extra FAR,"This story is from February 23, 2020

GHAZIABAD: Keen to shore up revenues, the district stamps and registration department plans to recover from developers stamp duty pending on additional floor area ratio ( FAR ) purchased from the Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA).

Citing a government order, the department has sought from GDA details of all such developers who bought extra FAR in the past five years, officials said.

The state government, for the current fiscal, has set a target of Rs 16.74 crore as stamp duty, and the Ghaziabad stamps and registration department has so far met 85% of the target. If stamp duty on additional FAR is recovered from developers, officials believe it would help the department meet its annual revenue target.

AIG (stamps) KK Mishra told TOI that there’s a provision to pay stamp duty on additional FAR as per a 2015 government order (GO). “But the GO was never implemented as a group of 28 builders had in 2016 moved the Allahabad HC against it and secured a stay,” he said.

“However, we have now received fresh orders from the government for implementing the GO and so we have sought details from GDA of developers who availed purchasable FAR so that we could issue notices to them for recovery of pending stamp duty,” added Mishra.

The department, in the meantime, has referred the matter to the standing council over the status of the case that was filed by a consortium of builders.

The GDA normally allows 2.5 FAR, but a developer can seek up to 3.75 FAR from the development authority at an additional cost. which is 60% of the land cost in case of commercial property and 40% in case of group housing societies.

GDA’s chief architect and town planner Asheesh Shivpuri said they would definitely share details of the developers who purchased additional FAR since 2015.

But developers have slammed the latest move of the stamps and registry department. “In 2016, the HC had stayed the matter only after it saw merit in our case. Though the court has still not passed a final judgment in the case, we will oppose the move,” said Gaurav Gupta , president of CREDAI’s Ghaziabad chapter.

MUMBAI: The city’s public transport system is witnessing a “reverse migration” from autorickshaws to BEST buses . According to the latest estimates by BEST officials, nearly three lakh riders have migrated back from autos to the red buses over the past three months.For a few years now, BEST has been losing commuters to share autos—around 100 new stands were set up across suburbs. Auto ridership more than doubled from six lakh to over 12 lakh between 2016 and 2019, said sources, adding these numbers were now dipping.In the past three months alone, with the entry of small AC buses in the suburbs and the drastic reduction of fare — Rs 6 for AC bus ride for 5km — there has been a huge exodus from three-wheelers to buses. Auto ridership has fallen to around nine lakh and there are indications that it will shrink further, said sources.On the other hand, BEST’s daily commuter strength has increased from 32 lakh to around 35 lakh in the past three months, thanks to this reverse migration, said an official.Auto union leaders told TOI that it is a commuter-driven market where riders prefer both affordable fares and reliability. BEST recently introduced 525 services, including 325 AC mini buses, on feeder routes outside railway stations, connecting commercial business districts and thickly populated housing colonies.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74262412,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-647391,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/best-vapsi-buses-get-back-3-lakh-daily-auto-travellers-in-3-months/articleshow/74262402.cms

NAVI MUMBAI: A two-year-old boy died after a snake bit him at a civic garden in Sector 26, Vashi, on Wednesday around 6.30pm.

Sumeet Sonkamble, son of constable Viashal Sonkamble of Turbhe MIDC, had gone to the garden with his grandfather. What his grandfather assumed was an insect bite, turned out to be a snake bite as the boy began frothing and fell unconscious. The boy was declared brought dead at the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) hospital.

Corporator Usha Bhoir wrote to NMMC chief, blaming the boy's death on the poorly maintained civic gardens.

443,['23/02/2020'],"India, US defence deals: How defence partnership ringfences ties between India, US","File photo (An India-US joint military exercise in West Bengal in 2018)

NEW DELHI: Expansive defence cooperation has been, and will continue to be, the lodestar of wider India-US ties. Whether Bush Jr or Obama , or now Trump , bilateral defence ties have been on an upward trajectory for almost two decades now despite persisting disputes on other fronts like trade and tariffs.Consider this: starting virtually from scratch, US has notched up Indian defence deals worth $20 billion for aircraft, helicopters and howitzers in just the last 13 years, managing to displace India’s long-standing military supplier Russia for a few years. Several more deals worth over $7 billion are in the pipeline.These deals, though, are a small part of the ever-tightening strategic embrace between the two nations, both wary of the rise of an aggressive and expansionist China in the Indo-Pacific. From a flurry of joint exercises for greater interoperability between their armed forces to foundational military pacts, and operational intelligence-sharing to expanding security cooperation in the Indian Ocean Region, India and the US have set a scorching pace that has astounded many sceptics.But it’s not all hunky-dory. US is upset with India for inking the $5.43-billion deal for S-400 Triumf missile systems with Russia in October 2018, and then following it up with a $3-billion deal to lease an Akula-1 nuclear-powered attack submarine in March 2019.Besides, the Defence Technology and Trade Initiative (DTTI) between India and the US to co-develop and produce cutting-edge military technologies has failed to take off since being launched in 2012. But Indian and US officials contend DTTI is now being jump-started, with the two sides agreeing last October to focus on seven projects. These include a “short-term” one to develop drone swarms that can overwhelm enemy air defences and a “long-term” one on anti-drone technology called “counter-UAS rocket, artillery and mortar systems”.“DTTI will now steadily move forward. Moreover, there is also growing integration between Indian and American defence industries,” said a senior Indian official.Similarly, joint exercises, from the naval “Malabar” (with Japan as the third regular participant) to the counterterror “Vajra Prahar” and “Yudh Abhyas”, are becoming wider in scope, size and complexity. The two sides also held their first-ever tri-Service exercise, “Tiger Triumph”, in Bay of Bengal last November.India is now also moving towards finalising the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement for Geo-Spatial Cooperation (BECA), the fourth and final foundational pact with the US after the General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA) of 2002, the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) of 2016 and the Communications, Compatibility and Security Arrangement (COMCASA) of 2018.While LEMOA provides for reciprocal logistical support, COMCASA has paved the way for India to get greater access to military technologies. BECA will enable the US to share advanced satellite and topographical data for longrange navigation and missiletargeting with India. “The next meeting to discuss BECA will be in March. It will probably be ready for inking by next year,” said a senior official.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74264804,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-150313,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/how-defence-partnership-ringfences-ties-between-india-us/articleshow/74262419.cms

Vashram and Ramesh Sarvaiya, who work in their farms, frequently spot lions.

AHMEDABAD: Two of the four Dalit men who were battered and paraded half-naked in Una for skinning a cow killed by a lion have now started a big cat patrol to curb attacks on livestock. Three-and-a-half years ago, Vashram and Ramesh Sarvaiya along with their two siblings were flogged by self-proclaimed gau rakshaks.

After the July 2016 atrocity against them in Una, the Sarvaiyas used to share videos and messages on various social media platforms to raise awareness about the suppression of Dalits. Many of their messages also related to Lord Buddha.

But on February 17, they shared a video of a lion and a lioness roaming across a farm. They say they have been regularly posting lion alerts for the past three months now.

Vashram and Ramesh, who work in their farms, frequently spot lions. These days they either share the videos of the sightings on various WhatsApp groups of villagers or inform cattle owners concerned about the threat.

“Lions are commonplace in the fields in Mota Samadhiyala in Una taluka of Gir-Somanth district,” Vashram said, adding, “These lions sometimes kill cattle and so we want to maintain a vigil and save livestock.”

He said that usually his younger brother, Ramesh, shoots and disseminates the videos of lions.

Ramesh, who recently shot a video of a lion couple, says the number of predator lions is on the rise. “People have sheds for their animals. But lions prey on stray cattle,” he said. “If people want to protect their livestock, lions ought to be closely watched.”

As for the 2016 atrocity, CID (crime) had found that the cow being skinned by the Sarvaiyas had been killed by a lion.

Imports shot up 10 times to $35.6 billion in the same period.While imports from the US have grown faster than Indian exports to the US, President Donald Trump is not satisfied. He has slammed India, seeking to drive a better bargain to push American goods, while seeking to restrict the entry of goods and software professionals into the US.Ahead of his visit, Trump made his intentions clear, accusing India of “hitting” the US “very hard” with high import duties. He had previously called India “tariff king” as his administration drove a hard bargain to restore preferential tariffs through the generalised system of preferences (GSP) scheme, a facility that was withdrawn last June.For the last 18 months, India has been seeking to buy peace with the US, with negotiations picking up pace after the Narendra Modi government returned to office last May. Despite the Trump-Modi chemistry and commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal ’s equations with US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, the two sides have failed to clinch a deal, which was “almost ready” when Modi was in New York last September.At the time, medical devices were the sticking point. With no breakthrough in sight, the government agreed to carve out a special dispensation to benefit American stents and knee implants. It also decided to lower import duty on high-end bikes and food products like almonds and apples that were part of India’s “retaliatory tariffs” in response to higher customs duty on its aluminium and steel shipments to the US. Lighthizer and his team were, however, not happy with what was expected to be a $10-billion trade deal.India had also signalled its willingness to engage in a free trade agreement with the US after it decided to disengage from the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) to create what would have been a mega Asia-Pacific trade bloc.Officials said American ambitions had grown over the last few months, prompting India to seek and “accommodate” more demands. For instance, the government agreed to allow the entry of distillers dried grain with solubles, the controversial genetically modified animal feed. American negotiators began pressing for lower tariffs too. The story was repeated across several other product segments and the Americans were seen to be raising new demands and reopening what were seen to be settled issues.Around January, it was decided that it was crucial to draw the red lines and Modi himself reportedly made the stand clear internally.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74262427,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-280694,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/bargain-hunting-prez-to-press-delhi-hard/articleshow/74262428.cms

US President Donald Trump ’s first visit to India, also the first standalone visit by any US president to the country, comes at a time the Indo-US relationship has evolved into India’s most consequential strategic partnership. As foreign secretary Harsh Shringla said recently, whether in countering terrorism or ensuring a peaceful Indo-Pacific, India and US have unprecedented convergence of interests.

The two countries have more than 50 bilateral inter-governmental dialogue mechanisms for exchange of views on issues of mutual interest, many of them at the ministerial level.

While defence and counter-terror cooperation has dominated headlines in the recent past, relations are equally robust in other areas like science and technology, space, energy, education, diaspora and regional and international cooperation.

The scope of the relationship has a large people-to-people component. “The size of the Indian diaspora in the US is estimated at around 4 million, with a million of NRIs. There are more than 200,000 Indian students in the US. There is comprehensive engagement among our academics, scientists, professionals and other stakeholders,” said Shringla last week.

According to MEA, both countries are collaborating and coordinating on a number of regional and global issues in both security as well as development spheres. They are also engaged in areas such as maritime and cyber security, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief efforts. The US has expressed support for India’s permanent membership on a reformed United Nations Security Council and for India’s early membership in the Nuclear Suppliers Group .

The fisherfolk are also being denied access to the inter-tidal fishing areas such as the area opposite Worli D... Read More

MUMBAI: Fisherfolk from Worli approached the Supreme Court for a stay on the reclamation work for Mumbai’s coastal road and to vacate a stay it granted last December to a Bombay high court judgment.

They claim that ever since the SC stayed the HC order “irreversible damage is being caused to coastal ecosystems and livelihoods” due to the reclamation work that commenced “at a rapid pace”.

The kolis in their plea now say that the ongoing work is destroying “breeding grounds and habitat of a variety of marine fauna and various large and small fish that come to shallow coastal areas including lobsters, prawns, pomfret and crabs.”

The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear it on Tuesday.

Worli Koliwada Nakhwa Maatsya Vyavasay Sakhari Society had originally petitioned the Bombay high court against reclamation work for coastal road last year, citing adverse impact on their customary fishing rights and coastal ecosystem.

In July 2019, a bench of then Bombay high court Chief Justice Pradeep Nandrajog and Justice Nitin Jamdar, after hearing a bunch of petitions, had set aside a 2017 CRZ clearance for the project by the environment ministry. The HC held that it requires a green nod under provisions of Environmental Impact Assessment 2006 which would also involve a public consultation where the fisherfolk could be heard.

The civic body, project contractors Larsen & Toubro and HCC-HDC JV had challenged the HC order before the SC. On December 17, a bench of Chief Justice of India Sharad Bobde and Justices Bhushan Gavai and Surya Kant had considered the “balance of convenience, prima facie case and irreparable damage” and stayed the HC order.

It had allowed the work on reclamation of land and for the contractors to “build the road thereon and to secure the road”. But posting the matter to April directed them “not to carry out any other development work until further orders”.

The new plea submits that the ongoing work is in “violation of ” various conditions of the 2017 CRZ clearance which stipulate “no fishing activity be hampered”. It points to an expert report of last March which says that “tidal pools in inter-tidal area also also a nursery for juvenile fish”. Also, that “damage to the rocky outcrop is also leading to the destruction of oyster beds, affecting the livelihood of local hand-pickers, mainly fisherwomen.”

“The fisherfolk are also being denied access to the inter-tidal fishing areas such as the area opposite Worli Dairy at Worli, which are currently be reclaimed. They are also being restrained from casting their nets in these areas,” the application says. Besides, it says without a nod under the Wildlife Protection Act, reclamation could not begin.

And relying on reports to back their case that reclamation is resulting in damage, it wants the SC to set a date to hear the pending appeals soon submitting that else it might lead to a “fait accompli situation”.

Barcoding will help quicken identification

AHMEDABAD: Wildlife crime investigators usually spend days to know if the seized animal products belong to specie protected under the Wildlife Act. A scientist at Gujarat Forensic Sciences University (GFSU) in Gandhinagar has devised a DNA barcode which can tell if the seized meat, nail, fur, horns etc belong to musk deer of Himalaya or a blackbuck from Gujarat.In fact, the DNA barcode can identify all the seven species and over a dozen sub-species of the ungulate family.A doctoral research by Malay Shukla has created a repository of DNA barcoding and Forensically Informative Nucleotide Sequencing (FINS) for ungulates. The study was carried out in collaboration with a team of researchers from Wildlife Institute of India (WII).The study aimed to reduce the time taken in identification of the species, which would range from 15 days to over a month. Samples also ran the risk of deteriorating during transition from crime scene,” said Malay Shukla.Barcoding can not only identify ungulate species but also reveal its natural habitat. “If a musk deer’s pod is seized, we can also tell from which region of the Himalayas it came,” said Shukla. Dr J M Vyas, director general of GFSU, said that wildlife forensics is new field and DNA is one of the most trusted methods for identification. “The will would be very useful in quicker identification of species in poaching cases,” Malay Shukla said.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74262472,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-234734,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/oh-deer-gujarat-man-makes-dna-repository-for-quick-identification/articleshow/74262425.cms
