Working with such legends is a blessing. These judges just took me into their fold like a warm hug.

Even as they are all praise for the Korean film, many among them feel that it is very similar to a Tamil film KS Ravikumar ’s Minsara Kanna, starring Vijay in the lead. Social media is agog with posts and memes, suggesting how these two share uncannily similar storylines. Parasite, which won awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay and Best International Feature Film at the 92nd Academy Awards, is about how a poor family of four infiltrates a wealthy household as workers and feeds off them.Many people claim that the storyline is borrowed from the 1999 romantic drama Minsara Kanna, in which a young millionaire and his family take up work as household helps at his girlfriend’s home to convince her sister to get them married. The film also stars Khushbu, Monica Castelino, Rambha, Manivannan and Karan, among others, and is known for Deva’s melodic scores.We asked KS Ravikumar what he thinks of the comparison, and he told us, “I haven’t seen Parasite, but going by what people are saying, I think I should feel happy that I selected an Oscar-worthy story 20 years ago. It’s not just me, even Vijay really loved the story and we had a great time making the film.

8,['13/02/2020'],"FIRs against ex-NRC official, Hajela amid row over missing data","This story is from February 13, 2020

GUWAHATI: A day after it emerged that Assam's updated citizenship data had vanished from the website ""nrcassam.nic.in"", the state NRC coordinator's office on Wednesday filed an FIR against a former official for allegedly not ""surrendering"" the central data access password in her custody before quitting the job in the wake of her ex-boss Prateek Hajela 's transfer.

In another FIR filed by the NGO Assam Public Works, former NRC coordinator Hajela was accused of ""cyber crime"" during the six-year NRC exercise conducted under his supervision. ""We have requested the CID to register a case against Hajela for tampering with valuable public records and conduct an inquiry into his involvement in cyber crime during the process of updating the NRC,"" said Abhijit Sarma, president of the NGO behind the 2009 petition that led the SC to order the exercise.

While the ministry of home affairs said the citizenship data uploaded to the official website last October was ""safe but no longer visible because of some technical issues"", NRC staff here maintained that the cloud-storage blackout was caused by a delay in renewing the subscription for services provided by Wipro. ""The Bengaluru-headquartered company has claimed pending dues totalling Rs 70 crore, which includes the cloud-storage subscription fee. Our estimate is about Rs 60 crore. We are in the process of reconciling this,"" an official said.

In a statement, Wipro said, ""The IT Services Contract was not renewed by the authorities upon its expiry in October 2019. However, as a gesture of goodwill, Wipro continued to pay the hosting service fee until January-end 2020.""

NRC officials said the subscription couldn't be renewed on time as there was no coordinator after Hajela's inter-cadre deputation to MP on the Supreme Court's orders. They declined to say if there was any link between the data not being currently visible on the website and the FIR filed against a former colleague.

""We have filed a complaint against a former NRC official for violating the Official Secrets Act. Since she did not surrender the access password, even authorised officers are unable to access the system,"" a source said.

9,['13/02/2020'],PM Modi at Times Now Summit: Better to set stiff target than to drift without aim,"Stating that just 1.5 crore people pay taxes in the country, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday made a strong appeal to citizens to take a pledge to pay their taxes honestly, keeping in mind the sacrifice of those who laid down their lives for the freedom of the nation. “We will be celebrating 75 years of our Independence in 2022. I urge you to align your personal objectives with this great occasion,” Modi told the First Times Now Summit .He said the government was making a strong effort to make India a tax-compliant society. “In the past four-five years, a lot of work has been done but there is a long way to go,” Modi said.The PM said last year, 1.5 crore cars were sold and more than 3 crore people travelled overseas for business or leisure. He said across the country there were many professionals who were lawyers, doctors and chartered accountants but only 2,200 professionals declared annual income above Rs 1 crore. “There will be that many in the Supreme Court itself,” he said.“We feel happy when we see people going overseas for vacations and buying cars of their choice. But when we see the number paying tax, it worries me,” he said.Detailing steps taken by the government to re-orient the tax system from process-centric to people-centric, PM Modi said, ""There will be no room for foul play anymore"". The PM also said tax administration is being overhauled, promising, ""Tax harassment will be a thing of the past. Now India is moving towards tax encouragement with the help of technology."" He added that the country had entered the club of a handful of nations who have a taxpayers' charter.Modi referred to reform measures the government had unveiled in its second tenure. ""The theme of your summit is India Action Plan 2020 but India is now working on action plans for the entire decade. Yes, the style may be befitting the T-20 format but the resolve is to ensure consistent performance, build new records and make it India's series. The world's youngest country is in a mood to play at a very fast pace,"" said Modi, using cricketing metaphors as he listed a string of decisions his government has taken after its return to office.Modi ticked off major decisions taken, saying there was more to come, and reeled off initiatives like abrogation of Jammu and Kashmir's special status, passage of the Citizenship Amendment Act, the PM Kisan yojana, plan to complete stuck housing, bringing water strategy centrestage, passing the law against triple talaq, rights for transgenders and major changes in corporate tax.Modi also detailed the measures taken by the government to achieve the goal of a $5 trillion economy and said the February 1 budget had steps to achieve that target. Addressing the scepticism in certain quarters about the target, the PM said: ""It is better to set a stiff target and seek to achieve it rather than drifting forward without aim"".""This is not an easy goal but also not one that cannot be achieved,"" the PM said, asserting that the country was moving ahead on several fronts and there was renewed confidence. He said businessmen and entrepreneurs have got confidence that they can do business in a good environment and prosper. He said the government was working overtime to reach the $5 trillion economy target.Earlier, in his welcome address, Times Group MD Vineet Jain said citizens, who are stakeholders in the country's future, have a great responsibility in deciding how to face the challenges ahead. ""We are an economy that is aiming to touch $5 trillion by the middle of the decade. We are also a nation whose struggle for freedom and successful experience in democracy has inspired others. It's no surprise, therefore, that the eyes of the world are on us,"" said Jain.""We have to deliver on the promise of India. This can only be possible if India's citizens prosper, if its poor and marginalised are in a position to uplift themselves, if its diversity continues to remain a source of strength, and if its youth have the confidence and faith to realise their potential,"" said Jain.The PM said the government's aim to invest Rs 100 lakh crore in infrastructure would help reach the $5 trillion economy target and 6500 projects across the country would help trigger economic activity in the nearby areas. ""So far, our tax system was process-centric, it is now being turned into a people-centric one"", he said, listing recent steps like faceless assessment and faceless appeal which will ""leave no room for foul play"".Modi also said the NDA government was the first to focus on the economic potential of Tier 2, Tier 3 cities. ""For the first time any government has enabled these small towns to dream big,"" he said, adding that the benefits of the Centre's measures on taxes and MSMEs will help these towns.In Video: Our aim is to make India $5 trillion economy in next 5 years, says PM Narendra Modi at Times Now Summit",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74109463,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-387488,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/better-to-set-stiff-target-than-to-drift-without-aim-pm-modi/articleshow/74108157.cms

A still from the short film (BCCL)

Bringing laurels to the city is Lucknowite Diwakar Bhattacharya , whose short film Suno-The Unspoken has been selected for the Filmfare Best Short Film 2019 in the romance genre category. Starring Tulika Banerjee and Shreedhar Dubey , the plot of the film revolves around a girl, who is on death bed and how a thief fulfills her last wishes.Talking about the film, the debuting director says, “The film has only two characters, who share a different kind of relationship. Because it was my first movie, I chose a script with only two characters and shot the entire film in a room. Though, I had to face a lot of challenges, majorly technical glitches because I don’t come from that background, but that made me a better director.” Sharing the concept of the film, Bhattacharya, who’s into event management, says, “We usually like to name a relationship but there are relationships in our life to which no name can be attributed to. There are some unsaid or unspoken relationships where only actions do the talking.”A still from the short film (BCCL)Talking about his journey from working in the corporate sector to event management to becoming a film director, Diwakar says, “During school days I was into dramatics and aspired to go to Film and Television Institute in Pune but due to family pressure couldn’t pursue it. After working in the corporate sector for about 14 years, I ventured into event management but I used to scribble my thoughts on several stories. And when you make up your mind for a short film then the budget constraints go away. So, I went ahead with my plan to make a short film.”Not stopping with his debut film, Diwakar is already in action with his next short film. “The future of short films is really bright because people don’t have time to watch a 2-3 hours film and so they like to watch a short movie while travelling in a metro. For the same reason, all the OTT platforms are promoting it. Also, there is a lot to experiment within the short films category. So, I will be focusing on short films as of now. This year, I will be making six short films and each one will be of a different genre. My next short film, which a thriller is already being shot and we will complete the shoot by the end of this month.”",lucknow,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74101341,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-267992,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/the-future-of-short-films-is-really-bright-lucknowite-diwakar-bhattacharya/articleshow/74101328.cms

13,['13/02/2020'],"Kartik Aaryan: I belong to the move-on generation, but it’s not easy for me to move on from a relationship","Don’t be fooled by the link-up rumours around him. Beneath all his social media expertise and flirtatious image, Kartik Aaryan is an old-school romantic at heart. The actor’s upcoming film, Love Aaj Kal , is directed by Imtiaz Ali , who is known to delve deep into matters of the heart through his stories. In a conversation with BT, Kartik talks about all things love… aaj and kal. Read on…This is my observation, and you can’t generalise, but aaj ke couples saath hoke bhi saath nahi hai — I find that odd. With our parents’ generation, it was the other way around. I am not saying that we value physical intimacy more than emotional intimacy, but yes, it’s rare today. I don’t see that longing in relationships anymore, because we are way too available in terms of social media, instant messaging, video-calling, etc. I miss that distance. You are constantly interacting with each other, and tend to take each other for granted. Somewhere, face-to-face interactions have taken a back seat. That exclusivity of time for each other is no longer there.I could be addicted to my phone, but I am quite old-school when it comes to love. Once I truly connect with someone, I can’t detach easily. I like meeting someone in person rather than texting them. I have never been on a blind date, tried a dating app or online dating. Yeh meri ideologies hain. I want things to be organic. People who generally don’t meet or interact with a lot of people, for them, I am sure dating apps are a big help. For me, it’s very important to know a person before I decide to take the relationship further. I belong to the move-on generation, but it’s not easy for me to move on. I get too invested in a relationship.The intimacy that is felt and implied is more relatable. If you show love scenes to commercialise your movie, that’s not required. But, if they justify your story, why not?Love Aaj Kal is universally relatable because we often wonder how right or wrong, we were in a relationship. We all fear unrequited love as we want our love to be fulfilled and reciprocated. Uss pyaar mein ek dard hai, par you still crave for it. Getting to experience that kind of love is also a unique feeling in itself. I was in college when that film had released, and I liked it a lot. Be it Love Aaj Kal or his other films, I have always been a fan of Imtiaz Ali sir.Love stays the same, but what changes is, how you convey it and your journey towards it. That essence is constant in this film as well, but there aren’t any similarities beyond that. I play two characters in the film (Raghu and Veer). Both the love stories are so relatable that you feel yeh kisi ke saath bhi ho sakta hain. What I like about Imtiaz sir’s films is that unke characters woh cheezein bol dete hain joh aapke dimaag mein chal rahi hoti hain, par aap bol nahin pate. We tend to filter our thoughts, but Imtiaz sir’s characters don’t. They say what they feel, but since we are not conditioned to live that way, it comes across as unconventional.It was challenging, as I have never worked like this before. Imtiaz sir changed my thought process. I actually lived Veer and Raghu’s lives to play those two characters. I attended body language classes as the two characters are completely different. I also listened to 90s music and wore clothes reflecting that time frame for Raghu’s character. Imtiaz sir is particular about every little detail. For instance, 90s was the time when a guy would wear his father’s blazer and a girl would wear her mother’s sari for the school’s annual function. Guys would always carry a comb in their pockets, but today, we like our hair messy. Also, we don’t want to compromise in relationships or waste our time. Veer is a new-age guy, who says things that are true, but uncalled for.I have always said that I am a fan of Ranbir’s talent. Who isn’t? I envy his body of work. I would have loved to play his character from Rockstar (2011). For me, getting an opportunity to work with Imtiaz sir was so big that I couldn’t think of anything beyond that. I didn’t even think about the comparison. All I knew was, main unke picture mein kaam kar rahan hoon. He has worked with the best of actors and to be on that list itself was a big deal for me. The fact that he chose me as the hero of his romantic film gave me the validation that I may be good at portraying romance (smiles). Agar woh convinced hai toh mujhe romance aata hoga. This was the opportunity I was waiting for. It’s my most intense and emotional role till date and I enjoy this genre. Most of my characters have been humourous. Par mujhe hasaane se jyaada rulana pasand hain. I can confidently say that I am creatively satisfied with this film.Imtiaz sir comes across as someone who is quiet, but woh bohut baat karte hain. Aaram se karte hain, par karte hain, and I like to listen to him. He doesn’t have a filter either. I remember when he had called me to narrate a film for the first time, we spoke on the phone for 40 minutes. He had faith in me, so he didn’t audition me for that project. After that, we met in Delhi for further discussions. At that time, he fleetingly mentioned Love Aaj Kal 2 as the second story that he was keen to make. Eventually, the film that he had offered me initially didn’t work out, but this one did.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74103495,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-149772/74103495.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/kartik-aaryan-i-belong-to-the-move-on-generation-but-its-not-easy-for-me-to-move-on-from-a-relationship/articleshow/74103491.cms

15,['13/02/2020'],Imtiaz Ali: I feel this generation is far less hypocritical than the previous one,"His films have a lot of heart, and his conversations, too. A chat with Imtiaz Ali could linger around anything from philosophy, poetry, passion to travel, youth, and of course, love across time zones. Yes, much like his movies, the conversation travels places, and finally comes back to what we seek from him — his insights on love. The filmmaker, known for his cinematic love stories, reminds us that he has no guidebook for lovers, and in fact, he says, “The closer you get to the concept of love, the concept walks further away from you.” On the eve of his next release, ' Love Aaj Kal ', he explores some concepts of love, and questions some. Read on...It had never crossed my mind. In fact, I never thought that I would revisit a concept in my life or make a franchise. The only reason I felt this compulsion was because so much has changed since then. The rules of the game have reversed. Also, when I look at it, it is perhaps the only ‘franchisable’ idea I have ever had. For instance, what more can you say about Geet and Aditya (played by Kareena Kapoor Khan and Shahid Kapoor) from 'Jab We Met' (2007)? You will have to simply cook up some stuff to bring it to the screen again. But for 'Love Aaj Kal', if you just change the time frame, it becomes a new story, with new characters.My daughter (Ida) is my source and connect to this generation. She is like a close friend and we relate to each other on that level really well. Through her feelings, experiences and stories, I am very aligned with a certain point of view, which is now my point of view. Being in this industry, we meet people of different ages, and while hanging out with them, I get a feel of their take on things. I value that and do feel that at this age and having gone through the experiences that I have, I am able to tell a story to this generation.Today, there is a lot of noise in communication around them, but not too many things get communicated. The result is that there are few things that actually touch them. We know that there is this communication boom and they can express their thoughts instantly across the world, but this is not making them reach out and connect with people in the way they would want to. It leaves them hollow. They get so much information, have access to so many devices, but they could still feel blank within. It is the times that they are living in. For them, it is easy to be in a relationship, it is easy to have a string of relationships as well, but what they really hope to get from a relationship is difficult to get. I feel this young generation is lonelier than ever before and they are struggling to get something meaningful. Everything that was precious before, like intimacy, physical intimacy… all of that is now often the first door to enter the relationship. However, they are looking for the same thing that every generation has, when it comes to love. That has not changed, and it won’t ever. In fact, this is what Zoe (Sara’s character) represents in this film. This generation also carries the baggage of the previous generations’ relationships and their problems. Hence, it is not easy for them to disarmingly and effortlessly submit to love.This generation is only as confused and messed up as we were. Every generation thinks that it is their divine right to tell the subsequent generation that, ‘In our time, it was better, and you guys are so messed up… you look at things the wrong way.’ I feel that this generation is far less hypocritical than the previous one. They are far more truthful, they represent things as they are, but they want the same things. Also, this generation is always seeking. You would wonder, ‘She is already dating somebody, this is the fifth guy she is dating in the last few years, so, what is she seeking?’ You would also wonder, ‘Why is he lonely, he is on the phone all the time.’ It is because they are constantly seeking.Exactly! The young people are used to having different sources for different things. We would go to school, study and read… and that was the only place we would get knowledge. Today, they are getting classroom education online. So, this concept of one person being the only influence, is not something they have seen. Hence, they are seeking on various levels.I feel there comes a time when a person starts questioning this whole thing about a man and woman being monogamous, and why should we be the only organism in the world that is monogamous. People start thinking that... these are rules that have been made by society and you have to toe the line. So, you look at another woman and man and constantly feel guilt or shame. This generation is questioning it more, as they reach this point earlier in their life. In 'Love Aaj Kal', at some point, Sara’s character gets this seed of thought. It is a huge challenge when you want to get into this monogamous love relationship, which she also wants, but it is one thing to have practical reasons to keep you apart from your partner, it is another to have an ideological confusion about it. I think modern-day people and the older generation, too, have thought whether this concept — of having feelings for one man or woman all your life — is even valid. We thought about it, but the younger generation questions it and have the ability to act upon it.It’s like you get closer to the concept of love, and the concept walks further away from you. As it is evident from my films and not so much from my life, that I have been engaged with this concept a lot. The fact that I don’t know, is the reason I seek. People think because of the movies I make, I have answers. The reason I make those films is because I have more questions about love. Yes, sometimes, what I aspire to be, I show that through my cinema. Everything that I wished had happened and did not happen in my own life, I know it can happen in my films. Like, I could spend time with that girl in the train, which I did not in real life (smiles).It’s a track of hope. The world did not come into existence because of some calculation, instead it was some sort of random collision. The idea for the song actually came from a writing by TS Eliot, which goes like this, ‘The awful daring of a moment’s surrender that an age of prudence can never retract. By this and only this, we have existed.’ I was so taken in by these lines. I look back at my life and think of all of the things that I have done, and what I am living now — is like this. Like, you fall in love, you make mistakes, get messed up for it… and all this is what makes your life. Sometimes you got to do what you think is a mistake. You should flow with the heart because it’s not like if you go with your calculations, you will definitely get to a better place. This is the hope that this film gives. It tells you that you can make a passionate mistake. It is fine to do it, and it is what will make you who you are.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74101458,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-95582/74101458.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/imtiaz-ali-i-feel-this-generation-is-far-less-hypocritical-than-the-previous-one/articleshow/74101388.cms

MH-60 Romeo helicopters

NEW DELHI: India has finalized two more mega defence deals with the US, together worth over $3.5 billion (Rs 25,000 crore) for 30 heavy-duty armed helicopters, in the run-up to President Donald Trump ’s visit here on February 24-25.These soon-to-be-inked deals will take the total value of Indian defence contracts bagged by the US just since 2007 to well past the $20 billion mark. The $2.6 billion deal for 24 MH-60 `Romeo’ multi-mission helicopters for the Navy and the $930 million one for six AH-64E Apache attack choppers for the Army are set to be cleared by the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) by next week, said sources on Wednesday.“India will pay an initial 15% instalment for the MH-60R helicopters under the US Foreign Military Sales (FMS) government-to-government deal. Once the contract is inked, the first lot of the choppers will be delivered in two years. All 24 will come in four to five years,” said a source.The “direct commercial sale” of the six Apaches, in turn, is basically a follow-on order to the 22 such helicopters already inducted by IAF under a Rs 13,952 crore deal inked with the US in September 2015. “The Army should get the deliveries of the six choppers, armed with Stinger air-to-air missiles, Hellfire Longbow air-to-ground missiles, guns and rockets, around 2022-2023,” said a source.The MH-60Rs, which are armed with Hellfire missiles, MK-54 torpedoes and precision-kill rockets, are considered a “critical operational necessity” for the Navy because its warships are virtually bereft of such helicopters at a time when Chinese nuclear and diesel-electric submarines are making regular forays into the Indian Ocean Region. The 140-warship force has just about a dozen old Sea King and 10 Kamov-28 anti-submarine warfare helicopters operational as of now.As was first reported by TOI in June last year, the 24 MH-60Rs and six Apache helicopters are part of the several lucrative defence deals worth over $10 billion being lined up for the US by India over the next two-three years.The others include six more P-8I long-range maritime patrol aircraft ($1.8 billion), the National Advanced Surface to Air Missile System-II for the missile shield over Delhi ($1.8 billion), 30 Sea Guardian armed drones (over $2.5 billion) and 13 big MK-45 naval gun systems for warships ($1.02 billion). “These deals will take some time to be finalized and inked,” said the source.During his visit, President Trump is also expected to push the case for a US fighter -- F/A-18, F-15EX or F-21 (upgraded version of F-16) -- to be selected for the mega “Make in India” project to produce 114 jets for the IAF for around $20 billion. The US is also in contention to supply 57 multi-role fighters capable of operating from aircraft carriers for the Indian Navy.India and the US have also identified seven defence projects for co-development and production under the bilateral Defence Technology and Trade Initiative (DTTI). These include air-launched small aerial systems (drone swarms), light-weight small arms technology, ISTAR (intelligence, surveillance, targeting and reconnaissance) systems and anti-drone technology called “counter-UAS rocket, artillery and mortar systems”, as was reported by TOI in October last year.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74109292,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-182752,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/on-eve-of-trumps-visit-india-us-seal-3-5bn-defence-deals/articleshow/74108325.cms

23,['13/02/2020'],"AICTE: 50% seats vacant, no new engineering colleges for 2 yrs","MUMBAI: The All India Council for Technical Education has put the brakes on engineering education. With a glut in BTech institutes across India, no fresh applications for setting up new institutes will be accepted till 2022. The decision draws upon the experience of the admission season of 2019-20 which saw every other seat in this technical stream remain vacant.India has 27 lakh seats in the undergraduate (14 lakh), diploma (11 lakh) and postgraduate (1.8 lakh) space, but only 13 lakh students took admissions in 2019-20, with seven lakh of them joining undergraduate programmes. ""In view of the large number of vacant seats in various programmes during the last few years and the likely future demand, the council shall not grant approval to new technical institutions at the diploma/ undergraduate/postgraduate level in engineering and technology,"" stated the new AICTE handbook that defines the guidelines for the coming academic year.The council's committee headed by IIT-Hyderabad chairman BVR Mohan Reddy suggested that the ban be reviewed after two years.In 2019, merely six lakh graduates found jobs during campus placements, according to AICTE data. Between 2015 and 2019, a total of 518 engineering colleges shut down.Experts say the technical education sector needed a massive revamp. ""The hopeless engineers and sluggishness in the industry are leading to a massive breakdown of technical education in India,"" said G D Yadav, former vice-chancellor, Institute of Chemical Technology.The National Perspective Plan also states that existing colleges asking for new programmes or for increase in student intake in engineering and technology will be turned down, barring those that are starting courses in emerging areas.The Reddy report stated if one looked at seats available versus students admitted, the number stood as low as 49.8%. ""Creating any further capacity is a big drain on investments since, at the very basic level, it involves the creation of physical infrastructure like buildings and laboratory infrastructure. We recommend that we do not create any new capacity starting from the academic year 2020. The creation of new capacity can be reviewed every two years after that.""When the sun of the new millennium rose, shining on the aspirations of a young India, it marked the golden age for professional education. In the early part of the previous decade, hundreds of new institutes came up and thousands of aspirants queued up to join them. That was a time when the country was bullish on education and India added tens of thousands of seats to its professional colleges every year. Two decades hence, the picture is one of stark contrast in technical professional colleges.Joining a professional college was once the pinnacle of an Indian student's career. So students, left with little choice, often joined anonymous colleges. But now, they are put off by one or more of these three reasons: Poor quality of teaching, lack of adequate faculty or no job offer at the end. The tables have turned and candidates scoring even a zero in entrance exams are invited to sign up at engineering institutes. Yet, colleges are running half-empty. The engineering space indeed needs re-engineering.",home,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74108456,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1121858,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/education/50-seats-vacant-no-new-engineering-colleges-for-2-yrs-aicte/articleshow/74108434.cms

GUWAHATI: As many as 614 government-aided madrassas and 101 Sanskrit tols (institutes) in Assam will shut down over the next couple of months and reinvent themselves as high and higher secondary schools as part of a policy decision by the BJP-led government not to spend public money on ""religious education"", finance and education minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said on Wednesday.""Teaching Arabic and religious texts is not the government's job. In a secular country, religious teachings cannot be funded by the government,"" Sarma said. ""If religious texts are allowed to be taught in state-run madrassas, the Gita, or for that matter the Bible, should also be taught with government funding.""The government spends Rs 3-4 crore annually on madrassas and about Rs 1 crore on Sanskrit tols.""Teachers employed in these madrassas can stay home without having to worry about finding employment elsewhere. The government will pay their salaries till their day of retirement,"" he said.Pointing to the decision to simultaneously stop funding Sanskrit tols, Sarma said this should put at rest speculation that madrassas were being targeted on religious grounds. Privately-run madrassas - Assam has around 900 of them, all run by the Jamiat Ulama - and Sanskrit tols can continue to function as usual, he said.The website of the erstwhile state madrassa education board defines ""madrassa"" as an Arabic word for ""an educational institution or school imparting education to all, irrespective of religion, caste, creed and gender"". ""The idea that it imparts religious and theology based education to a particular religion is not true,"" it states.Jamiat Ulama's legal cell convenor Masud Akhtar Zaman said the closure of state-aided madrassas would not affect the private madrassa education system in any way. ""Our madrassas do not depend on the government for a single rupee. Almost all our students are from BPL families, and we take care of their boarding, food and clothing.""Zaman also clarified that there was more to madrassas than religious education. ""We follow a normal syllabus same as other schools under the state board,"" he said.Two years ago, the government disbanded the madrassa education and Sanskrit boards to bring all madrassas under Secondary Board of Education, Assam, and the Sanskrit tols under the Kumar Bhaskar Varma Sanskrit and Ancient Studies University in Nalbari.

The Trump administration is changing a key exemption to America's trade-remedy laws to make it easier to penalize about two dozen so-called developing countries including China, India and South Africa.

The United States on Monday narrowed its internal list of developing and least-developed countries in order to reduce the threshold for triggering a United States investigation into whether nations are harming United States industries with unfairly subsidized exports, according to a United States Trade Representative notice.

In doing so, the United States eliminated its special preferences for a list of self-declared developing countries that includes: Albania; Argentina; Armenia; Brazil; Bulgaria; China; Colombia; Costa Rica; Georgia; Hong Kong; India; Indonesia; Kazakhstan; the Kyrgyz Republic; Malaysia; Moldova; Montenegro; North Macedonia; Romania; Singapore; South Africa; South Korea; Thailand; Ukraine; and Vietnam.

USTR said the decision to revise its developing country methodology for countervailing duty investigations was necessary because America's previous guidance- which dates back to 1998- ""is now obsolete."" The move also reflects President Donald Trump's frustration that large economies like China and India are permitted to receive preferential trade benefits as developing nations at the World Trade Organization.

During his visit to Davos, Switzerland, last month Trump said the WTO hasn't treated America fairly. ""China is viewed as a developing nation. India is viewed as a developing nation. We're not viewed as a developing nation. As far as I'm concerned, we're a developing nation, too.""

The goal of the WTO's special preferences for developing nations is to help poorer countries reduce poverty, generate employment and integrate themselves into the global trading system.

Under WTO rules, governments are required to terminate their countervailing duty investigations if the amount of foreign subsidy is de minimis, which is normally defined as less than 1% ad valorem.

But WTO rules provide a different standard for so-called developing nations that requires investigators to terminate duty investigation if the amount of subsidy is less than 2% ad valorem.

The Trump administration has sought to end these special preferences for nations that fall under certain categories, like those who are members of global economic clubs like the Group of 20, the OECD or who are classified as high-income nations by the World Bank.

Last July, Trump issued an executive memo that asked U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to determine whether there's been ""substantial progress"" toward limiting the number of countries considered developing nations. The U.S. may act unilaterally if not, Trump said.

Several of the de-listed countries in the USTR notice have already agreed to relinquish their developing-country rights in future trade negotiations, including Brazil, Singapore and South Korea.

US President Donald Trump and wife Melania will be visiting India on Feb 24-25

NEW DELHI: An advance team of US officials has visited ITC Maurya to reconnoitre the luxury hotel as President Donald Trump could be staying there during his visit to Delhi later this month. Maurya's 4,800 sq ft Grand Presidential Suite is learnt to have been recently given a luxurious facelift in anticipation of the US President and First Lady Melania Trump's stay.

ITC Maurya did not comment on the subject. The Trumps will not need to worry about Delhi's pollution in their suite. The hotel, it is learnt, has massive air purifiers to ensure ""clean air quality"" as per WHO standards. The Grand Presidential floor will breathe this purified air. A dynamic plaque in the lobby gives real-time air quality readings. Rooms have been booked across some top five-star hotels in central Delhi for the presidential delegation, sources said. The US President and First Lady will be in India on February 24 and 25 and will also visit Ahmedabad.

The ITC Hotels website describes some of the features of Maurya's Grand Presidential suite. ""...An exclusive private entrance... a private high-speed elevator, State-of-the-art security systems... The Grand Presidential abode is a two-bedroom mansion of luxury with silk-panelled walls, dark wood flooring and magnificent artwork. This suite comprises a reception area, a large living room, a study, a peacock-themed 12-seater private dining room... and a mini spa & gymnasium.""

In the past, too, US presidents have stayed at the Maurya. President Bill Clinton famously had Dal Bukhara at the hotel's Bukhara restaurant. When President Barack Obama came to India as the chief guest for Republic Day in 2015 - Modi's first as PM after his 2014 win - he stayed in the presidential suite on the 14th floor. Obama had stayed there on his earlier visit to Delhi, in 2010, as well.

In March 2006, President George W Bush stayed here, as did Clinton whose 2000 visit led the hotel to introduce the special ""Clinton Platter"" and ""Chelsea Platter"" at Bukhara.

It was also pointed out that while Sami opted for an Indian citizenship only four years gao, his father is a Pakistani security force veteran who fought against India during the 1999 Kargil War.Sami has earlier declared that he shouldn't be held responsible for his father's action. Asked how he looked at the fact that Indian Muslims continue to be made accountable for what the Mughals and other Muslim invaders did to Hindus over centuries, he said: ""First of all, the best thing about history is that it's past, and it should be kept in the past because that's where it belongs. God gave us eyes to look forward and not backward. The most important thing is we should forget all that because nobody from that era is alive today to answer these questions -- least of all you (the media) and I, or anybody for that matter.""""Secondly, this is all about politics. I am not a politician. I am a musician. Just like you wouldn't ask a politician about Raag Darbari, don't ask me about politics. All I know is that I am a musician. I spread love through my music.

Shergill shared a video on Twitter in which he can be seen lashing out at the government.Shergill pointed out that on one hand, while retired Indian Army Junior Commissioned Officer Mohammad Sanaullah has been tagged as a ""ghuspethiya"" in the NRC list by the Centre, on the other hand, Adnan Sami, whose father fought against India during the 1999 Kargil War, has been honoured with the Padma Shri.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74108520,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-72418/74108520.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/music/news/adnan-sami-dont-drag-me-into-politics/articleshow/74108519.cms
29,['13/02/2020'],"In a first, Calcutta HC allows live-streaming of proceedings","This story is from February 13, 2020

The Calcutta High Court

KOLKATA: In a first, the Calcutta High Court on Wednesday granted permission for live-streaming of proceedings in a matter pertaining to whether the children of Parsi Zoroastrian women married to non-Parsis can be allowed access to Atash Adaran (Fire Temple) at 91, Metcalfe Street, Kolkata.

Two special cameras and other equipment will be set up in the courtroom to telecast live footage of the proceedings on YouTube. The costs will be borne by the Parsi Zoroastrian Association Calcutta (PZAC), an applicant in the matter.

In September 2018, a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court had held that live-streaming of court proceedings will lead to greater transparency and serve as an instrument of greater accountability. “It will encourage the principle of open court, effectuate the public’s right to know and reduce dependence on second-hand views,” Justice D Y Chandrachud had observed.

On Wednesday, the counsel for PZAC, Phiroze Edulji, also highlighted the need for greater publicity in such cases before an HC bench of justices Sanjib Banerjee and Kausik Chanda. Live-streaming will uphold the rights of citizens, particularly the Parsi Zoroastrians, to access courts. It will also uphold their right to information, a pre-requisite to their Fundamental Right, to be able to freely express their opinions guaranteed under Article 19(I)(a) of the Constitution, the counsel submitted.

The division bench then granted permission for live-streaming during the final hearing, but no date for this has been fixed yet.

The original matter arose after Prochy N Mehta and Sanaya Mehta Vyas moved court against community leaders Noshir Tankariwala, Y J Dastoor and J S Bilimoria for opposing access of children born to Parsi Zoroastrian mothers and non-Parsi fathers to the Fire Temple even if such children are initiated to the Zoroastrian faith by the performance of Navjote ceremony. The PZAC also support this. However, there are no such restrictions on children of Parsi men who marry non-Parsi women, once the children are initiated to the Zoroastrian faith through Navjote (thread) ceremonies.

The PZAC, which claims to promote religious, social, economic, intellectual and general welfare of the Parsi Zoroastrians, has claimed in its application that the Parsi community comprises Parsis who are descended from original Persian emigrants and who are born to both Zoroastrian parent, Iranis from Persia professing the Zoroastrian religion who come to India either temporarily or permanently, and the children of Parsi fathers by ‘alien’ mothers who have been duly and properly admitted into the religion by performance of the Navjote ceremony.

“A person can be an Iranian Zoroastrian or may follow the teachings of Zoroaster even if neither of his/her parents is a Parsi Zoroastrian. Such a person will be counted a Zoroastrian but not a Parsi Zoroastrian and can’t worship or even be in the presence of the sacred Atash (fire) at the Fire Temple. That is why there are less than two lakh Parsis following the Zoroastrian faith in the world, while the number of Zoroastrians is four million,” Edulji submitted.

NEW DELHI: In an unprecedented development, a Madhya Pradesh woman additional district judge who had resigned in July 2014 protesting her “illegal” transfer from Gwalior to Sidhi (424 km away) soon after she accused a sitting high court judge of sexual harassment appears set to get her job back without losing seniority despite a five-year hiatus in service.

A Supreme Court bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices B R Gavai and Surya Kant asked Madhya Pradesh High Court to consider taking her back after her counsel Indira Jaising said the woman judge had moved on from the harassment incident as the HC judge had retired and that she did not claim back wages but wanted her seniority to be maintained. The CJI even suggested that she could be shifted out of MP judiciary to a neighbouring state after being reinstated. The woman judicial officer agreed.

Appearing for MP HC, senior advocate Ravindra Srivastava said the woman judge had resigned voluntarily and that her resignation was accepted by the HC after a full court meeting. It was reconsidered and the HC full court had refused to allow her to take back the resignation. Jaising stepped in and said the judges’ panel which inquired into the sexual harassment charges had found that she was transferred in violation of the HC’s transfer policy.

A judges’ panel had inquired into the sexual harassment complaint but did not find clinching evidence to prove the charges. But it had termed her transfer from Gwalior to Sidhi ‘illegal’, and said the circumstances were such that she had no option but to resign and “there was total lack of human face in ordering the transfer”. It had recommended her reinstatement, Jaising said while reading out from the inquiry report.

The CJI-led bench asked Srivastava to convince the HC on the administrative side to reinstate her. “Whatever it is, even if she was transferred validly, she would have completed her tenure of three years at the new place and would have been due for a fresh transfer. We want the issue to be brought to a decent conclusion,” the CJI said.

When Srivastava said if she was reinstated, then it would appear that the HC was incorrect in transferring her, the CJI said, “It would appear worse if we pass an order directing her reinstatement. The issue involves a judicial officer and high court. The situation has changed drastically (acknowledging that the HC judge in question had retired) and no one will be affected.”

Justice Kant said, “It is a simple issue. She will submit an application seeking withdrawal of her resignation and the HC (on the administrative side) will allow it.” The bench allowed Srivastava to discuss the suggested solution with the MP HC and report back on March 18.

During the hearing, the SC also told the MP HC that once it reinstated her as additional district judge, the SC could order her shifting to a neighbouring state judiciary. It also asked the former additional district judge to give her choice of state. She said she was ready to shift to any north Indian state after reinstatement. Jaising told the court that the woman judicial officer had outstanding ACRs throughout her career till the incident happened leading to her transfer to Sidhi.

34,['13/02/2020'],5 Days week in Maharashtra Government: Maharashtra approves 5-day week for govt employees,"This story is from February 13, 2020

MUMBAI: The Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra cabinet on Wednesday approved a five-day week for all state government employees starting February 29. While earlier, the state government’s 22 lakh employees got the second and fourth Saturday of every month off, they will now only work Monday to Friday.

However, their working hours have been extended by 45 minutes every day to make up for time that might have been lost as a result of the new arrangement. So while they started work at 9.45am every day and had to swipe out at 5.30pm, they will now have to work up to 6.15pm, with a 30-minute lunch break in the afternoon.

A five-day week is followed by the Central government and it is in place in states such as Rajasthan, Bihar, Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal.

The cabinet move came on a demand made by the state government employees union, which has been petitioning successive governments on the issue. Last week the union’s representatives met CM Thackeray, who promised to agree provided work did not suffer, officials said.

According to a government press release, state employees currently have 288 working days which will go down to 264. However, the working hours per day will go up from seven hours and 15 minutes to eight hours. Employees will actually work one day or 24 hours more every year, the statement said.

While in Mumbai all government offices, including employees of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, will follow the new working hours, the five-day week will not apply to government offices covered under the Factories Act and the Industrial Disputes Act and to those that are considered essential services or providers of such services. These include government hospitals, dispensaries, police, jails, fire brigade, conservancy workers, educational institutes (both schools and colleges), technical institutes and others. Employees working on water supply projects too will not follow a five-day week.

Milind Sardeshmukh of the state employees union said all workers were happy with the decision, and it would not adversely affect productivity. “It was our long-pending demand to have a five-day week, and everyone is happy it has been conceded. We had agitated many times for it,” Sardeshmukh said.

However, many women employees are unhappy over the extended hours as they would be able to leave work only at 6.15pm. A woman employee told TOI it would have been better if they had been allowed to come to office earlier in the morning so that the 45 extra minutes they will now have to put in would be better adjusted. “They could have even divided those 45 extra minutes in the morning and evening sessions so that we did not get to reach home late,” the employee said.

Union leaders, however, claimed female employees were also happy with the decision and were ready to adjust if they got two days off a week.

After the cabinet move, teachers from government and aided schools across the state too demanded they be given the benefit as well. While most unaided private schools in the city work for five days, government and aided schools work at least for half a day on Saturdays.

Anil Bornare, member of a teachers’ group said, “Most private schools work only five days. They meet the minimum requirement for working days as prescribed under the Right to Education Act, 2009. The secondary schools code also permit schools to work five days. So why can’t the government extend the same to schools.”

As per the RTE Act, classes I to V must have a minimum of 200 working days or 800 hours, and classes VI to VIII have to meet a minimum requirement of 220 days or 1,000 hours. The state’s secondary school code states the number of holidays cannot exceed 76.

Another teacher, Uday Nare said, “Teachers at government and aided schools are state employees as well. They are made to do all other non-academic tasks that government employees do, like election and census duty. So why is the government not extending the benefit of a five-day week to its teachers?”

RAJKOT: A three-member gang of robbers was busted on Morbi Road in Rajkot on Wednesday.

Police said the accused, identified as Ajit Jakhania (20), Gopal Sadamia (22) and Bheekha Jakhania (40), confessed to having committed 14 thefts and two robberies from Morbi and Rajkot.

The Rajkot detection of crime branch (DCB) arrested the trio on the basis of a tip-off about their whereabouts on Morbi Road.

Explaining about their modus operandi, H M Gadhvi , inspector with Rajkot DCB, said, “The accused would take out hand carts to buy scrap in different localities and zero in on their targets during the day time. At nights, they would break into the houses and commit thefts.”

KOLKATA: Hale-and-hearty youngsters suddenly collapsing and dying of stroke is not an unheard-of phenomenon in the city. A study by IIT-Kanpur has attributed the exposure to PM2.5 in the air to the high premature mortality rate in Kolkata, a reason that had remained mostly unexplained so far. In fact, stroke death rate due to PM2.5 exposure in a city was the highest in Kolkata, revealed the study, which surveyed million-plus population in 29 cities in India.Track the pollution level in your cityKolkatans in the age group of 25 to 50 years, who are the most exposed to pollution in the air, were considerably at risk.The epidemiological survey revealed that 1,14,700 people in the 29 cities died owing to PM2.5 exposure every year. The exposure to the toxic particulate matter, which straight enters the lungs, cause stroke, ischemic heart disease, lower respiratory infection, lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). While ischemic heart disease is the leading cause of deaths, accounting for 58% of PM2.5-related premature deaths across the city, in Kolkata, the biggest culprit is cerebro-vascular disease, commonly known as the stroke.The study, presented by Mukesh Sharma, professor at IIT-Kanpur and a leading member of National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) Committee, at Anil Agarwal Dialogue, 2020, revealed that premature deaths due to PM2.5 exposure in Kolkata was only second to Delhi. While the figure recorded in Delhi is 20,000 a year, it is 12,000 in Kolkata. Mumbai emerges third, with annual premature deaths due to PM2.5 exposure being 10,000. The report came following the release of ‘India’s State of Environment 2020’, annual anthology of critical review of India’s myriad environmental issues by Centre for Science and Environment.“People usually associate air pollution with effect on lungs and respiratory systems. But evidence shows the largest health impact of air pollution is associated with cardio-vascular systems. Kolkata’s annual concentration of PM2.5 in 2019 was 77 microgram per cubic meter (µg/m3). Kolkata needs to cut down on 47% of its PM2.5 count to meet the national ambient air quality standard of 40 µg/m3. It will automatically result in 18% reduction in premature mortality. The figure will go up to 80% if World Health Organisation (WHO) standard of 10 µg/m3 is met,” said air-pollution expert and CSE executive director Anumita Roychowdhury.Total premature deaths per 1-lakh population in the city due to PM2.5 exposure is 80, out of which 35 is due to stroke, 34 due to ischemic heart disease, 6 COPD, 3.5 lower respiratory infection and 1.5 because of lung cancer.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74111940,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-118140,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/study-city-records-highest-stroke-deaths-due-to-pm2-5-exposure/articleshow/74107442.cms

MUMBAI: Tata Trusts , owner of the Tata Group , on Wednesday appointed N Srinath as chief executive from April 1. This is the first time that the Trusts has created the CEO post. Srinath is currently managing director of Tata Teleservices. The 57-year-old is the second executive assistant of Ratan Tata to head the country’s largest public philanthropic foundation after R Venkataramanan, who exited amid a controversy.TOI had in its December 10, 2019 edition reported about Srinath’s impending elevation at the Trusts. Srinath has held various positions at the Tata Group since joining it in 1986.A Tata observer said the trustees have selected an old hand in managing the affairs of the Trusts, whose main asset is its 66% stake in Tata Sons , the holding company of the Tata Group.“Srinath has worked closely with Ratan Tata, knows the dynamics of the group and maintains a low profile. These factors will help him in managing the inter-relationship between the Trusts and Tata Sons,” he said.Srinath’s appointment comes at a time when the foundation is in a legal battle with the income tax authorities over cancellation of registrations of some Trusts. It is also involved in a dispute with the Shapoorji Pallonji (SP) Group over alleged minority shareholder oppression. SP is the largest external investor in Tata Sons.The foundation has also appointed former Citi India head Pramit Jhaveri as a trustee of Sir Dorabji Tata Trust (SDTT) for three years with effect from February 12. Tata observers said Jhaveri could play a larger role in the group, including being on the board of Tata Sons.Venkataramanan had held the position of managing trustee at the foundation, but his Rs 2.66-crore compensation came under the scanner of the income tax authorities as it was not in line with the Trusts’ deed. The deed of SDTT (one of the main charitable organisations) specifies that the trustee must be paid Rs 1,000. The authorities subsequently withdrew the tax exemption given to SDTT.After Venkataramanan’s exit, the Trusts, chaired by Ratan Tata, decided to create the chief executive position, which will have similar powers as the managing trustee. Srinath’s compensation package at the Trusts couldn’t be ascertained, but with the Trusts doing away with the managing trustee position, it will have no problem in formulating his remuneration.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74114525,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-73731,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ratan-tatas-former-exec-asst-is-tata-trusts-1st-ceo/articleshow/74108353.cms

45,['13/02/2020'],Committee to decide on impending salary hike of MLAs,"This story is from February 13, 2020

Bhopal: Amid financial crisis and public debate over wealth and accountability, a committee headed by the deputy speaker of the Vidhan Sabha will soon recommend hike in salaries of legislators in Madhya Pradesh. The committee is studying proposals and planning to submit a report in the upcoming budget session of the assembly.

As per Madhya Pradesh Ministers’ (salaries and allowance) Amendment Bill 2016, and Madhya Pradesh Speaker, Deputy Speaker and Leader of Opposition (salaries and allowance) Amendment Bill 2016, passed in the House in April 2016, the chief minister gets a salary of Rs30,000 while other allowances takes his package to a total of around Rs2 lakh a month.

Similarly, salary and allowances of the Speaker of the assembly goes up to Rs1.85 lakh per month, Rs1.70 lakh for state cabinet rank ministers and Rs1.50 lakh monthly salary of ministers of states (MoS).

The members of the legislative assembly (MLAs) get a salary and allowance package of Rs1.10 lakh against Rs71,000 in 2015. This is inclusive of Rs30,000 as salary, Rs35,000 constituency allowance, Rs10,000 stationary allowance, Rs15,000 computer operator allowance and Rs10,000 as telephone allowance among other fixed wages.

After three-and-a-half years, the MLAs have again demanded hike in salary and allowance equivalent to Telangana state where the legislators’ salary and allowances per month goes up to Rs2.50 lakh.

“We have conducted the first meeting of the committee to discuss a possible hike in the salary and allowances of the MLAs. General administration department (GAD) minister Govind Singh and finance minister Tarun Bhanot are members of the committee. A few more meetings are likely to be called to chalk out the perks. We are hopeful to table our recommendations in the budget session of the assembly. It could also take some more time,” deputy speaker of Vidhan Sabha, Hina Kawre told TOI.

Sources in the Mantralaya disclosed that during the 14th Vidhan Sabha (2013 to 2018), a total Rs32.03 crore were spent on the salaries of legislators. In addition, Rs117 crore were paid as various wages and allowances while Rs34.03 crore were spent on travelling allowance. The total expenditure is Rs151.03 crore. The annual expenditure on MLAs amounts to Rs2.51 crore, which comes out to be Rs1.08 lakh additional pay on each MLA. Incidentally, this is four times more than the actual salary of an MLA.

It was also calculated that the per capita income in MP is Rs90,998 against Rs1.26 lakh national average. The poverty index of the state is 33% against 21% of national average. The employee unions seeking salary hike have demanded to form a wage board to decide salary hike of MLAs every 10 years.

Sources said that chief minister Kamal Nath is unwilling to approve a salary hike of the MLAs in the soon to be tabled state budget. This is why during a cabinet meeting last month, he had turned down the proposal of granting vehicle loan to the MLAs on subsidised interest rates.

Gangwar said, “It is only through better monitoring that eligible people can be provided full benefits of various schemes through cooperative institutions. With the introduction of a common platform for all the cooperative institutions, a unique system will be developed, and people will not be cheated by the societies.”

He said the departmental officers will be trained for systematic implementation of the common portal.

The state government had cancelled the registration of seven cooperative societies in the state in September last year. The seven credit co-operative societies whose registrations were cancelled are Shubh, Sudhan, Parvati, Dani, Ambe, Keshav and Supreme.

The department has also cancelled the registration of 33 housing co-operative societies of Jaipur that were not following norms.

Mumbai: SBI Mutual Fund has overtaken HDFC asset management company (AMC) to become the largest fund manager in the country. SBI MF , which was third largest in terms of assets under management (AUM) in December 2019, moved to the number one slot in January.

As of January-end, SBI MF’s AUM stood at Rs 3.82 lakh crore as against Rs 3.79 lakh crore for HDFC AMC and Rs 3.68 crore for ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund .

Satyanarayan Iyer | TNN

Pune: President Ram Nath Kovind on Wednesday said lenders must look to include all people into the banking services net. “I would urge them not to leave any citizen behind. It need not be emphasised to a banker that this is also the best way of gaining market depth and de-risking operations,” the President said, while addressing the golden jubilee celebration of the Pune-based National Institute of Bank Management (NIBM).

The President also urged bankers to focus on providing for the banking needs of Divyang (visually impaired) and also enhance gender diversity. “I request banks to take proactive measures to bring greater gender parity in ownership of financial assets... Divyang are more than 2% of our population and we have to make every effort to fully integrate them in the financial mainstream,” he said.

He lauded the role of Jan Dhan Yojana in taking banking services to the unbanked. “One can say that never before in history have so many been brought into the fold of the formal financial system. As the scheme progressed, nearly 35 crore bank accounts have been opened. This number is larger than the population of all countries except ours and China’s,” Kovind added.

To involve, those included in the banking system more deeply, the President asked the bankers to think of financial products that meet the needs of those at the bottom of the ladder. He urged NIBM to use its research facilities to create financial products for the poorer sections of the population.

“Deep involvement of those at the bottom of ladder requires display of empathy and compassion by the bankers. This needs greater engagement on part of banks with our underprivileged population and attitudinal change towards them,” he said.

The President said the goal of $5-trillion GDP also involves “banking with the unbanked” and “securing the unsecured”. He also said India should aim to have just more than one bank in the global list of top 100 banks.

PATNA: The Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) has slapped a fine of Rs 12.56 lakh on the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences ( IGIMS ) for flouting the Biomedical Waste Management Rules. It has also directed the hospital to deposit the fine in 15 days and rectify the shortcomings pointed out by the board within a month.

This is for the first time that a government hospital in the state has been found guilty of violating the biomedical waste rules.

Describing it as a “serious lapse”, BSPCB chairman Ashok K Ghosh told this newspaper on Wednesday, “Hundreds of patients from across the state visit the IGIMS, which has failed to dispose of hazardous biochemical wastes properly. Despite frequent reminders, the hospital did not improve its waste treatment system and caused damage to the environment.”

There is also a Common Biomedical Waste Treatment Facility on the premises of the IGIMS where numerous hospitals and private clinics dispose of biomedical wastes. During inspection, a BSPCB team found out that both the sewage and effluent treatment plants were not working and the hospital lacked a proper system for segregation of biomedical wastes.

“Hospitals are meant for treating patients, not spreading harmful germs and chemicals, which may cause diseases. The IGIMS has failed miserably in disposing of biomedical wastes,” said Ghosh.

The BSPCB has also issued a notice to the Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital and asked why a fine should not be slapped on it for flouting the pollution control rules.

Earlier, hundreds of private hospitals and pathological labs were issued ‘proposed closure direction’, following which they modified their biomedical waste disposal mechanism.

CHENNAI: With the auto sector witnessing sharp demand contraction, companies are cutting back production to clear out inventory. Ceat Tyres , part of the RPG group hopes that demand pick will start in the second half the current year. In conversation with TOI, Ceat managing director (MD) Anant Goenka speaks on market conditions, company performance and business expansion plans. Excerpts:Market is currently challenging. Actually, positive initiatives done by the government like curing pollution, increasing safety norms. But what happens as a result is the prices of vehicles are going up where the vehicle demand is seeing a dip. That’s the big challenge. It will take at least 8-9 months to see any pickup in demand. However, we have to wait till the festive season - Diwali 2020 - to see any demand pickup, as the previous festive season was weak.Share of tyre production for the replacement segment stands as high as 60%, while our original equipment (OE) share is at 30%.Have a sales target to export market about 15% of our revenue for this Chennai plant, which is similar to the company’s overall ratio of 13-15%.The performance for the fourth quarter looks positive on year-on-year basis. Though, business for the last year was difficult with the entire IL&FS situation.We have 40-50% of raw material cost towards crude and crude derivative products.

PATNA: Upbeat over the landslide victory in the Delhi assembly polls, Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) will, for the first time, contest Bihar assembly elections slated to be held later this year.

AAP’s Bihar unit president Shatrughan Sahu told TOI on Wednesday that the party has already started mass connect initiatives and his party AAP will contest Bihar elections with the same agenda of development and service to people.

VARANASI: The newly-built Vaidik Vigyan Kendra (Centre for Vedic Science) at Banaras Hindu University (BHU), set up to explore vedic corpus for knowledge related to various sciences and conduct multidisciplinary research and promote scientific approach and vision of seers, is likely to be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his February 16 visit.

PM Modi had laid foundation of the centre, being established with financial support of UP government, in September 2018.

BHU vice-chancellor Prof Rakesh Bhatnagar said there was need for research on establishing linkage between ancient wisdom and modern knowledge and exploring Vedas , the illustrious source of knowledge, and the centre will play a major role in this.

The centre will prepare reference documents/books, formalize scientific study of various aspects of Vedic intellectual heritage, promote logical and scientific achievements of vedic scholars and collaborate with national and international research institutions to conduct joint research, said CVS co-ordinator Dr Upendra Kumar Tripathi.

The centre would run research projects and collect vedic manuscripts for publication, he added.

The centre has been established to explore the glorious past of Vedic sciences for popularising them and has a modern state-of-art laboratory for study and research on effect of Vedic mantras, rituals, yoga and meditation on human mind through neuro-psychological studies, said Tripathi.

Various branches of vedic studies like science of rituals, agamas, music, architecture, astrology, astronomy, cosmology, medicine, surgery, yoga, mathematics, metallurgy remained in oblivion and the centre aims at bridging the gap by connecting them with modern science and technology, he added.

The UP government had made a provision of Rs 16 crore for the centre in the 2019-20 state budget. Earlier, the government had provided Rs 12 crore for the construction of building and Rs 2 crore for infrastructure development.

Divisional commissioner Deepak Agrawal said PM Modi would also inaugurate the 430-bed Centenary Superspecialty Block in Sir Sunderlal Hospital of BHU among 26 projects worth Rs 1,009 crore during his visit to the city.

Chennai: Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami, on Wednesday, unveiled tyre manufacturer - Ceat Ltd’s - manufacturing plant with an investment of Rs 1,400 crore and spread over an area of 163 acres near Sriperumbudur.

This plant has a manufacturing capacity of 28,500 passenger car radial tyres per day and 2,500 motor-cycle radial tyres per day, which is an additional 252 tonne per day to the existing total production capacity of 1,000 tonne per day. This facility aims to employ 1,000 people directly, comprising 40% of women staffs.

“With pickup in petrochemical production soon in the State, we hope tyre manufacturers need not import raw materials like synthetic rubber from external markets like Malaysia, but purchase at cheaper cost from within the State. This could also lead to more employment opportunities and give a push to domestic supplies,” Palaniswami said.

The CM, who also asked Ceat’s MD Anant Goenka to start R&D activities in Tamil Nadu, assured that the industries department will take all steps to provide single window clearance system for the company for smoother operations going forward.

<p>RJD chief Lalu Prasad <br></p>

PATNA: RJD chief Lalu Prasad took to Twitter on Wednesday to post a parody of a cheeky Bollywood number to take a swipe at chief minister Nitish Kumar for bowing before the portrait of RSS ideologue Deen Dayal Upadhyaya after unveiling his statue in the state capital on Tuesday.

“Tere dar par sanam chale aaye, tu na aaya to hum chale aaye…le kar sangh mukt Bharat ka bhramm chaley aye, le kar apna bhramm swayam chaley aaye…” read the tweet, accompanied by photos of Nitish paying his tributes to the RSS ideologue.

Lalu, who is in jail in the fodder scam cases and currently under treatment at Rims in Ranchi, posted the tweet to contrast with Nitish’s call for “Sangh-Mukt Bharat (RSS-free India) to save democracy in India”, given in April 2016 when he was heading the JD(U)-RJD-Congress coalition government in the state.Reacting to Lalu’s tweet, JD(U) national secretary general K C Tyagi told TOI that when the first non-Congress government was formed in Bihar in 1967 by the socialists under the leadership of Mahamaya Prasad Sinha and Karpoori Thakur; Upadhyaya’s Jansangh was part of the government. Again in 1977, when the Janta Party formed the government in Bihar under the leadership of Karpoori Thakur, the Jansangh was again part of the government.

“In fact, Lalu himself won the Lok Sabha elections in 1977 and 1989 with the support of then Jansangh and the Bhartiya Janta Party, respectively. It is not appropriate for Lalu to preach us,” Tyagi said.

He added, “Nitish Kumar Ji is carrying forward the legacy of great socialist leaders like Lohia, JP and Karpoori Thakur. Lalu is attacking the heritage and past leadership of the non-Congress movement by raising question over unveiling the statue of Upadhyaya.

PATNA: Amid the ongoing fear of novel coronavirus (nCoV), at least 25 persons from different parts of the state have been kept under observation at their homes.

Of them, two persons are from Madhepura, Siwan and Madhubani each, three from Patna and East Champaran each and one each from West Champaran, Saran and Bhagalpur. The remaining persons are from Supaul and other places. “Even though these people have been found to be asymptomatic, we have kept them under observation for 14 days as precautionary measure,” state surveillance officer Dr Ragani Mishra said.

Meanwhile, samples of altogether five persons from different parts of the state, including Bhojpur, Supaul and West Champaran, have been sent to National Institute of Virology (NIV) till now. “Of the five nCoV suspects, four have been tested negative, including the one who was admitted to ANMMCH in Gaya last week. Test report of Supaul resident is awaited,” she said.

“Earlier, strict vigil was kept on people returning from China, Hong Kong, Thailand, Singapore and Nepal. However, on Tuesday, the state health department asked to keep a vigil on people coming from South Korea and Japan as well. We have also increased the number of gram sabha meetings and orientation programmes being conducted at schools,” she said.

Meanwhile, residents are avoiding poultry and non-vegetarian food, including seafood and chicken in view of the nCoV. Sujit Yadav of Buddha Colony said: “I have stopped eating non-veg food, especially fish. Since, the cause for the deadly virus is still unknown, we must avoid food that we are unsure about.”

However, Mishra said people should not panic. “People should definitely take precautions, but coming to a conclusion is not correct because nothing is clear as of now. Until and unless some solid proof comes up, we cannot say what food to avoid,” she said.

“However, in the wake of the nCoV outbreak, people, especially those who returned from China after January 14, are advised to follow health advisories issued by the government. Besides, if they feel any symptoms of coronavirus, they should call on our call centre number ‘104’ and report us,” she added.

LJP on Wednesday announced a seven-member committee headed by party president Chirag Paswan for drafting ‘First Bihari, First Vision 2020’ document, which will be basically its manifesto for the state assembly election to be held later this year.

“The vision document will be prepared after having dialogues with the people in the villages and knowing their problems. Party president Chirag Paswan has already announced that those who will make 25,000 party members at booth level will be considered for the party symbol in the state elections,” said Krishna Kumar Kallu, media incharge of LJP.

It will be, in fact, the third assembly elections for LJP since its founder Ram Vilas Paswan passed on the baton to his son and Jamui MP Chirag Paswan. Incidentally, LJP could not win even a single seat in Delhi and Jharkhand assembly elections.

RJD has also started district and booth level preparations, for which the meeting of its legislators and newly elected district presidents was held in Patna last week. The party is planning to form a 15-member committee and make 100 primary workers at every polling booth by this month end.

RJD spokesperson Chitranjan Gagan said the party’s state executive committee is to meet on Thursday. “It has been targeted to make 100 primary workers, four active members and form a 15-member struggle committee at every booth. The state and district presidents have already been instructed in this regard in the recent meetings held at Patna. They were asked to coordinate with former district presidents, MPs and MLAs for the same. The Thursday meeting will chalk out strategy for further preparations,” Gagan said.

JD(U) is also organizing booth level training camps in all assembly segments till February 16. “The party has identified polling booth as the primary unit for strengthening the organization. Accordingly, around 72,000 booth presidents and secretaries were recently appointed. Now, a booth level training session has been going on since February 10 for further strengthening the party’s preparation for the upcoming assembly polls,” JD(U) spokesperson Rajiv Ranjan Prasad said.

Congress has also started poll preparations with training of its IT cell. State Congress leaders were given social media training on Monday. Altogether 500 functionaries were trained by experts at a workshop organized by Bihar Congress’s ‘social media’ and information and technology cell. State president of Congress’s social media and IT cell, Sanjeev Singh, said one social media head will be appointed in each district and assembly constituency besides at block and booth level by the end of February.

Congress’s state unit working president Kaukab Quadri said efforts were on to rejuvenate the block level party functionaries.

Ramdas Athawale

GAYA: Union minister of state for social justice and empowerment Ramdas Athawale has emphatically reassured the SC/ST and OBCs that the ongoing reservation facility in government jobs will, in no case be tinkered with and they will continue to get population-based reservation in the jobs, as has been the practice so far.

Athawale was talking to media persons in Gaya on Wednesday afternoon.

Asked about the Union government’s response to job reservation in the light of the recent SC judgement, saying that reservation was not a fundamental right, the Union minister said the government will do everything possible to ensure justice to the disadvantaged sections.

“The government is seriously seized with the matter and an appropriate response will soon be made to clear the air. Opposition parties were engineering panic for narrow political gains,” alleged the Union minister.

The minister said the interests of the SC/STs and other disadvantaged groups were fully safe in the hands of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “The PM is committed to all-round upliftment of the hitherto deprived sections. The SC/STs figured high in the PM’s priority list,” Athawale said.

Playing down the impact of the Delhi elections on the national politics and equations within the NDA, Athwale said, “Delhi election will have absolutely no impact on national politics.”

Refusing to give credit to AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal for the landslide victory of his party in the Delhi assembly elections, Athawale said the Delhi voters fell in the freebie trap laid by CM Arvind Kejriwal. “The Delhi voters will soon repent their choice,” he said.

We request the honourable court to pass the cases on Thursday and Friday, in case the counsels fail to appear,” states the resolution passed by them and signed by the chairman of the coordination committee of the advocates’ associations, Yogesh Chandra Verma, and presidents of the three associations.

The lawyers had abstained from work since last Friday demanding restoration of old system of listing of cases and alternative arrangement of filing the cases till they are acquainted with the new online system. They had initially announced to abstain from work till February 17.

Suggestions made by the bar for the workable solution of listing included creation of a case bank on monthly basis for every roaster for both fresh and previously pending cases to be uploaded to the Patna high court’s website. “Every Monday, hundred cases would be listed for that day. This listing would be in seriatim irrespective of the subjects in the roaster … Adjourned cases in the roaster on account of counter affidavit, case diary, etc to join the list on a lateral basis as per the seriatim. Same principle be adopted for adjourned cases,” the memorandum enumerating suggestions made by the bar stated.

It further stated that bail matter may be listed as fresh cases and a committee comprising the Chief Justice, members of the coordination committee, registrar general, registrar listing and NIC be constituted for monthly review of listing issues.

68,['13/02/2020'],GJEPC appeals revision of credit terms for payment-hit exporters,"This story is from February 13, 2020

SURAT: The Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council ( GJEPC ) has urged the central government and the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) to revise credit terms for the payment-hit exporters.

Diamantaires and jewellery exporters in Surat and Mumbai have been facing serious issue of delayed payments from Hong Kong owing to the prolonged anti-government protests and also from the recent novel coronavirus outbreak.

In a statement, chairman of GJEPC, Pramod Kumar Agarwal stated that Surat has an exposure of about 40% with Hong Kong and mainland China. The protests and the virus outbreak in China has disrupted the business including delay in the payments.

In its letter addressed to RBI, finmin and ministry of commerce, the council pointed out that protests in Hong Kong commenced around April 2019 and have turned violent since Sept-Oct 2019. This has disrupted business in many ways, with offices being partially closed due to violent protests; clearance of parcels exported getting delayed and overall slowdown of trade.

GJEPC said that this has impacted the turnover and financial dealings with the traders based out of Hong Kong with India, the financial implications of which have led to delay in shipments and delay in receipt of export proceeds.

Further, the council states, “As if this was not enough, the breakout of coronavirus in mainland China and then spreading to other countries too has also led to adverse impact on gems and jewellery trade in these regions too.”

The business has thus been facing severe hurdles with commitments not being fulfilled in exports and for inward remittances, they said. Moreover, a major trade fair scheduled for March too has been rescheduled for May.

“The trade foresees major imbalance in payments for the community dealing with various merchants in this part of the world. The RBI should consider giving leeway and time for credit facilities availed by exporters / importers for meeting their financial commitments,” GJEPC stated.

SURAT: The powerloom weavers manufacturing nylon fabrics have represented to the additional director general of trade remedies (DGTR) on Wednesday stating that the anti-dumping duty on the nylon filament yarn would render about 1 lakh powerloom workers jobless.

Powerloom weavers met additional DGTR, Mithilesh Thakur in New Delhi and submitted their reply at the ongoing hearing on imposing anti-dumping duty on nylon filament yarn on Wednesday. The weavers stated that the anti-dumping duty of $1 on the imported nylon yarn would increase the yarn prices by Rs 90 per kilogram in the domestic market.

Weavers stated about 6,500 powerloom units are manufacturing nylon yarn employing more than one lakh workers. The hike in the prices of nylon yarn would force the weavers to shut their units thereby rendering the workers jobless.

Senior office-bearer of Federation of Gujarat Weavers Association (FOGWA), Mayur Golwala said, “The DGTR is running the anti-dumping case of nylon yarn from the last four months. The import duty on yarn will ruin the nylon weavers in the city as the yarn prices will go up by more than Rs 90 per kilogram.”

Chairman of the Federation of Indian Art Silk Weaving Industry (FIASWI), Bharat Gandhi said, “Against the claim of the yarn spinner, the import of nylon yarn in the country has gone down from 25,000 metric tones in 2015-16 to 21,000 metric tonnes in 2018-19. Till now, the imported yarn has protected the domestic industry’s survival.”

SURAT: A person travelling from Sharjah was nabbed by the air intelligence unit of the customs department from Surat airport with 200 grams of gold worth Rs 9 lakh on late Tuesday night.

Official sources said that the accused identified Rajesh Chabria , a resident of Mumbai had arrived at Surat airport in the Surat-Sharjah flight on Tuesday night. Since his movements were suspicious on the airport, the sleuths of air intelligence unit decided to scan his body.

On scanning, it was found that the smuggler had hidden the gold capsules in his rectum. The passenger was detained after suspicion. Later on detailed examination, it was found that the passenger had put the gold paste covered with plastic sheaths in his rectum.

Sources said that the accused had brought the gold to deliver it in Surat. There are many traders in Surat who are paying the smugglers handsome amount to smuggle gold from Dubai .

It must be noted that the smuggling of gold has increased after the government increased import duty on gold from 10% to 12.5%. Since the Surat airport operates a single international flight between Surat-Sharjah, the smugglers are finding it easy to get the yellow metal smuggled from Sharjah.

72,['13/02/2020'],Surat News: Gangster stabbed to death; assailant killed in incident,"This story is from February 13, 2020

Hardik Patel was caught on the CCTV footage of the crime

SURAT: Gangster Surya Marathi alias Suresh Pawar was stabbed to death on Ved Road in the city on Tuesday. In the attack, Marathi’s former close associate Hardik Patel , who was with the assailants, too was killed as Marathi stabbed him in retaliation.

Police investigation revealed that Marathi had allegedly molested Patel’s wife during Navratri in 2019. Patel had been nursing a grudge against Marathi and had decided to kill him once he was out of jail.

On the fateful day, around seven assailants led by Patel barged into Marathi’s office and stabbed him 20 times.

At around 1.22 pm on Tuesday the attackers barged into Marathi’s office on the ground floor of Om Sai Park Apartment. Marathi was alone in the office. None of the attackers had covered their faces and they were seen leaving the office in blood stained clothes in a CCTV footage. As the faces of all the attackers are clearly visible, police are trying to ascertain their identities.

After stabbing Marathi, the assailants escaped from the spot. But due to the stabbing injury in private part caused by Marathi, Patel’s condition worsened around a kilometre away while escaping. He was rushed to a nearby private hospital where he died due to heavy blood loss. Marathi, who also suffered heavy blood loss, was first taken to Prannath Hospital and later shifted to Mahavir Hospital where he was declared dead.

“The police have identified few of the accused, and attempts are on to identify others. The police have rounded up some suspects and attempts are on to nab the others,” said an official from Chowk Bazaar police station.

The police refused to divulge the names of those identified, citing secrecy of the investigation.

“We have deployed bandobast in the area to maintain law and order,” said B R Pandor, deputy commissioner of police, zone II.

Marathi and his gang operated on Ved Road, Katargam and Chowk Bazaar police station limits. He was involved in extortion and land disputes. Marathi’s men were also into private financing. Marathi was arrested in 2017 for the murder of another gangster, Manu Dahya Baraiya, operating in the same area. While Marathi was in jail, Patel used to manage the gang’s activities.

Marathi had come out of jail after being acquitted by a local court in the murder case of Baraiya.

On February 5, Marathi and his six associates were acquitted by a local court. Marathi was named as an accused in the Baraiya murder case in Gotalawadi area in the limits of Katargam police station in April 2017. Marathi and his associates — Paresh Limbachiya alias Paliyo, Jayesh Paul alias Jay, Vikash Magre alias Ikiya, Jayesh Sosa, Akshay Devre and Amol Zine were acquitted by the court for want of evidences. During the hearing of the case, majority of witnesses turned hostile including the main witness.

DID MARATHI’S MEN BETRAY HIM?

Meanwhile, the CCTV footage of the crime has revealed that two of Marathi’s gang members were sitting outside the office when the assailants entered it with weapons. “We have called them up for questioning as their role is highly suspected. It is suspected that Marathi’s own men had betrayed him and had given the tip-off about him to his assailants,” the official added.

THE BARAIYA MURDER CASE

Baraiya was shot dead when he was returning home from a barber shop that is at a walking distance from his home on April 17. Baraiya was shot from a close range by two attackers on a motorcycle, according to the complaint by his son Jigar. Marathi was identified as the shooter by eyewitness then.

PANAJI: The directorate of education, in an advisory to schools on coronavirus , has said that misinformation and racism are more dangerous than any virus. “The panic and hysteria... is fuelled by racism and xenophobia, not evidence or practicality,” states the note issued to schools. Students have also been asked not to fall prey to panic over the virus, or to engage in ‘rude’ and ‘insensitive’ jokes which may be racist.The advisory seeks to bust the ‘myths’ surrounding the ailment. The advisory also says that we need not all “panic and blame China for this emergency”.“Nothing justifies being rude to others,” it states.The circular also asks schools to inform students that they should not believe everything they read online about coronavirus because it may not necessarily be factually correct.“Check for references and look for evidence, not ideology,” the advisory states. While informing students that they need not “buy a hazmat suit and an n95 mask to stay protected”, the advisory issued by director Vandana Rao states that “washing hands and sneezing into elbows is the best practice” to keep infection at bay. Clarifying on the ‘myth’ that “coronavirus is the most dangerous virus on earth”, the advisory counters it with the ‘fact’ that ‘the common flu kills 60 times more people annually than coronavirus’”.“Only 2% cases have reported deaths, and most of these deaths are associated with weaker immune systems (e.g. old age),” states the advisory, clarifying that being diagnosed with coronavirus does not mean that death due to it is inevitable.The circular has been sent to heads of all government, government-aided and unaided schools from the primary to the higher secondary level.“Bring this advisory to the notice of the students, teachers and non-teaching staff of the respective school and put it up on the notice board,” Rao said in the circular issued on Tuesday.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74115600,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-401788,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/misinformation-racism-more-dangerous-than-coronavirus-edu-dept-to-students/articleshow/74108239.cms

76,['13/02/2020'],Court still waits for a speed-breaker outside its building,"This story is from February 13, 2020

Two years on, Surat civic body is yet to fulfill its promise

SURAT: The tables have turned for lawyers practising at the Surat district court, who are now awaiting justice from the Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) for the past two years.

A long-pending demand of the lawyers for construction of speed-breakers on the main road outside the court building in Athwalines as protection from speeding vehicles seems to be going on the lines of pending court judgments.

On regular days, the district court located on the Athwalines is teeming with tens of hundreds of people including lawyers, litigants and policemen. Being one of the busiest road, vehicles zoom past the court building in the absence of speed-breakers. Those crossing the road outside the court building have to remain extra vigilant and that there have been minor accidents reported in the past.

It was in 2017, the speed-breakers on the road outside the court building were demolished during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s roadshow ahead of the Assembly election. Despite various reminders by the Surat District Bar Association (SDBA), the SMC is yet to construct speed-breakers on the main road.

Sources said that the entire stretch from Surat airport to Athwalines main witness VVIP movements including that of CM, ministers from state and the central government. However, the entire stretch has been kept clear of speed-breakers.

President of SDBA, Brijesh Patel told TOI, “We have sent several letters to the SMC including the Athwa zone for constructing speed-breakers outside the court building, but no action has been taken from the last two years. If there is a VVIP movement, it doesn’t mean that the innocent people should suffer. We have been facing lot of difficulties crossing the road on the other side in absence of speed-breakers.”

Patel added, “The traffic situation at the court building is worse during the peak hours. Since the entire parking space inside the court building remains chock-a-block, the lawyers and litigants must occupy the parking space on both the sides of the road. It is a challenge to cross the road from the other side due to the speeding vehicles”

An advocate, Zameer Shaikh said, “I narrowly escaped an accident a few days ago from a speeding car. I was crossing the road when the car suddenly appeared in front of me. The driver applied brakes on time or else I would have been hit hard. Many people are facing similar situation on a daily basis.”

Talking with TOI, deputy municipal commissioner, Rajesh Pandya said, “We have been told by the police department that the entire stretch from the airport to Athwalines is for the VVIP movement and so there will be no speed-breakers. We will have to take permission from the police department to construct speed breakers in front of the court.”

Representative Image

SURAT: The figure of tax defaulters may look very small when compared to the total number of properties in the Diamond City . However, there are at least 620 major tax defaulters in Surat who have not cleared their taxes in excess of Rs 2 lakh. And more than 100 have not paid their dues which are in excess of Rs 5 lakh.

At present in Surat, there are more than 19 lakh property taxpayers, and this year’s demand for property taxes is Rs 1,385 crore against which till date the recovery is Rs 982 crore. In the year 2018-19, against the demand of Rs 1,234 crore, the recovery of Rs 920 crore was made on the same date. This recovery at present amounts to 70.92% for the current year.

“We generally have more than 90% recovery ratio against the current years demand. It is the tax defaulters from the past few years that create the issues.” said a senior official from the recovery department of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC). “Majority of the people are regular taxpayers and at least 12-20% pay up their taxes in advance too. However, it is this small number of defaulters that troubles the SMC .” he added.

A look at the figures of the defaulters suggests that a large number comes from the central zone consisting of old parts of the city. Out of 620 defaulters, 179 are from the central zone and 112 are from Udhna zone. These taxpayers have their taxes due for more than three years.

“In central zone, we have number of disputed properties where property owners and tenants are at loggerheads. So no one pays taxes. We also have some old railway properties where taxes are overdue from years which brings our recovery ratio down,” said M Y Bham, deputy accountant of SMC. “In Udhna zone too, there are some big disputed properties where taxes are not paid. These properties include old closed dying mills in Pandesara and big properties like Baroda Rayon .”

The SMC this year has issued more than 1.5 lakh demand notices to commercial and residential properties of the city.

According to the SMC, a normal taxpayer who owns a house always pays his taxes regularly, but it is those big industrial and corporate type owners that do not pay up in time.

78,['13/02/2020'],Amazon to HC: Probe by CCI an abuse of power,"This story is from February 13, 2020

BENGALURU: Amazon India told the Karnataka high court on Wednesday that there is no “prima facie” evidence on the basis of which the Competition Commission of India (CCI) wants to open a probe. The e-tailing giant, in its hearing to quash the anti-competition investigation, added that it would be an abuse of power if such a probe is initiated.

According to Amazon, the Delhi Vyapar Mahasangh — which represents a group of small and medium-sized retailers — has been filing identical cases in Delhi HC (dismissed) and Rajasthan HC (pending). Essentially questioning the motive behind such moves, the e-tailer said this group has now gone to the CCI with similar allegations of predatory pricing and preferential treatment to select sellers.

The senior advocate representing Amazon India said that the e-tailer had offered its recommendations to the CCI, which made it to the study released on January 8 on a self-regulatory approach for e-commerce. It was pointed that, if the regulator could reach out to Amazon for the same, why would they not approach the company in case of such allegations by the Delhi Vyapar Mahasangh.

“There must be a prima facie finding with adverse effects on competition... (it) would be essential and mandatory before CCI could order such an investigation,” said Amazon’s advocate. Amazon’s legal representatives also highlighted many of the initiatives. For example, doorstep grocery delivery actually increases competition instead of being anti-competitive. They cited previous judgments in cases of Star India and Airtel over CCI probe orders that were quashed on similar grounds as Amazon’s.

Interestingly, a legal representative from Flipkart was also present at the hearing as the Walmart-owned e-tailer has been a respondent in the case by Amazon India. “Our counsel was present in the audience and did not actively participate,” Flipkart said in a statement.

Delhi Vyapar Mahasangh’s lawyer questioned why Amazon was oversensitive about the investigation and said it was facing various probes in the US and other markets. Further arguments in the case, including from the CCI, are expected on Thursday when the HC is expected to give its order on the “interim stay” on the probe.

Last week, the local arm of the Seattle-based e-commerce major moved the HC, seeking a stay on the CCI probe, slamming it as “perverse, arbitrary and untenable in law”. Amazon is seeking an interim stay on the matter, without which the US e-tailer said it would see “irreparable loss” and the same would hurt its brand goodwill.

On January 13, the CCI had ordered an investigation into the operations of US-owned e-tailers like Amazon India and Flipkart (in which Walmart owns a 77% stake). The probe was for various trade practices, including deep discounts and favourable terms to select sellers. This was done following a complaint by the Delhi Vyapar Mahasangh against the two e-tailers, who dominate the online retail market with over 70% share.

The CCI order to probe Amazon came days before Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos landed in India for a visit last month, where he announced $1 billion of new investment. Right after Bezos’s announcement, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal kicked up a row, saying Amazon wasn’t “doing any favour” to India by investing as it was to cover up losses. He even questioned how can a marketplace lose so much money.

80,['13/02/2020'],Kolkata: Low certified screener count threat over roll-out schedule,"AAICLAS employees check flyers’ luggage on the ILBS system on Wednesday

KOLKATA: After a tentative start on Tuesday, when one flight used the newly installed inline baggage screening system (ILBS), over 1,000 checked-in bags of seven international flights were cleared through it on Wednesday. On February 17-18, passengers of all international flights will be able to avail of the facility. The soft launch of the domestic wing is set for February 18 once the advanced X-ray machines in all three portals in the international wing become operational. But shortage of screeners may force the airport authorities to push back the internal deadline for bringing all flights under the ambit of ILBS from February 24 to February 28.Speaking to TOI, airport director Kaushik Bhattacharjee said that while the system was working smoothly, availability of certified screeners — who need to be deployed in adequate numbers before the full roll-out of ILBS — was an issue that Airport Authority of India’s subsidiary company AAI-CLAS was trying to resolve.“Around 114 screeners have been recruited and trained for Kolkata. Of them, 54 have been certified for deployment by the Bureau of Civil Aviation Services (BCAS) after they were examined. Some more have taken the examination while the rest will sit for the tests soon. We need around 65-70 certified screeners for 24x7 operations spanning both domestic and international wings,” said Bhattacharjee.That figure seems rather elusive at present with only 12 of the 54 certified screeners currently in Kolkata. They are an integral part of the ILBS soft launch currently underway in the international wing. The remaining 42 have been dispatched to Chennai, Goa and Varanasi, where the system is also being launched.Bhattacharjee is hoping a good number of screeners recruited for those airports will also receive the BCAS certification within the next few days so that those from Kolkata who are now deputed there can fly back in time for the domestic ILBS launch.“In the meantime, we expect more screeners to receive certification here so that they add up to the minimum strength required to get going,” he said.While seven screeners need to be deputed per shift in the international wing, the domestic wing needs 12 every shift. That pegs the daily requirement of screeners at 57. With rotational off days added, the actual number required will range between 65 and 70.Checked-in baggage screening was earlier done by Air India in the international wing and individual airlines in the domestic section. But with the screening system becoming centralized, AAI Cargo Logistics & Allied Services Co Ltd (AAICLAS) has been created to perform the task. Though many of the new recruits were screeners of various airlines, including grounded airline Jet Airways, they have had to be retrained and certified because the CTX images are different from the ones that conventional X-Ray machines generate.Also, since the screening has to be done along a moving belt that cannot be stopped, swift and accurate decision making will be critical.“Screeners have to clear the bags and ensure there are no slip-ups.

PATNA: Altogether 100 stalls have been put up at the Gandhi handicraft exhibition organized at Gandhi Maidan. The fair-cum-exhibition showcases rural handicrafts from Bihar as well as other parts of the country, including Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, West Bengal and Punjab.

It has been organized by Ambpali Handloom and Handicraft Multi-state Cooperative Society. Its president Archana Singh said the motive behind organizing this exhibition was to empower skilled artisans from rural parts of the state as well as the country. “The exhibition gives a chance to rural entrepreneurs to sell their products through direct marketing. Besides, a fair like this not only encourages rural entrepreneurs but also helps in understanding customers’ likes and dislikes regarding the products,” she said.

From Mithila painting, Tikuli Art, stone craft, terracotta and Sikki Art to Tussar silk sari, dress material and khadi clothing, the products are finding many takers. Food items, including ‘papad’, ‘badi’ and pickle are also attracting customers at the exhibition.

Madhubani-based artisan Vimal Devi said she is expecting an overwhelming response from the visitors. “I have been selling Madhubani paintings for the last many years. The paintings are in demand across the country,” she said.

Another artisan, Urmila from Ranchi said: “Bamboo products available at my stall are in high demand.”

The collection of sari at a stall is extremely good, said Rashi Shrivastava of Kumhrar.

“Food items, especially semolina ‘papad’, ‘badi, potato chips, ‘adori’ and ‘tisiori’ are good products at the fair. Besides, the products are being sold at a much cheaper prices,” said Savita Sinha, a visitor.

82,['13/02/2020'],NHAI explores new ways for recharging FASTag accounts,"This story is from February 13, 2020

Jaipur: Even as FASTag coverage in Rajasthan has touched nearly 70% and toll collection through it has gone over 75%, people are still finding it difficult to recharge their accounts.

Hence, National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is exploring new ways of recharging the accounts physically at toll plazas, shops, and e-mitra centres.

“People are still facing problems with regard to recharging their FASTag accounts. That's why NHAI is exploring new ways. FASTag accounts can be recharged anywhere like mobile phones,” said said M K Jain, chief general manager, NHAI regional office (Rajasthan).

Meanwhile, the truck drivers are still adopting two-tag tactic, i.e. carrying two stickers (valid and blacklisted), to evade tax at the toll plazas. ""Some banks/private distributors still haven't linked the tags with the vehicles. That is why, when they buy a second sticker, it doesn't show that they are already registered with FASTag,” said Jain.

IHMCL (Indian Highways Management Company Limited) has identified some vehicles carrying two tags in order to evade toll tax and has blacklisted both the stickers. These drivers usually paste the blacklisted tag on the windscreen. First, they would argue with the toll plaza officials for 5-10 minutes with the hope that they would be allowed to go after a long argument. Then, they put pressure on the officials to check with the hand-held machines. If they are not allowed to leave, they either take out the valid tag and get it scanned or make the payment through cash.

“By using this ploy, if they are allowed to go by the toll plaza officials coming under pressure due to the increasing traffic, they can save Rs 1,000-1,500 each day. So, they use these tricks to evade toll tax. This leads to traffic congestion at the toll plazas,” Jain said.

“When they lodge a complaint on the helpline number 1033, they give the number of the valid sticker, and not the blacklisted one, which is pasted on the windscreen. After calling, they would complain why were they not allowed to go. But when the numbers were tallied on the system, they don't match,” he added.

83,['13/02/2020'],Centre’s expert panel clears green nods for 2 MPT projects,"This story is from February 13, 2020

Panaji: The Union environment ministry’s expert appraisal committee ( EAC ) has recommended that environmental clearance (EC) should be granted to Mormugao Port Trust to deepen the approach channel and redevelop berths.

The decision will pave the way for MPT to go ahead with its expansion plans.

“Based on the information submitted, examination of the submitted documents, clarifications provided by the project proponent during appraisal of the project and after detailed deliberations on all the issues, (EAC) recommends the project for grant of environment clearance,” the EAC noted in the minutes of the 48th meeting.

Locals and activists had opposed MPT’s plans claiming that capital dredging would affect the marine ecosystem and the Vasco shoreline.

MPT wants to deepen the depth of the approach channel to 19.5-19.8m from the existing depth of 14-14.4m over an 18km length. An earlier EC granted to MPT was quashed and set aside by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) on September 2, 2016. MPT then challenged the NGT’s order before the Supreme Court, but the apex court dismissed MPT’s appeal.

While giving MPT the green signal, the EAC (Infrastructure) has imposed certain conditions on MPT. The EAC has said that no construction other than what is permitted as per the Coastal Regulation Zone Notification can be done.

“Dredging shall not be carried out during the fish breeding season. Dredging, etc shall be carried out in the confined manner to reduce the impacts on marine environment,” the EAC said.

The EAC has also said that while carrying out dredging, an independent monitoring shall be carried out by a government agency or institute to check the impact and necessary measures should be taken on priority basis if any adverse impact is observed.

MPT has assured the environment ministry that it will utilise at least Rs 5 crore under Corporate Environment Responsibility (CER) Plan. The funds will be used for resurfacing of roads, suppression of dust and planting of saplings around the port area.

Both these projects , deepening of the channel and redevelopment of the berths were recommended by Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA) on January 24, 2019.

Meanwhile, IIT-Bombay, which is carrying out the source apportionment study, has submitted preliminary report in February 2019, phase I report in September 2019 and raw data report on December 2019. It has sought more time for submission of final report and the same is consented by GSPCB.

PATNA: State road construction minister Nand Kishore Yadav on Wednesday asked senior officials of Bihar State Road Development Corporation (BSRDC) to ensure vehicular movement on Digha flyover by February 15. The flyover connects Digha approach road to JP Setu. He also asked the officials to make Digha-AIIMS elevated highway ready for vehicular movement by April.

The minister was reviewing the progress of the ongoing BSRDC projects with its senior officials, including managing director Sanjay Kumar Agarwal and chief general manager Sanjay Kumar. Agarwal made a detailed presentation on the ongoing projects.

The first 2km of the elevated road is a two-lane semi-elevated structure and the remaining stretch till Digha is a four-lane road.

The minister also expressed concern over the slow progress on the Ganga Path project, popularly known as Ganga driveway. A representative of the contractor executing the project said the stretch between Digha and A N Sinha Institute will be ready by June this year.

The minister also asked the officials to ensure that the six-lane bridge between Kachchi Dargah and Bidupur is made ready by 2021. Claimed to be the longest river bridge in India, the total length of Kachchi Dargah- Bidupur bridge connecting Patna and Vaishali over the Ganga would be 22.76km, of which the main bridge length is 9.76km.

Deliberating on the targets set for Bihta-Sarmera state highway, the minister said: “The stretch between Dumri and Sarmera will be completed by March and from Dumri to Bihta by June.”

He also claimed that R Block-Digha road will be made ready by June. Officials told the minister that a flyover under the project is being constructed at Hartali Mor to prevent any obstruction to vehicular movement.

RAJGIR: Nalanda University is to start three research centres — Centre for Bay of Bengal, Centre for Conflict Resolution and Peace building and Common Archival Resource Centre — from the upcoming academic session, its vice-chancellor Sunaina Singh said on Wednesday.

Singh said the university has already shortlisted 13 candidates for the PhD course to start from August 2020. “We are going to run both regular as well as part-time 4 years’ PhD course in three centres,” she said.

Addressing the media on the new campus of Nalanda University at Rajgir on Wednesday, Singh said the university was also going to start its first MBA course under the School of Business Management from the upcoming academic session. “The course would be specialized in sustainable development and management. Besides, we are going to start several certificate and diploma courses of one year in cultural heritage and ethos,” she said.

“The journey of rebirth of new Nalanda University has been very small. Historically, if we look at institutions, it takes a long time to grow. But now, we are slowly spreading our wings,” Singh said.

The VC said the university has 100 students in postgraduate courses and 650 in diploma and certificate programmes. “About 60% students are from Australia, New Zealand, US, Canada and other European countries. Earlier, we only had students from South Asian countries,” Singh said.

“Of the total students, around 50% are girls and 30% students are monks. We have 26 faculty members, including three foreigners for four PG courses and other certificate and diploma programmes. Some visiting faculties from abroad also take classes in language and literature/humanities, ecology and environment studies, historical studies and Buddhist studies,” the VC said.

Presently, the university’s five buildings — academic block, laboratory block, faculty block, teaching block and administrative block — are operational. The sprawling campus is spread over 465 acre land, where 110 buildings, including 17 non-residential and 80 residential ones will come up.

KOLKATA: In a bid to put a ban on using groundwater and augment filtered water supply in different city areas, the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) has planned to set up 11 capsule booster pumping stations in the next two years. The matter was discussed on Wednesday at the mayor-in-council meeting held at the civic headquarters. Among the 11 stations, the one at Kayasthapara (Kasba) was inaugurated on Wednesday and three others — Bansdroni (Tollygunge), Panchasayar (EM Bypass) and Jodhpur Park — will become operational by this weekend.For the remaining seven such capsule booster pumping stations, land has either been earmarked or the process of search is still on. Some of the areas where the land has been earmarked include Manasatala ( Kidderpore ), Behala and Shraddhananda Park (Amherst Street). Search for land is on in areas like Behala, Tollygunge Jadavpur and areas located off EM Bypass, a KMC water supply department official said.According to a KMC water supply department official, the focus of the department was on replacing ground water with filtered water. “Our motto now is very clear. We have taken up augmentation of water treatment plants in a major way. I want the results of such augmentation to reach the citizens who are even now dependent on groundwater. Keeping in mind paucity of land, we have identified small plots where capsule booster pumping stations will come up. We will build more such booster pumping stations to replace groundwater usage, especially in added areas, like Garden Reach, Behala, Tollygunge and areas along EM Bypass,” mayor Firhad Hakim said.Sources in the KMC water supply department said special stress was being laid on construction of capsule booster pumping stations in large areas of Behala and Tollygunge. “We have already built four water booster pumping stations in Behala and identified land for two more that will come up in the next two years. Similarly, such booster pumping stations have been inaugurated in Golf Green, Pallisree, Baghajatin and another station constructed at Bansdroni will be inaugurated this week,” said a KMC water supply department official.On Wednesday, residents of Kayasthapara and other areas in Kasba gathered in large numbers during the inauguration of a capsule booster pumping station. Sambit Guha, a senior manager with a pharmaceutical company and a resident of Kayasthapara, expressed satisfaction over construction of the booster pumping station as now they would get filtered water from Dhapa water treatment plant.“Now we will be relieved of the burden of buying mineral water regularly as the quality of groundwater is very bad,” Guha said.“In large areas located adjacent to Bansdroni, Naktala and Garia, a section of citizens is still dependent on groundwater.

As soon as the habeas corpus petition of Sara, who was present in the courtroom, was taken up for hearing before a bench led by Justice N V Ramana, Justice Shantanagoudar said he would recuse. Given the urgency of the petition challenging preventive detention, Justice Ramana ordered its listing on Thursday. But Sara's counsel Kapil Sibal requested for hearing on Friday, which the court accepted .

Referring to Omar Abdullah's political credentials, from being external affairs minister to J&K chief minister from 2009-2014, Sara's petition sought quashing of the ""arbitrary and mala fide"" detention order under J&K PSA, saying as her brother had been under detention since August 5, when Article 370 was abrogated, he could not have done anything to pose a threat to peace, warranting fresh detention.

She said her brother's public statements and messages posted on social media prior to his detention on August 5 ""would reveal that he kept calling for peace and cooperation, messages which in Gandhi's India cannot remotely affect public order"".

Representative image

CHENNAI: After removing tainted candidates from the selection list, the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission ( TNPSC ) on Wednesday announced that the certificate verification for Group IV exams will be conducted from February 19.

Following complaints from candidates, TNPSC unearthed a major scam in which answer sheets of candidates who appeared in Rameswaram and Keelakarai centres in Ramanathapuram district were tampered with. The candidates were given pens with special evaporating ink and their answer sheets were later filled with correct responses on a moving vehicle. The commission banned 99 candidates for life for malpractice and 39 candidates who figured in the top 100 rank holders were removed from the selection list. It also handed over the scam probe to the CB-CID.

“In order to verify the genuineness of candidates’ claims made in their online application regarding age, qualification, community, and to fill up vacancies, original certificate verification is scheduled to be held at TNPSC’s office at VOC Nagar in Chennai,” TNPSC said in a release. It also asked the candidates to upload certificates from February 13 to 18.

In the meantime, CB-CID sleuths arrested R Marli Josekumar, 32, a driver and Washermenpet resident, taking the total number of suspects arrested in connection with the Group IV and Group II-A exam scams to 42. Kumar assisted the mastermind Jayakumar, his associate and TNPSC staff Omkanthan to ferry answer scripts from Ramanathapuram to Chennai.

In another development, the DMK urged the state to transfer the investigation of Group I examination scam to the CBI. Rajya Sabha MP and DMK’s organisation secretary R S Bharathi, in the four-page petition to chief secretary K Shanmugam, questioned the rationale behind changing the investigation officer of the case frequently and alleged that former Chennai mayor and senior AIADMK functionary Saidai Doraisamy was one of the kingpins of the scam and said arrests made so far in the case was a diversion tactic to shield the real accused.

Bhopal: In order to end the digital divide and help students from remote areas across Madhya Pradesh get the benefit of modern education, state higher education department has decided to form a ‘knowledge corporation’ soon.

It will be formed on the pattern of Maharashtra’s knowledge corporation.

Talking to TOI, higher education minister Jitu Patwari said that modern education is digital-based and he wants the state to keep pace with today’s world. “Knowledge corporation is an ambitious project. We want our students equipped with all modern facilities. The corporation will work in that direction,” said Patwari.

Patwari said digital learning platform will be an important part of the Knowledge Corporation. “Several educationists and renowned personalities visit Bhopal and Indore regularly, but it is beneficial to the students of these two cities only. We want every student in the state to benefit from them,” he said.

Patwari added that digital learning platforms will be developed in Indore, Bhopal, Gwalior and Jabalpur. “Visits and lectures of such personalities will be made available across the state through studios developed in different colleges. Our attempt will be to help students of different colleges come together and learn through such studios,” said Patwari. About the corporation’s launch, Patwari said, “We are working on all aspects before launching it. We do not want to leave a single stone unturned.”

Notably, Maharashtra Knowledge Corporation Limited (MKCL) was promoted by the department of higher and technical education (H& TE), Government of Maharashtra (GoM) and was incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956.

Higher education department officials said that creating a knowledge-led economy and knowledge-based societies in the world is the key to survival and development of people in the emerging knowledge world. The aim is to develop learning, governance and empowerment systems, which are world-class and value-based and which are responsive to the individual and social developmental needs of the people by bridging the digital divide.

Panaji: Goa Forward Party ( GFP ) slammed the state government for passing the Goa Private Universities Bill 2020, without a proper debate in the legislative assembly on the benefits of private varsities for the state. The party has urged governor Satya Pal Malik to send the bill back to the House for discussion.

GFP general secretary Mohandas Lolienkar said that the passage of the bill amounted to an admission by the BJP government that it was unable to provide quality education in the state.

“The main reason for the closure of government schools are the private schools. In the same way, a private university will lead to the closure of Goa University,” Lolienkar said.

“We appeal to the governor not to give assent to the bill. There should be an extensive debate in the assembly. If the chief minister is showing haste, then there must be something in it,” he alleged.

97,['13/02/2020'],Mishap averted after 65-tonne iron cast falls on flyover,"This story is from February 13, 2020

Jaipur: A major accident was averted when the hook of a crane carrying a heavy bridge cast broke atop the Sodala elevated road near Bais Godam on Wednesday. The incident occurred around 5.30am when work on the elevated road was going on in full swing.

According to eyewitnesses, the cast was hanging in the air on the under-construction elevated road. The 65-ton cast could have created a havoc if it had come crashing down. Pratap Singh, who stays close to the elevated road and was going for a walk said, “Luckily, there was no traffic on the road. Also the metal cast did not fall on the road. It was a scary moment.”

Officials said the incident happened while dismantling the machine after work. A senior engineer said, “The crane is used in launching a segment of the elevated road. After the work was done, these heavy boxes that weigh approximately 65 tonne were being lowered. During the operation, the hook of the crane broke and fell. It was a mechanical failure as the company working on the site has experience of working with heavy machinery.”

A source said the second crane to lift the iron girder was called from Kota. “The broken crane and iron box was restored later.”

Residents alleged that heavy vehicles were diverted from the construction site while smaller ones were allowed on the road below the elevated road despite it being risky for commuters.

Ragini Singh, who travels from Bapu Nagar to Vaishali for work said, “ It is arterial road and during peak hours thousands of cars pass beneath the road. I was informed about the incident after I reached office. The government should not put life of residents at risk because of casual approach.”

This is not the first accident on the elevated road since construction started. In April 2019, a 25-year-old youth riding pillion on his brother's bike was killed after a height barrier crashed on his head near Hawa Sadak in Sodala where work for an elevated road is going on for nearly three years. A private bus had hit the heavy iron barrier on Friday morning while illegally trying to cross the road where heavy vehicles are not permitted.

AHMEDABAD: The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation has removed the phrase “Pakistan railway crossing” as a landmark from the birth certificate of Mohammed Uzerkhan , the 18-month-old boy of Arbazkhan Pathan and Mahekbanu Pathan , who was born on October 1, 2018.

The family lives in Char Maliya Society near Vatva railway crossing. Shaleha Bibi Pathan , grandmother of the child, collected his birth certificate from a civic centre on February 3. Sarfaraz Khan the grandfather of Mohammed Uzerkhan, claimed that they were called by the AMC officials on Tuesday and were asked to furnish documents.

“The officials even got the affidavit made by their staff at their own expense and ensured that we did not face any hassle. As soon as the affidavit was made, the officials immediately got the correction done not only in their record books but even ensured that the record was updated online. On Wednesday morning we got the new certificate which does not even have the mention of any railway crossing, leave alone Pakistan Railway crossing,” he said.

Khan claimed that in the time of NRC and CAA such mention of Pakistan in your address was difficult to accept. “Had it been any other country it would not have worried us but the mention of Pakistan, and that too in the birth certificate of a minority child could have proven disastrous for the child as well as the family,” he added.

Bhavin Joshi, who is in-charge of the office of Registrar of Births and Deaths, said the aggrieved parents were called and and after verifying their documents the correction was made.

Thiruvananthapuram: The area of operation of Kerala Bank can be extended to outside the state for which the government can take a decision. However, at present, no such decision has been taken, said cooperative minister Kadakampally Surendran in the assembly.

“It can be decided in future with the permission of the government and the regulators. Necessary provisions are there in the bylaw of the Kerala Bank, which was formed as per the Kerala Cooperative Societies Act of 1969,” said the minister.

The minister said since the district cooperative banks have been merged with the Kerala Bank, necessary instructions have been given not to collect funds from pravasis. “No new pravasi accounts should be opened, all authorization letters given to receive the pravasi funds should be surrendered, and within six months of Kerala Bank formation the existing pravasi accounts should be closed,” said the minister.Based on the inflow and outflow of the cash in each branch, the amount that has to be kept in the vault of each branch will be decided. It has to be ensured that adequate funds for the daily business are available at the branches of Kerala Bank. There is no stipulated directive given for how much funds should be kept in each branch, he added.

The Kerala Bank is expecting to provide an agricultural loan of Rs 5,000 crore in the first three years at 6% interest. The interest rate of non-agricultural loans will also be lessened, he added. The cadre integration (merger of employees) will be completed before March 31 after consultations with various employee organizations. tnn

Junior college teachers protesting in Dhantoli

NAGPUR: Various issues were highlighted by Vidarbha Junior College Teachers’ Association ( VJUCTA ) at the office of the deputy director of education where teachers protested to get their basic rights that are yet to come their way despite being approved by the government two years ago.

Increment, promotions, retirement and the number of admissions were a few of the many issues that were taken up by teachers. Various demands were voiced to government officials by the teachers seeking the grant.

Since 2012, junior college teachers have been raising a number of issues concerning their basic rights. Adding to the misery are the government’s new rules and regulations which have affected many students and teachers.

Every government employee is entitled to an increment after completing 10 years in service, but teachers in particular are not getting their due.

On the issue of pension, the teachers contended that how come those appointed before November 1, 2005 are not getting their rightful dues. Limiting the number of admissions to 60 in junior colleges attached to high schools was another issue discussed with education officers.

Teachers have demanded at least 30 years of service and retirement at 60, instead of the current 58 years. Pension policy, salary increment to deserving teachers and five-day working per week were the other demands of the teachers. Roughly 80-100 teachers were at the protest venue.

Speaking to TOI, Ashok Gavhankar, who is heading VJUCTA, said, “Teachers who deserve to retain pension should get their rights and the government should consider this issue very seriously. Teachers who work hard should get their deserving promotion and pay.”

Chetan Hingnekar, PRO of VJUCTA, said, “The rights which have been promised by the government should come into effect soon. Teachers give their best while working and hence, their rights should be safeguarded. Our protest will continue if are demands are not met.”

Kota: The anti-corruption bureau (ACB), Kota, on Wednesday arrested a forest guard and a cattle guard posted at Ghagtana forest checkpost of Itawa forest range after the duo had accepted a bribe of Rs 4,000.

The two accused had demanded Rs 10,000 for allowing transportation of sand-laden tractors from the sanctuary and had taken Rs 1,000 at the time of verification of the complaint.

The ACB on Wednesday noon arrested Mukesh Chand Jatav, 33, a resident of Mochapura village in Sawaimadhopur district who is posted as forest guard in National Chambal Crocodile Sanctuary and Dinesh Singh Rajput, 55, of Kundanpur village of Kota district, posted as cattle guard at the same checkpost, after the duo had accepted a bribe of Rs 4000 from Neeraj Meena of Kitalheda village of Kota district, said additional superintendent of police, ACB, Kota, Chandrasheel Thakur.

Trichy: In a significant development, the idol wing CID has confirmed the accurate match of the picture of the stolen antique metal idol of Thirumangai Alwar of Soundararaja Perumal temple in Kumbakonam with that of the same idol in a London museum.

Acting on a complaint from the executive officer of the temple in Sundaraperumal Kovil village in Kumbakonam taluk, idol wing CID registered a case that a metal idol of Thirumangai Alwar in the temple had gone missing from here between 1957 and 1967. As part of the investigation, the idol wing CID team led by the investigation officer and DSP, P Chandrasekaran, got information that the picture of Thirumangai Alwar idol identical to the one stolen from Soundararaja Perumal has been kept at Ashmolean Museum in London. The idol wing in a press statement said the documented picture of Thirumangai Alwar idol matched 100 % with that of the idol in the museum.

The wing also said that efforts are being made to arrest the accused behind the idol theft and to bring back the idol. Singapore-based blogger Vijay Kumar Sundaresan said that French Institute of Pondicherry (IFP) should be thanked for making available the archives that helped them once again crack these difficult cases which were closed in the 1960s and 1970s as untraceable. “We also thank the support of the idol wing in actively pursuing our leads and reopening the old cases,” he said.

GANDHINAGAR: In just over three months since Industrial Training Institutes ( ITIs ) were authorized to issue learner’s licences, they have issued more than 1 lakh licences to applicants.

As of February 10, more than 2.08 lakh persons applied for driving licences at the 221 ITIs in the state. “The system of issuing learner’s licence at ITIs is getting good response, as it is more convenient for applicants to go to ITIs rather than RTOs which generally have a greater rush. More than 2.08 lakh people have applied for learner’s licence at the 221 ITIs as of February 10, of whom 1.03 lakh candidates passed the online test, and were issued licence,” said Vipul Mittra , additional chief secretary, labour and employment department.

In a bid to make the process of obtaining licences convenient for applicants, and to ease the rush at the road transport offices (RTOs), the state government had in November, authorized 221 ITIs and 29 government polytechnics to conduct online tests for learner’s licence and to issue learner’s licences. Of the remaining applicants, more than 49,000 failed in the test, while over 56,300 applications were rejected due to missing documents, pending fees, errors during the exam and other reasons.No change has been made in the system for obtaining a learner’s licence. Applicants need to register online for the test, pay fees, and then appear for the online test. The facility was however earlier available only at district RTOs, but is now available at ITIs in talukas. “We are also training ITI officials and employees to further streamline the processes,” Mittra added.

At present, ITIs undertake learner’s licence related works for limited hours. For the 24 ITIs in city areas, the hours are from 1:30pm to 5:30pm, while for the 197 taluka level ITIs, the time slot is from 3:30pm to 5:30pm. In Ahmedabad city, there are six ITIs from where learner’s licences are issued.

106,['13/02/2020'],Rajasthan: Bisalpur Pipeline leak snag fixed without stopping pumping,"This story is from February 13, 2020

File photo of the Bisalpur dam

JAIPUR: For the first time, a leak in Bisalpur pipeline was repaired by the Public Health and Engineering Department (PHED) without shutting down water supply in 70% of the city.

The department came to know about the leak during patrolling last week and started repairs immediately. Instead of going by the routine method of shutting down the pipeline, PHED diverted water supply and repaired the leak.

PHED additional commissioner Devraj Solanki said this was the first time they decided to use this technique. “Almost 70% of the city would be facing water shortage if we had repaired pipeline with the old method. Normally, we shut supply, let it dry before starting repairing. In encasing, we divert the water in another direction, let one part of the pipeline dry and start repairing. The process is then repeated for the other part. This way we were able to save water and no inconvenience was caused to people,” said Solanki.

The repairs took place from February 7 to 11. The normal method could have taken 48 hours but around 70 MLD water would have been lost.

PHED superintending engineer Sudhanshu Dixit said that the process of encasing is slow but more reliable. “A team of 12 people worked on itOnly 1.5 MLD water was wasted but there was zero public inconvenience,” said Sudhanshu.

This is the second time in 2020 when Bisalpur pipeline had a leak. There have been many incidences last year when the pipeline leaked and Jaipur’s supply was shut down for two days. Though the department said leaks occur due to small technical glitches, this issue has to be looked into properly.

107,['13/02/2020'],Cash-strapped MP tightens belt to save Rs 25K cr in 2 months,"This story is from February 13, 2020

Bhopal: Battling financial troubles after the Centre drastically cut the state’s share of funds, the Kamal Nath government is tightening its purse strings and trimming expenses to save Rs 25,000 crore in the remainder of the fiscal.

Events at five-star hotels are prohibited, as is purchase of new cars and equipment for the next two months. Finance minister Tarun Bhanot said that presenting the state budget this year would be the most challenging task of the year.

“We are bearing the burden of the previous BJP government and repaying Rs 14,000 crore debt drawn by the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government. During the last two financial years, the Centre has slashed state’s share of revenue. Presenting the budget this time is the most challenging job for me,” Bhanot told reporters in Jabalpur on Wednesday.

The Union government has cut Madhya Pradesh’s share in taxes by Rs 11,556 crore for the 2020-2021 fiscal, the finance minister said, pointing out that the Narendra Modi-led Centre had reduced Rs 2,677 crore in the state’s share taxes in the 2019-2020 fiscal. The devolution for Madhya Pradesh, after last year’s reduction, stood at Rs 61,074 crore. After this year’s cut, it has come down to Rs 49,518 crore — a reduction of Rs 11,556 crore.

This has compelled the state government to cease expenses for new schemes. Every department has been given a maximum limit of expense, say sources. There would be no approval for seminars, workshops or event at five-star hotels. Normally, February and March are heavy-expense months, but this is the first time departments have to keep it to drastically low levels.

“No payment above Rs 25 crore will be approved without clearance from the finance department. All departments that have released tenders for purchases after February 11 will have to withdraw the plan. The department cannot spend more than 10% of their allocation in the coming two months. This would save a whooping Rs 25,000 crore before the state budget is tabled,” said a senior official in the finance department.

Eight select departments have been exempted from these restrictions — including health, PWD, panchayat and rural development and urban development, where funds have been sanctioned through state and central schemes for utilisation within prescribed time limits.

Panchayat minister Kamleshwar Patel cracked the whip on Wednesday, saying: “All incomplete work of rural engineering services should be completed by March 31 or else strict action will be taken against the consultant and contractor responsible for the delay.”

Madhya Pradesh has been deprived of Rs 14,233 crore in the last two budgets by the Centre. The 15th Finance Commission, under the chairmanship of N K Singh, has recommended that states receive 41% share of central taxes for 2020-21. The 14th Finance Commission had recommended that 42% of the divisible pool of taxes should go to the states. However, 1% has been adjusted for development of two newly formed Union Territories, Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh.

The cut in MP’s share in the Union Budget will reflect in the state's budget allocations. Some of the 2,050 schemes running in MP are likely to be cancelled or closed by March 31 and new schemes will be approved only after cabinet nod. Sources said the budget session of MP is likely to be held from March 16 to April 13.

108,['13/02/2020'],Foresters opt for participatory mgmt method to prevent fires,"This story is from February 13, 2020

Thrissur: The state forest department has reduced the fund allocation for the clearance of fire lines to prevent forest fires. This year, it is only 30% of last year’s allocation, forest department sources said.

Normally, forest department spends a huge sum for the fire line clearance works before summer. But this year, it was directed to change its approach and opt for participatory management for controlling fires. This year, the forest fire prevention system will be implemented through Vana Samrakshana Samithis (VSS) and forest guards, said a forest department official. The main forest fire-affected region in Munnar , Idukki , last year changed the fire line method and implemented the forest strip method.

Munnar assistant forest conservator Martin Lovel said. “With the participation of VSS and forest guards we began to prepare forest strips in the Munnar region. In the forest strip method, the dense vegetation from a particular area is totally removed in a width of 5-10m.”

“We found the forest strip method more effective in preventing forest fires than traditional fire lines. Normally, the fire lines clearing is for only 5.2m and in case of strong winds the fire lines will not be capable in preventing fires. The fire strip method is more practical and we can complete it within the government-allotted budget,” Lovel added.

The new fire prevention method includes awareness campaign, controlled burning and other measures with support from VSS and tribespeople living in the forest areas. In some circles, it was decided not to spend for fire line clearance as it was found ineffective, said a forest department official.

109,['13/02/2020'],"Will meet archbishop soon, explain CAA: Sawant","This story is from February 13, 2020

Panaji: Chief minister Pramod Sawant on Wednesday said he has sought an appointment with the archbishop of Goa and Daman, Filipe Neri Ferrao, to discuss the controversial Citizen’s (Amendment) Act (CAA).

The latter had recently appealed to the Centre to revoke the CAA and to desist from implementing the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the National Population Register (NPR).

Sawant had told TOI on Monday that he sought to assure the archbishop that minorities need not fear the act. He had also said that although Ferrao had given him an appointment, he was unable to keep it due to the budget session.

“We will get an appointment in a day or two. I have asked him for a meeting. I was busy all this while, but I shall go to meet him,” the chief minister said on Wednesday.

In a strongly-worded statement, the archbishop had said that the NRC and NPR exercises would result in “direct victimisation” of the underprivileged classes, “particularly the dalits, adivasis, migrant labourers, nomadic communities and the countless undocumented people who, after having been recognised as worthy citizens and voters for more than 70 years in this great nation, will suddenly run the risk of becoming stateless and candidates for detention camps”.

While Sawant had remained silent on the statement, BJP spokesperson Narendra Sawaikar reacted by asking religious heads not to claim benefits of taxpayers’ money by enjoying minority status for educational institutions under Article 30 of the Constitution.

This evoked a sharp reaction in political circles, with Congress slamming Sawaikar and some MLAs including two ministers Vishwajit Rane and Michael Lobo saying that the archbishop had the right to express his view.

Trichy: After receiving several complaints from parents about students avoiding food with vegetables at home, a government-aided school in Trichy has found a novel way to add adequate vegetables to their meals at school.

All the 149 children of Subbiah Memorial Middle School at Tennur have been asked to bring one or two vegetables from home on a daily basis and put those vegetables in an exclusive vessel named as ‘Akshaya Pathiram’. Vegetables collected as part of the initiative will be utilized to make the noon meal served in the school, which will be rich in greens.

Getting one or two vegetables from their kitchen will not be a big task for children, said K S Jeevanandhan, headmaster of the school. At the same time, we will make it a habit for these tender minds to eat vegetables, he said. “Considering the fact that most children come from nearby slums, there is also less possibility of children taking healthy meal at home, hence, we chose to take this initiative,” he said. One of the chief guests on the inauguration of the initiative, Manoj Dharmar, founder member of Shine TREEchy - a voluntary youth organization, praised the children for avoiding use of plastic bags to bring vegetables to schools. He advocated other schools to follow suit as this will help stay children healthy. Apart from noon meal, the school has been serving morning meal to about 100 children by sourcing funds.

111,['13/02/2020'],Only recommended early release of Rajiv Gandhi assassination case convicts: Tamil Nadu government,"This story is from February 13, 2020

Madras high court

CHENNAI: The state government on Wednesday clarified to the Madras high court that it has only recommended the release of all seven life convicts in former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi assassination case as it lacks power to order such release.

“The state cabinet has only made a recommendation to the governor. The governor has to take a decision. He cannot be questioned by the state for not acting on its recommendation,” public prosecutor A Natarajan said.

The prosecutor made the submission on a plea moved by Nalini Sriharan, one of the convicts, seeking to declare her detention as illegal since the governor has failed to order her release based on the recommendation of the state cabinet dated September 9, 2018.

When the plea moved as a habeas corpus plea came up for hearing before a division bench of R Subbiah and R Pongiappan, the court directed the prosecutor to file the reply as an affidavit by February 18 as to whether Nalini’s imprisonment after the state’s recommendation for release would amount to illegal detention.

According to the petitioner, as per the Supreme Court judgment in Maru Rams case, the advice of the state government under Article 161 of the Constitution would be binding on the head of the state – the governor. She contended that as the power under Article 161 (power of the governor to grant pardons and suspend, remit or commute sentences in certain cases) has already been exercised by the government of Tamil Nadu, the governor has no discretion but to act on the advice of the council of ministers. Since she has not been released as per the advice of the council of ministers, the continuous detention was illegal and violative of Article 14 and 21 of the Constitution, she claimed.

Behind the bars for more than 27 years, Nalini is the longest serving woman prisoner in the country.

Bhopal: State Congress on Wednesday launched a scathing attack on the Union government after retail inflation jumped to 7.59 per cent — a 68-month high — and a steep hike in subsidized cooking gas cylinders.

“Where is the BJP’s 2014 slogan that said Bahat hui mahagai ki maar, Ab ki baar Modi Sarkar?” asked PCC media department chairperson Shobha Oza, adding that issues having no direct bearing on people are the priority for the BJP-led NDA government.

“They keep the country engaged in NRC and CAA when the issues troubling the common man are steep inflation rates, economic slowdown and rising unemployment. But these major concerns do not attract the attention of the Narendra Modi government. This is extremely shameful,” she said.

Congress leaders said that a Union government that came to power promising “ache din” has harassed the country with spiralling inflation. State Congress media cell vice-president Bhupendra Gupta argued: “Thalinomics budget of the Union government has snatched the plate of food from the poor. Gas cylinder prices have been increased by Rs144.5 per cylinder, which devastating for the common man. It seems like Modi government is taking revenge on people for BJP’s defeat in Delhi assembly elections.”

Gupta said that Union finance minister, while presenting the annual budget, was explaining “thalinomics” on the floor of the House.

“Ten days after the thalinomics phenomenon, the thali has been taken away from the poor,” he added.

“In six years, the Union government has ensured people are distressed, distraught and unable to make their ends meet. Cooking gas prices have been increased when the country is undergoing a severe unemployment crisis. We are facing the worst unemployment scenario in 45 years,” said Oza.

In five months, prices of cooking gas cylinders have been in several bouts raised by Rs140, she claimed.

“And here comes another major jolt of Rs150. After all, how will a common man live his life? Demonetization and wrong imposition of GST has taken the nation into fiscal darkness. Petrol, diesel, gas cylinders, edible oil, vegetables, lentils, wheat are all in the grasp of spiralling prices. The Centre has failed to give fiscal strength to the nation,” she said.

The team of doctors who performed a heart transplant at SMS Hospital in the city on Wednesday

JAIPUR: Within a month of performing its first heart transplant on January 16, Sawai Man Singh Hospital conducted its second cadaver heart transplant on Wednesday.

It was more difficult than the first one as the organ donor was brought from a hospital attached to Bikaner’s Sardar Patel (SP) Medical College in a critical condition.

The donor suffered a cardiac arrest after being brought to SMS Hospital , which had almost minimised chances of cadaver organ donation. Doctors revived him and took a six-day time for preparing him for organ donation.

Aditya (17) was brought to Sawai Man Singh Hospital from Bikaner on February 6 night. He had suffered head injuries in an accident in Sriganganagar. Officials of SP Medical College talked with SMS principal and controller Dr Sudhir Bhandari about the patient. The doctors at Bikaner hospital had declared him brain dead. Since, they do not have the facility for retrieval of organs, they contacted SMS Hospital, which sent its professors of neurology and anaesthesia for taking the patient from Bikaner to Jaipur in critical care ambulance.

The ambulance reached SMS Hospital around 7am on February 6 and doctors shifted the patient to ICU at Institute of Traumatology and Orthopedics of SMS Hospital where he suffered a cardiac arrest, but doctors revived him.

“The doctors took care for him for six days and prepared him for organ transplant. The heart was transplanted into a 47-year-old person from Alwar,” said Dr DS Meena, medical superintendent, SMS Hospital.

After taking the consent of the family, the doctors harvested his organs around 4am on Wednesday. “We retrieved his heart and two kidneys, which were transplanted to three patients in SMS Hospital on the same day of harvesting his organs. He saved life of three persons,” said Dr Meena.

A 47-year-old person, who was already admitted to SMS Hospital undergoing treatment for his ailing condition due to heart failure, was found as a suitable recipient for the heart. The recipient had a valve replacement surgery in 2011. His heart was functioning just 15% of the capacity. He also had cardiomyopathy, which made it harder for his heart to pump blood to the rest of body. He was bed-ridden due to his ailing heart condition. “We have transplanted heart of a 17-year-old boy into a 47-year-old man. We started the procedure around 4am and it continued for 10am. We are closely monitoring his condition,” said Dr Anil Sharma, head of the department, cardiothoracic surgery, SMS hospital, who spearheaded the surgery.

A fleet of at least 60 doctors and nursing staff of different specialities made the heart transplant possible.

The doctors are taking extra care of the heart recipient more than the heart recipient of January 16, which was performed in the same hospital as a lot many risk factors are involved in it.

“The kidneys retrieved from the donor was transplanted into a 32-year-old patient and a 55-year-old patient. One of them was in dialysis for six months and the other was on dialysis for the past one year,” said Dr SS Yadav, spokesperson, SMS Medical College and SMS Hospital head of the department (urology).

The parents moved the high court objecting to the state government’s decision to close down the school after taking the school management from the present trust. The dispute arose after was found out that the school authorities had used allegedly forged NOC of the state government to get CBSE affiliation in 2010. The school’s affiliation was straightway cancelled by the CBSE and the primary education department was quick to announce that the education activity might be discontinued after the academic session.

DEHRADUN: The residents of Selaqui, who have been protesting against Shishambara waste management plant for many months, intensified their agitation on Wednesday by sitting on an indefinite dharna outside the office of the Uttarakhand Environment Protection and Pollution Control Board (UEPPCB) in IT Park.

Apart from the protest at the UEPPCB office, the residents are also simultaneously continuing their protest in front of the waste plant. Their protest has been going on for the past four months.

The protesters demanded the board to close down the waste plant since they claim that the plant is being run by the municipal corporation without an no objection certificate (NOC) from the pollution control board for the past six months.

“We want the UEPPCB to close down the waste plant and sue the municipal corporation for running it without a no objection certificate. We will be sitting here until our demands are met,” said Satpal Dhaniya, a protester who had earlier burnt his car in front of the waste plant to register protest against the plant..

“The waste plant has taken the lives of numerous people living in Selaqui and other nearby areas. The waste isn’t getting treated at the site. Instead of a waste processing plant, the site has become a dumping yard. Also, the plant has been functioning over its capacity. We will be sitting here for 24 hours daily until our demands are met,” said Niranjan Chauhan, another Selaqui resident.

Meanwhile, member secretary of UEPPCB, SP Subudhi said, “Our team inspected the site and we found some shortcomings in it. We have asked the corporation to re-apply for the NOC once they get those shortcomings addressed.”

GORAKHPUR: Under the ongoing postcard campaign, around 500 postcards against Citizen Amendment Act, National Register of Citizenship (NRC) and NPR were posted to Prime Minister Narendra Modi by Dalit outfit Poorvanchal Sena, Asur Chhatra Sangathan and BhIm Army at DDU Gorakhpur University gate, on Wednesday.

The campaign ‘PM Ko Postcard Likho (write postcard to PM)’ was launched on February 4 by Poorvanchal Sena seeking DNA-based NRC instead of asking for documents. “The campaign was launched from Unwal and since then around 300-500 postcards are being posted from Ranipar, Jigina, Hardia, Pichoura, Khajni villages daily. People have written around 10,000 postcards since then as the campiagn spreads to Maharajganj, Deoria, Kushinagar, Siddharth Nagar and Sant Kabir Nagar,” said president of Poorvanchal Sena, Dhirendra Pratap.

Pratap said, “We aim to send at least one lakh postcards to the PM. We go to rural areas and create awareness about CAA which is against the Indian Constitution.”

District president of Poorvanchal Sena Surendra Valmiki said, “The campaign will end only with rollback of CAA, NRC and NPR. And we’ll also see that there is no possibility of bringing these acts back.”

Bhopal: Congress on Monday said that the municipal body in Chhnidwara had to remove the statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji as it was installed there by some persons on Monday night without permission from the authorities.

“The statue was removed in the presence of the persons, who installed it there. A better constructed statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji will be installed there soon,” assured state Congress spokesman Narendra Saluja.

“There is no controversy on the issue, but some persons are purposefully trying to mislead people and disrupt peace of the area,” Saluja added.

Activists of a saffron organization installed the statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji for his upcoming birth anniversary on February 19. Within 24 hours, the statue was removed by the municipality and administration. This saw huge protests and road blockage by the Shiv Sena in the district.

Former chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan demanded an apology from chief minister Kamal Nath. “The Kamal Nath government takes pride in humiliating great men like Shivaji,” Chouhan said.

Congress issued an officially-signed proposal of chairperson and all corporators of the municipal corporation that a tri-section of the town in Sauser will be named after Chhatrapati Shivaji.

Kottayam: Heavy loss was reported in a fire that broke out at Mankombu in Moonnilavu panchayat near Erattupetta. Several acres of agricultural land were destroyed in the fire which started on Tuesday evening.

Fire and rescue service personnel couldn’t put out the fire completely due to strong winds in the region.

Huge trees were destroyed in the fire which spread over 2km from Irumapra to Chalamattom. Major tragedy was averted as the fire occurred in places uninhabited by human beings. Since the agricultural land which caught fire was located on a hill slope, heavy winds made rescue activities more difficult. Fire and rescue units from Pala, Kottayam and Erattupetta have jointly undertaken the rescue work. Since the fire broke out in areas which were not accessible by fire engines, small vehicles were used to carry water to the spot for extinguishing fire.

According to residents, the cause of the fire was the spark produced after the electric lines collided. However, no official communication has come in this regard from the fire safety department. Pala RDO Pradeep Kumar visited the place. Many voluntary organizations have also stepped in to help the fire force to extinguish the fire.

Meanwhile, Pala MLA Mani C Kappen cautioned people to stay alert over fire incidents during summer. He also said he has directed the collector to find out whether compensation from the government is possible for those who have incurred losses in fire at places like Irumapra, Mankombu and Moonnilavu. He also said many had raised suspicion over certain fire incidents and authorities concerned have been directed to look into such complaints.

Fire was also reported in agricultural lands in Idukki district. Fire engulfed a rubber plantation at Parambukattumala near Thodupuzha after the forest area nearby caught fire. Fire and rescue service personnel suspect it to be man-made fire and not a natural forest fire . Meanwhile, fire brokeout in Ilam Desam, which is already reeling under acute water shortage. People had to use stored rain water to put out the fire.

CHENNAI: “Beware, don’t encourage people who approach your doorstep asking you to take a blood test for diabetes. They could be anti-social elements, belonging to a particular banned outfit roaming around to spread HIV.” – Tamil Nadu police. Such messages, purportedly from the law enforcers for effect, have been flooding social media platforms over the past few days and causing panic.

The Chennai police have decided to act against such messages which are alarming and designed to disturb the public peace. A special team has been set up and will monitor and bust such fake news doing the rounds in social media. Police will also keep urging members of the public not to believe any rumours. “These fake messages don’t look like random rumours, but seem to be carefully composed. They look official enough to deceive people” said a police officer.

The subject could be about kidnappers on the prowl to take away children, about burglars set to strike at houses or about the safety of women. Recently, senior officers were surprised to see two messages with the logo of the state police asking the members of public to be wary of the child lifters, particularly in the northern parts of the state. Another one spoke about police providing exclusive cab services to women to ensure their safety. Both were found to be false. “We know these are fake messages, but still we conducted checks as the message appeared genuine,” said the officer.

The special team, comprising officers and staff from the social media monitoring wing, will check with personnel across various districts and after ensuring no such information had been passed will post the clarification message on the police’s social media accounts like Facebook and twitter. “Sometimes the messages are disturbing; some even land on our phones,” the officer said.

The team will monitor fake message and also probe the source of such messages. Once the culprit is found, he/she will be taken to task for spreading rumours. “Our aim is to create awareness in the minds of the public and also to ensure they don’t get duped,” said police commissioner A K Vishwanathan.

Raju Odedara and Sagar Patel

VADODARA: The man who abused Waghodia BJP MLA Madhu Srivastava over phone last week turned out to be a security guard working at an ATM in Ahmedabad.

The detection of crime branch (DCB) arrested the man Raju Odedara and his aide Sagar Patel from Viramgam in Ahmedabad for hurting religious sentiments and issuing threats to kill the complainant in the case Vijay Yadav .

Odedara and Patel were booked by the crime branch on February 6 for threatening Yadav over phone. The police said that Odedara works as a security guard at an ATM in Ahmedabad.

Odedara had also called up Srivastava on February 5 and abused him during a heated exchange. “We had tracked him down from his phone number. Odedara had gone missing since last few days but we got his location on Wednesday and arrested him along with his friend Sagar Patel, who too had abused Yadav over phone,” said Jaydeepsinh Jadeja , DCP (crime).

While Odedara originally belongs to Porbandar, Patel is a resident of Ahmedabad. On February 5, Raju had called up Srivastava to discuss the latter’s work being ignored by the state government. The conversation soon turned ugly and both used expletives against each other. Both Srivastava and Odedara had claimed on the phone that they were drunk. Audio of the call went viral on social media the very next day.

On February 6, Yadav, a sympathiser of Srivastava, called Odedara but the accused again used abusive language against God and even threatened him. A complaint was filed by Yadav against Odedara following which he was booked under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

Crime branch sleuths said that Odedara had made similar phone calls to some other politicians and recorded the calls. “We will now investigate if Odedara has made such abusive calls to anyone else,” crime branch sleuths said. TOI had contacted Odedara and he admitted to have abused Srivastava. Odedara had said that Srivastava had abused him first so he lost his cool.

PUNE: A police team lay in wait outside a building in Wadgaon Maval for two men to exit.

The moment they did late on Tuesday, the cops caught one of them. The second man fled to the terrace and hid near a water tank. He too was nabbed.

The Pune rural police thus arrested two of the five inmates who had escaped from a sub-jail in Karjat taluka in Ahmedangar district on Sunday night.

The Ahmednagar police arrested another undertrial from Indapur in Pune district. A search is on for two more undertrials who had escaped. The undertrials, Mohan Bhore (36) and Dnyaneshwar Kolhe (25), both from Jamkhed taluka in Ahmednagar district were taken into custody when they came to meet Bhore’s brother at Mhalskarwadi in Wadgaon Maval.

A Wadgaon Maval police team led by inspector Suresh Nimbalkar arrested Bhore, a murder suspect, and Kolhe, an illegal arms supplier.

Meanwhile, a team of sub-divisional police officer (Karjat) Sanjay Satav on Tuesday arrested Gangadhar Jagtap from Indapur taluka. “After escaping from the sub-jail, the suspects stole two motorcycles and fled from Karjat,” Satav told TOI. Jagtap went to Indapur.

On Sunday night Bhore, Kolhe, Akshay Raut and Chandrakant Raut, both suspects in a murder case of a fruit vendor from Mumbai and Gangadhar Jagtap, a rape suspect, had escaped from the sub-jail.

They had cut the plywood ceiling of their barrack, climbed up on the roof after removing the roof tiles and used blankets to climb down the wall.

The Karjat sub-jail in Ahmednagar is located near the Karnar tehsil office. It is some distance away from the Karjat police station.

The Ahmednagar police had sent five teams to trace them. “We have arrested three of the five undertrails. A search is on for the remaining two,” an officer from Ahmednagar police said.

Sub-inspector Dilip Desai and another policemen laid a trap outside the complex where Bhore’s brother lives.

The police team saw Bhore coming out of the building late at night and arrested him. “ Kolhe fled to the terrace of a building. We found him hiding near the overhead water tank and arrested him too,” Nimbalkar said.

The duo had travelled to Wadgaon Maval on a motorcycle. “We have seized the vehicle. The duo was handed over to the local crime branch of the Ahmednagar police,” Nimbalkar said.

An officer from the Ahmednagar police said the sixth undertrial, who was in the barrack, was a suspended policeman attached to the Solapur police arrested in 2017 in a murder case.

“He told us that the suspects had been cutting the plywood ceiling throughout Sunday. They had chosen a spot where the CCTV camera did not capture their act,” the officer said. The suspended policeman claimed he did not alert the guards as the five men had threatened him.

133,['13/02/2020'],JCTSL menace: Only 45 drivers fined in nine months,"This story is from February 13, 2020

Low-floor JCTSL buses have become a cause of concern due to rash driving by their drivers in the city

JAIPUR: Despite large number of complaints against drivers of the Jaipur City Transport Service Ltd (JCTSL) buses on a daily basis, just 45 were challaned by the traffic police between January and October 2019. The traffic police have been reluctant to share the challan data of November and December 2019.

Most of these buses do not have speedometers and the ones that have, do not have these in working conditions. JCTSL’s low-floor buses can be seen being driven rashly, often leading to accidents. In 2019, around 24 accidents occurred due to JCTSL buses in which seven people died. Traffic police and JCTSL have failed to keep tabs on the rash drivers.

Ashish Mehra, a daily commuter from Tonk Road said, “The buses are driven very high speed. Whenever I ride my motorcycle on road, I have to be very careful of JCTSL buses because they over-speed, which can cause an accident.”

ACP traffic Rahul Prakash, however, said the department focused on violations by the low-floors buses in January. “After receiving complaints, we organised a drive especially to curb the menace of low-floor buses. In January, we had challaned around 140 low-floor buses. We have been focusing on these buses because their size can cause more damage to the public on the city roads,” said Prakash.

There are 273 low-floor buses that currently ply in the city. Most of these are run by private contractors. The drivers hired by private contractors have an idea that the demand and supply ratio of drivers is in their favour, which has created their monopoly in the market.

An official at JCTSL recalled an incident when the drivers across the city stopped buses in the middle of the road when the department tried to discipline them. “There is an urgent need to organise some training classes for these driver and terminate their services to teach them a lesson,” said an official at JCTSL. The current scenario, though, projects JCTSL and traffic cops as utterly helpless before these rash and rowdy drivers.

TRICHY: The city police arrested a 26-year-old man on charges of duping a woman of Rs 11,000 after promising her to help withdraw money from an ATM kiosk at Karumandapam late on Tuesday.

The Cantonment police arrested S Saravana Kumar of Kulithalai in Karur district from near the SBI ATM kiosk in Karumandapam on Tuesday night. He was charged with cheating P Kamali, of Punganur in Trichy, of Rs 11,000, from her bank account on January 13.

Kamali is a homemaker and her husband a Tasmac employee in Tiruppur. He had deposited Rs 16,000 in her bank account on January 13 for household expenses. She visited the ATM the same day. It was around 12 noon that Kamali tried to withdraw Rs 5,000 from the account. As the woman did not know how to operate the ATM, she looked for help.

Saravana Kumar, who was waiting outside, stepped in offering to help her. He took her debit card and inserted it into the machine, asking her to type the PIN even as he watched. As the cash came out, he took the cash and gave it to her along with a debit card.

The woman left the place with the cash. However, when the woman came back to the same ATM and tried to withdraw some more money the card was rejected. She checked with the bank and found that it was a fake card. Later, she received a message from the bank that cash of Rs 10,000 and Rs 1,000 were withdrawn from her account on January 13.

As her husband was away in Tiruppur, she waited for his return and lodged a complaint with the Cantonment police on Tuesday.

The police verified the CCTV footage and identified the accused. As requested by the police, an auto-rickshaw driver informed the police on seeing the accused at the ATM on Tuesday night.

The police caught him and seized several fake debit cards from him. Police said he was already involved in such crimes. He was produced in court and remanded in judicial custody.

Nagapattinam: State minister for milk and dairy development, Rajenthra Bhalaji, has said that an amendment would be passed by chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami declaring the entire delta region as a 'Protected Agriculture Zone'.

Bhalaji said that no industry other than the ones catering to agriculture-related activities would be allowed to function in the region. The minister added that the farming community and leaders of the farmers’ associations had welcomed the announcement and congratulated the chief minister.

He attacked the opposition saying that it was during the regime of the DMK government that the nod to carry out hydrocarbon excavation in the delta was given.

“There is no doubt that chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami will safeguard the livelihood of every farmer and farming in delta region by passing an ordinance in the assembly”, he further stated.

When asked whether the ongoing projects by ONGC would be allowed to continue to function, Rajendra Balaji said that they would have to wind up everything immediately.

“Once the chief minister makes the announcement, everyone in the state will have to comply. It is being done for the sake of the farming community”, he further added.

142,['13/02/2020'],Non-functional escalator at Trichy railway jn inconveniences commuters,"This story is from February 13, 2020

Trichy: Wile passengers are delighted with the smart outlook of the Trichy Junction railway station, many commuters, particularly the elderly and pregnant women, are left dejected after finding the escalator not working most of the time.

The non-functional escalator forces the senior citizens to go for the arduous task of climbing the staircase, as they walk to platforms two and three to catch the trains. Adding to the woes is a narrow passage which the passengers have to negotiate when the escalator goes off.

An escalator at Trichy was a long pending demand of commuters, especially senior citizens, patients and pregnant women, as they had difficulty in reaching platforms one to seven. The passengers have to get off the steps first and walk through the subway before taking the stairs again to reach the platforms.

A new escalator was installed with the help of Trichy Rajya Sabha MP Trichy Siva’s Members of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS) fund. The facility was established after removing stairs on Chennai side of the platform and was thrown open on November 2015.

Passenger trains such as Trichy-Palakkad, Thanjavur, Mayiladuthurai and all the Chennai-bound express trains arrive at platforms two and three, said Janarthanan, a regular commuter from Trichy.

“As there was a single way to reach platform, commuters found it difficult to take the stairs. It was particularly difficult for elderly to walk to the platforms. I am a heart patient. As the escalator was stationary in the morning, I had to climb the stairs on the way to platform. Earlier, a dedicated contract employee used to man the escalator. However, there was no such operator now,” he said.

A senior official from Trichy railway division said that there was no dedicated operator for the escalator as there was a staff crunch. The escalator would be operational in peak hours, he said adding that without an operator the elderly people tend to fall using the facility. “So, the staff was asked to be there and operate it only in pea khours,” the official said.

Representative image

CHENNAI: Facing heat from the Tamil Nadu Real Estate Regulatory Authority (TNRERA) over delay in delivery of housing projects, developer’s body Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Associations of India (Credai) has activated its consumer grievance redressal forum to resolve complaints of homebuyers. Though the mechanism was in place more than a decade ago, it has come to limelight only after the state realty regulator started taking stringent action against erring developers.

Briefing newspersons on Wednesday, Credai vice-president (Chennai) S Sivagurunathan said a separate committee is functioning to look into grievances of homebuyers. “Not many are aware that there is a redressal forum of Credai constituted before TNRERA came into being. That’s why we are publicising about it and suggesting homebuyers not to rush to TNRERA,” he said. Had there been an awareness about the forum, this many number of cases would have not reached TNRERA, he said. “If we are unable to resolve issues, then homebuyers can pursue the same with TNRERA,” he said. TNRERA was constituted after the state government notified the rules on June 22, 2017. The authority has passed orders over more than 500 complaints by homebuyers penalising violating promoters. Majority of projects were in Chennai and its peripheries.

Credai president (Chennai chapter) W S Habib said seven complaints were received by the forum in 2019 and almost all were resolved. “We force developers to resolve issues and even warn them that they may lose Credai’s membership. We have done that in the past removing seven to eight developers from our membership,” he said. The forum can only take up issues regarding projects executed by its members numbering 160,” he added.

Meanwhile, Credai Chennai is conducting its annual exhibition between February 21 and 23 at Chennai Trade Centre in Nandambakkam. About 400 housing projects in and around Chennai would be showcased in Credai Fairpro 2020 - the 13th edition of the annual event. While the price range of dwelling units would be between Rs 10 lakh to Rs 10 crore, between 10,000 and 15,000 units would be on sale. Developers are expecting bookings amounting to the tune of Rs 200 crore.

AHMEDABAD: Thirteen persons who have purchased properties in Varsha Flats moved the Gujarat high court complaining that the sub-registrar did not register the sale deeds even though they had obtained prior permission from the deputy collector for sale/purchase of the properties under the Disturbed Areas Act.

The Gujarat high court issued notice to the sub-registrar of Paldi and Ahmedabad’s deputy collector (West) asking them to file replies in four weeks.

Sources said that the petitioners had obtained permission from the deputy collector in February 2018 to purchase flats in Varsha Flats in the Jankalyan Cooperative Housing Society Ltd in Paldi.

This colony has been marked under the Disturbed Areas Act and prior permission for the sale/purchase is a must.

When they requested the sub-registrar in September 2019 to register the sale deeds, the official refused registration of properties saying that the deputy collector had asked him not to regularize the sale. The reason put forth by the authority was that the property sale/purchase registration should take place within 60 days of getting permission from the deputy collector.

The petitioners have contended that there is no such provision in the law that sale deed should be registered within 60 days of getting permission.

This is a clear misreading of the law on part of the authorities and done to harass the petitioners.

The sale of flats in Varsha Flats gathered huge controversy after a right-wing outfit objected to regularization of sales by the district collectorate in case of 11 purchasers. They are Muslims who have bought flats from Hindu owners after the society went into redevelopment.

Following the objection, the authority cancelled the permission.

This issue is also pending before the court and before the secretary after those who objected to the grant of permission were allowed to join in the proceedings by the secretary. The HC has stayed it at present.

Meanwhile, police registered an FIR against these owners for violation of Disturbed Areas Act by purchasing properties without prior permission of the government.

The HC has also stayed the FIR until another bench finally decides the civil issue.

Landowners have been opposing the acquisition of properties, which has delayed the survey. With the state government going ahead with the project, we have to do it.”The state government intends to expedite the airport project. The district administration can start the land acquisition process simultaneously with the survey. “If all goes well, we should get the clearance in two months,” the official said.Senior MADC officials claimed that they would survey the airport site in coordination with the Pune district administration to collect some intricate details.After the announcement of the airport project in 2016, wildlife experts and activists had said some parts of Purandar were home to packs of the Indian grey wolf. In May 2017, former MADC vice-chairman-cum-managing director Suresh Kakani had disagreed with it.“A proper environmental clearance is required if the project area has a river or trees have to be felled. The land at the proposed site for the airport is dry and barren barring a few trees. We haven’t noticed any wolf population in the area and feel that there is no need to create a buffer zone,” said Kakani, who was recently transferred from the MADC.Wildlife enthusiast Mihir Golbole has been working for the wolves in the area.He told TOI that the animals were still there. “The Wildlife Institute of India collared some wolves in the area. The state forest department is being updated about the daily movement of these wolves,” he said.The MADC does not have a permanent vice chairman-cum-managing director, but authorities said they had opened an office in Pune for the project.“The office has some employees and it became operational last month.

ALLAHABAD: Allahabad district administration would try its hand at creating a Guinness World Record for distributing the largest number of disability aids like walking sticks and wheelchairs from a single location among 26, 127 differently-abled persons, on February 29.

The event will be organised on Parade Ground along the banks of Sangam and in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

State-owned Artificial Limbs Manufacturing Corporation of India (ALIMCO) would be supplying the aids and the firms’ officials are finalising the details of the event.

District social welfare officer (Allahabad) Praveen Kumar Singh said, “A formal announcement for the record attempt will be made by ALIMCO soon. ALIMCO officials are in talks with the Guinness World Records team.”

The programme is being organised under the aegis of Union ministry of social justice and empowerment. PM Modi is likely to distribute 680 battery-operated tricycles to persons suffering from over 80% disability and 10,000 elderly citizens would get disability aids like walking sticks, wheelchairs, spectacles and hearing aid. In addition, over 14,000 differently-abled persons, under 40 years of age, would be provided assistance aid for different disabilities.

The current record for the largest number of disability aids being distributed from a single location was created on June 29, 2017 in Rajkot in Gujarat.

The Gujarat event was also attended by PM Narendra Modi and was involved participation of 17,589 persons with disabilities.

In 2019, Allahabad clinched the Guinness World Record for the largest science practical session. The record was created on the premises of Delhi Public School’s Naini branch, wherein 4,272 students of nearly 50 CBSE-afiliated participated in the event. The schools were from Allahabad and Pratapgarh.

The city also clinched three more Guinness records during the Kumbh Mela 2019. The first one was set on February 28, 2019, wherein a fleet of 510 buses zooming on city roads bagged the record of the ‘largest parade of buses’.

The second world record was set on March 1, 2019 for largest number of participants in a painting competition. The third record was created on March 4, 2019 after 10,000 sanitation workers simultaneously cleaned five different spots on the Kumbh Mela ground for three minutes.

Allahabad residents created another Guinness World Record on August 9, 2019 when 76,823 saplings were distributed at a single event on Parade Ground near Sangam. UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath himself received the certificate from the Guinness team.

148,['13/02/2020'],DGP in CAG crosshairs on irregularities,"This story is from February 13, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: The details of guns and bullets missing from the Special Armed Police Battalion, Thiruvananthapuram, have come up in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) tabled in the assembly on Wednesday.

The audit observed a shortfall of 25 rifles of various kinds and 12,061 live cartridges from the Special Armed Police Battalion, Thiruvananthapuram. The shortage of 250 9mm drill cartridges was covered up by replacing the same with dummy cartridges.

The audit examined a shortfall in availability of modern weaponry and consequent deployment of obsolete weapons. As on September 2018, the status of availability of modern weapons in the department was only 11,446 for police constables, civil police officers, senior civil police officers and havildars against the requirement of 41,064, with a deficit of 29,618 weapons.

The audit also examined that failure of the police department to make payment of spectrum charges resulted in inability to obtain licences from Union government for procurement of digital mobile radios (DMR). Anti-Maoist operations in the dense forests of Palakkad, Malappuram, Idukki and Wayanad suffered for want of DMR as the personnel on field had to depend on analog communication equipment.

Addressing reporters here on Wednesday, accountant general (general and social sector audit) said that there was a clear nexus between officers of the police department, vendors and Keltron in fixation of prices in at least four instances of procurement of electronic gadgets and equipment, violating store purchase manual and central vigilance commission (CVC) guidelines.

The audit report also targetted the state police chief for purchasing luxury vehicles and constructing luxury villas, thus misappropriating funds and leaving police personnel on field high and dry with no enough weapons or communication systems.

The state police chief didn’t reply to specific allegations. “We will give a reply to the public accounts committee of the legislature on the facts about each allegation. Audit report of CAG, as per the procedure, has to be sent by the government to the PAC which is empowered and competent to take decisions on such allegations,” said a statement issued by the police headquarters.

Responding to the serious findings against the state police chief, opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala demanded the government to remove Loknath Behera from the post. He also demanded probes by central agencies such as National Investigation Agency and Central Bureau of Investigation into the alleged corruption he committed.

The report on general and social sector for 2017-18 said that the police department violated guidelines of modernization of police force (MOPF) scheme to procure luxury vehicles during 2013-18. MOPF scheme guidelines only allow procurement of vehicles like jeep, motorcycles and medium/heavy vehicles for deployment at police stations and outposts.

Of the 269 light motor vehicles (LMVs)procured during the period, 64 were procured for the use of non-operational units and high-level officers.

As many as 41 of the 64 LMVs were either cars or luxury vehicles such as Toyota Crysta, Innova, Maruti Ciaz, Maruti Ertiga and Swift Dzire, which were not eligible for procurement under MOPF scheme. Audit observed that while eight of the 64 vehicles were allotted to the vehicle pool at PHQ or to high-level officers, 19 vehicles were allotted to non-operational units like crime branch-criminal investigation department and 25 vehicles like Bolero SLE 2WD and Tata Sumo Gold were transferred to vigilance department, which is not covered under the scope of the MOPF scheme.

The report said that the state police chief violated MOPF guidelines, which prohibited procurement of vehicles for VIP/VVIP security utlizing MOPF funds. Two bullet-resistent vehicles were procured at a cost of Rs 1.10 crore without inviting tenders as required under the Store Purchase Manual. The state police chief also diverted a fund of Rs 2.8 crore meant for construction of staff quarters for sub-inspectors and additional sub-inspectors for construction of villas for the state police chief himself as well as other additional directors general of police, the report said.

A defunct low-floor bus lies at a depot in the city

JAIPUR: The degrading condition of the Jaipur City Transport Service Limited (JCTSL) buses can be understood by the fact that only 12 buses of the 33 were operational at Sanganer depot on Monday.

There are three depots in the city – Sanganer, Todi and Vidhyadhar Nagar. Except Sanganer, both the depots have been handed over to private contractors. There has been a shortage of JCTSL buses which is affecting public transport in the city as only 273 buses are operational against the required 1,000. Most of the buses are either condemned or on the verge of being condemned as they are already running out of time.

Managing director of JCTSL Narendra Kumar Gupta said, “We are just about managing the transport of the city with these buses. There is a huge shortage, but we have decreased the number of buses from low pressure routes and have deployed them on high pressure routes. Soon, we will purchase 100 electric buses and some more diesel buses and passengers can heave a sigh of relief.”

The department will soon purchase 45 diesel buses as well. In total, the department is planning to purchase 300 diesel buses and 300 electric buses for the city. This will, however, still not be enough. Two days ago, JCTSL had launched ‘Chalo’ app which will track the movement of buses and provide information of bus arrival time at the stop. Passengers have questioned the importance of the app.

The shortage of buses has caused delay in the time of arrival at bus stops. There are places where buses reach within five minutes, but there are places where they reach after a gap of 40 minutes. Sheela Sharma, a passenger, said, every day she has to wait for 20 minutes to board a bus. “I have downloaded the app, but my bus comes in 20 minutes and in some cases takes 40 minutes to arrive. It just shows the timing of the bus, so we don’t have to wait longer. That does not change the fact that the problem of shortage is still persists,” Sheela said.

KOLKATA: Chief economic adviser ( CEA Krishnamurthy V Subramanian on Wednesday said that amid the uncertainties in China owing to the novel Coronavirus outbreak , there is an “actual opportunity” for India to push its exports. He also mentioned an “Assemble-in-India” model.“If you go by episodes like these, it is very hard to say what exactly it will manifest in terms of India’s trade relations with China. For economists, it is ‘unknown unknowns’. The 2002 SARS virus outbreak in China, for instance, did not impact India that much. Because of the uncertainties faced by China, it’s actually a good opportunity for our country to utilise the time (for exports expansion),” Subramanian said on the sidelines of a lecture on ‘Wealth Creation’ at the IIM-Calcutta.The CEA was replying to a query on China’s current halt in the exports market of networked products like cellphones, automobiles, white goods, apparel and textiles.India is one of China’s leading trade partners in Asia and has a huge trade deficit with that country. “China itself imports components from the rest of the world, assembles them in their country and exports them. In mobile handset manufacturing, India is following the same model. So, if one looks from this perspective, it provides a scope for us,” he said.The CEA referred to the latest Economic Survey and prescribed how India could integrate assemble-in-India and export-driven models.On sagging IIP numbers, the CEA said: “When you are getting out of a phase of deceleration in growth these kinds of phenomenon are anticipated. Some will volatility in the numbers will be there.”According to him, it is high time that the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 be withdrawn as it was an “anachronistic piece of legislation”. ""That act was needed when there was ravaging famines and foodgrain production was low. This act is now anachronistic,"" the CEA said.On the probable time frame to arrest the demand slump despite short- and long-term measures taken by the government since August last year, Subramanian said: “We all know how tough it is to control temperature in an AC room. Imagine, how tough it could be for a complex economy. Going forward, the real growth should be higher at 6-6.5% in the next financial year from 5% as projected for the current fiscal. We have focussed a lot on rural consumption, the 16-point agenda that we announced and the steps on capital expenditure side.”On the need for fixing the fiscal deficit budget, “The FRBM Act specifies limit for the fiscal deficit and also provides the escape clause within 50 basis points. In this delicate balancing situation between spurt in growth and fiscal prudence, we need to lean on growth and not to put all the weight on growth.”",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74114159,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-93909,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/can-push-exports-assemble-in-india-cea/articleshow/74108256.cms

Pune: The Confederation of Real Estate Development Association of India (Credai) has urged the state government to keep ready reckoner (RR) rates unchanged for the next financial year and reduce the prevailing high rates in some areas.

The appeal comes even as district meetings of local representatives are on in the state for suggestions on RR rates. The state kept the rates unchanged in the last two years.

Ready Reckoner (RR) rates are assessments of property value by the state government, on the basis of which stamp duty and registration charges are paid. The government usually revises these rates every year at the start of the financial year on April 1.

State Credai president Rajiv Parikh told TOI, “We have demanded that there should be reduction of rates in most parts of the states as lowering the rates will automatically attract buyers for registration of units. This will help government in getting substantial revenue.”

Credai also requested the government to change RR rates once in every three years. The body has sought drastic and factual changes in the footnotes (guidelines) in RR books, which are useful in calculating stamp duty.

Meanwhile, town planning department officials said they were hearing the suggestions made by local representatives, which will be sent to the registration department.

Property analyst Niranjan Kelshikar, who has been studying the realty sector in the state, said the rise in RR rates will adversely affect the registration and revenue collection in the state. “If government is for revenue rise, small rise in stamp duty of about 1% can bring about 10-15% rise in revenue. However, it should be done only after detailed assessment,’’ he said.

154,['13/02/2020'],Telangana set to repeal 124 acts to frame unified Revenue Act,"Telangana CM K Chandrasekhar Rao

Telangana roped in land laws expert for suggestions

HYDERABAD: Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao is pressing ahead with his reform agenda in the revenue department by getting a unified Revenue Act drafted for Telangana on the lines of a similar Act Uttar Pradesh has enacted.Towards this end, the state government is planning to abolish 124 (various) land and revenue Acts and bring in the unified Revenue Act.The CM is believed to have asked government chief advisor Rajiv Sharma and chief secretary Somesh Kumar to give the final shape to the new Act after examining UP’s Revenue Act in consultation with district collectors and experts on land laws. KCR reportedly spoke about the new Revenue Act at Tuesday’s collectors’ conference held here. “Our effort is to take all the good practices implemented in other states and come up with a new Revenue Act,” a senior CMO official said.Senior officials said the UP government brought a new revenue code in 2016 by merging 35 Acts. “Of the 124 Acts in Telangana, 27 Acts such as Hyderabad Tenancy and Agricultural Land Act of 1950, Hyderabad Asami Shiknis Act of 1354 Fasli, Telangana Atiyat Enquiries Act of 1952, Telangana Jagirdars Debt Settlement Act of 1952 and Splitting of Joint Pattas Act of 1965 are redundant and have no relevance now,” a senior official explained.“Some Acts such as Telangana Record of Rights in Land and Pattadar Passbooks Act (ROR Act) and Telangana Assigned Lands (Prohibition of Transfer) Act require further amendments, which will now be incorporated in the unified Act,” the official said.Experts said once the new Act is in place, every bit of land will be accounted for. “Every dispute relating to ownership by tribals, non-tribals, revenue or non-revenue land will be identified and conclusive titles issued,” an expert said.The government roped in land laws expert, Nalsar University faculty M Sunil Kumar, to make recommendations on various land and revenue Acts. “I had made four suggestions, including having a single law by repealing redundant and obsolete laws. On an average, there are100 to150 Acts pertaining to land,” Sunil told TOI.Secondly, he said the government would have to adopt the Title Guarantee Act to put an end to land disputes. He highlighted the fact that 62% of cases revolve around land disputes only. “Thirdly, the government should go for a comprehensive land survey and evolve a dispute resolution system like setting up land tribunal on the lines of Bihar in every district,” he said.Sunil said the Centre had sent a model Act on title guarantee to all the states a few years ago. But senior officials in Telangana said Title Guarantee Act could not be adopted in its present form and states which took to the Act did not become zero-land dispute states. They said though KCR talked about Title Guarantee Act, the government has had second thoughts on it as it may lead to further complications.Another land laws expert said thanks to conclusive titling, maintenance of property recordswouldceasetobe merely a tool for governance and revenue generation but added to agenda of citizen services.A similar effort to have unified Revenue Act was made by TDP government in 1999 in unified AP but presidential assent was not accorded to resolution.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74108874,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-176436,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-set-to-repeal-124-acts-to-frame-unified-revenue-act/articleshow/74107763.cms
155,['13/02/2020'],Court puts on hold auction of DSK’s 4 high-end vehicles,"This story is from February 13, 2020

Pune: A special MPID court on Wednesday passed an order temporarily excluding four high-end vehicles, including a Porsche, belonging to one of the firms of jailed developer DS Kulkarni, alias DSK, from a public auction process scheduled for February 15.

The other vehicles include two BMWs and a Toyota car. “The prosecution is directed to verify the registration particulars in respect of these vehicles with the Regional Transport Office, Pune, and submit a report accordingly for passing further necessary order in respect of these four vehicles,” the order by special MPID judge JN Raje stated.

DSK and eight others, including his wife, Hemanti, and son, Shirish, are lodged in the Yerawada central jail following their arrest in an alleged multi-crore rupees economic fraud by his group of firms, which came to the fore in October 2017. The fraud refers to siphoning off funds raised via deposits from investors, loans from banks, non-convertible debentures and money collected from homebuyers.

The Pune police’s economic offences wing had seized 20 vehicles in 2018. Of these, 12 are registered in the name of DSK Motors Private Ltd (DSKMPL), five in the name of DSK Developers Ltd (DSKDL) and three in the name of DSK.

On August 20, 2019, then special MPID judge AS Bhaisare passed an order clearing the public auction of 13 of these vehicles. Lawyers Ashish Patankar and Pratik Rajopadhye moved a plea on behalf of Shirish Kulkarni opposing the auction of four DSKMPL and four DSKDL vehicles.

“We brought to the court’s notice that the two firms are going through a liquidation and resolution process under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code and the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal has passed orders on April 9, 2019, and September 26, 2019, prohibiting transfer, alienation or disposal assets of the two firms, respectively,” Patankar said.

Special public prosecutor Pravin Chavan opposed the plea on the grounds that the same was not tenable and it was beyond the special court’s powers to stay partly or otherwise its own order, which had directed the auction. “The court heard the arguments and temporarily excluded four DSKMPL vehicles from the auction,” Rajopadhye said.

CHENNAI: Random allotment of exam centres by Teachers Recruitment Board (TRB) for block education officers recruitment exam caused distress among candidates as many of them were alloted centres far from their home districts. The board, while allotting female candidates centres within their three choices, shuffled the exam centres for male candidates.

Following malpractices in Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission ’s (TNPSC) Group IV exam at select exam centres, TRB decided to allot exam centres randomly to candidates for all its recruitment exams And it decided to intimate about the centres only three days before the exams. The board is conducting online recruitment test from February 14 to 16 to fill block education officer posts. More than 64,000 candidates are competing for 97 posts.

Ganesan, a teacher from Tirunelveli who applied for the test, said he opted for Tirnelveli and Thoothukudi districts, but got an exam centre in Chennai. “I was asked to report at the centre by 8.30am The train from Tirunelveli reaches the city by 7am, and any delay would make it difficult to reach the exam centre on time,” he said. “They could have allotted a centre at least in Madurai or Virudhunagar.”

Shanmugam, a candidate who works in Namakkal district , said he opted for Tirunelveil and Namakkal districts, but was allotted Kancheepuram district. ""The bus ticket would cost me Rs 900. I was allocated a centre near Sripermbudur. If I have to go a day in advance, it would cost me around Rs 5,000. Most of the candidates are unemployed rural graduates. Allotting them exam centres at far away places would discourage them from taking competitive exams,” he said.

Some candidates from Erode said they were allocated exam centres in Virudhunagar district . “Random allocation of exam centres is a good move. But, it should not be a burden. It would be better if centres were allotted within 50km from the candidates’ place of stay,” they said.

When contacted, TRB officials said random allocation is necessary to rule out malpractices. “Of 64,710applicants, more than 40,268 of them are female applicants. They were allotted centres within their three choices. We also made exemption for differently abled candidates from random allotment. Only male candidates were allotted in centres located away,” an official said.

“Though TRB has moved to online exams, we cannot take any chances. These measures were taken to maintain unpredicatability,” official added. Supervising officials have also been randomly allotted exam centres.

Pune: President Ram Nath Kovind has said that bankers must look at including all citizens in the banking services net.

“I would urge them not to leave any one behind. This is also the best way of gaining market depth and de-risking operations,” he said at the golden jubilee celebration of National Institute of Bank Management (NIBM) in Pune on Wednesday.

The President urged bankers to focus on providing for the banking needs of divyang (physically challenged) and enhance gender diversity.

“Banks must take proactive measures to bring greater gender parity in ownership of financial assets. Divyang are more than 2% of our population and we have to make every effort to fully integrate them in the financial mainstream,” he said.

He said the Jan Dhan Yojana had taken banking services to the unbanked. “Never before have so many been brought into the fold of the formal financial system. Nearly 35 crore bank accounts have been opened, larger than the population of countries except ours and China’s,” Kovind added.

“Deep involvement of those at the bottom of the ladder requires display of empathy and compassion by the bankers. This needs greater engagement from banks with our underprivileged population and an attitudinal change,” he said.

The President said the goal of $5 trillion GDP mainly involves “banking with the unbanked” and “securing the unsecured”. India should just more than one bank in the global list of top 100, he added.

VADODARA: A security guard working at a farmhouse in Ampad was arrested on Tuesday by Vadodara rural police for possessing a double-bore gun with a forged licence.

On interrogating the security guard Ravi Sharma , he admitted that he had paid Rs 50,000 to Umar Faruk , an owner of a gun factory in Kashmir to get the gun license . Sharma is a native of Rajouri district in the Union territory of Jammu & Kashmir. Faruk had forged the stamps of district magistrate of Rajouri and Udhampur districts to stamp them on the duplicate license.

Sharma came under the police scanner when cops from Vadodara Taluka police station raided a businessman’s bungalow in Ampad last week.

Although police did not find any liquor there, cops saw the 12 bore double-barrel gun and asked Sharma to furnish the weapon’s license.

Sharma told police that license was deposited with the security agency’s office, so he was asked to report at the police station along with the license and the gun.

When Sharma did not turn up, cops brought him to the police station on Tuesday.

On checking his license, it was known that the license for the gun was issued in Sharma’s name in 1995 by the home department of former state of Jammu & Kashmir and was later renewed in 2014 and 2017. Police found it strange as Sharma was born in 1988 and it was not possible that a seven-year-old boy would have been issued a weapon’s license.

Police seized Sharma’s gun and cartridges and booked him and Faruk for forgery, criminal conspiracy and under Arms Act.

JAIPUR: The JCTSL (Jaipur City Transport Services Limited) claims to have fitness certificates for all its 273 low-floor buses, but more than 150 of these buses will be discontinued as condemned this year. The city will be running on just 110 buses, that may seriously affect public transport in the city.

Across the city, low-floor buses with broken bodies can be seen. Sushmita Sharma, a daily passenger from Narayan Singh Circle says, “Once, I saw a bus moving on the road slightly tilted towards right side. I waited longer to board another bus. Sometimes, there are buses that produce excessive smoke or make more noise. It is no secret that their condition is pathetic.”

Managing director of JCTSL Narendra Gupta, said, “We have fitness certificates of all the buses that are functional, as safety of more than 1 lakh passengers travelling everyday on them is at stake. The buses are being condemned because their time period is over as per the norms. Though the buses that are still functional are kept functional for some years. We are in the process of purchasing 100 electric buses and a few more diesel buses.”

Though it has been said that within six months the electric buses will reach Jaipur, but if any legal or technical problem occurs, it may take the entire year.

Joannes George

MANGALURU: Air customs and preventive wing of Mangaluru customs commissionerate need to be a step or two ahead of gold smugglers . Having booked 52 cases in the current fiscal at Mangaluru International Airport (MIA), seizing a total 17.7 kg of gold up to February 11, they are faced with the need to redouble their efforts to foil novel methods that smugglers constantly employ to smuggle gold into the country.

Unconventional thinking is the need-of-the-hour to be a step ahead of smugglers, said Joannes George , joint commissioner of customs. With MIA being one of the major entry points for smuggled gold into India due to its geographical proximity to districts in neighbouring Kerala, which are notorious for their gold smuggling rackets , it is this constant vigil that has helped customs detect and seize gold, he said.

Noting that it is a game of cat and mouse with the smugglers, George said due to the tight vigil maintained by the customs personnel at MIA, the department was able to check the activities of smugglers who had come out with novel modus operandi to bring in gold from Saudi Arabia and UAE. Gold seized at MIA included unusual methods that offenders adopted to hide gold, which included hiding it under a wig and even inside the rectum in oval-shaped capsules.

Other methods of concealment included converting gold into paste and hiding it under the sole and in specially stitched pockets in pants, underwear and inside kneecaps, George said. They also attempted to smuggle gold by hiding it inside toys, umbrellas, speakers, talcum powder, as metal supporting frame of suitcase, and even as strips within measuring tape.

Baswaraj Nalegave, commissioner of customs, said the department sensitizes officers at MIA on various modus operandi that smugglers adopt, directing them to step up their vigil to take on challenges they posed, by constantly evolving their tactics. “We do not focus on a particular MO given lengths that smugglers go to bring in gold through the green channel,” he said. From April 2019 to January 2020, the air customs at MIA has seized gold weighing 17.7kg worth Rs 6.4 crore from a total 52 smuggling cases registered, he said.

Margao: State Congress president Girish Chodankar has smacked of a scam in the tendering process for organising the Aqua Goa Mega Fish Festival scheduled from February 13 to 15 at Campal, Panaji.

“The biased decision of the directorate of fisheries to award the tender of the Aqua Goa Mega Fish Festival to the second lowest bidder by ignoring the lowest bid for the project is an open and shut case of corruption,” Chodankar said on Wednesday.

Stating that the tender was floated by violating all rules and allowing irregularities in the tender process, Chodankar said he has written to the chief secretary demanding the event be cancelled and that a thorough probe be initiated.

Chodankar said that while the tender was floated by the directorate of fisheries on December 27 specifying the dates of the event between January 31 and February 2, the financial bids were opened on January 22, giving hardly a week’s time for the selected agency to prepare and execute all the deliverables as per tender specifications.

“This is a clear indication that the selected agency was pre-fixed by the department of fisheries,” he said.

Further stating that the tender selection committee headed by director of fisheries Shamila Monteiro comprised four other members from the department neither of who, Chodankar said, have any knowledge of creative designs and art, and wondered how they could assess and evaluate the designs.

Chodankar further pointed out to the absence of clear technical specification like area, size, number of aquariums and quality of aquariums is not mentioned in the tender document, giving scope for escalation in cost which will favour the agency.

NAINITAL: The Uttarakhand high court (HC) on Wednesday issued a show-cause notice to the district magistrate of Dehradun in connection with court order of September 2018 which had directed the state government to stop slaughtering animals in open spaces.

The court has asked the DM to explain why contempt proceedings should not be initiated against him on not complying with court’s orders.

The bench of Justice Sharad Kunar Sharma was hearing a petition which said the state government was not complying with the court's order and that the animals were still being slaughtered in the open across the city.

“The court had directed that all illegal slaughterhouses in the state be sealed. The court also directed that no animal shall be slaughtered outside any legal slaughterhouse. However, the slaughtering of animals is still going on across the state, and even in Dehradun,” said Kartikey Hari Gupta, the lawyer appearing for the petitioners.

Gupta added that the court will initiate contempt proceedings against officials if they are not satisfied with the response.

Puducherry: Chief minister V Narayanasamy on Wednesday lashed out at lieutenant governor Kiran Bedi for interferring in the proceedings of the legislative assembly of the Union territory and All India NR Congress founder-leader N Rangasamy for failing to play a proactive role as the leader of opposition in the assembly.

Speaking to reporters after the assembly session in which an unanimous resolution urging the Centre to repeal CAA ,NRC and NPR was passed, adjourned sine die, Narayanasamy said Bedi without knowing the powers of a legislative assembly unfortunately issued an advisory directing the legislative assembly not to take up discussions on CAA. He said Bedi does not have the authority or power to interfere in the proceedings of the legislative assembly.

He accused her of posting a ‘confidential’ letter she wrote to him on the CAA issue on social networking platforms even before it reached him. “It is a confidential document, but she posted it on the WhatsApp before I got it. This again proves that she does not have administrative acumen. She is not fit to occupy the post of the lieutenant governor. She failed to keep the oath of office and secrecy,” Narayanasamy charged.

He pointed out that several acts passed by the Parliament was debated in the legislative assembly. Many acts have been repealed after the Supreme Court intervened, he said.

Narayanasamy lambasted Rangasamy for failing to make clear the stance of his party on the CAA, NRC and NPR. “Unfortunately, AINRC did not make a stand on CAA, NRC and NPR. By not taking a stance, it has become clear that the AINRC is supporting the BJP,” he said. He insisted Rangasamy attend the assembly sessions to raise issues related to people’s welfare.

He said the landslide victory of AAP in the Delhi assembly polls was largely seen as the people’s recognition for the AAP government’s development and welfare measures. He said the passing away of Congress leader Sheila Dikshit has left a void in Congress party in Delhi.

Pune: The Yerawada police on Tuesday night arrested three men, including a criminal on record, and booked their accomplice for demanding Rs2lakh extortion from a PMC road contractor for allowing him to execute road repair work at R K Chowk on Monday night.

Police identified the arrested as Sagar Hanumante (24), a criminal on record, his father Adinath Hanumante (54) and accomplice Vrushab Pise (21), all from Yerawada.

The PMC had approved the online tender of contractor Uttam Rajendra Vadavrao (34), from Yerawada, and issued him work order to carry out repair work from Sevak Chowk and R K Chowk up to Dakshi Ganapati temple.

“Vadavrao pressed into service an earth moving elevator and commenced work at R K Chowk on February 5, but Sagar and three others asked him to show them the work order and demanded an extortion of Rs 2 lakh for allowing them to execute the contract,” said senior inspector Yunus Shaikh from the Yerawada Police Station.

Shaikh said, “The contractor expressed his inability to pay extortion because the margin of profit in road repair work was less but Sagar and others were in no mood to listen. ”

“Vadavrao held 10 to 12 meetings with Sagar and others, gave them a photocopy of the work order and appealed to them not to create any hindrances, but in vain,” he said.

After considerable negotiations, the suspects reduced the amount to Rs80,000 and asked him to pay the first instalment of Rs60,000 and the rest Rs20,000 later.

Assistant inspector, Balbhim Nanaware, who is investigating the case, said, “Around 11pm on February 10, when Vadavrao and his staff started work, the suspects rushed to the spot and threatened them. They said that work cannot be started without their permission.

The Bhoole Bhatke Shivir on Magh Mela ground

ALLAHABAD: When 70-year-old Raghuvansh Prasad set out for Allahabad from his home town Siddhi in Madhya Pradesh last week, he had just one aim in mind — to atone for his sins by taking a dip in Sangam during the Magh Mela on Basant Panchami. Accompanied by several other senior citizens from his town, he had planned to return the same week. That was until he lost his way and got separated from his group at the massive Magh Mela venue.

Prasad spent 10 days at the Bhoole Bhatke shivir (lost and found camp) at the Mela ground before he could go back home. He did not remember contact details of his family members and no one came to take him back home during the period. On Monday, the camp’s organisers found out his address and sent him back.

Prasad is among several elderly devotees who have been languishing in various camps after getting separated from their groups. As most of them do not remember their contact details, Mela authorities and camps often struggle to find about their families.

Ever since the Magh Mela started, the organisers of Bhoole Bhatke Shivir said they’d have to send back 28 elderly citizens back homes as when no one from their families turned up to take them home.

One of the volunteers at the camp said, “One of the devotees spotted Prasad sitting with a lost expression at the ground and then brought him to the Bhoole Bhatke shivir. The man couldn’t remember a lot and could only tell us that he belonged to Siddhi.”

Geeta Rai from Katni in Madhya Pradesh had come to the Magh Mela on Basant Panchami along with a group of villagers, but got separated from them on the ghats.

“The woman narrated her story to the volunteers at Bhoole Bhatke camp and requested them to make arrangements to send her back. She also told us that she had been visiting Magh Mela since the past several years and this was the first time when she was separated from her group,” said the volunteer.

Umesh Tiwari, organiser of the Bhoole Bhatke Shivir, said, “We have a list of 28 elderly people who were sent back by Mela authorities since the beginning of Magh Mela. Most of them were between 60 and 85 years of age and were unable to recall details like their address or family members’ phone numbers. We had to make continuous efforts to get some inputs.”

Tiwari said there were a few cases when the lost devotees refused to go back to home. “They told us that they didn’t wish to return due to as they don’t get along with their family members. For instance, a devotee from Lalitpur, Shriram Parethia (70), had refused to return as he was fed up with his grandson’s antics.” The septuagenarian told the camp’s volunteers that his grandson was nine years old and often used to make unnecessary demands from him. “He said he was unable to fulfil his demands as he didn’t have enough money. Parethia agreed to go back home only after police assured him they would try to convince his grandson to not make any more demands,” Tiwari said.

171,['13/02/2020'],Dr Reddy’s to buy part of Wockhardt India biz for Rs 1.8k cr,"This story is from February 13, 2020

Hyderabad: Pharma major Dr Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd on Wednesday said it was acquiring select divisions of Wockhardt Ltd’s branded generics business in India along with a few other international territories of Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and Maldives. The deal has been struck for Rs 1,850 crore on a slump sale basis.

While Dr Reddy’s is among the top five pharma companies in the country, Wockhardt is among the top 15. While Dr Reddy’s reported a consolidated turnover of Rs 15,400 crore in 2018-19, Wockhardt posted a consolidated revenue of Rs 4,158 crore for the same fiscal.

With this, a portfolio of 62 brands in multiple therapy areas such as respiratory, neurology, VMS, dermatology, gastroenterology, pain and vaccines would transfer to Dr Reddy’s along with related sales and marketing teams. The deal also includes Wockhardt’s manufacturing plant at Baddi in Himachal Pradesh, which manufactures some of these products. The transfer will include all employees at the plant.

The two players have already inked a definitive agreement and the transaction is expected to be closed by May 12.

The India business of Dr Reddy’s contributed just 17% to the company’s consolidated turnover for 2018-19.

Commenting on the buy, GV Prasad, co-chairman and managing director of Dr Reddy’s Labs, said, “India is an important market for us and this acquisition will help in considerably scaling-up our domestic business. The acquired portfolio shall enhance Dr Reddy’s presence in the high growth therapy areas with market leading brands such as Practin, Zedex, Bro-zedex, Tryptomer and Biovac.”

Wockhardt Group founder chairman Dr Habil Khorakiwala said in a regulatory filing to the bourses, “The intended sale of business portfolio is in line with the company’s strategic plan to shift from acute therapeutic areas to more chronic businesses like anti-diabetes and CNS. We also want to focus on niche antibiotic portfolio of NCEs (new chemical entities).” The deal is expected to strengthen the company’s balance sheet.

“The divestment will also ensure adequate liquidity to bring in robust growth in the chronic domestic branded business, international operations, investments in biosimilars for the US market apart from the company's global clinical trials of break-through anti-infectives (NCEs approved under coveted QIDP1 program of USFDA) and R&D activities,” Khorakiwala explained in the statement.

Wockhardt said in a regulatory filing that the revenue from the business undertaking to be sold to Dr Reddy’s stood at Rs 594 crore for financial year 2018-19, which was 28% of Wockhardt’s total standalone revenue from operations and 14% of the total consolidated revenue of the company.

For the nine-month period ended December 31, 2019, the business clocked a revenue of Rs 377 crore, which is 34% of the total standalone revenue from operations for the period and 15% of the total consolidated revenue.

Panaji: Soon, locals residing in villages close to forest areas will act as the forest department’s eyes and ears with the state government registering them as forest trackers. Chief minister Pramod Sawant said that tracks have been identified in sanctuaries at Netravali, Dudhsagar, Mhadei and Cotigao wherein these trackers will be permitted to enter the sanctuaries.

He was speaking at the inaugural of the Goa Van Bhavan – the forest department’s state-of-the-art office building, on Wednesday. He also said that the forest department will be enrolling medicinal plant collectors in the state in a bid to inventorise its herbs and explore sustainable ways to extract their properties.

“The leaves, fruits, roots and other components of each medicinal plant will be shortlisted and licensed. There is good scope for medicinal plants in pharmaceutical companies,” Sawant said. In addition to this, Sawant also said that the Bondla wildlife sanctuary will be developed and promoted as a tourist destination. Efforts will also be made to relocate tribals and villagers living close to forest areas in a bid to tackle the man-animal conflict. He urged range forest officers to maintain a good rapport with the inhabitants of such areas to ensure smooth communication.

Speaking about the Van Bhavan, he said that all the offices under the forest department will be shifted into this new building. “From here they will coordinate with all the sanctuaries and forest training can also be done from this office. Henceforth we will coordinate with RFOs and taluka offices with this office,” Sawant said. The GSIDC project has been built at the cost of Rs 18.5 crore in Altinho. GSIDC vice-chairman Joshua D’souza said that solar panels have been fitted on the building to power its offices.

PANAJI: After being denied bail thrice, a 61-year-old ayah (helper) accused of mixing tobacco in a feeding bottle of a 21-month-old child at a daycare centre in Ponda has been granted bail.

The high court of Bombay at Goa has held that there was no reason for her to continue in custody as the investigation is substantially over, the chargesheet has been filed and there is nothing to be recovered from her.

“The vital point which ensures in favour of the applicant is the fact that the substance was referred to the food analyst for analysis who was not a competent authority to carry out the analysis for the presence of tobacco in the milk ,” Justice Nutan Sardessai stated in her order.

Counsels Damodar Dhond and Ravi Gauns, representing the accused, submitted that the food analyst who said that the brownish substance found inside the feeding bottle was nicotine was not a competent authority and was not notified to do so.

Additional public prosecutor Gaurish Nagvenkar argued that the daycare centre was run without permission.

The 61-year-old ayah has been in custody for more than 140 days since she was arrested in September last year.

BENGALURU: Setting the stage for the ambitious high-speed rail corridors, National High Speed Rail Corporation ( NHSRC ) has invited bids for preparing the alignment design and survey for six new lines across the country.

This includes the 435km Mysuru-Bengaluru-Chennai line which may reduce travel time between the three cities to one and half hours.

A senior railway official said two new lines will have to be laid with fencing throughout the route. “The line may have to go either underground or be elevated when it passes through the city or towns en route. Approximately, 50 to 60 metres width of land will be needed to lay two lines with fencing. This means, several lakhs of acres of land will be needed for the Mysuru-Bengaluru-Chennai route alone.”

Apart from this line, NHSRC has proposed five other corridors –– Mumbai-Pune-Hyderabad (711km), Delhi-Varanasi (865), Delhi-Ahmedabad (886), Delhi-Amritsar (459) and Mumbai-Nashik-Nagpur (753km). Of this, Delhi-Varanasi is likely to be taken up in the first phase.

Tender documents reveal that selected firms will finalise the alignment and prepare stage-1 preliminary route map for the six high-speed rail lines. The tender is likely to be finalised by the end of this month.

At present, NHSRC is tasked with the 508-km Mumbai Ahmedabad High Speed Rail Link project.

Experts say high-speed rail corridors will reduce journey time by 50%.

NEW DELHI: A Delhi court expressed displeasure on Wednesday over the CBI's investigation of a bribery case involving its former special director Rakesh Asthana , who was given a clean chit on Tuesday.

""Why are certain accused, who seem to have a bigger role in the case, roaming free while the CBI has arrested its own DSP (Devender Kumar),"" special CBI judge Sanjeev Aggarwal asked. The CBI had registered the case against Asthana on a complaint from Hyderabad-based businessman Satish Babu Sana, who faced investigation in a 2017 case involving meat exporter Moin Qureshi.

The agency filed a chargesheet in the court on Tuesday concluding there was no connection between Asthana and the alleged middleman, Manoj Prasad, and no evidence to prove that Asthana had ever demanded or received a bribe to save Sana in the money laundering case related to Qureshi.

The CBI has also found nothing against present R&AW chief Samant Goel, who was named in the FIR filed at former CBI director Alok Verma's behest - a development that had many flummoxed. Dubai-based businessman Prasad, however, has been charged in the case. Sources said the CBI would continue to investigate his brother, Someshwar Srivastava, and father-in-law Sunil Mittal.

Srivastava, whose name had cropped up during investigation, was not arrested in the case, and the CBI's DSP Devender Kumar, who was arrested in 2018, later got bail.

""Why is Srivastava not arrested? Manoj Prasad seems to be a weaker link... Why is Srivastava roaming free? You arrested your own DSP without considering his career, which might have been ruined,"" the court asked.

The court also said that while Devender Kumar's life and liberty were curtailed, Srivastava was enjoying his life. The agency, on the other hand, said the investigation was still on as far as Srivastava's role was concerned.

The matter has been posted for hearing to February 19 .

Villupuram: Opposition DMK, which during its tenure passed a resolution in the cabinet to punish all convicts barring Nalini in the assassination case of former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi , is not worthy enough to criticise the AIADMK dispensation which has been working for the release of all seven convicts who have been in prison for more than 28 years, said Tamil Nadu minister for law , prison and courts C Ve Shanmugam. He was taking part in a government function in Villupuram on Wednesday.

Villupuram municipal office sources said as the municipality is celebrating its centenary, Tamil Nadu chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami had announced Rs 50 crore for infrastructure development. As part of the announcement, the municipality would get a new building and Rs 32 crore-worth tar roads across the town.

Addressing the media after laying foundation stone for the Rs 50 crore project, Shanmugam, citing the Supreme Court direction that the Tamil Nadu government may request governor Banwarilal Purohit regarding the premature release of the convicts, said, “We, the AIADMK government, believe that the governor will take a good decision regarding the release of Nalini, Sriharan, Perarivalan, Santhan, Jayakumar, Ravichandran and Robert Payas as he has the authority to grant them pardon under Article 161 of the Constitution.”

The AIADMK government, with an intention to release all the seven, had passed a resolution and immediately forwarded it to the governor under the powers vested on it by the Constitution. Now, it’s up to the governor to decide, he said. Shanmugham also strongly criticised the DMK, which had reportedly said the government had not initiated any steps for the release of the convicts. The oppposition party had passed a resolution while in power to hang six convicts, except Nalini, Shanmugam said. The opposition party now has no right to criticise the AIADMK government on the issue, he added.

Collector A Annadurai, Vanur AIADMK legislator M Chakrapani, Vikravandi AIADMK legislator M R Muthamizhselvan, Villupuram municipal commissioner Dhakshinamoorthi and other government officials took part in the ceremony.

“Earlier the date proposed was March 15. Holi starts on March 9 followed by the Shigmo festival. Considering that it is celebrated in every village, we decided to postpone the polls,” he said.

He said that the notification announcing the date was to arrive on Wednesday, but owing to the postponement of the polls, the fresh dates will be notified soon.

“I have approached the state election commission in this regard. They have tentatively decided to shift the dates. The notification and reservation announcing the same will be released soon,” he said.

The polls to be held on party lines will involve all 50 Zilla Panchayat constituencies - 25 in the north and remaining in South Goa. TOI was the first to report that the ZP elections would be held on party lines.

CLEARED SKHER

Kolhapur: Three police personnel were injured while conducting a raid at a gambling centre in Akurde village of Bhudargad taluka on Tuesday night, when a mob attacked them. The Bhudargad police have registered an assault case against unidentified persons.

The Bhudargad police got information that a illegal gambling den was operating near a primary school in Akurde village. Following this, a team of four police personnel raided the place and found around 12 people involved in gambling in a room near the school. Police asked them to collect their mobile phones, playing cards and cash that was found on the spot and started the process of panchnama (witness recording).

At the same time, one of these people requested permission to go out and attend nature’s call. One of the policemen took him outside the room. When they were moving out, the man suddenly fainted.

At the time of the incident, the village was full of people due to a fair on Tuesday. Some people thought the man had collapsed because the police had beaten him up. The rumour spread in the village and the villagers gathered at the spot started attacking the police with sticks and stones. Three policemen were injured in the incident and were later admitted at the primary health centre at Bhudargad.

“We have initiated enquiry and will soon nab the suspects involved in the attack. We will take strict action against those involved in attacking the police on duty,” said an officer attached with Bhudargad police station.

This is the second such incident in which the police were attacked by a mob when they were on duty. Last year, a team of 12 police personnel led by trainee assistant superintendent of police Aishwarya Sharma had reached Yadavnagar area to raid a matka den on the night of April 8, 2019, when they were attacked by a mob and also manhandled. Then, one of the suspects snatched the service revolver of the officer and ran away from the spot.

Box: Man held for setting cop’s car on fire

Bhudargad police on Wednesday arrested a man for allegedly setting afire the car of a police inspector parked outside his residence on Tuesday night. The fire engulfed car as well as a part of the inspector’s house. The fire brigade managed to bring the fire under control.

According to the police, the suspect had encroached on land in the police residence area in Gargoti and had constructed a shop on the spot. Inspector Sanjay Patange had removed the construction as it was illegal. Enraged with this, the suspect poured petrol on Patange’s car on Tuesday night and set it on fire.

“We have arrested the suspect identified as Subhash Desai and are taking appropriate action against him as per rule,” said Srinivas Ghatage, additional superintendent of police.

Thiruvananthapuram: Corporation has set in motion some key projects which had figured in the previous budget ahead of budget for 2020-21. The civic body issued tenders for Mayor’s bhavan at Kunnukuzhy and Elders’ corner, a pet project of the town planning standing committee at a cumulative estimate of Rs 3.6 crore.

Mayor's bhavan had repeatedly surfaced in corporation budgets and works standing committee had given its nod to call tenders and initiate the construction process before the end of the present council’s tenure. Elders’ corner is being planned at Kowdiar, Vazhuthacaud, Kannammoola, Peroorkada, Kulathur, Palayam, Pettah and Harbour wards. Chairman of town planning committee Palayam Rajan said some of the elders’ corner will come up near children’s park.

“Elders’ corner is being planned with space for recreation, reading and chit-chat. There will be facilities for listening to music or even watching television. The corner will be sheltered and project will be implemented using Rs 50 lakh,” he said.

Corporation has set a deadline of March for the completion of elders’ corner. The civic body had recently completed revamp of children’s park in many wards and spaces designated as Elders’ corner will come up near the revamped children’s park. “People going for morning and evening walk can also come to elders’ corner and spend some quality time with their peers. There would also be toilet facilities,” Rajan said.

Mayor’s bhavan is being planned with facilities for accommodation, hosting events and meetings especially meetings of members of mayor’s chamber. Tenders have been called for setting up swap shops in city. Corporation had earlier opened a swap shop in Kazhakkoottam during the tenure of previous mayor V K Prasanth.

The swap shop will feature three different categories; electrical and electronic appliances and gadgets, dress materials and toys. There would be conditions to put up items for sale; electrical appliances shall be fully functional, dress materials must be washed, dried and neatly pressed and toys must be useful. Any other item, which could be useful for others, can be put up for sale.

Corporation and Suchitwa mission have been mulling over one-day shops in the city modelled on garage sale, where private individuals can sell used goods. Stalls will be conducted similar to e-waste collection centres which has been a massive success in the city till date. The civic body has gone for this idea in the wake of a retail chain dumping rejects which they had collected from people in exchange for discount coupons in a private property. Used bags, shoes, sandals and books in usable condition can also be collected in swap shops.

Representative image

ALLAHABAD: The father and two uncles of a 23-year-old woman were arrested in Pratapgarh on Wednesday for allegedly beating her to death in May last year and trying to pass it off as a missing case.

The murder of Priti Verma oddly came to light during investigations into an attempted murder, where a trader known to her father was shot at and injured by a youth who harboured secret feelings for her.

Pratapgarh SP Abhishek Singh told TOI that Priti’s father Raju Verma and uncles Jamuna Prasad Verma and Rajesh Verma, all residents of Nandlal Ka Purwa Raja Puneriya, were arrested on charges of murder and concealing evidence.

The family had not only performed the young woman’s last rites in a clandestine manner on May 14, but also tossed her mobile phone into her pyre. A day later, the accused trio, along with local trader Sarvesh Somvansi, had visited Antoo police station and lodged a missing diary.

Preliminary investigation into Priti’s murder suggests she had tied the knot at a temple with a young man she loved against the wishes of her parents. Rahul Verma, the husband, told police that the couple had planned to legalise their wedding in court soon, but couldn’t have guessed what was in store.

On May 13, Priti’s parents — apparently unaware of her temple marriage to Rahul — had arranged her engagement with another man. Priti met Rahul the same day and told him that she needed to go ahead with the ring ceremony so as to not raise suspicions. “She said agreeing to the sagai (ring ceremony) would facilitate our court marriage later,” Rahul told police.

Unfortunately for the young couple, Priti’s father and uncles caught them talking. While Rahul managed to escape, Priti was dragged back home. She was so mercilessly beaten that she died. Her family hastily performed her last rites at Singhani Ghat on the banks of Ganga.

On how the murder was cracked, the SP said the missing case had almost hit a dead end when two youths — Ajay Pasi and Pawan Saroj — were arrested in connection with the November 11 gun attack on trader Somvansi.

Pasi said that he had a “soft corner” for a woman who mysteriously disappeared one day and he suspected Somvansi had a role in it.

“Since Pasi had seen the trader accompany Priti’s family to Antoo police station to lodge the missing diary, he thought Somvansi knew what happened to her. Pasi and his aide shot at him to avenge her disappearance,” the SP said.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The state government ’s failure in ensuring the promised funds for Kerala Road Safety Authority (KRSA) has crippled the efforts to improve road safety measures in the state, observed Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) during the audit report on revenue sector for 2017-18 submitted in the assembly on Wednesday.

The report finds that the government didn’t release Rs. 435.51 crore meant for Kerala Road Safety Fund for 2008-09 to 2017-18 despite clear provisions in statutes. “The government didn’t take any steps to rectify and the KRSA was unable to allot funds for projects identified for road safety,” notes the report.

As per Section 11(3) of the KRSA Act, 2007, 50% of the compounding fee collected in the previous year should be transferred to KRSF. As per rule 3 (4) of the KRSA rules, 2007, 1% of the road safety cess collected by the motor vehicles department may be charged for expenditure and the balance shall be transferred to KRSF.

The audit report found that during 2014-15, the police levied Rs 45.83 crore as compounding fee using 100 speed detection cameras installed by Keltron . But, only Rs 14.70 crore from this was transferred to the fund.

The audit is critical of the organisational set up of the KRSA. “The KRSA didn’t maintain any information about the present status of implementation of projects, amount pending with implementing agencies after completion of projects and up to date account of refunds regarding completed projects. This could lead to shortage of funds with KRSA and affect the sanctioning of projects,” notes the report.

The audit also found that district road safety councils also didn’t comply with rules. DRSCs didn’t send any report or return to the road safety commissioner as mandated by Section 23 of the KRSA Act. KRSA didn’t prepare annual report and submit to the government as mandated by the rule. The government also didn’t nominate experts to the district councils, finds the report.

The CAG report also notes that the shortcomings when pointed out during the exit conference were approved by the government. Officials assured the audit body that the issue of short transfer of funds would be taken up by the finance department.

Slug: Amassed through smuggling

Kolhapur: A special workshop was organised for the Kolhapur police in connection with the seizure of narcotics and smuggling materials along with the preventive action taken to keep a check on these activities.

Ratnesh Srivastava, a vigilance officer attached with the finance department, Mumbai leads the workshop and gave tips to the police officers regarding several issues. He also shared his expertise regarding the seizure of the property found during the raids on smugglers and action taken on criminals to keep a check on the narcotics network.

Srivastava shared his inputs to seize of the property they had illegally amassed through the profit generated from the illegal business.

According to police sources, Kolhapur is the entrance gate for Maharashtra having a good and porous border with neighbouring states of Karnataka and Goa. There are possibilities of running a nexus of drugs from Goa to Maharashtra and other parts of India through Kolhapur. Hence the focus has been given on Kolhapur to keep a check on the flow of the drugs and break the nexus.

During a recent action taken by the police against the criminals running matka and illegal gambling centre, the issue of seizure of properties amassed by the criminals had surfaced. The police department had appointed a forensic auditor to conduct the survey of the properties and the auditor had later submitted the report to the police department in this regard. Police are opting legal options to take action against these criminal’s properties and seize them as per rule.

Apart from this, police are also trying to gather information about the absconding Telnade brothers, criminals booked under MCOCA. “The tips given during the workshop will definitely help in addressing these routine issues along with keeping a check on the nexus of narcotics in the district” said a senior police officer.

184,['13/02/2020'],NSI signs MoU with IIMR for bio-ethanol production,"This story is from February 13, 2020

Kanpur: To promote bio-ethanol production, National Sugar Institute, Kanpur and ICAR-Indian Institute of Millets Research, Hyderabad joined hands to develop varieties of Sweet Sorghum and suitable technologies for producing ethanol from it to meet the requirement of 10% for blending in petrol,.

The two institutes signed a MoU at National Sugar Institute, Kanpur on Tuesday. The MoU aims at undertaking collaborative research and development projects on exploring potential of sweet sorghum for ethanol production.

As per the understanding, testing of promising sweet sorghum genotypes developed by ICAR-IIMR, Hyderabad, suitable for planting in February and June/July in northern India shall be carried out at the National Sugar Institute farm. Thereafter, the study of processing technique and ethanol production potential from different sweet sorghum varieties shall be carried out at NSI , Kanpur.

“In addition to it we shall explore possibilities of utilising sweet sorghum syrup in beverage and confectionary industry,” said Prof Narendra Mohan, director, National Sugar Institute, Kanpur.

Sweet sorghum may be considered as a potential crop for ethanol production in northern India as it is a warm-season crop that needs high temperatures and short days. It tolerates drought and high-temperature stress better than many crops, but it does not grow well, under low temperature, said Dr Vilas Tonapi, ICAR-IIMR, Hyderabad.

He said that it is about four months crop which requires much lesser irrigation water than sugarcane. A crop yielding 40 tonnes fresh stalk/hectare, upon juice extraction at 60% would yield about three tons jaggery and 3.5 tons syrup. The same stalk in fermentation may yield about 2,000 litre of ethanol considering production of ethanol at 50 litre/tonnes of sweet sorghum stalks, he added.

The stalk residue left over after processing may be about 12-15 tonnes/hectare, which may be used either as fuel or feed. However, the real picture will emerge after the collaborative study. It has been recognised as one of promising crop for production of ethanol in the National Bio-fuel Policy, said Dr Ashok Kumar, assistant professor, agriculture chemistry, NSI, Kanpur.

“We have still not been able to achieve the ethanol blending target of 10% in petrol and thus development of such alternate feed stock may go a long way in meeting the country’s requirement”, he added.

187,['13/02/2020'],Overflowing garbage bins mar children’s park at Colva beach,"This story is from February 13, 2020

Colva: The childrens’ park adjoining Colva beach, an idyllic swathe of green that is on most days bustling with school students on excursions and picnicking families on the weekends, is now being used for a rather unsavoury activity. The otherwise picturesque park has become a ‘transfer point’ for garbage— both wet and dry— collected from beach shacks by cleaning agency Karnataka Commercial and Industrial Corporation (KCIC). A cluster of large garbage bins and even dumpsters, filled to the brim with mixed garbage are the first thing one notices at the park— apart from the pervasive stench and flies.

When TOI caught KCIC staff in the act of leaving the bins in the park in the December 2019, the Goa head of the beach-cleaning agency, Parveen Farooqui, said that it was just a temporary arrangement as they were in the process of getting a transfer station from state tourism department.

Farooqui had also stated that the staff only transfer the garbage from vehicle to vehicle, and “do not leave it on the ground”.

On February 12, TOI took pictures of garbage bins overflowing with waste and even dropped on the ground— while school children, on a picnic, frolicked around the park.

The children’s park was one of the additions to the Colva beach as part of the Union government’s Rs 11.67 crore-development and beautification project to turn the beach into an iconic tourist destination.

KCIC collects wet garbage from 96 shacks allowed by the government from Arossim to Cavelossim and brings it to the children’s park, from where it is transported.

When the picture was sent to Farooqui, she wrote back stating that the vehicles with the first load of garbage had already transported it to the plant and the garbage lying at the park would be transported before evening.

She did not respond to her earlier statement that they do not keep the garbage on the ground. When contacted, tourism director Menino D’souza echoed Farooqui’s statement that it was a tenporary arrangement.

190,['13/02/2020'],There’s mo stopping FC Goa,"This story is from February 13, 2020

Margao: Don’t get fooled by the scoreline, this was a nervy win for FC Goa but an important three points that take them back to the top of the Indian Super League ( ISL ) ladder.

Goa continued their search for a cherished place in the AFC Champions League group stage with a 5-2 demolition of Mumbai City FC at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda on Wednesday.

Mumbai started the goal-rush here with Rowllin Borges opening the scoring in the 18th minute. Goa, however, hit back with goals from Ferran Corominas (20th), Hugo Boumous (38) and Jackichand Singh (39) for a 3-1 advantage at the break. In the second session, Bipin Singh (57) pulled a goal back for Mumbai, but Coro struck again for his 13th of the season, while Mohammed Rafique ended up turning a harmless ball into his own goal with three minutes left on the clock.

The win gives Goa 36 points, the highest tally for any club in the ISL, but with ATK close on their heels, there will be hardly any time to rest. Goa play their last league game away at Jamshedpur next week and will be without Brandon Fernandes (seven yellow cards) and Seriton Fernandes (four bookings), both of whom remain suspended.

Mumbai have 26 points, four ahead of Chennaiyin FC, who have two games in hand. Mumbai’s home clash against Chennaiyin could now possibly decide the fourth playoff spot.

The visitors could have so easily made things comfortable for themselves. They had a predictable plan – press Goa high up and force mistakes. Goa panicked and Rowllin’s opener should have given Mumbai a massive boost. Instead, it worked the other way as Goa struck back within two minutes through Coro’s low volley from inside the box.

Between the time Goa got the equaliser in the 20th minute and half-time, they could do anything. Every move, the winners believed, would result in a goal and proof of that was provided by Boumous and Jackichand, who scored twice in as many minutes. Mumbai didn’t know what they were up against and were lucky that they didn’t concede more, before coach Jorge Costa talked them back into the game at half time.

In the second half, the boot was on the other foot. Mumbai were now so dominating that Goa were completely unrecognisable. Mumbai attacked in numbers and a wayward Goa pressed the panic button too easily. There were tired minds and legs too. Bipin’s strike from inside the box injected life and a sense of a fightback with more than half an hour still left to be played.

Mumbai, to be fair, should have scored more. Goa goalkeeper Mohammed Nawaz was forced into two very good saves, keeping away a long ranger from Rowllin and a header from the relatively-quiet Modou Sougou in quick succession.

As it so often happens with Goa, they found a way, through Coro’s goal. It was a quick counter attack which saw Boumous read his strike partner’s run and slip the ball through for the Spanish sharpshooter to finish clinically past goalkeeper Amrinder Singh in the 80th minute.

By this time, the match was in Goa’s pocket. There was time for another one as Coro was on the hunt for his hat-trick. He was brought down inside the box. But while the referee remained unconvinced and Mumbai defenders simply watched, Lenny pounced on the opportunity to shoot at goal. The ball was travelling wide, only for Mumbai defender Rafique to turn it into his own goal.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Months before the new coronavirus COVID-19 , CO-stands for corona, VI for virus and D for disease) turned deadly and led to fatalities across China triggering a global panic, a review by four Chinese scientists had warned that in future SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) or MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) type coronavirus outbreaks will originate from bats and there was an increased probability that this would occur in China.The article by Yi Fan, Kai Zhao, Zheng Li Shi and Peng Zhou titled ‘Bat coronaviruses in China’ was published by MDPI journal in March 2019. The team with CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens and Biosafety, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan stressed on the investigation of bat coronaviruses to detect early warning signs and thus minimize the impact of such outbreaks in China in future.According to the researchers, three zoonotic coronaviruses caused SARS, MERS and SADS (Swine Acute Diarrhea Syndrome) in two decades and the agents originated from bats; two of them originated in China. Since both SARS and SADS were caused by coronaviruses of bat origin in China, they underlined the need to study bat coronaviruses to understand their potential of causing another virus outbreak. During the review, they collected information from past epidemiology studies on bat coronaviruses in China, including the virus species identified, the host species and their geographical distribution.The article devotes a special chapter ‘Why China’ in which various reasons are enlisted as to how China could witness another major outbreak due to coronavirus. The study points out that most of the bat hosts of live near humans, potentially transmitting viruses to humans and livestock.“Chinese food culture maintains that live slaughtered animals are more nutritious and this belief may enhance viral transmission. It is generally believed that bat-borne coronaviruses will reemerge to cause the next disease outbreak and China is a likely hotspot. The challenge is to predict when and where to prevent such outbreaks,” the article said.The review was completed in January 2019 and by January 2020, China was in the grip of COVID-19 with Wuhan as the epicentre, forcing complete shutdown of cities.“Predictions in research have a high variability factor. Every disease can be monitored by observing certain trends and administrations must look for such trends. Many factors affect survival and mutation of a virus. In our state, we used Nipah experience for early detection and checked community spread of COVID-19 and prevented a calamity,” said scientist at Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology Dr E Sreekumar.Global spread of COVID-19 gave rise to theories of bioweapon experimentation. But the researchers anticipated an outbreak. On February 3, Peng Zhou, Xing Lou Yang and Zheng-Li Shi published another article in Nature journal which reported the identification and characterization of COVID-19. As per the report, full length genome sequences were obtained from five patients during early stages of the outbreak and it showed that they are almost identical to each other and share 79.5% sequence identity to SARS-CoV.

VADODARA: An irate mob tried to barge into the Sukhsar police station in Dahod district and pelted some bricks on it after a man from the Nana Borida village in Fatepura taluka was murdered.

The youth Kalpesh Damor (23) was strangled to death by two friends on Tuesday night.

According to the police, his body of was found inside a well near the Nana Borida village. The body was fished out and rushed to the Sukhsar government hospital where he was declared dead and the incident was registered as an unnatural death by cops. A group of persons residing in the same neighbourhood as Kalpesh rushed to the police station suspecting that he had been murdered. Police told the group that they would register an offence based on the findings of postmortem. The group, however, started insisting that the post mortem should be performed at Dahod.

Some persons from the group tried to barge into the police station and hurled some bricks lying outside. Police used mild force to disperse the mob.

The autopsy on Wednesday revealed that Kalpesh was strangled to death. Investigations led the police to two of his friends Harish Bamaniya and Rakesh Bamaniya from Mota Natva village. An offence of murder was registered and the duo was arrested. Dahod superintendent of police Hitesh Joysar said that an offence was also registered regarding the disturbance created at the police station. “Only a few bricks were pelted, but such behaviour cannot be tolerated. We will arrest those involved. Those responsible for the incident were not even relatives of the deceased and merely stayed in the same area,” said Joysar.

Kolhapur: A Sangli resident, who was quarantined on February 7 at the civil hospital, has been discharged after his swab sample tested negative .

Sangli district civil surgeon Sanjay Salunkhe said the swab sample was sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune for novel coronavirus (nCoV) testing. “We received the result on February 10. We discharged the patient on the same day,” he said, adding that the patient’s health is still being monitored.

He added that the patient had cold, cough, and fever from February 1 and resides in Palus taluka. He had a travel history from Shijiazhuang city, which is around 900 km from Wuhan, the epicenter of coronavirus outbreak.

“Since he had no symptoms matching with the coronavirus, there was no point in keeping him quarantined. Besides, the incubation period of 14 days was already over. It could be a normal cold and fever case, and we are treating it accordingly,” he said.

Salunkhe added that a private hospital from Sangli has requested permission to set up an isolation ward for coronavirus suspects. He added that a team of medical experts will visit the hospital to find out of it complies with the state government guidelines.

It has to be noted that the coronavirus is a large family of viruses including Middle East Respiratory Syndrome and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome that causes illnesses ranging from the common cold to acute respiratory syndromes.

The widening of the 16.5-km stretch, which is being undertaken by L&T constructions, needed a total of around 6,54,000 cubic metres of quarry materials for construction.

Though it had applied to department of mining and geology, the approval was given only for around 3,04,000 cubic metres.

Moreover, a recent decision to introduce prior environmental clearance for quarrying for NH projects came as a hurdle for completing the project on time. This was resolved in the recent meeting, which decided to continue the exemption for NH widening projects. “Around 78% of the work has been completed. The construction of around 8-km concrete road has been completed. However, the delay in getting raw materials on time would affect the work, especially since there is onset of monsoon within four months,” sources in NHAI said.

The NHAI is procuring crushed sand from Tirunelveli while other quarrying materials are sourced from places such as Kottukal, Anavoor, Irumbil, Chenkal, Parasuvaikkal in the district. Quarrying materials of around 3,50,000 cubic metres will be needed for the remaining works.

Sources in NHAI said that the project is progressing with an aim to complete it by May. The NHAI will have to complete an additional service road of around 5.6km.

The NHAI had not included continuous service road in the detailed project report considering the fact that the bypass is in a greenfield stretch in rural area. However, following local protest, NHAI has recently prepared a proposal for the construction of service road.

Sources said that regional office has sent the proposal to NHAI for a change of scope for construction of service road and is awaiting approval.

Meanwhile, it has also issued 3(A) notification for acquisition of around 1.23 acres for the construction of the remaining service roads of 5.5-metre width. There is also demand for construction of underpasses and overpasses in several stretches, which is delaying work.

Once completed, the Mukkola-Karode stretch will be the first concrete road project of NHAI in the state.

The project was awarded to L&T in June 2015 with a construction period of 24 months. After several deadlines lapsed, the NHAI is planning to complete works by May.

Kolhapur: Civic chief Mallinath Kalshetti on Wednesday suspended two junior engineers (JE’s) for dereliction of duty.

Sanjay Nagargoje, JE with the public works department (PWD), was suspended owing to the poor quality of the road constructed at Ideal Colony in the E-ward.

Kalshetti along with other officials conducted surprise visits in several parts of the city on Wednesday. At Ideal Colony, the civic chief found that the quantity of tar used for road construction was less compared to the prescribed quantity in the rule-book.

“I have suspended him (Nagargoje) for causing economic loss to the KMC. The poor quality of road construction has caused anger among citizens. Such acts damage the reputation of the civic body. I have appointed two senior officials to carry out further inquiry into the quality of the road construction taking place at other places,” Kalshetti said.

In the suspension order, Kalshetti said that during the termination period Nagargoje will not be allowed to take any other duty and has to register his attendance every day at the city engineer’s office.

Hemant Jadhav, JE with the town planning department, was found involved in wrong measurement of the layout and approval of faulty transfer development rights (TDR) to the developers of the property located at Ujlaiwadi.

Kalshetti said that prima facie Jadhav is involved in the irregularities. Deputy city engineer Harshjit Ghatge has been appointed to carry out further investigation into such cases.

According to a civic officials, faulty surveying and TDR is done to benefit the developer which subsequently leads to loss to the KMC. The TDR is the certificate of right provided to the developer in lieu with the land handed over to the KMC. With TDR, the developer can carry out construction at other place or can sell it to another developer.

Since last week, Kalshetti is taking the civic staff to task for poor performance and irregularities. Recently, he issued a show-cause notice and salary cut to over 200 employees for arriving late at work.

VADODARA: Southpaw Rajveer Jadhav ’s unbeaten 130 runs and leg-spinner Patel Jeet’s five wicket haul helped Shreyas School to record a massive victory over Vibgyor School on the second day of the Maharani Shantadevi U-19 Inter School One Day Tournament held at VCA grounds on Wednesday.

Shreyas School won the toss and elected to bat first, but suffered major jolts when the school lost their opening pairs early with just 14 runs on the board. But with a record partnership between Rushikesh Uttekar and Rajveer Jadhav of 184 runs in 182 balls the match took a sudden turn. Vibgyor fielders missed the opportunity as they dropped Rushikesh when he was only on 10, which proved to be very costly. The duo troubled the bowlers, as they batted for 30 overs, striking the ball to perfection all across the ground.

Rudra Mayur of Vibgyor finally broke the partnership, by taking the wicket of Rushikesh at 75, with the scoreline reading at 198 in 34.3 overs. With the team well settled, Adnan Shaikh accelerated the run rate at the end of the inning, scoring a quick fire 32 of 13 balls proved to be a good support for Rajveer, who remained not out at 130 in 111 balls.

Vibgyor boys started 267 run chase on a good note, scoring 46 in 8 overs. But a wicket by Vishwajeet Patil on 9th over changed the script of the match. The rest of the batsmen could not accelerate the run rate for Vibgyor.

Rajveer was adjudged the man of the match for his class batting.

Thiruvananthapuram: Within two weeks of his induction into the Government Railway Police, Jack, the sniffer dog specialized in narcotics, has garnered much attention.

On Wednesday, when the police was conducting a random search at the Thiruvananthapuram Central railway station, Jack identified a bag filled with ganja , which led to the arrest of Abhiraj (22), who was seated inside the waiting room in the first platform.

Abhiraj a resident of Pachalloor had arrived at the railway station from Visakhapatnam and was waiting for his aid to hand over the ganja he was carrying with him. Though the police could not catch hold of the person who aided Abhiraj, they could recover 16.3kg ganja, which was stuffed inside two travel bags.

“We believe this is an organized racket at work,” said Suresh Kumar, station house officer, railway police station, Thiruvananthapuram.

Jack completed a nine-month training at the state training academy, Thrissur, along with his handlers Sajin Raj and Sandeep SV before joining the Government Railway Police on January 26. He also became the first sniffer dog to join the railway police in Thiruvananthapuram and second in the state.

“Based on inputs about use of ganja becoming rampant amongst schools and college students, for the past few days we have intensified search operations at the railway stations and today’s catch was a result of this alertness. It is believed that 90% of ganja comes into the state from Andhra Pradesh–Odisha border,” said Manjunath H, Railway SP.

With the allocation of a sniffer dog dedicated to the railway police, they hope to crack down the drug mafia in the coming days.

Thiruvananthapuram: To reduce the impact of floods in the state, the government has conducted the feasibility study on constructing three new dams with higher capacity. Peringalkuthu upstream, twin Kallar and Pooyamkutty are the three projects on which the KSEB has conducted the feasibility study, said power minister M M Mani in the assembly.

Based on central water commission’s finding that there is a need for dams with higher capacity to reduce impact of floods, the state government decided to conduct the feasibility study. “These three dams were under state government’s consideration earlier. Hence it was decided to conduct the feasibility study once again in the wake of consecutive floods,” said the minister.

In the first phase, the government is planning to begin the survey process of Peringalkuthu upstream project, for which forest department’s permission is required. Already the forest department has been approached for this.

The minister assured that the new dams will be constructed only with minimum environmental impact. All the directions from the Union environment ministry will be followed during the construction of the dams.

Earlier, the state government planned to explore the possibility of constructing five new dams in the state. However, it has been decided to go ahead with the three projects now. According to the Central Water Commission report, dams had reduced the impact of flood in the state.

Besides flood water regulation, the upcoming dams aim for hydroelectricity power production. The new Peringalkuthu dam is planned to be built between the existing Sholayar and Peringalkuthu dams with a water capacity of 200 million cubic meter and 40MWhydroelectric power production.

CLEARED SKHER

Kolhapur: The Kolhapur Municipal Corporation ( KMC ) is going to spend Rs 7.51 crore for the e-governance system that would offer hassle-free civic services to the citizens.

A firm from Pune, Monarch Technologies, has been selected for the project. The earlier project was launched ten years ago, however it did not have a smooth run. To overcome all the hiccups, a completely new set-up will be developed. This involves setting up of a data centre, developing softwares to run the civic services from bill payments to internal digitisation.

A senior KMC official, requesting anonymity, said, “After a long wait, the tender of the Pune firm has been accepted. The work order will be given in next few days. The work of the new set-up and updating the existing work-flow will start.”

Civic officials said they were also going to include new services, especially those related to the property tax department and town planning department. Eventually, all the departments will be brought under e-governance system.

“This will reduce the work load on the existing citizen facilitation centres. All services will be brought online. We have studied the e-governance systems of other civic bodies, especially Pune,” an official said.

A few years ago, the KMC started the system work flow that granted access to officials to check the daily revenue collections and the stages of file movements pertaining to some departments. The officials claim that various services started such as issuing of certificates, paying the tax, applying for licenses are not properly working and the citizens are made to visit the offices frequently and get their applications processed manually.

The state government has passed a law making it mandatory for officers to clear the applications within certain period of time. “We receive several complaints against the officials. Also, there are issues related to missing files. All these concerns will be addressed and the officials will not be under pressure. We are soon going to recruit new technical staff to run the system and develop the softwares of our need,” said the official.

Repalle TDP MLA Anagani Satya Prasad on Wednesday wrote to the AP chief minister objecting to the treason charges levelled against Rao. He was suspended in connection with alleged irregularities in the purchase of security equipment from Israel.

Satya Prasad said: “The chief minister has been harassing IAS and IPS officers in the last nine months. Former chief secretary LV Prasad was removed from the post. The chief minister is now harassing a senior IPS officer by placing him under suspension and filing treason charges.”

In the letter, the MLA said a recent GO denying payment of wages to policemen who are on vacancy reserve was causing disquiet among cops. “Policemen who are discharging their duties and leaving behind their families to maintain law and order are demoralised with the recent GO... The decision of the government indicates a clear grudge against government employees,” he wrote.

The MLA sought to know as to how the government could justify placing 58 DSPs, over a 100 circle inspectors and 10 additional superintendents under vacancy reserve (VR) and issue a GO stalling their wages if they were on VR for more than three months.

Bareilly: A salesman at a petrol pump in Meerut fought his way to marry the girl of his choice in Bareilly. Both families bowed to the wishes of the lovebirds and they got married on Monday. On his way home along with his bride and brother on Tuesday, he mysteriously disappeared from a roadside dhaba, where they had halted for refreshment, only to be found hanging from a tree two kilometres away. Police said Dushyant Giri (22) committed suicide.

Station house officer (SHO) of Pakbada police station inspector Surendra Pal Singh told TOI, “When we were sending the body for an autopsy, Giri’s family members told us that they didn’t want any further action, including the postmortem. But, following the standard procedure, we sent the body to a mortuary for an autopsy. The evidence collected from the spot suggests that it was a case of suicide.”

A native of Kuandali village under Saidnagali police station limits in Amroha district, Dushyant tied the knot with his girlfriend Asha, 20, on Monday. On Tuesday, Dushyant was on his way home along with his bride, brother and two photographers in a car, when they halted at a roadside dhaba for refreshment in the afternoon, said police.

However, people accompanying the couple found, Dushyant missing from the dhaba all of sudden. After his brother and others failed to trace him, they informed police and sent the bride back to her parent’s house in Bareilly.

During the search operation, police found Giri hanging from a tree in a field in Pakbada area, around two kilometres from the highway.

The SHO said during the investigation, they came to know that it was a love-cum-arrange marriage in the same caste, which the couple, especially Dushyant, made possible by convincing their parents with great difficulty.

Dushyant’s brother Shivyant said, “Around 1pm, we halted at a roadside dhaba, where Dushyant ordered tea, but he disappeared all of sudden. We tried to search him out, but in vain. Then we informed police and left for home. Later, police informed us over the phone that they found Dushyant’s body hanging from a tree.”

“Dushyant’s bride and both families are shocked and clueless as to what made Dushyant take such a drastic step,” added Shivyant.

Meanwhile, Moradabad superintendent of police (city) Amit Kumar Anand said the postmortem report confirmed it to be the death by hanging.

Kollam: Abdul Gafoor (63) was killed in an accidnet at Ayathil around 3.20pm on Kollam Bypass on Wednesday when a truck hit his scooter and ran over him.

The Peroor resident died on the spot after the truck transporting fish ran over his head.

The truck, which lost control, also plowed into a Maruti Alto car. Kilikolloor police, which rushed to the spot, shifted the body to the district hospital mortuary for autopsy.

The body will be buried at the Kizhakke Peroor Muslim Jamaat burial ground by 12pm on Thursday.

Gafoor leaves behind wife Laila Beevi, children Habeebulla AG (civil police officer, SAP, Thiruvananthapuram), Ameer Hamasa AG and Hashim AG (member, AIYF mandalam committee). Kilikolloor police arrested truck driver Dhanoop, who is a residnet of Ernakulam.

Kollam bypass stretch from Kureepuzha to Kallumthazham is an accident-prone area. Since its inauguration in January 2019, several lives have been lost along the stretch. More than 50 byroads join the 13km bypass connecting Mevaram and Kavanad.

Though there are markings at points where major byroads join the bypass, at some points there are not enough indicators and sudden entry of vehicles from byroads confuse speeding passengers on the main road, leading to accidents.

District administration and road safety authority had launched several measures to control road accidents on this stretch; those measures were only partly successful.

Thiruvananthapuram: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Wednesday said graft allegations raised by Congress legislator P T Thomas against state police chief Loknath Behera were baseless.

Thomas on Tuesday alleged large scale corruption in the purchase of vehicles and electronic equipment in the police department and demanded the government to order a CBI inquiry.

“The state government takes steps for the modernization of police force. It’s natural that computers, cameras and vehicles are purchased as part of this. Crime and criminal tracking network system was purchased with the approval of state empowered committee. Purchases were carried out via central procurement (CPRC) and contract system and government e-marketing(GeM). CCTVs were purchased through open tender,” Pinarayi said.

Chief minister said there was no truth in the allegations that funds allocated for security related expenditure in Naxal-hit areas was diverted for building bungalows for senior police officials. “What I have to say is that the allegations raised by Thomas are baseless. You all know what the procedure takes places on the CAG reports. It would take its own natural course,” he said.

217,['13/02/2020'],Docs flee paltry salary at teaching hosps as govt plans more colleges,"This story is from February 13, 2020

Amaravati: Young doctors in the state no longer seem inclined to teach at government healthcare institutions.

Getting an opportunity to work in a teaching hospital used to be considered a privilege in the past. However, changed economic priorities and poor services in the government sector coupled with attractive pays offered by private hospitals are weaning doctors away.

More than 1,100 posts for doctors in teaching hospitals have been vacant for the past several years.

Sources said salaries of doctors in teaching hospitals are among the lowest in the country. The issue of salaries has come to the fore, particularly, in the wake of the state government’s determination to revamp the entire public healthcare facility under Nadu-Nedu. Surprisingly, specialists with double post-graduation degrees are working in teaching hospitals with lesser salaries than graduate doctors working at Primary Health Centres (PHCs). In fact, the specialists are getting salaries nearly equal to the stipend being drawn by PG students.

“Low salaries is one of the significant reasons for doctors not being keen on joining government service, especially those with super-specialty degrees like cardiology, gastroenterology, neurology, neurosurgery, and oncology,” observed a senior professor in Government Medical College (GMC), Vijayawada. He said it is, in fact, a disservice to the public health as the government is spending a large amount of money on PG students to help them continue their studies. But these same students end up joining private institutions owing to the poor salaries in teaching hospitals.

Meanwhile, most of the young super-specialist doctors are either joining corporate hospitals or setting up their own private practice which is lucrative.

The salaries of junior-most doctors working in central teaching medical colleges is believed to be around Rs 3-4 lakh per month, which is nearly five times what a doctor working in a teaching medical college in Andhra Pradesh receives.

In fact, many state governments are also offering better pays than AP, said Jayadheer, Government Doctors’ Association president. He said they have been knocking on every door in the government for the past seven months to get the issue resolved.

“A professor in super-specialty department with nearly two decades of experience is getting a salary similar to that a technician or a physiotherapist receives in central medical institutions,” fumed a senior professor.

Speaking on the same lines, a retired principal told TOI that the issue of salaries should be addressed before taking any step to create more medical colleges in the state. “Who will be interested to serve in these colleges when they are offered 2006 pay scales in 2020?” he asked.

Visakhapatnam: Vexed with the long-continuing apathy of the state, tribal residents of nine, remote, uphill hamlets in Ananthagiri mandal of Visakha agency took it upon themselves to lay a road . In the last three weeks, a team of hundred workers have taken turns to lay a seven kilometer mud-track.

Cut-off from the nearest panchayat headquarters by almost 15 kms, 1,500 tribals living in nine hamlets had no other choice but to lay the road themselves. They took up the work on January 23.

Speaking to TOI, K Govinda Rao, district governing body member CPI (M) and a local said, “The tribals have been waiting for a connecting hilltop road since 2011. They were granted roads under the NREGS scheme, both in 2011 and later in 2018-2019, however, the contractors were unwilling to take up the road connectivity project.” Govinda Rao further added that in 2018-2019 the grant was for Rs 40 lakh.

Shedding light on the people and their lives on hill top, Govinda Rao said, “There are 1,500 inhabitants, 250 families and nine hamlets. All these people have no access to electricity and medical services. There have been many cases of pregnant women being carried down to the nearest health centre in a doli , in-fact it happens on an annual basis. Forced by their plight they took up the job on their own.”

But the initiative was first taken up by four youths. “ Four of us took upon ourselves to motivate the residents of all the nine hamlets. We are happy that our efforts are finally paying off,” said, Paduvula Buchanna, one of the four youngsters.

Speaking to TOI, the project officer for Integrated Tribal Development Agency, D K Balaji said the project will be brought under NREGS and the tribals involved in the work would be paid for their labour.

221,['13/02/2020'],Civic body faces space crunch for keeping abandoned vehicles,"This story is from February 13, 2020

Kolhapur: The Kolhapur Municipal Corporation’s ( KMC ) drive to remove roadside abandoned vehicles has been halted for last several months, the reason being that the municipal corporation does not have enough space to dump the confiscated vehicles.

Last year, the municipal corporation had seized around 80 four-wheelers lying abandoned in the city. These vehicles were taken to the Buddh Garden workshop of the Kolhapur Municipal Transport (KMT).

The action was taken after the civic officials were informed about the same by the regional transport office (RTO). Following the confiscation, they wrote to the vehicle owners to get their vehicles back by paying Rs 1,000 fine for three-wheelers, Rs 1,500 for four-wheelers and Rs 5,000 for heavy vehicles. The fine amount was further reduced to half and subjected to negotiation to ensure that the owners approach the civic officials immediately.

However, very few owners turned up to stake claim on their vehicles, said civic officials, adding that over 50 vehicles are still lying at the workshop.

A senior KMC official, on the condition of anonymity, said, “There are over 2,000 vehicles lying abandoned on city streets. We have shifted some of them to nearby open spaces; however, still many are still lying on the roads, causing traffic jams. We have no space left at the KMT workshop for keeping these abandoned vehicles. We have approached the RTO to get the sanction for scrapping these vehicles. Once we get the permission we will immediately start the scrapping vehicles and selling the scrap.”

The officials also claim that the expenses to tow the abandoned vehicles to the KMT workshop is more than what they will get after selling scrap. According to civic officials, the private towing vans charge Rs 2,000 per day. Also, it requires two staff members to operate it.

“We had fixed fine amount considering all these expenses. We are also thinking of other alternatives to reduce the cost. One of them is to scrap the vehicle on the spot. We are going to check for more options that might have been acted upon by other civic bodies,” said the official.

Thiruvananthapuram: Opposition staged a walkout on Wednesday alleging police laxity in controlling violence against women and children, while citing a huge increase in Pocso cases and those related to domestic violence and rape over the past three years.

The opposition also demanded handing over the Walayar case, related to the alleged rape and murder of two minor girls, to CBI. “Why is CM reluctant to give the case to CBI? Why is he demanding an appeal by the family before the court for such a probe?” asked opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala before the walkout.

Replying to the notice issued by UDF MLA Shanimol Osman seeking leave for an adjournment motion on the ‘rising atrocities against women and children’, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan and women and child development minister K K Shailaja said that the number of cases were increasing due to awareness among public to lodge complaints ‘unlike other states’.

Besides pointing out the lapses in Walayar case, the MLA criticized the women’s commission for inaction, and the CM replied that the member was jealous over the exemplary way in which WC is functioning at present.

Asserting that police teams, investigating cases involving atrocities against women and children, were going in the right direction, Vijayan said six appeals by the government against the trial court’s verdict which acquitted the accused in Walayar case, were pending before the high court. “The government has also appointed retired district judge PK Haneefa as the judicial commission to probe the case,” he said.

“The government will not oppose in court any demand by the victims’ parents for CBI inquiry or any other kind of investigation and it has already been communicated to the family,” he said.

Dehradun: The Dehradun branch of Punjab National Bank (PNB) has initiated recovery proceedings of over Rs 21 crore loan taken by promoter of private club World Integrity Centre (WIC) Sachin Upadhyay and his wife Nazia Yusuf Izuddin.

According to bank officials, Upadhyay, the younger brother of former Congress state president Kishore Upadhyay, along with his wife had applied for a loan to develop an upscale housing project in Dehradun which never took off. The loan was given to S and N lifestyle Infraventure Private Limited, pomoted by the Upadhyayswhich had applied for the loan in 2017. Speaking with TOI, bank manager Deepak Shukla said, “The loan was given after checking all records and following all norms. The question of repayment has been raised in the past but no satisfactory answer has been received which forced us to start recovery proceedings.”

He added, “We have alerted our senior officials in Delhi about the project’s status and the fact that the company is not paying the installment. Our teams have visited the site of the project and there is no sign of construction.” TOI tried to contact Sachin Upadhyay as well as Nazia Izuddin but they were not reachable for a comment even after repeated efforts.

To recall, Sachin Upadhyay was implicated in a cheque-bounce case last month and was granted bail recently.

PUNE: The Sadhu Vaswani Bridge on Koregaon Park Road spanning the stretch from St Mira’s College to the Seafearers’ Memorial roundabout has been declared fragile and unfit for heavy vehicles .The Pune Municipal Corporation, after a structural audit, has said the bridge is out-of-bounds for heavy vehicles,Acting upon this report, the Pune traffic department banned such vehicles from using the bridge after the civic body installed height barriers to stop such entry.However, defiant heavy vehicle drivers have broken down the barriers at least twice in about a month and these vehicles continue to ply on the bridge.Structural audits are expected to observe cracks, surface deteriorations in the sub-structure and provide as accurate assessment which can help the PMC maintain the bridges.Residents said strict enforcement of the ban was necessary to avoid any mishaps. The PMC had closed the bridge for about a month for repairs in 2004 after a slab fell.A senior civic official said they have deployed measures to stop heavy vehicles. “But some miscreants have broken them twice. A decision to set up permanent barriers will be taken after corporators approve a stronger structure,” he added.Arman Jagwani, a resident of Koregaon Park, said the bridge should have been banned for heavy vehicles long ago as it is old and in a dangerous state.“Anyone travelling over the bridge can sense it has weakened,” he added.Vineeta Ajani, another regular user of this bridge, said, “A misinformed social media message created a bit of a panic among residents and regular users of this bridge on Wednesday. Very frequently, heavy vehicles are seen plying on this bridge despite the presence of traffic cops. As a commuter, I feel that if the bridge is unsafe, necessary steps should be taken to strengthen it and ensure the safety of citizens.”Local corporator Umesh Gaikwad said at a meeting with PMC officials and traffic department, the decision to set up barriers was approved in-principle.“The funds can be made available at the ward level and a permanent structure can be constructed. But it needs to be protected. Previously, such arresters were built, but they were damaged,” he added.One side of the bridge is under the jurisdiction of the Pune Cantonment Board. The barriers are to be built on that side too, he said. Only fitting barriers on one side under the PMC’s jurisdiction is not proving effective, as entry of heavy vehicles cannot be prevented from the cantonment side too, Gaikwad added.A senior traffic police officer said the condition of the bridge was delicate and allowing heavy vehicles on the bridge may prove dangerous.“After receiving a report from the civic officials, we haven’t allowed heavy vehicles on the bridge for the last two months. Now, the traffic police have deployed four constables round-the-clock to divert heavy vehicles to alternate roads,” the officer added.Similarly, PMPML buses heading towards Koregaon Park or Bund Garden from Hadapsar, Swargate, and Wanowrie areas, have also been diverted from the other bridges, he said.The city has several old bridges but their building plans are not available. The civic body, in 2017, put the bridges into two categories. Bridges constructed before 1952 fell were heritage and those built after 1952.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74108941,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-958513,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/free-run-for-heavy-vehicles-tankers-on-unsafe-koregaon-park-rd-bridge/articleshow/74107944.cms

Representative image

TRICHY: A survey by a group of NGOs led by Campaign for Ending Girl Child Marriages in Tamil Nadu (CECM-TN) has exposed the unending ordeal the minor girls are going through in terms of physical and mental health.

The survey was conducted with the help of a mobile application CECM-TN in rural and urban areas in Coimbatore, Tirupur, Karur, Erode and Karur in June 2019. A total of 297 victims (in the age group of 13-17) of child marriage shared details about their ‘married life’ with the field workers.

Health issues and sexual violence plagued the lives of 89% victims. ""Most of them are infected with sexually transmitted diseases (STD) caused by multiple sexual behaviours of their partners. In many cases, the minor girls were sexually abused by in-laws when their husbands were away,"" said director of Health and Education Alternative Development Study (HEALDS), Namakkal, M S A Satish Babu.

The study also revealed the physical violence meted out by the in-laws against the victim girls in several cases. Babu recalled a story of a child marriage victim who was subjected to sexual abuse by in-laws that even her mother convinced her to adjust with the situation instead of returning to the maternal house in order to avoid complications to the lives of her siblings.

Convener of central zone NGO coalition K Govindan made shocking revelations about the child marriage victims being forced into unnatural sex either by husband or in-laws. ""Our field visit showed a few of the victims having oral infections and even cervical cancer,"" he said.

The study revealed that the health condition of the 88% of the victims deteriorated after their marriage and 85% of the victims had not faced any violence before marriage.

The study handpicked a few communities, which are infamous for child marriages in Kongu belt and other areas of the five districts. Despite facing such hardships, child marriage victims hardly opt for divorce. According to the study, the rate of divorce in child marriage cases stood at 6% only. ""It’s an irony that such affected girls and women are not ready to break away from the marriage life due to the compulsion of upholding the customs of their particular community and religion,"" said Govindan.

Child marriage also takes its toll on the young mother and the baby born to her as majority of them face health issues during pregnancy.

Vijayawada: Thousands of tribals gathered in the Agency town of Paderu in Visakhapatnam, on Wednesday for a public meeting to demand that constitutional provisions and legislations for protection of Adivasi rights be implemented in its true spirit.

Tribals from 11 mandals of the agency area of Visakhapatnamas as well as from East and West Godavari, Srikakulam and Vizianagaram districts assembled at the Junior College grounds in Paderu for the Adivasi Atmagaurava Sabha.

The Joint Action Committee for protection of rights of Adivasis (JAC) demanded that the land held by non-adivasis as properties and business establishments in contravention of the Land Transfer Act be reverted to the Adivasis.

The flashpoint of the protests was the reservation of seats in the upcoming local body elections for non-Adivasi communities. JAC first protested earlier in January against the same and obtained a stay from the High Court.The movement has been gaining momentum and the JAC plans to take it forward with awareness campaigns and further protests.

The JAC also raised concerns about the increasing number of tourist establishments owned by non-locals in the Araku Valley. They alleged that their presence is destroying the pristine environment and culture in the valley, creating an unsafe environment for the women, and are intrusive to their privacy, according to a press statement released by the JAC.

Among other major demands put forth by them are, detection and deletion of illegally-held ST certificates in the region, removal of non-Adivasis holding jobs reserved for Adivasis.

Speaking at the meeting, Ramarao Dora, convenor of JAC said, “Land and resource grab in the Fifth Schedule region by the non-Adivasis has increased over the past decade. Despite protective legislation like 1 of 70 and PESA, little has been done to protect our rights.”

“Tourism is becoming a nuisance for us. Not only that, Adivasis only get daily wage jobs or the lower rung employment at these establishments whereas the non-Adivasis make profits out of it by holding it under benami,” he added.

Dora said that the JAC would wait for 15 days for the government to resolve the issues raised by the Adivasis, after which the JAC would decide its next course of action.

The fire started on the second floor of the block at Kothi Palace at around 1 am and soon spread across the room filled with a huge stock of paper, sub-divisional magistrate RP Tiwari said.

“Old records of the divisional commissioner’s office were destroyed in the fire. The cause of the fire is not known, but chances of arson can’t be ruled out. Police are investigating the matter,” he said.

The first information of the fire was received by the police control room, following which the fire brigade sprung into action. The fire was doused after nearly four hours of toil.

“Six water tankers made 10 trips to the site and used 50,000 l water to douse the flames,” fire officer Ajay Singh Rajput told TOI adding that most of the files stored in the record room were lost – both in the fire and water used to douse it.

Sources said the documents were of four decades from 1960 and contained information about revenue related matters.

The Kothi Palace, where the administrative block is situated, is a 125-year-old building. The record room was kept locked. Firefighters found that the doors were completely destroyed and the locks were broken, indicating forced entry.

ASP Rupesh Dwivedi said Madhav Nagar police station has registered a case of fire. “We are also exploring the arson angle. A forensic team was on the spot to probe the matter,” he said.

239,['13/02/2020'],Women’s quota: Goverment assures HC of redress,"This story is from February 13, 2020

Photo for representative purpose only

AHMEDABAD: The state government on Wednesday assured the Gujarat high court that it will issue a circular on Thursday to redress the grievances of Lok Rakshak Dal (LRD) candidates who have been agitating and petitioning against the method adopted in implementing women reservation .

The government’s assurance came on the day when women candidates from both reserved and unreserved categories approached the high court – the former questioning the manner in which general category list was declared in January and the latter in support of it.

The advocate general made the statement about the government willing to come out with the circular during the hearing of a petition filed by 155 women candidates, who belong to the scheduled caste (SC), scheduled tribe (ST) and the socially and educationally backward classes (SEBC). These candidates have challenged the government and Lok Rakshak Bharti Board’s decision to come out on November 30, 2019 with a select list of general category women candidates in which meritorious those from reserved categories did not get any mention and hence they did not get a call.

These reserved category candidates have claimed that if the government followed proper procedure to implement quota policy and included names of meritorious candidates of reserved categories in the general category list, they would have been selected for the job.

The reserved category women candidates have also questioned the provisions of a government resolution issued on August 1, 2018 in which clause 12 states that if any female candidate belonging to any reserved category is selected on her own merits, she would be treated as general category candidate for the purpose of roster that is vertical. However, they would be considered as female representatives of that particular category by applying the horizontal roster or representative reservation in the register of women's reservation.

After the government assured the court that it would come up with a solution to the question raised by the reserved category candidates, the high court posted further hearing on February 18.

On the other hand, as many as 254 women candidates from general category moved the high court on Wednesday in support of the government’s gesture. They have expressed apprehension that the government may make changes in the August 1, 2018 GR and sought the HC direction not to amend it or implement it. If amended, it should be done with retrospective effect.

240,['13/02/2020'],Maoist involved in Araku legislators’ killing surrenders,"This story is from February 13, 2020

Koraput (Odisha): A Maoist carrying a cash reward of Rs 4 lakh on his head surrendered before the police in Malkangiri district of Odisha on Wednesday. The 30-year-old Maoist, Jipro Habika, hails from Khajaguda village under Narayanpatna police limits. He joined the Maoist organisation in 2012.

Habika was wanted for his involvement in the killing of TDP leader and then Araku MLA Kidari Sarveswara Rao and former legislator Siveri Soma at Dungiguda near Araku valley on September 24, 2018. The attack took place in Thutangi village in Visakhapatnam district’s Dumbriguda mandal. Rao was believed to have been on the Maoist hit-list and had received threats from Maoists in the past. A group of about 50-60 outlaws were involved in the deadly attack. Rao was elected from Araku on a YSRC ticket in the 2014 elections, defeating the TDP’s Soma. In 2016, he switched loyalties to TDP.

Police sources said Habika was also wanted for his alleged involvement in several Maoist offensives, exchange of fire and blasting of vehicles, among others. Till his surrender , Habika was an area committee member of Malkangiri-Koraput-Visakhapatnam border (MKVB) division of Andhra-Odisha border special zonal committee (AOBSZC) of the banned outfit and was active at Swabhiman Anchal in Malkangiri district.

“I had joined the Maoists because I was drawn towards their ideology. But now I have realised that the rebels do nothing for development of tribals,” said Habika. He also said the Maoists are using innocent tribals for their own benefit. “After getting their work done, they target tribals on false charges of being police informers and kill them. The Maoists are mostly involved in extortion and the cadres are being ill-treated at the camp. Also, the extensive operations in Swabhiman Anchal by security personnel in recent times has made life miserable in the forest,” he added.

Malkangiri SP Hrisikesh Khilari said Habika will be rehabilitated as per the prevailing surrender policy of the state government and will be given vocational training.

242,['13/02/2020'],Government caught on sticky wicket over new reservation roster for direct recruitment,"This story is from February 13, 2020

Trivendra Singh Rawat

DEHRADUN: The issue of new reservation roster in direct recruitment has left the Trivendra Singh Rawat government in a piquant situation. With both sides—the SC/ST employee association and General-OBC employee association— at loggerheads, taking a call on the issue is likely to prove extremely tough for the BJP government.

Under the new reservation system, the first five places in the roster were kept for candidates of general category while the sixth position was kept for the SC candidates. In the earlier pattern, the first position was allotted to SC candidates.

However, the new roster system has met with a strong response from the SC/ST employee unions who argued that their candidates cannot apply in any government departments that seek to employ five people or less.

“We have made it clear that the SC post should be kept on the first rank on the reservation roster. We will not compromise on the issue, as it is linked with the future generations of SC candidates,” Karam Ram, the state president of SC/ST Employees Federation said.

On the other side, state president of Genral-OBC Employees Association Deepak Joshi has warned of protests if any change is made in the new recruitment roster.

Taking note on the issue, the CM had constituted a three minister sub-committee headed by urban development minister Madan Kaushik, which had BJP MLA from Narendra Nagar , Subodh Uniyal, and state minister Rekha Arya as members.

However, Arya, who represents a reserved constituency, Someshwar, is not pleased with the change and has asked the government to include a retired IAS officer in the committee, a source said.

Denying differences, minister Kaushik said, “I had invited both sides on Tuesday to listen to their stand. Rekha Arya will be present in the next meeting of the sub-committee, and after taking the views from all sides, we will forward our report to the government.

Visakhapatnam: Ranked ninth among the best-performing smart cities under the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA)’ Smart Cities Mission, Vizag city will pair up with Diu Smart City Limited to guide the latter in implementing projects under the Mission.

MoHUA has in an advisory asked the 20 best-performing cities to team up with the bottom 20 cities. The paired cities will work as ‘sister cities’ and enter into a memorandum of understanding (MoU) before February 20. The top 20 performers will help the sister cities in project implementation and improving performance in a 100-day challenge. The partnership will also facilitate visits of a delegation from Diu to the Port City to learn best practices, while Vizag will help Diu in preparing project reports.

Statistics presented at a two-day Smart Cities CEOs conference in Visakhapatnam on January 24 and 25 show that Diu has till date utilised Rs 2 crore out of the Rs 110 crore sanctioned by the Union government.

Terrain, geological conditions and other features of a city were taken into consideration while pairing smart cities. Capital cities, for example, have been paired with another capital city while coastal cities have been linked to another coastal city and tourist/health/religious destinations linked among each other. Varanasi has been paired with Amritsar, Agra with Puducherry, Bhopal with Aizawl and Nagpur with Port Blair.

Speaking to TOI, an official under the Vizag smart city project said they have received the advisory from MoHUA, “but we can take it forward only after discussing the advisory with officials of the state department of municipal administration and urban development.”

The Greater Visakhapatnam Smart City Corporation Limited (GVSCCL)— a special purpose vehicle floated by the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) to execute smart city projects in the city — has proposed projects worth Rs 1,050 crore. The Union government will provide annual financial assistance of Rs 100 crore for five years for the urban renewal and retrofitting programme, while the state government will release a corresponding sum of Rs 500 crore. Other projects will be undertaken through the public-private partnership mode.

Lover Ajay Nadia

AHMEDABAD: A transgender woman named Mamta was stabbed to death by her lover Ajay Nadia , 30, of Sardarnagar , on Tuesday late night. Fearing that the killing may trigger a war between groups of transgenders, if the accused was a transgender too, senior cops rushed to the spot. But during primary investigation it became clear that the Nadia had killed her.

Hemant Patel, inspector of Sardarnagar police station said that within hours of the incident they nabbed Nadia, who was also injured and admitted in a hospital. “We suspect there were two accused. We will identify the second accused as soon as Nadia is discharged,” Patel said.

Patel added that Nadia and Mamta had been living together for some time. “They were in love and Nadia had also tattooed the Mamta’s name on his forearm. However, after some time Mamta came to know that Nadia is also in love with a woman. This triggered frequent fights between Nadia and Mamta,” Patel said.

Police officials said during interrogation it came to light that Nadia used to take money from Mamta and spend it to woo the woman. This enraged Mamta.

“On Tuesday night Mamta had a fight with Nadia on the same issue. Nadia lost his temper and stabbed Mamta several times, killing Mamta on the spot. We have sent the body for postmortem,” Patel said.

(Puliyur) Ramanathapuram: M R Mohamed Rilwan, the councillor of Ward No 10 in Tiruvadanai panchayat union in Ramanathapuram district, has petitioned public health department officials in the southern coastal district to conduct a health checkup in Vellayapuram and Kattivayal as many from these villages had returned from China.

Puliyur, Vellayapuram and Kattivayal in Tiruvadanai are among the major pockets from where many men work as ‘Indu Sui Bing’ – Indian Fly Bread, locally known as stuffed parotta – masters in the eateries in China. ""I requested a checkup as the deadly nCoV outbreak has claimed hundreds of lives and also left thousands infected in China,"" he told TOI.

The health officials said that they are monitoring nearly 120 people from the locality who have returned from China. These ‘Indu Sui Bing’ masters from Ramanathapuram, Sivaganga and Pudukottai districts are waiting for the hotels in China to reopen after nCoV.

Unlike India where it is the main course, multi flavoured ‘Indu Sui Bing’ is served as a desert shared by a group. The delicacy that weighs about 150g is priced at Rs 200 apiece when stuffed with a variety of fruit such as banana, pineapple or flavoured spreads like peanut butter and vegetables. Non-veg verities are stuffed with sardine, chicken, mutton, beef and pork is priced at `250.

""We make around 20 to 30 such Sui Bing a day,"" says Umamani Kalingarathinam, 45, of Puliyur who is making it since 2003. Chinese were fascinated seeing the masters from Tamil Nadu toss the dough high up in the air and spread it to three foot in diameter. Cut into 12 to 16 pieces, it is served like cookies as a delicious desert after their sumptuous Chinese meal.

Working hours of expert Sui bing masters are less than seven hours a day. A typical day begins around 10.30 am and goes on till 1.30 to 2 pm and resumes around 5 pm and goes on till 9 pm. On an average they make Rs 40,000 to Rs 50,000 a month.

Some get it as salary or as 50% share in profit from the restaurant owner who provides space on the road facing side of the hotel to attract customers by tossing the dough in the air. ""The person who is referring a fresher there signs a bond with the Chinese employer and gets Rs 5,000 a month for a labourer. I have referred 10 people,"" said a master.

Umamani, Venkatesh, Thirunavukarasu, Perumal and Rajaram are among the many from Puliyur who are regularly in touch with their Chinese employers through social messenger ‘We Chat’.

Labourers here express concern over nCoV in China and advise employers and their families to stay safe. Employers on the other hand are waiting to book tickets for their ‘Indu Sui Bing’ masters to return to China after the virus is brought under control.

Madurai: The state government has been directed to file a counter within two weeks on a plea moved by a woman who sought compensation and action against nurses and doctor of the Uchipuli primary health centre (PHC) in Ramanathapuram district for leaving behind a broken needle in her body after childbirth.

In her petition before the Madras high cour, Ramya, 22, a resident of Ramanathapuram district, stated that she gave birth to female child through normal delivery at the Uchipuli PHC on November 19, 2019. The delivery was performed by the nurses as the doctors were not present. Since she suffered from a minor complication named episiotomy (surgical incision through vaginal wall during childbirth) due to which she was bleeding even after she was shifted to the ward.

She stated that when she was referred to the government hospital at Ramanathapuram, doctors there noticed a broken needle inside her body after taking an x-ray. The needle was left inside her body after stitching her incision. She was immediately referred to the Government Rajaji Hospital in Madurai district where the doctors removed the needle by performing a surgery on November 21.

Due to the negligent act of the nurses and doctor of the Uchipuli PHC, she was put to great hardship physically and mentally after her childbirth. Hence, the petitioner moved the high court Madurai bench. When the case was taken up for hearing on Wednesday, justice Pushpa Sathyanarayana gave the direction to the state government. TNN

252,['13/02/2020'],"Telangana: With 4 contenders, BJP begins final process for appointing state chief","This story is from February 13, 2020

HYDERABAD: With BJP gearing up for the next round of opinion taking process for a new chief of its state unit, the recent change of guard at the national level may influence the final decision. Highly placed sources in BJP told TOI that present state chief K Laxman’s goodwill with Union home minister Amit Shah could have earned him another term had the latter remained the party’s national president.

With JP Nadda taking over reins of the party at national level, he might not be averse to giving a chance to new face in the state. Though there are four main contenders — Laxman, DK Aruna, N Ramachander Rao and BJP national secretary Muralidhar Rao — the competition is between former Congress minister DK Aruna, who joined BJP few months ago, and Laxman.

Reportedly, both Ramachander Rao and Muralidhar Rao are not actively lobbying for the post but are open to take up the role if the party gives them the post. Party leaders say Nadda also has better understanding of Telangana party affairs as he stayed here for more than a week during the last election season.

When the opinion taking process for new state chief took place, many in the core committee supported Laxman. Also, he struck a chord with Union minister of state for home affairs G Kishan Reddy, who will play crucial role in giving feedback on the choices available.

On the other hand, Aruna is seen as firebrand leader who took on chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao and reportedly has backing of two national general secretaries, Muralidhar Rao and Ram Madhav. But her inexperience in the party might be a hurdle in getting her name cleared.

Representative image

MADURAI: Madras high court has reserved orders on a man’s plea seeking compensation for the maternal death of his wife and over delay in issuing the post-mortem report and death certificate. S Manimuthu, a resident of K Pudur, stated that his wife Sakthikali, 22, was admitted for delivery at K Pudur UPHC on September 14.

The duty doctor told them that the delivery would be normal and there will be no complication. He stated that after the doctor left, his wife went into labour and the doctor did not return to the hospital till 11pm. A few minutes later, when the nurse called him inside the UPHC, he found his wife lying in a pool of blood and immediately rushed her to the government Rajaji hospital in an ambulance. The doctors declared his wife brought dead. Based on his complaint, the K Pudur police registered a case under section 174 of CrPC.

The authorities had not taken any steps to issue the death certificate and post-mortem report despite submitting representations.

He stated that since his wife and his child died due to the negligence of doctors at UPHC, he moved the HC last year seeking Rs 10lakh compensation from the government. He also demanded that the death certificate and post-mortem report be issued.

During the previous hearing, the court had taken serious note of the delay in informing the petitioner about the cause of his wife’s death. The court directed the dean of GRH, multipurpose health supervisor of GRH and inspector of police of K Pudur police station to file an affidavit explaining why the cause of the woman’s death was not communicated to the petitioner. It was only after the court took a serious view of the matter that officials handed over the death certificate at the previous hearing.

On Wednesday, the GRH dean and inspector of police of K Pudur police station submitted their affidavit before the court, but not the multipurpose health supervisor. Taking cognizance of the submissions, Justice Pushpa Sathyanarayana reserved orders in the case.

Bhubaneswar: Chief minister Naveen Patnaik is the richest among his ministers with assets to the tune of nearly Rs 64 crore. This was revealed in his asset declaration as on March 31, 2019.

The statement of assets of all the ministers was uploaded on the website of the chief minister’s office on Tuesday.

The value of Naveen’s properties has increased by around Rs 15 crore in a year (compared to March 31, 2018). This is because of an increase in the valuation of his immovable properties in Bhubaneswar, Faridabad and New Delhi.

The chief minister, in his statement, informed that the value of Naveen Niwas, in which he has 2/3rd share, is Rs 9.52 crore (valuation as on August 2017). Naveen also has a 50% share in the property situated on APJ Abdul Kalam Road, the current value of which is Rs 43.36 crore (valuation as on September 2014).

He also owns a farmland and building spread over 22.7 acres at Tikri Khera, Sohna Road, Faridabad worth Rs 10.75 crore (valuation as on March 2014). Interestingly, the five-time chief minister has not repaid the loan of Rs 15 lakh, which he has taken from his elder sister Gita Meheta. Naveen has cited it among his liabilities.

Naveen also owns an Ambassador of the 1980 model, the current value of which is mentioned at Rs 8,905. There has been no change in the valuation of the jewellery owned by him in the last five years as it remained at Rs 2.12 lakh.

Interestingly, the asset statement of state health minister Naba Kishore Das revealed that he possesses two licensed revolvers, a rifle and a fleet of high-end vehicles such as Audi, Mercedes Benz and Jaguar in the name of his wife. While Das has Rs 32 lakh in cash, he has bank deposits of around Rs 1 crore and fixed deposit of more than Rs 2 crore.

The value of the properties of the panchayati raj minister Pratap Jena is estimated at around Rs 10 crore as on March 31, 2019. It has increased by around Rs 4 crore in a year as Jena had cited the value of his properties at Rs 5.38 crore as on March 31, 2018.

Hyderabad: A day after high drama at the state-run Gandhi Hospital, where casualty medical officer Dr Vasant Kumar attempted suicide over being asked to surrender, the Telangana Joint Action Committee (TJAC) of the health and medical department wrote to the Director of Medical Education (DME), asking authorities to keep surrender orders of the medical practitioner in abeyance.

They also demanded that the allegations of corruption in the hospital made by Dr Vasant be probed. Dr Vasant, being an office-bearer of Telangana Government Doctors’ Association (TGGDA), had reportedly brought some irregularities to the notice of the medical superintendent. “Without taking the facts into consideration, he has been surrendered to the Directorate of Health, which we strongly condemn. We request you to keep the orders of Dr Vasant Kumar in abeyance and order an inquiry into the issue. The inquiry should be done by higher authorities and have two representatives of the TJAC,” Association secretary general B Venkateshwar Reddy said in the letter.

256,['13/02/2020'],"He needed a miracle, his pastor answered the prayer","This story is from February 13, 2020

Hyderabad: Suffering from kidney ailments, Ranjit Voola knew what fate had in store for him — medication, dialysis and a long wait on the transplant list. However, in what could be best described as divine intervention, Ranjit’s prayers for a healthy life were answered by his former church and its pastor, Stephen Tuck. In April 2019, Ranjit was the recipient from a live donor who was none other than Stephen. Ranjit and Stephen have been friends since the former along with his wife and daughter moved from Hyderabad to Sydney’s Kogarah in 2010.

Describing the operation as a life-changing experience, Ranjit says: “I never asked anyone for a kidney and was mentally prepared for things not going my way. My mother, Lalitha, had passed away in 2011 from ovarian cancer. At the time, things could not have been more difficult but now, in retrospect, I feel her grace through the various treatments helped me to understand and cope with my own condition.”

Ranjit started undergoing dialysis in 2018 — a 10-hours a day peritoneal dialysis. It was when his wife posted about his condition online that Stephen realised how grave the situation had become. A father of three, Stephen then approached his wife with a proposal. “Being tied to a machine every night is not how one should have to live. When I told my wife that I felt god was telling me to donate a kidney to Ranjit, she encouraged me. My youngest child, who is twelve, was the toughest to soothe. She thought I would die but when I explained to her the process, she too stood by my decision,” said Stephen.

After Stephen made his decision, what followed were several tests to confirm if he was fit enough to donate his kidney and to apprise him of the risks. “I was made aware that while the chance of anything untoward happening to me was rare, it was a possibility. And that once I made the decision, there was no turning back,” Stephen recalled.

On the day of the operation, both families stood courageous. “I had the whole church praying for me. I told my wife I love her and I will see her on the other side,” said Stephen. As for Ranjit’s family, he says: “Despite all my time spent on rushing in and out of hospital, I do not recall my kids missing any of their activities. My wife made sure they did it all which is an incredible achievement.”

After the operation, Stephen made a quick recovery. However, Ranjit suffered two serious setback within months. “The first episode was when my body started rejecting the organ. It took three biopsies to confirm and my medication was changed. The second was when I contracted pneumonia. What may be small issue for others, can become life-threatening for a transplant patient,” Ranjit said.

Despite difficulties, Ranjit is happy and says the operation was the best experience of his life. He now provides financial assistance to another patient with a similar condition. “I have realised that it is always more rewarding to give than to receive,” he says. Meanwhile, Stephen goes about life as before. “I am as healthy as I was. I play tennis and have even joined the gym,” says the pastor. The two recently took part in the Sydney to Surf Marathon.

Representative image

BENGALURU: Citing input cost, multiple bakers in the city are considering hiking the price of bread by February-end. The increase in price is likely to be in the range of Rs 2 to Rs 10.

The average price of a standard loaf of wrapped bread (400gm) is Rs 40, which is set to go up to Rs 45. While a 200gm loaf of bread, priced at Rs 18 may jump to Rs 20, sandwich bread may increase to Rs 70 from Rs 60, multiple bakers told TOI.

“We don’t have a choice but to hike prices given that the cost of eggs, gas, labour and other commodities has been rising. Selling our product at the same price, while price of raw materials skyrocket, is not economically viable,” said Ullas Chandra, director of a bakery in Kamakshipalya.

Another baker, who did not want to be named, said labour cost too has increased. Bakery owners have even formed the Karnataka Wrapped Bread Manufacturers Association , which too has been actively discussing the issue.

BS Bhat, member, Karnataka Wrapped Bread Manufacturers Association, said, “Another major issue is that we pay GST when we buy raw materials, but the same does not apply to the commodities we sell and this adds to our burden.”

In the past three months, the price of palm oil — the basic ingredient in manufacturing vegetable oil, dalda and margarine, all of which are key to making bakery products — has increased from Rs 80 to Rs 110. Price of milk solids too has increased from Rs 220 to Rs 260, the bakers said.

Arjun Seeba, who has a plant to manufacture baked goods on Kanakapura Road said prices of wheat and bakery flour are constantly increasing. “The price of gas and diesel too has gone up,” he added.

259,['13/02/2020'],Telangana 4th highest in number of deaths among HIV/AIDS patients,"This story is from February 13, 2020

Representative image

HYDERABAD: Telangana recorded fourth highest number of deaths among people with HIV and AIDS in the country in 2019-20, according to National AIDS Control Programme (NACP) data. The statistics were presented by minister of state for health and family welfare, Ashwini Kumar Choubey, in Rajya Sabha in response to a question.

During 2019-20, Telangana recorded 4,278 deaths, which are almost a tenth of the total deaths in India (43,017). As per the available data for Telangana, there has been a huge rise in the number of deaths from 2,925 in 2018-19 to 4,278 in 2019-20.

Experts attribute the high mortality rate to late diagnosis and discontinuation of treatment. The ART (anti-retroviral treatment), which is given to HIV/AIDS patients, keeps in check the viral load of HIV and also improves the count of CD4 cells in the body.

“A normal CD4 count required to maintain good immunity is around 500,” said Dr Mustafa Afzal, infectious diseases expert. “Patients with HIV or AIDS have lower counts, which could be between 400-500, 200-400 or lower than 200. Since the immune system depends on the CD4 count, for patients with lower than 200 count all kinds of opportunistic infections such as candidiasis and tuberculosis come into play, and patients succumb to these infections.”

In his reply in Rajya Sabha, MoS Choubey had said, “Infection with HIV causes progressive deterioration of immune system leading to immunodeficiency syndrome and making HIV-infected people susceptible to many opportunistic infections like tuberculosis, pneumonia and HIV-associated malignancies such as Kaposi sarcoma. In such cases, the death cannot be directly attributed to AIDS, and is mostly caused by opportunistic infections.”

However, drugs used for treatment as well as ART have significant side effects, including inflammation, vomiting, palpitations, and neurotoxicity of kidneys, which result in many discontinuing the treatment.

Another reason for discontinuation of treatment is stigma and lack of understanding about the seriousness of diseases.

“In Hyderabad, these diseases are largely seen among people in the low-income group. Illiteracy and poverty are the major reasons behind discontinuation of treatment in this group,” said Mujtaba Hasan Askari, who works with self help groups of HIV women and a palliative care centre for HIV patients.

“In many cases, patients do not understand the gravity of the problem and discontinue the treatment, while several others do not buy medicines due to stigma. They need to be counselled,” said Askari.

Hyderabad: Senior revenue and municipal officials who went with police security to demolish illegal houses built on assigned land on the outskirts of Mahabubabad town faced stiff resistance as an angry group of tribals rained stones on them on Wednesday.

Two cops were injured in the stone-pelting incident. A woman, who fell unconscious while resisting the officials from demolishing the houses, was rushed to the hospital. Several vehicles, including that of the municipal commissioner, were damaged when stones were being hurled by the mob.

Tension prevailed at Babu Nayak thanda when the officials came to demolish the houses in survey No. 504. With the locals preventing the demolitions on Tuesday, the officials came with police protection on Wednesday. Irate residents exchanged fisticuffs with cops, while women shouted at the officials.

In the last few days, revenue officials have been undertaking demolition of houses in some of the localities.

Locals at the thanda said they did not receive any notice. Some residents said they belong to third or fourth generation and in possession of the assigned lands. They said they got the house door numbers and electricity connections from the authorities concerned and wondered as to why their houses were now sought to be demolished.

Some angry women even threatened to commit suicide, but cops acted swiftly and foiled their attempts.

MUMBAI: A 57-year-old psychologist has been arrested on charges of rape and unnatural sex after a former patient , a student now aged 20, lodged a complaint against him with Kasturba Marg police. Sanjoy Mukerji was produced before a magistrate court at Borivli on Wednesday.

While the incident dates back to 2018, she told the police she only confided in her parents earlier this week, following which an FIR was lodged on Monday.

The survivor told the police she suffered from anxiety in 2018. Her parents took her to a physician who asked her to do a blood test. But when the blood test results were found to be normal, they recommended that she see a mental health professional. The survivor looked up online for a renowned psychologist practising in the western suburbs where she lived.

She found details of Mukerji’s clinic online and went along with her father in August 2018.

After the first session, Mukerji asked her to come back the following week.

“The girl went with her grandfather for the next session. Relatives are asked to wait outside, as per usual practice, so that patients can reveal their anxieties without any pressure. According to the girl’s complaint, Mukerji made remarks about her body and told her to stop dressing like a tomboy. He held her close, which she wasn’t comfortable with,” said a police officer.

The survivor said she refused to return for the next session but her family insisted. According to her complaint, she was raped during this session and the psychologist shot a video clip too.

She went back to him to ask that the clip be deleted but he allegedly had unnatural sex with her. She did not return thereafter and went to another therapist.

Out of fear, she did not confide in her parents. But the female therapist that she went to next managed to get her to narrate “the ordeal” and insisted that she inform her parents, which she did on February 9.

“Based on her statement, Mukerji was taken into custody on February 11. His phone will be examined by forensic analysts,” said an officer.

MUMBAI: Engineering education once commanded respect over other undergraduate streams. Tough entrance exams and competition from thousands only added to the allure of pursuing BTech. Cut to now: Bad engineers, outdated courseware, untrained faculty and poor placement score have called for a rewiring of the engineering programme.AICTE, which has decided to not accept fresh applications from managements wanting to start new colleges or courses in engineering, has instead planned on promoting newer areas within existing colleges. Institutes will now offer minor programmes in artificial intelligence and machine learning, blockchain, cyber security, data science and internet to students of computer science, electronics and communications and electronics engineering Similarly, smart cities, underground space utilisation, sustainable engineering, microgrid technologies and earthquake engineering will be offered to those pursuing civil courses.Those studying mechanical engineering can opt for a minor degree in robotics engineering, electrical vehicles, 3D printing or energy engineering. The AICTE-appointed committee headed by IIT-Hyderabad chairman B V R Mohan Reddy observed that traditional engineering disciplines such as mechanical, electrical, civil and electronics saw just about 40% admissions as opposed to computer science, aerospace and mechatronics at 60%.“This is a clear pointer that the demand lies in emerging technologies. We recommend that no additional seats are approved in traditional engineering areas. Institutions need to be encouraged to convert current capacity in traditional disciplines to emerging new technologies,” said Reddy in his analysis.“Low enrolment, lower placements and employability are causes for concern. Employment generation is very critical to a nation’s economic development. While we are making certain recommendations on the role that academic institutes can play in improving the quality of education and indirectly contribute to employment generation, all other stakeholders, including the government and the industry, should also start putting in place corrective measures to improve employment generation,” said Reddy.Not everyone, though, says a ban on new colleges is the panacea. “Merely banning new colleges from coming up may not solve the problem,” said former AICTE chairman S S Mantha. “In the past few years, feeder Class XII graduate numbers have not grown but the engineering sector has been expanding. The quality of graduates is an issue, apart from the fact that opportunities after engineering, reflected by the poor growth of India’s primary and secondary sectors, are not growing. But if there is free enterprise, one will see the required correction.”",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74110938,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-558587,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/low-placement-score-dated-courses-are-a-drag-on-engineering-education/articleshow/74106149.cms

Nashik: The city’s drinking water demand in the past six months has increased from 450 from 450 million litre per day (MLD) to over 500 MLD.

The rise, according to a civic official, could be due to increase in city’s population, particularly those migrating to the city in search for work. “Moreover, new residential societies and eateries are constantly coming up in the city,” he said.

According to the latest environment status report of the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC), city’s water requirement had increased from 368.46 MLD in 2013-14 to 434 MLD in 2017-18. The NMC has recently demanded water reservation of 5,000 mcft from the state water resources department (WRD).

“Unless more water is reserved for the NMC, the city would face water problems during peak summer this year. The bulk of city’s water requirement comes from Gangapur dam,” the official said.

Gangapur dam is the major source of water for the city as it provides 80% of the drinking water to the city. Moreover, the NMC also gets water from Darna and Mukane dams.

The water is reserved for city in these dams for a period between October 15 and July 31 every year. Last year, the NMC had drinking water reservation of 4,900 mcft, including 4,200 mcft in Gangapur, 400 mcft in Darna and 300 mcft of water in Mukane.

The NMC has now placed a demand for 5,000 mcft of water for the city for the year 2019-20. This includes 3,600 mcft in Gangapur, 400 mcft in Darna and 1,000 mcft in Mukane.

The city has used a total of 2,124.21 mcft of water between October 15 last year and February 12, 2020. Earlier, the NMC would outsource water from Gangapur and Darna dams. But it started getting water from Mukane from last year following construction of a direct pipeline.

Last year, the NMC had lifted 300 mcft of water from Mukane dam. This year, the civic body has plans to lift 1,000 mcft of water. Water from Mukane dam is supplied to Cidco division.

There are total 1.96 water connections in the city — including 1.87 lakh residential, 4,000 commercial and 5,000 non-commercial.

Visakhapatnam: Police found the dead body of the missing infant girl on Wednesday on the forested hill between Duvvupalem and Pulaganipalem villages, after five days of concerted efforts. The child, identified as Jnanasa, is the younger of two children of Kusumalatha and K Appa Rao.

Earlier, Kusumalatha had taken the 18-month-old baby girl to the hill on February 6 following a heated argument with her husband Appa Rao, who is a railway employee. He had then filed a missing complaint with the police.

Kusumalatha had tried to commit suicide by swallowing her gold and silver rings and had even tried to cut her neck. She was found unconscious by the locals on February 7, who then called in the police.

Upon being asked about the child, she told the police that her daughter had died of starvation and she buried her on the hill, but could not locate the place of burial. Suspecting her version of the incidents, police had initiated a search on the same day.

According to Pendurthi police station circle inspector Satyanarayana, they started their search with 50 police personnel and 50 civilians along with sniffer dogs. They finally found the place where the baby was buried on Wednesday.

The CI said the case is still being probed and if necessary, would be converted into another case by adding different sections.

BIJNOR: A leopard attacked a herd of goats and mauled to death three of the lot in Bijnor ’s Shahalipur Kotara village on Wednesday afternoon, setting alarm bells ringing in the region. Worried owners of the livestock and locals have now sought the help of forest department which is already finding it hard to tackle the man-animal conflict due to the sudden rise in the number of big cats, and also of the humans.

The incident occurred when two locals -- Omprakash Singh and Kallu Singh-- were grazing their goats close to a sugarcane field. “The leopard came from the sugarcane field and pounced on the goats. We fled to save our lives. It mauled to death three goats. When we shouted for help, passersby came to the rescue and scared the feline away. But, the goats were dead by then,” Kallu said.

Hours later, a villager spotted another leopard on nearby Barhapur-Raipur road while he was on his way to Najibabad .

When contacted, divisional forest officer (DFO) M Semmaran said, “We have alerted our staff and asked them to install camera traps and cages at the places where the big cat has been spotted. We have also urged the villagers to inform the forest officials if they spot any leopard.”

In the last two months, six people have lost their lives in leopard attacks and scores of others have been injured.

Bhubaneswar: With just days left for the board exams, feeling of anxiety is common among students. This affects their diet and sleep and can lead to a number of health issues like dehydration, indigestion, nausea and headache. To prevent them, health experts advise students not to take stress, do yoga and light exercises, listen to music, eat healthy and easy to digest food and drink lots of water to avoid falling ill in the exam season.

“My daughter simply stops eating the day before the exam. If we ask her to eat something, she throws up. But it’s not that she is bad in studies,” said Renubala Mohanty, whose daughter will appear in the Class X board exam.

Dietician and nutrition experts said loss of appetite among students is a common complaint during exams. “We advice parents to give students food in small quantities and in regular duration, instead of heavy lunch or dinner. They should also be given light and easy-to-digest food like khichdi, daliya, roti, vegetable stew, dalma and so on. Children must not be given junk food during exam time. They should also have plenty of fruits and liquids,” said Seema Mishra, a dietician.

Doctors also advised parents not to give too many medicines to students. “Many parents give medicines to students for quick relief following complaints of an upset stomach or headache. This should be avoided. They may get quick relief but some medicines have side effects and may affect the child,” said Dr S K Swain, medicine specialist.

“A day before the exam, students must avoid studying for long hours. They must get sufficient sleep. Students should go to bed early and try to wake up early on exam day. They should spare a few minutes for yoga or meditation to relax and de-stress their mind. Take a quick recap and never learn or start a new topic just before the exam,” advised Ipsita Rath, a senior teacher and counsellor. The Class X and XII board exams of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) will start from February 15 while the Class X exams of the Board of Secondary Education (BSE), Odisha, will begin from February 19 and the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) Class X exams will begin from February 27.

270,['13/02/2020'],Govt sets up panel headed by ex-judge for backward classes,"This story is from February 13, 2020

Bhubaneswar: The state government on Wednesday constituted a backward classes commission which will be headed by a retired judge of the Orissa high court. The move comes barely a month after the state cabinet passed a resolution to move the Centre for a socio-economic caste enumeration along with the 2021 general census.

On January 13, chief secretary Asit Tripathy had requested Union cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba to consider the proposal for a caste-based census, on which the Centre is yet to take a call. Former Orissa HC judge, Justice Raghunath Biswal, would head the commission while academicians Navneeta Rath (professor in sociology), Mitali Chinara (professor in economics) and Prasanna Kumar Patra (professor in anthropology) will be the members of the commission. Serving bureaucrat VV Yadav will be the member secretary of the panel, said an official statement.

The five-member commission has been constituted in accordance with the provisions under the Odisha State Commission for Backward Classes Act, 1993, a law that was formulated when Naveen Patnaik’s father Biju Patnaik was the chief minister of the state.

The 1993 law empowers the commission to examine requests of inclusion of any class of citizen in the backward class list. It can also hear complains of over inclusion and under inclusion into the list.

The commission has the power to advice the state government on inclusion or exclusion of any communities in the backward classes list. The advice of the commission shall ordinarily be binding upon the state government.

The state government’s move assumes significance as it has been facing flak for not constituting the backward commission. Though there has been no official census to enumerate the number of socially and educationally backward classes (SEBC), they account for around 54 per cent of the state’s population, which forms an important segment for any political party. There are around 209 communities identified as SEBCs in Odisha.

Union petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan, who had earlier criticized the state government move for a caste-based census, said the commission for backward classes has become a reality.

MADURAI: The Rs 290 crore Underground Drainage (UGD) proposed by Madurai corporation under the smart city scheme covering newly annexed 15 wards in the north of the city has started taking shape. Corporation officials said that the tender process was completed weeks ago and the work awarded to a chosen contractor.

A ground-breaking puja was recently conducted and the contractor has started ordering materials required to provide the connection. They have also started gauging the gravity of the surface area, where the project is to be implemented. “The ground-breaking ceremony and puja were conducted at Vandiyur on Sunday. Residents can witness works on the ground in a few days. The contractor will complete the project within the specified time of 24 months,” said an official.

While Madurai corporation has proposed the project at an estimated cost of Rs 291.37 crore, only Rs 247.90 crore has been utilized from the smart city scheme. The rest will be met through the connection deposit, which would be collected from the residents. The corporation has underground drainage system in the old city comprising 72 wards. Although 28 wards were annexed in 2011, they were not provided facilities like underground drainage or piped drinking water connection. The project proposed by the corporation will cover 10 wards in zone II and five wards in zone I. Santhi Nagar (ward number 1), Koodal Nagar (2), Anaiyur (3), S Alangulam (4) and Visalakshi Nagar (23) in zone 1 and Thirupalai (24), Kannanendal (25), Parasuramanpatti (26), Uthangudi (28), Masthanpatti (29), Melamadai (30), Tahsildar Nagar (31), Vandiyur (32), Aathikulam (498), Naganakulam (49) in zone two will get the facility.

At a time when a large number of projects are being carried out under the smart city mission, the issue of dust emanating from them has come to the fore. Officials said they have taken every step to bring down the dust and contractors have been told to water the construction area frequently. However, the officials said that dust cannot be completed averted and urged the residents to bear with it until the projects are completed.

HYDERABAD: While studies have pointed out serious lack of awareness about HIV and AIDS in the country, a recent survey by Practo, an online health consulting platform, shows there has been 139% increase in consultations about sexual and reproductive health in the past one year across India. Hyderabad has also seen a huge jump in such online consultations.

In fact, it was found that Indians asked over 1,000 queries per hour related to sexual and reproductive health. Bengaluru topped the chart, followed by Delhi and Mumbai.

“Bangalore, Chennai and Hyderabad witnessed a significant increase in the number of online sexologist consultations, compared to the previous year. People aged between 21 to 30 years contributed to 72% of the overall eConsults on sexual health ,” read the report.

The study said, “70% of the eConsults for sexual health were from cities like Bangalore, Delhi-NCR, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Pune, and Chennai. Queries from Bangalore, Chennai and Hyderabad have increased at a rate of 50% year-on-year. Also, sexual health has been one of the topmost concerns for people from non-metro cities, contributing to 30% of all eConsults. Most of the queries were about abortion, unplanned pregnancy, masturbation and premature ejaculation.”

This overt dependence on online platforms is primarily because of lack of guidance from adults. “Less than 10% people admit of getting knowledge about sexual and reproductive issues from family members, teachers and healthcare professionals,” the study said.

BIJNOR: The Bijnor agriculture department has started promoting ‘cow-based zero budget’ farming in the district, to ensure that farmers use cow dung and urine as manure, and reduce expenses to nil. The department has also started identifying farmers who are engaged in organic farming, so that they can be trained in best practices.

The plan came up at the end of a training session for 1,026 farmers on cow-based-farming, organized by the agriculture department at Kanpur last month. Initially, the state government focused on areas close to river banks, to keep the Ganges clean, what with huge amounts of chemical fertilisers and pesticides used by farmers draining into the river. This project covered 27 districts, 1,026 villages and 21 civic bodies.

Now, Bijnor agriculture department has decided to boost traditional farming among farmers not only in riverbanks, but across the district. Deputy director of agriculture, J P Chaudhary, said, “Our department had chalked up a plan to promote cow-based zero-budget farming across the district. Hundreds of farmers practice organic farming in Bijnor, but they are isolated from each other. We’ll unite and shortlist them, so that they can all be trained in these techniques, which is profitable for farmers and good for consumers. We have nominated Yogendra Pal Singh as nodal officer of this project.”

“Chemical fertilisers and pesticides have huge negative effects on biodiversity and human health, leading to fatal diseases like cancer, blood pressure and cardiac arrest, etc, besides causing deterioration of soil health. We’re teaching villagers not to burn farm waste, but use it to raise humus or organic carbon in soil,” Chaudhary claimed.

Nodal officer Yogendra Pal Singh said, “With the dung and urine from just one cow, farmers can fertilise around 25-30 acre land by preparing bijamrit, jivanmrit, neemashtra and ghanamrit. Some other naturally available things can be mixed with the dung and urine to prepare bio-pesticides or manure, without having to buy anything from the market. We are shortlisting farmers willing to go natural.”

He added, “Produce grown this way is going to be more expensive than the rest. Our department will guide farmers on how to get registered and sell their produce.”

MUZAFFARNAGAR: Holding them responsible for what it said was ""widespread damage to public property"" during anti-CAA stir in Muzaffarnagar on December 20, an additional district magistrate (ADM) court on Wednesday sought recovery of Rs 23.41 lakh from 53 protesters. According to the administration, all the culprits were identified from CCTV camera footage.

“In all, 57 people have been served with the notice after they were spotted damaging properties on CCTV. They have been asked to submit their replies,” a senior government official said, adding that four of them turned out to be innocent later. The replies of the 53 people were not found to be satisfactory, he added.

Additional district magistrate (First) Amit Singh said, “We will paste recovery notices on their homes now. The recovery will start soon.”

The “rioters” have been asked to appear in person before the ADM court to record their statements within seven days.

When contacted, Mannawar Hussain, a lawyer representing the accused, said, “My clients are innocent and most of them are very poor. We will go to high court against this order.”

One of the accused, Raju, who is a manual labourer and lives in a rented house with family, said, “I was seen in the CCTV footage returning from a mosque after Friday prayers. I have nothing to do with the violence. But I got a notice from the administration. I also appeared before the ADM court and explained my plight. But to no avail.

CLEARED SKHER

Nashik: The district administration is keen on having a ropeway built on Indian standards rather than the European standards, which push up the project costs.

In Nashik district, three ropeways are planned – one each from Nanduri to base of Saptashrungi temple, from the temple to Markandeya and in Trimbakeshwar. A meeting to discuss the construction of the ropeways was held on Wednesday between the officials of Indian Rail Port Corporation Limited (IRPCL), the public works department and the district planning officer.

The meeting discussed the type of carriages and infrastructure of the ropeways. The government is not going to invest in the project, but would allow companies to built and operate the ropeways at all the places.

During the meeting on Wednesday, IRPCL, which is the consultant for the project, presented two choices for the construction of the ropeways. After the presentation, the district administration said the ropeways should be of Indian standards as it would be less expensive. However, no compromise on the safety of the passengers should be made.

The administration has asked the IRPCL to revise the process of charging for the ropeway rides to ensure that the fare remains minimal. The Saptashrungi hills have seasonal rush to the temple, as against Trimbakeshwar, which has a steady flow of pilgrims all the year round.

“The model of revenue earning for the company installing the infrastructure should be designed in such a way that it does not pinch the visitors,” the officers added.

The meeting also discussed the income from the funicular trolley at the hill-temple shrine of Vani. The IRPCL has been asked to work upon the project and the present the figures.

KANNUR: With the state government planning to open the West Coast Canal next year, which is expected to boost the tourism sector in the state, especially Malabar region, state-owned tourism promoter Bekal Resorts Development Corporation Ltd (BRDC) is planning to launch a new endeavour, ‘Uru Tourism’, which would provide an opportunity for tourists to explore the culture and history of north Malabar by sailing across the backwaters in a dhow (uru).

“The new tourism project has been envisioned as one which would offer a rich experience to travellers by stringing together cultural, historic, art with other elements of Malabar,” said managing director of BRDC T K Manzoor , adding that the project, which would also introduce art forms of north Kerala along with tribal art, would be launched by December.

“Along with the art forms of the north Malabar, such as the ‘yakshaganam’, ‘duffmuttu’, ‘pavakali’, ‘ kolkali ’, ‘alamikkali’ and ‘oppana’, tribal art such as ‘mangalam kali’, ‘eruthu kali’, ‘man kali’ would also be performed by artists so as to offer the travellers a peek into the rich cultural milieu of the state,” Manzoor said.

Traditional culinary delights of the land will also be offered in the package, and travellers would be taken on a journey through the heritage of the state, including trips to sacred groves, forts, temples, churches and mosques, he said. “The package also lets travellers explore the rich biodiversity of the state, natural medicine, and experience village life as well.”

Other heritage monuments and historic sites would be introduced through narratives and visual tools.

Though houseboat tourism is prevalent, backwater tourism through uru is a first of a kind offering in the state, said BRDC, which has introduced many experiential tourism projects with its SMiLE tourism project, with the participation of local entrepreneurs.

“The uru, which is being arranged by the BRDC, can accommodate more than 50 people, and it has been approved during a director board meeting in Thiruvananthapuram which was presided over by chief secretary Tom Jose,” Manzoor said .

Uru, which corresponds to the traditional shipbuilding culture of Kerala, plays a major role in the state’s history. It is constructed without any blueprints and is created by expert craftsmen, who use only locally available equipment, and even now it is considered an architectural marvel around the world.

With this, it also aims to preserve this shipbuilding culture, which is now a disappearing art, and travellers would be given a glimpse into the making of the vessel, its history and significance, said BRDC.

Visakhapatnam: Even as cases of death by drowning continue along the city’s beaches , little has been by the district administration to counter the problem.

“Besides appointing a few community guards, nothing has been done to save people from drowning in the sea along the beaches across the city. Last year there were efforts to procure life saving boats. But even after floating a tender we had to stop our efforts because of the assembly and Lok Sabha elections,” a senior official of the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) told TOI.

According to reports available with the police, more than 570 people died in the past decade on the nine beaches in the city, spreading from Bheemili to Yarada, an average of over 50 deaths per year. Further, a majority of the deaths were of persons below the age of 25.

“There had been several discussions on how to arrest erosion along the beach, construction of floating walls and lighthouses with a public address system. But nothing has happened till date. In drowning cases we are dependent on the marine police, the Navy and the Coast Guard,” the official added.

The National Institute of Oceanography (NIO) had previously issued a warning against venturing into the sea abutting the coastline of the city as rip currents in the Bay of Bengal in this part of the country are hazardous.

Even during the lean season, police said the nine beaches in the city register a footfall of around 20,000 visitors in a month.

With a large number of colleges and educational institutions located close to the Beach Road, several visitors to the beaches are students.

“The best way to counter such an issue is a public awareness system. Nowadays, state-of-the-art life saving crafts are also available. These crafts are not so expensive and come at between Rs 5 lakhs to Rs 6 lakhs depending on the make and facilities,” said Aliasgar Calcuttawala, a local entrepreneur whose company designs water rescue crafts.

279,['13/02/2020'],"SC guidelines bar political use of govt buildings, HC told","This story is from February 13, 2020

Vijayawada: The Union government on Wednesday told the high court that government buildings cannot be used for political advertisement of the ruling party.

Responding to notices issued by the high court on the issue of government buildings in the state being painted in the YSRC flag colours, the Centre said the Supreme Court has issued guidelines in this regard which applies to all public places, government establishments, local bodies and public undertakings.

Appearing on behalf of the Union government, assistant solicitor general B Krishna Mohan told the high court that the guidelines by the apex court mandate that the government advertisements should maintain political neutrality in disseminating information to people about government schemes. The advertisements should be objective but not directive neither to promote ruling political party nor to defame opposition parties.

Further explaining the SC guidelines, Krishna Mohan said that the Election Commission has liberty to take necessary steps to prevent political parties from using public places and government buildings for political mileage not only when the model code of conduct is in force but also prior to the elections. Defacing of public properties, government buildings and public undertakings in any manner with that of political advertisements is prohibited during the elections he said.

On the other hand, the state government justified its stand by saying that the colour shade and pattern used for painting of buildings is different from that of YSRC party flag colours. Arguing on behalf of the state government, additional advocate general, Ponnavolu Sudhakar Reddy said that there are only seven colours in the universe and more than 700 political parties are present in the country. Any colour would be identical to some or the other party.

Further in its defence, the state government in the affidavit said the buildings were painted in view of setting up village and ward secretariats in which a number of government services are made available. So to make the buildings standalone for easy identification for people, a colour scheme was adopted by the government. Reddy argued that the contention of the petitioner that the colours would influence the electorate is not true as the recent election result shows that people will not vote by seeing mere colours as the previous government had painted even the toilets with their party colour but lost the elections.

On the other hand, the high court bench headed by Chief Justice JK Maheswari and Justice Ninala Jayasurya asked the State Election Commission about the steps taken by them in view of the ensuing panchayat elections.

As the advocate for the EC replied that the issue would come into their ambit only after the model code of conduct was in force. However, the high court questioned the EC what preparations have been made to conduct election and have they written to the government about election preparations yet.

The HC also questioned whether the EC would wait for another two months for issuing the election notification.

After hearing all sides, the high court reserved judgment on the issue.

Representative image

MEERUT: Days after the UP government instructed all the state-run schools to identify dilapidated school buildings, if any, to ensure the safety of children and school staff, instructions have been given to demolish these buildings within three months.

In a circular issued recently, UP basic education director Sarvendra Vikram Bahadur Singh has asked the school authorities to make sure that a building is demolished if it has either completed 15 years or is in a poor condition. He has also asked the authorities to initiate action against the block education officer and other officials concerned if a building constructed less than 15 years ago has to be razed.

The director said, “This is to bring to your notice that all the dilapidated buildings that have been identified by the education authorities in each district should be demolished within three months. The risk to lives of children and teaching staff remains in cases where schools function from dilapidated buildings. Hence, the buildings in question should be demolished within three months.”

TOI had earlier reported about the concerns of the education department and instructions were given to see that the decision of demolishing a building is taken only after bringing the matter to the notice of the respective district magistrate and a four-member technical committee formed by the public works department. Instructions have also been given to take action against the construction officer and the block education officer who was behind the construction of the buildings which require demolition in less than 15 years’ time.

Representative image

MEERUT: The first phase of the 2020-21 door-to-door campaign to detect and treat patients suffering from tuberculosis (TB) will be launched here on February 17.

During the 10-day-long drive, 159 teams of doctors and health officers would visit homes to examine lakhs of people and collect sputum of those suspected to be suffering from the disease .

The active case-finding is part of a nation-wide effort to eradicate the disease which has re-emerged as a potential killer claiming more than 4.06 lakh lives in the country every year. The central government, aiming to root out the disease by 2025, has instructed all states to start “active case-finding”. This means that health authorities, instead of waiting for TB patients to approach them, would send workers to households in order to identify and treat such patients. The pilot project kicked off from urban slums of Meerut in August 2017.

Dr MS Fauzdar, district tuberculosis officer, said, “As many as 159 teams – including 34 supervisors and 11 nodal officers — have been formed to examine lakhs of people. A list of the areas where the survey will be conducted has also been identified.”

The drive would start on February 17 and end on February 27. Each TB patient identified would be given Rs 500 per month under the government scheme.

Similarly, instructions have been given to hold HIV awareness camps in 25 gram panchayats from February 15 to March 15.

Nashik: The Nashik division of the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) is developing infrastructure to recharge electric-buses that will ferry passengers to and from Pune and Nashik.

“It has been decided that we (Nashik) will get some e-buses to ferry passengers from Nashik to Pune and back. They will replace the equal numbers of diesel-powered Shivshahi — semi luxury, air-conditioned buses,” divisional controller Nitin Maind, MSRTC, Nashik division, said.

Maind attended a meeting of divisional controllers held in Pune. The meeting saw discussion about increasing bus connectivity in the state.

“We are not aware of the exact numbers of buses Nashik division will get, but we know that 50 e-buses will be running across the state soon. Hence, we have been asked to create suitable infrastructure for the said vehicles at the earliest,” the officer said.

The Nashik depot 1 runs buses for inter-district and inter-city purposes and as such the responsibility of running of Nashik-Pune buses will be handed over to depot 1.

“We will raise three electric bus charging stations at the depot based on the technical specifications as provided by the company providing the buses. The charging stations will be raised with the help of the Maharashtra state electricity distribution company limited (MSEDCL) and the contract for the same would be out soon,” the officer said.

There will be 50 e-buses in the first phase and they will connect Pune centrally and reach out to the various places across the state in the range of about 250 km, another officer said.

The e-buses buses will connect Pune to Nashik, Aurangabad, Solapur, Kolhapur and Mumbai in all directions.

Going by the design of the first phase of buses, Nashik could get five buses.

287,['13/02/2020'],Passengers protest as Rajya Rani gets delayed by around 4 hours,"This story is from February 13, 2020

Nashik: Irked passengers of Mumbai-bound Rajya Rani Express from Nanded staged a protest at Nashik Road railway station owing to the late running of the train.

The train scheduled to arrive at 6.15 am reached Nashik Road railway station at 10.12am and the regular passengers were forced to take Panchavati Express for reaching Mumbai.

The passengers also demanded streamlining of the train. “We have been raising the issue of late running of the train on several occasions especially the time it was extended up to Nanded division,” Kiran Borse, a regular passenger, said.

The passengers also pointed out that the train is being delayed almost every day. But since it comes from a long distance, the passengers say they are fine with 15-minute delay.

“The train is getting delayed by 20 to 50 minutes and this is like taking Nashikites for granted. Basically the Rajya Rani inter-city train was started from Manmad for two things enabling the citizens to reach their offices in time and help in decongesting the Panchavati Express. But not the purpose seems to be defeated,” Sanyogini Jadhav, another passenger, said.

There is little space in the monthly season ticket travel coach in Panchavati Express. Similar is the situation of the people travelling by the second seating class arrangements.

“The Panchavati Express has its own passengers to cater to. Now since Rajya Rani got delayed, passengers had to rush to this train. We are facing lot of hardships while commuting to Mumbai,” Asif Shaikh, another commuter, said.

There is also an increasing feeling among the commuters to travel by Panchavati Express instead of Rajya Rani Express. “Now if the time between the two trains is small and we might as well start travelling by Panchavati Express as it is likely that Rajya Rani will continue getting delayed,” Santosh Pathak, another regular traveler, said.

Railway sources said the train was delayed because of a block in Nanded division of South Central Railway Zone.

“The Mumbai-Nagpur-Mumbai Nandigram Express has been cancelled till Feb 14 because of the works being undertaken. On Wednesday the Rajya Rani was delayed because of the ongoing work. It is likely that the train may be delayed by few minutes for the next few days,” railway sources said.

288,['13/02/2020'],Shifting of vigilance office: HC asks govt to file affidavit,"This story is from February 13, 2020

Vijayawada: The high court on Wednesday asked the state government to file an affidavit, explaining why the offices of vigilance commission and commissionerate of enquiries are being shifted to a different place instead of a different building if adequate space is not available in the present secretariat.

Hearing the public interest litigations (PIL) challenging the GO 13 issued for shifting of the offices, the special bench headed by Chief Justice JK Maheshwari, Justice AV Sesha Sai and Justice M Satyanarayana Murthy asked the government to explain how vigilance would be possible when the office of the head of the department is not at the same place as the vigilance officers.

The HC also asked the government to furnish details about the number of employees working and the space allocated to them at the present office in the interim government complex.

Advocate general S Sriram told the court that the office of vigilance commission is present in an area of 6,585 sq ft in the interim complex. However, the chief justice said they do not want to accept any oral submissions in this case and asked the AG to file an affidavit with the details.

Resuming the arguments on Wednesday, the AG said though the vigilance commission is part of the general administration department (GAD), its functions are distinct from that of GAD. The HC asked the AG to explain the distinction between functions of GAD and the vigilance commission.

On the other hand, the high court rejected the interim applications moved by petitioners seeking inquiry against IAS officers for flouting norms and for making adverse remarks against judiciary.

The chief justice told the petitioners to confine to the shifting of offices and not club irrelevant issues with the petition.

On the question of defaming the judicial system, the chief justice said they know how to save the majesty of the courts. He observed that all the matters raised by the petitioners have come to their notice and that there is no necessity to club them with the PIL.

292,['13/02/2020'],Many Nashik ZP schools reeling under shortage of teachers,"This story is from February 13, 2020

Nashik: A day after students from a zilla parishad (ZP) school at Panzan village in Nandgaon taluka resorted to agitation to press for their demand of getting teachers, it has come to the fore that it is not the not the only ZP having the same problem.

As per ZP primary education department office, there are a total 3,385 ZP primary schools spread all over the district with 11,799 approved posts of teachers. Of this, there are as many as 611 vacant posts.

Meanwhile, the total number of students studying in these schools is around 4 lakh. Sanjay Babanrao Pagar, state treasurer of Maharashtra Rajya Shikshak Parishad, said, students studying in ZP schools are not able to get quality education and the reason is negligence of the administration in filling the vacant posts of teachers.

“We have taken up the issue with the authorities concerned but it has not served any purpose yet. More than 600 posts are still vacant. Apart from this at any given time of the year one may find that 25 to 30 lady teachers are on pregnancy leave. Thus, the number of teachers available is not able to give full attention to their respective classes,” he added.

Every child has the right to education, but this is not happening with the students of ZP schools in Nashik . They are not getting quality education. “Since the entire recruitment process of appointing or recruiting teachers has become online, even political leaders have kept the issue of vacant teachers in ZP schools on the back-burner,” said Pagar.

ZP president Balasaheb Shirsagar said, “Shortage of staff is seen in many departments, but Nashik ZP cannot get the posts filled at its level. Nonetheless, we will follow up the issue with the government.”

Other officials said that since 2011 there was no recruitment of teachers, though in September 2019 Nashik ZP got 202 teachers through the online recruitment process. The gap of vacant posts and number of teachers appointed in 2019 was too large following which over 600 posts are still vacant.

Meanwhile, during transfers there are certain villages that are left out as teachers are given a list of 20 schools where they can avail the transfer. Since this process is also online, some schools are left out as they are not picked by any teacher.

Bareilly: A sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) in UP’s Sambhal district has issued notices to 13 people, asking them to submit personal bonds of Rs 50 lakh each along with sureties from two guarantors for the amount after local police accused them of “provoking” women to hold protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

The men have been accused of “prodding” women to assemble in large numbers at a ground in Sambhal’s Nakhas area and organize a sit-in protest against CAA.

When contacted, SDM Rajesh Kumar told TOI, “We got intelligence reports that some people provoked Muslim women to hold a ‘dharna’ in the city. Such actions pose a threat to law and order in the district. Following the reports, the 13 accused were issued notices and given seven days to reply. We will examine their explanation, and initiate further action after that.”

He added: “Each and every person issued notice will have to submit a personal bond of Rs 50 lakh. This bond will work as a surety or a guarantee that they will not indulge in any such activity in the future.”

Most of the people served with the notice belong to poor families.

Lawyer Mohammad Yaqub Gama said, “Some of them are so poor that the total value of their assets would not cross Rs 2 lakh. Forget Sambhal, I have never heard any court serving a notice of such a big amount under section 107/116 of CrPC.

Pinarayi Vijayan

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that the usual royalty levied by mining and geology department has been waived off for sand and mud to be removed from various dams in the state. He was replying to a submission by MLA V K Ebrahim Kunju in the assembly on Wednesday.

The government has issued a transparent procedure for removing sand and mud from 12 dams and six regulator-cum-bridges, the CM said. “The mining and geology department has waived off the royalty and 20% of the income earned through sale of sand will be set apart for the protection and maintenance of dams,” he said.

Procedures are on to remove sand from dams under KSEB, including Kundala, Mattuppetty, Kallarkutti, Peringalkoothu and Lower Periyar , for increasing their storage capacity, Vijayan said. Besides, respective district collectors have been entrusted to initiate measures for removal of mud from rivers which got deposited during floods, the CM said.

After the 2018 floods, the government took a decision to remove mud and sand which got deposited in 40 big dams and to restore their storage capacity. A high-level empowered committee under the chief secretary comprising secretaries of departments concerned, chief engineers and department heads, is now functional, Vijayan added.

296,['13/02/2020'],Nagpur: 15 new FIRs registered in irrigation scam,"Representative image

NAGPUR: A day before daily hearings begin in a PIL seeking a CBI probe in the alleged irrigation scam , the state’s Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) units in Amravati and Nagpur have registered 14 new offences in the case, on Wednesday. The process of booking one more case was underway at Amravati till late in the evening, said sources.The ACB booked nine private contractors and 44 officials of Vidarbha Irrigation Development Corporation (VIDC) in this round. In majority of the cases, the contractors have been booked for forgery and fraud for allegedly submitting fake documents to take part in the tenders. There is no mention of financial loss to the state by fudging tender costs, except in two cases.Directors of M/s SMS Infrastructure run by the prominent Sancheti family have also been booked in the case. Former Rajya Sabha member from BJP Ajay Sancheti was also in the company’s management before he became MP around eight years ago. Sancheti is known to be close to Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari and also deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar. The latter was also under the scanner in the case, but was given a clean chit.The first complaint which led to the ACB inquiry into the alleged crime was against M/s SMS Infrastructure. However, even as the firm, which had been its joint venture partner in some of the works, was named in the earlier FIRs , M/s SMS Infrastructure had not been touched so far.The action takes the number of offences registered in Vidarbha to 38, 27 of them in Nagpur and 11 in Amravati.The 15 cases are among those registered after Pawar, who held the water resources portfolio in the Congress-NCP regime, was given a clean chit by the ACB in December 2019. The alleged scam took place during the Congress-NCP rule from 1999 to 2014. The PIL seeking CBI probe was filed by NGO Janmanch after the clean chit was given. Janmanch had also filed the first PIL that led to the ACB inquiry.A quick look at the First Information Reports (FIRs) shows that in most of the cases the contractors have been booked for alleged fraud and forgery of documents needed to qualify for taking part in the tender process. The officials of VIDC are charged with overlooking the facts related to forged papers.For example, in the case of SMS Infrastructure, it has been alleged that the company submitted a forged work done certificate for earlier jobs undertaken. The certificate was needed to take part in the tender for works on a barrage being built on Purna river in Akola district. The officials have been charged with conniving with the firm.A direct loss to the state funds has been alleged in only two of the cases, and the amount has been pegged at little over Rs 10 crore in all. Here, the officials have been charged with exceeding their brief to allow a hike in the tender cost.In the seven cases booked by the Nagpur unit of ACB, none of the private contractors has been named. Here, the officials have been charged with overlooking the deficiency in the contractors’ credentials for taking part in the tender process.In Nagpur, a common offence registered in most cases is that contractors had not submitted the registered copy of the joint venture firms created to take up the works. The officials have been booked under the Prevention of Corruption Act.ACB sources clarified that it was only a coincidence that the offences have been registered a day before the hearing begins. Proposals for getting approval of the Water Resources Department (WRD), the authority governing VIDC officers, was needed to register the offence. An amendment to the Prevention of Corruption Act calls for seeking the concerned authority’s permission before such action. The department has finally given the green signal.",nagpur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74113978,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-108503,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/15-new-firs-registered-in-irrigation-scam/articleshow/74107214.cms

Visakhapatnam: The city will observe the first World Pangolin Day on February 15 at the Indira Gandhi Zoological Park (IGZP) in collaboration with Eastern Ghats Wildlife Society (EGWS). Pangolins are endangered mammals and are trafficked for meat while their scales are highly valued as medicine. The programme will raise awareness of the importance of conservation of the species among school students.

International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) classification for the eight species of pangolin ranges from ‘ threatened ’ to ‘critically endangered’. All four Asian pangolin species are endangered. The Indian pangolin can be spotted in and around Visakhapatnam and the Eastern Ghats. In 2019, EGWS rescued and released into the wild two Indian Pangolins that were held captive by villagers near Chodavaram.

Conservation biologist and founder-president of EGWS Kantimahanti Murthy said, “World Pangolin Day is an opportunity to raise awareness about lesser-known fauna, educate the public and discuss conservation. The event will be held for students of Classes VIII and IX.”

Vijayawada: The Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL) submitted the new postmortem report in the BPharm student murder case to CBI on Tuesday.

According to sources, CSFL and DNA reports were received by CBI which confirmed head injury. They also examined bones, hair and nails and found other injuries as well. The re-postmortem was conducted on December 14 in Tenali where the body was buried.

Most of the findings did corroborate with the previous postmortem report, however, with the crucial vaginal swabs and other forensic evidence being lost, official sources explained that they have little to start with.

Tenali sub-collector and mandal revenue officer oversaw the proceedings which took about six hours. The final report is expected soon and will be submitted to the court by CBI.

In December 2007, the BPharm student was found murdered in the bathroom of a private hostel at Ibrahimpatnam in the outskirts of Vijayawada.

The case has seen several twists with allegations raised against Vijayawada police of bias to save family members of some prominent politicians. The biggest of them all came on March 31, 2017 when the high court acquitted Satyam Babu of the murder leaving the case wide open again.

The victim’s mother assured cooperation with CBI, however, did not express hope that her daughter would get justice.

Representative image

COIMBATORE: A 32-year-old man was sentenced to life sentence on Wednesday for stabbing a woman to death after she refused to accept his marriage proposal in 2014. The case was tried before the fourth additional district judge court in the city.

Pronouncing the verdict, judge K Poorna Jeya Anand awarded life sentence to R Thangadurai, of Pollachi, for stabbing C Suprika, 24. Thangadurai was 26-year-old when he murdered Suprika.

According to public prosecutor Baburam, Thangadurai had pestered Suprika to marry him. But she refused. Irked over this, in November 2014, Thangadurai entered Suprika’s house in Pollachi and stabbed her with a knife, killing her on the spot. When Suprika’s mother and brother came to her rescue, Thangadurai stabbed them as well with knife. Both sustained injuries in the attack.

Besides the life sentence, the court also ordered seven years of imprisonment each for stabbing Suprika’s mother and brother. The court also slapped a fine of Rs 41,000 on him besides 10 years of imprisonment for trespassing into a house with the intention of murdering someone.

Meanwhile, the mahila court here on Wednesday sentenced a 35-year-old man to three years of imprisonment for sexually harassing a five-year-old girl. He was convicted under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act.

In December 2016, the child had been playing in front of her house. The man had taken the child to his house and had harassed her.

Based on a complaint from the child’s mother, the Perur all women police had filed a case against the man.

Pronouncing the judgement in the case, the mahila court on Wednesday sentenced the man to three years in jail. It also imposed a fine of Rs2,000 or an additional six months sentence in case he fails to pay it.

NEW DELHI: The Patiala House Courts Complex witnessed dramatic scenes as two sections of protesters gathered outside its premises. One group demanded expeditious execution of the death warrants of the four convicts in the Nirbhaya case , while family members of the convicts, along with their supporters, demanded abolition of death penalty .

Earlier, the hearing on fixing date for hanging of the four convicts — Mukesh Singh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Vinay Sharma (26) and Akshay Thakur (31) — was adjourned. The Supreme Court posted order on a petition challenging the rejection of a mercy plea filed by Sharma on Friday.

During the proceedings, Nirbhaya’s mother, with her voice breaking, told the court, “I come here every day with the hope of getting justice only to return disappointed.” The judge sympathised with her and said everyone had to function within the ambit of law and couldn’t go beyond it.

After the proceedings were adjourned, the two groups were seen sloganeering at the main entrance of the court premises. The path at the entrance gate leading to the court premises divided the two factions — who had positioned themselves opposite each other. Chants of “phansi band karo (abolish death penalty)” were countered with even louder cries of “Nirbhaya ko nyay do… chaaron ko phansi do (give justice to Nirbhaya… hang the convicts)”.

It was perhaps the first the time that the family members of some of the convicts — Gupta, Singh and Sharma — held placards that read four people could not be hanged for the death of one person. Some of them also wanted the “politicisation of the case to stop”.

The two conflicting views also put spotlight on death penalty — execution of which was vehemently sought by counsels of Nirbhaya’s parents and contested by a convict’s counsel, who said, “The convicts are reminded of death every time they inhale and exhale.”

COIMBATORE: The very day TOI reported the story of a 26-year-old girl from Kavundampalayam who is being exploited as a housemaid in Saudi Arabia , where she was sent as a babysitter, a smart city director in the city had taken up the issue and tweeted it tagging the Indian embassy in Riyadh , external affairs minister S Jaishankar and local administrations minister S P Velumani . The Indian embassy has now responded by promising to do all that it could to rescue Priya and send her back home.

Moved by Priya’s story and plight in Riyadh, G Krithiha, who is also an entrepreneur, tracked down her family and verified the issue. Later, she tweeted the TOI story that appeared on Tuesday (February 11), tagging the Indian embassy in Riyadh, Velumani and Jaishankar the same day. While many people retweeted her post, the Indian embassy replied her on Tuesday night, requesting details like Priya’s passport number and copies of her passport, Saudi Arabia visa and her ticket to that country.

Krithiha meticulously followed that up with Priya’s mother, got all the required documents and sent them to the embassy. On Wednesday afternoon, the Indian embassy replied stating they had received the documents and the matter was being taken up both in Saudi Arabia and India. “Now, we hope that they would trace the employer and rescue Priya as soon as possible,” said Krithiha, who has seen pictures of Priya’s hands with burn injuries, bruises and cuts.

On Monday, Priya’s mother Thenmozhi had petitioned district collector K Rajamani to rescue her daughter. She said Priya was taken to Riyadh as a babysitter with a salary of Rs 25,000 by a couple of employment agents. She flew to Riyadh on October 29, last year.

However, when Priya landed in Riyadh, she was used as a domestic maid and made to work in three houses. “She would be woken up by her employer at 2am and she has to work late. Her health is failing due to lack of sleep and her hand has injuries everywhere,” Thenmozhi said in the petition.

NAGPUR: On September 2 last year, an ambulance taking an ailing Bhushan Tol from New Manish Nagar had got stuck in a “crater-like pothole” on the way to a hospital in Dhantoli. Bhushan was later declared dead within couple of hours of reaching the hospital.

His 32-year-old widow Amruta is now set to file an intervention application in the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court into a criminal writ petition, seeking action against the state for leaving the ditch unattended.

The ambulance, which had started from the residence of Tol family at 1.15am, managed to reach the hospital, which is only eight kms away, after a delay of around one-and-a-half hours. The ambulance could be freed from the “mucky pothole” after a struggle of almost 30 minutes which allegedly proved fatal for Bhushan.

In the latest case which was reported on Sunday, 55-year-old Indukala Chauhan was injured after she fell off from the bike of her son Sanjay who failed to spot a pothole on Hazaripahad road. The woman was later declared dead.

After TOI reported on February 12 about Gittikhadan police’s failure to register an offence in this case as per the high court order, it’s reliably learnt that process has started for filing an FIR against the concerned contractor and NMC official.

The so-called pothole that had trapped the ambulance in which Bhushan was being taken has left a family of three dependent women, including two elderly widows, without the sole bread-earner.

Amruta, now the third widow in the family, somehow kept the family of her two children, mother-in-law and mother afloat with a clerical job after her husband’s death. But with a salary of Rs10,000, she is struggling to make ends meet.

After few days of the incident, the high court had taken suo motu cognisance of TOI’s report about rising accidental injuries and deaths due to bad roads and potholes. The court converted the report into a criminal petition.

Amruta, with the help of her brother-in-law lawyer Shashikant and his associate lawyer Anil Kumar, decided to seek justice as an intervener. Amruta has pointed out the trauma her ailing husband and the rest of family and friends faced after the ambulance got stuck in the roadside ditch, which she has mentioned in the affidavit as ‘pothole’.

The ambulance’s heavy tyres got stuck in the roadside ditch which had become mucky and slippery due to rains, Amruta has stated in her affidavit.

KOZHIKODE: In a bid to wean tribesmen away from their deeply-entrenched tobacco-chewing habit, a major cause for cancer, Wayanad’s Ayush department is distributing tobacco-free thamboolam chewing packs in tribal colonies as an experiment.

‘Arogya Thamboolam’, which finds a mention in Siddha medical texts like Siddha Vaidhya Thirattu, comprises betel leaf wrapping containing small quantities of nutmeg, cardamom, cloves, tailed pepper, along with a dash of lime and betel nut.

Ayush tribal medical unit in Wayanad under National Health Mission (NHM) has distributed Arogya Thamboolam packs in many tribal colonies where tobacco chewing is widespread. They plan to cover over 30 colonies identified under the programme.

“There are colonies where over 80% adults have this habit. It has been a major factor in the increased incidents of head and neck cancers among the community. Asking them to stop chewing tobacco will not work and we thought of providing thamboolam packs as a chewing alternative,” said Dr Arun Baby , siddha medical officer under Ayush department in Wayanad.

He said the ingredients in thamboolam packs, mostly spices, can have positive health benefits, but added that betel nut and lime can have side-effects and people should use them in moderation. Dr Baby said the tribal medical unit is giving awareness classes to tribesmen to stop this habit and how to prepare this thamboolam with its ingredients.

“Thamboolam chewing can help resist the temptation of chewing tobacco and spices, which are used to prepare it, are also readily available in the area. We have distributed it in four colonies and the response was positive. But, proper follow-up action and continuous counselling is needed for success,” he added.

NHM district programme manager Dr B Abhilash said the district had a higher rate of oral cancer compared to others in the state and a major cause might be the widespread tobacco-chewing habit. Also, most oral cancers are detected late, leading to lower survival rates.

GUNTUR: BJP state president Kanna Lakshminarayana on Wednesday said criticised chief minister Y S Jaganmohan Reddy for the government plan to shift the capital to Visakhapatnam.

He said BJP will support to Amaravati farmers and back their demand to retain the capital city in Amaravati. A delegation of farmers from Amaravati met Lakshminarayana at his residence on Wednesday and appraised him of the latest situation.

They urged him to protect the interests of farmers and said they have faith in Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Kanna’s comments against the chief minister in the wake of the CM’s meeting Modi in New Delhi on Wednesday.

Addressing the farmers, Kanna said that people were struggling between two gangs of real estate mafia led by Chandrababu Naidu and Jagan. He said Naidu was the chief culprit of making Amaravati a real estate venture instead of building the capital city.

Kanna said Jagan had searched for looting opportunities in Amaravati in the first six months and realized that there was nothing left by Naidu.

“After realizing that there is no avenue to make money, Jagan suddenly decided to move the capital to Visakhapatnam. He sets his eyes only on reaping rich from the capital city,” said Kanna. He said people from Visakhapatnam and Vizianagaram were not in favour of the location of the capital city in their vicinity for fear of losing their precious land to YSRC land sharks.

He said that Jagan had put the state on boil without achieving anything in the last seven months. He said that the CM was thinking that people would back him if freebies are given. “People have realized that the CM would do no good to the poor as he hiked RTC, power and petroleum charges in the last seven months,” Kanna said.

He said the government should withdraw plans to shift the capital city and work for people’s welfare.

Kommineni Satyanarayana, Lanka Sudhakar, Avula Venkateswara Rao, G Swarajya Rao, Kommineni Sivaiah and others were present at the media briefing.

Amaravati: Parents’ committees in over 43,000 schools in the state have backed the government’s plan to make English language the medium of instruction in government schools.

At special emergency meetings of parents’ committees held in schools last week, a majority of committees welcomed the decision to introduce English as the medium of instruction. State education minister Adimulapu Suresh said, “It may be the first time in the history of the state that so many committees have passed a unanimous resolution on one issue.”

Addressing the media here on Wednesday, the minister said the state government had requested feedback from parents’ committees following interim orders from the high court, objections raised by a section of academicians and hurdles in the legislative council. “The committees in all mandals under Kuppam constituency represented by Telugu Desam Party (TDP) president N Chandrababu Naidu have also backed the move to introduce English medium ,” said Suresh.

The government has geared up its administration towards introducing English medium from the upcoming academic year, Suresh said. Training for around 67,000 teachers has also been completed in two phases, the minister added. A special mobile application is also under development to hone teachers’ skills while two IAS officers have been appointed exclusively to oversee the execution of the Amma Vodi scheme and introduction of English medium in public schools .

The minister said the government is studying best practices followed at Oxford University, Cambridge University and other premier institutions in the UK and in Sri Lanka. English labs will be set up at all schools and parents will be given handbooks.

The chief minister, the minister said, has allocated 16 per cent of the state budget for education, the highest allocation in the state’s budget. The government will also distribute Jagananna Vidya Kanuka (a bag with textbooks, notebooks, three sets of cloth for unifroms, two pairs of shoes, a belt and a pair of socks). “The introduction of English medium is no ordinary issue. We are gearing up the entire system to meet the challenge,” said Suresh.

Photo for representative purpose only

KOCHI: The front courtyard of Maharaja’s College will soon have an artificial forest as the college authorities are planning to increase the green cover on the campus as part of its activities supporting reduction of carbon footprint.

According to college officials, the plan is to plant more fruit tree saplings in the area and expand its green cover over the next few years. They are considering modern methods like the Miyawaki, a technique of growing dense plantations in a short time, pioneered by Japanese botanist Akira Miyawaki .

The project will be carried out by the botany department, in association with the National Service Scheme (NSS) unit, and talks are progressing to finalize which kind of fruit plants need to be grown. The works will begin in the next academic year.

“The college is proceeding with various environment-friendly initiatives and the green audit has found that the green cover on the campus plays a major role in reducing carbon footprint. So, we thought of increasing the green cover on the campus and the best way will be growing fruit trees. It will not only increase the greenery but also beautify the front courtyard. Fruit trees will attract more birds to the campus. The plan is to create a forest-like environment on the campus which will act as a lung for the city,” said P K Raveendran , chairman of college governing council.

He also said the college does not want to landscape its campus with artificial lawns. “It should be a natural forest cover without affecting the existing trees. Lawns cannot be created without cutting the trees and we are against cutting the trees,” Raveendran added.

Discussions are also progressing with experts in Miyawaki method as it will help to achieve the goal in a shorter period.

“Miyawaki method is the best way to create green cover in urban spaces. The method assures that plant growth is 10 times faster and the resulting plantation is 30 times denser than usual. It involves planting dozens of native species in the same area, and becomes maintenance-free after the first three years. The government is also promoting such a method but the college governing council is yet to finalise it,” said Sunish KS , Zoology assistant professor and member of governing council.

COIMBATORE: Two drunk men were arrested for abusing police personnel, including a woman traffic police officer, in as many separate incidents in the city on Tuesday.

In the first incident, 34-year-old S Bethukumar, of Ondipudur in the city, was arrested for verbally abusing a special sub inspector attached to Kattoor police station in an inebriated state.

According to a police officer, they had arrested Bethukumar, who was drunk, for disturbing traffic flow and causing inconvenience to the public in the early hours of Tuesday. He was booked under Section 75(1) (b) of Tamil Nadu City Police (TNCP) Act for breaching public peace and then let off on station bail.

“A few hours later, Bethukumar came back to the police station and verbally abused special sub-inspector G Mahalingam for arresting him. While we warned him to leave the station several times, he continued to threaten the official of dire consequences,” the official said.

Subsequently, the special sub inspector lodged a complaint against Bethukumar and the Kattoor police arrested him under Section 294(b) (for uttering obscene words), 353 (for preventing the official from discharging his duty as public servant) and 506(i) (for criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). He was produced before the judicial magistrate, who remanded him in judicial custody. Later, Bethukumar was lodged in the Coimbatore Central Prison.

In a similar incident, the Saravampatti police arrested 27-year-old J Vijayaraj after he abused a woman traffic police officer, who stopped him near Textool in the city on Tuesday for drunk driving.

A police source said the incident took place when M Sudha was on traffic regulation duty. “She stopped him for drunken driving. However, Vijayaraj entered into an altercation with her and threatened her of dire consequences. Based on her complaint, we arrested Vijayaraj under Section 75(1) (b) of the TNCP Act, and Sections 353 and 506 (ii) of the IPC.

312,['13/02/2020'],"Nirbhaya case: Article 21 protects even convict’s rights, says court","This story is from February 13, 2020

Representative image.

NEW DELHI: A condemned convict has the right to exhaust his legal remedies and no court can afford to ignore his fundamental rights , a Delhi court said on Thursday while adjourning the hearing of a plea of Nirbhaya’s parents urging it to fix a date for the four convicts’ execution in the gang rape and murder case.

Additional sessions judge Dharmender Rana said the Supreme Court had posted its order on a petition challenging the rejection of a mercy plea filed by convict Vinay Sharma for Friday. “Article 21 of the Constitution protects the life and liberty of a condemned convict till his last breath,” the court said.

The court felt it was only appropriate to grant some time to legal aid counsel Ravi Kazi, who has been appointed for convict Pawan Gupta, for an “effective representation”, so that it does not become an “illusory” and “superfluous” exercise.

The judge also came on record that following Wednesday’s hearing, when it was learnt that Gupta’s counsel A P Singh was not representing him any longer, a list was given by the Tihar Jail authorities to the convict. But he refused to accept the offer and said he didn’t want any government advocate. But no private counsel was representing him. Hence, advocate Kazi, appointed by the Delhi Legal Services Authority, was, therefore, appointed as a remand advocate.

“The right of legal aid flows from Article 21of the Constitution, which makes no distinction between a law-abiding citizen and a condemned convict while protecting life and liberty against any unlawful violation,” the judge noted.

Earlier, special prosecutor Irfan Ahmed submitted that the apex court hadn’t stayed the proceedings before the trial court. Appearing for Nirbhaya ’s parents, advocates Jitender Kumar Jha and Seema Kushwaha argued in favour of the date of execution. “We are under the will of the people. The Constitution comes second. They (convicts) are testing the patience of the people,” Jha said. He also claimed the convicts were enjoying a “luxurious” life behind the bar with the passage of time.

Convict Mukesh Singh’s advocate Vrinda Grover , however, objected to both statements and said, “It’s the Constitution of India, which embodies the will of the people. It is not subordinate to the will of the people.” Kazi added that the convicts must be “dying each moment every day as they breathe”.

The court will hear the matter again on February 17.

Vijayawada: Despite repeated clarification by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) that Rs 10 coins are valid tender, confusion over its legality continues in the district.

A case in point would be Gandikota Baburao, an owner of a paan shop on Tikkle road, who was found arguing with his customer over the issue on Wednesday. Speaking to TOI, he said, “I have a bunch of Rs 10 coins which I accepted from customers, but now no one is taking them. My daughter has saved over 100 of these coins and all of them are useless.”

After visiting supermarkets, local small shops and malls, TOI found out that while supermarkets and malls are accepting the coins, local kirana shops, fruit vendors and other small businesses did not accept the coins even if they were aware that they are valid tender.

Earlier, notices were issued warning shopkeepers of consequences if they were found refusing Rs 10 coins. Sources in the collector’s office said they have reviewed the issue in detail and even conducted surprise checks. If shops were found refusing to take Rs 10 coins they were issued notices that they could lose their licences. Moreover, successive collectors have issued warnings but the confusion continues.

Officials believe there are several reasons for both consumers and shopkeepers refusing to use the coin. One of the major reasons is attributed to reports on fake 10-rupee coins being found across the country. The other reason is the lack of complaints. Sources said that since, the monetary value of the coin is just Rs 10, people do not go want to go through the hassle of filing a complaint with the revenue department, which, in turn, can take action.

“If the government puts up some bills or poster at market areas stating that Rs 10 coins are legal tender, I think it would give the public and us a sense of confidence that we can take the coin and also spend it. More than notices, people need to be assured,” Kanna Ramu, an owner of a pharmaceutical shop pointed out.

Commerce minister Mekapati Goutham Reddy at the workshop

Vijayawada: Andhra Pradesh State Skill Development Corporation (APSSDC) on Wednesday conducted a workshop on ‘Implementation of Apprenticeship Scheme’ in the city.

Minister for industries and commerce Mekapati Goutham Reddy explained the government’s vision to set up a Skill Development University in Tirupati and High-end Skills University in Visakhapatnam besides 25 skill development colleges across 25 Parliament constituencies in the coming years.

The minister launched the National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme (NAPS).

He said there was a shortage of industry-ready workforce in the country compared to other developed nations. “To overcome the shortage, the state government with the support of the Centre has been planning to take up programmes for creating a world class workforce in the state,” Reddy said.

NAPS senior head Surajit Roy said that the workshop was organised to facilitate awareness and promotion of NAPS across the state.

‘’Apprenticeships are an important and a traditional way of imparting technical skills among students and make them industry-ready.

The recent steps taken by the Centre in promoting apprenticeships are yielding desired results and the same will be replicated in the state with the support of Andhra Pradesh State Skill Development Corporation in the coming months,” he said.

Around 400 students, representatives of local industry associations, private companies and both state and central skill development officials participated in it.

The tussle stems from the BJP government’s decision in 2010 to move the turf club to the outskirts of Bengalur... Read More

BENGALURU: The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) has taken serious exception to the state government for ignoring its recommendation to shut Bangalore Turf Club (BTC). The club is facing charges of conducting races without a valid licence and defaulting on rent.

The PAC, which met on Tuesday, took note of the cabinet’s decision to defer action on its recommendation citing a case pending in the Supreme Court. PAC now plans to seek an explanation from the chief secretary and the advocate general, when it summons them to their next meeting, perhaps later this month.

“It’s unbecoming of the government to take shelter under a court case and sleep on PAC’s recommendation,” said HK Patil, PAC chairman. “What is more unbecoming is that the decision was taken by the cabinet which has no business taking such decisions.”

In December, PAC had asked the government to crack the whip on BTC and take steps to recover Rs 37.4 crore rent outstanding. The cabinet promptly added the issue to its agenda for its meeting on January 6. However, at the meeting, members of the cabinet decided not to take any action against BTC since the club had moved the Supreme Court and secured a status quo order.

“We went by legal advice of the advocate general and the law department,” said deputy chief minister Govind M Karjol. “Although we are keen on resolving the issue, we cannot move till the court disposes of the case.”

Advocate General Prabhuling K Navadagi said the government is aware of the gravity of the issue and it has moved an application before the SC seeking early hearing of the case. “It would amount to contempt of court if the government takes action when the case is pending,” said Navadagi. He said the case could be heard on Friday.

The tussle over BTC dates back to 2010 when the then BJP government decided to shift the club from its present location in the heart of Bengaluru, to the outskirts. BTC moved the Karnataka high court, which ruled in the government’s favour. BTC then filed an appeal in the SC.

“The government has taken the right decision to wait for the SC’s final order. We too are abiding by law,” said BTC chairman D Vinod Shivappa.

However, PAC, which comprises members of the ruling party and the opposition, feels the government is going soft on the club and is not doing enough to get the status quo order vacated.

Former assembly speaker KR Ramesh Kumar, a member of PAC, said, “Although it is not binding, democratic convention suggests the government respect PAC’s recommendation. However, the rules mandate a debate on the PAC’s recommendation after it is tabled in the assembly. This means only the house can take a decision to reject it.”

Legal experts concur. “The government may reject the PAC recommendation, but it has to give proper reason for it on the floor of the house,” said Subhash C Kashyap, former secretary-general of Lok Sabha and Constitution expert.

The government is bound present an action taken report on PAC’s recommendations. Failure could invite disciplinary action against the officials concerned.

VIJAYAWADA: The high court on Wednesday summoned director general of police (DGP) D Gautam Sawang before the court after the judicial inquiry into a habeas carpus petition confirmed that Visakhapatnam police illegally detained a couple .

Reddi Govinda Rao moved the high court with a habeas carpus petition alleging that Visakhapatnam police illegally detained his son Reddi Gowtam and daughter-in-law Ellanti Lochani from their residence in Vijayawada on October 28, 2019. Visakhapatnam police denied the allegations and told the HC that they arrested the wife and husband in Visakhapatnam in a cheating case.

The petitioner challenged the police’s affidavit and presented evidence of Visakhapatnam police coming to their home in Vijayawada. P Ravi Teja, counsel for the petitioner, brought to the notice of the court that the house of his junior Sheik Mohammed Ismail was raided by Patamata police without warrant on November 7, 2019.

Even after the HC gave directions to register a case, Patamata police in Vijayawada ignored the orders and said they would not register case based on the high court orders.

The HC bench headed by Justice Rakesh Kumar and Justice D Ramesh summoned the DGP to be present in person on February 14 to explain the police action.

COIMBATORE: A 25-year-old woman and her 26-year-old husband, who had an inter-caste marriage on Tuesday, have sought police protection from the bride’s family, who has threatened to murder the groom.

Vinitha Selvaraj and her husband Muthukumar Rajendran, working as teachers in a Namakkal-based school, petitioned city police commissioner Sumit Sharan in this regard on Wednesday.

In her complaint, Vinitha, who hails from Sangagiri in Salem, said she is an engineering graduate and that she has been working as a teacher in a school in Thiruchengode, Namakkal. “She said she was in love with Erode-based Muthukumar Rajendran, who works in the school as a physical education master, for more than a year. When she told her parents about the relationship, they opposed it because Muthukumar belonged to the gavara naidu caste, while they were kongu vellalar gounders.”

According to the officer, when Vinitha insisted on marrying Muthukumar, her mother, aunt and uncle K Bhaskar began to threaten her. “They threatened to harass them if they got married and even threatened to kill Muthukumar. When she did not back down, they locked her in her house for days,” the officer said, quoting her complaint.

Vinitha, however, managed to escape from her house on Sunday afternoon and eloped with Muthukumar. The couple took a bus to Coimbatore, where they believed Thanthai Periyar Dravidar Kazhagam was strong, and got married in Gandhipuram on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, they petitioned the city police commissioner. “Since I still fear my family, I seek protection for my husband and myself from my family,” Vinitha said in her complaint.

The couple was sent to the Ramanathapuram all-woman police station, where officers are expected to reach out to the girl’s family.

Aurangabad: As per the directions of the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) commissioner Astik Kumar Pandey, the officials conducted an anti-encroachment drive near Himayat Bagh, Delhi Gate, on Wednesday to remove illegal furniture shops. They then planted saplings at the site.

Incidentally, people have been selling furniture equipment on the road over the past few years. The AMC anti-encroachment department had conducted drives to remove the encroachments in the past, but the sellers used to return to the site.

Subsequently, on Thursday, a squad of the anti-encroachment department of the AMC accompanied by the vigilance squad members and police personnel reached the spot and removed the structures raised for the furniture shops. The team was headed by deputy municipal commissioner Ravindra Nikam and comprised building inspector Mazhar Ali and others.

Police inspector Fahim Hashmi was also present to oversee the drive.

Soon after the removal of encroachments, the AMC squad undertook the plantation of trees at the spot. According to the municipal commissioner, the plantation of trees would prevent the encroachments from reappearing. Incidentally, in a similar fashion, the AMC under Pandey had removed the encroachments at Aamkhas Maidan. Saplings too were planted at the site. Now, the AMC has deployed a member of its vigilance squads at the site to check on any damage to the plants or attempt of encroachments.

However, as the saplings were being planted, a group of MIM corporators reached the mayor’s office and objected to the civic body’s move to plant saplings. They stated that the plantation of trees would come in way of parking in an emergency situation. Mayor Nandkumar Ghodele visited the spot on their insistence but the municipal commissioner refused to accept the MIM’s demands to not plant the trees. Some unidentified individuals also attempted to uproot the newly planted saplings.

However, on the municipal commissioner’s directive, the sapling plantation was completed. The objecting members of the MIM had to leave the spot after police started noting down their names.

PATNA: A nearly 9km four-lane road connecting Mithapur in Patna with Ramgovind Singh Mahuli halt to the east of Patna-Gaya railway line will be built at a cost of Rs 1,030.6 crore by 2022. The state cabinet on Wednesday approved the government’s proposal to build the road, which would have both ‘at grade’ (on surface) and elevated sections.

The road will meet the NH-83 near Mahuli road over-bridge with the starting point in Patna being on the south-west lane of Mithapur flyover. Among the major points on the route will be Mithapur, Sipara, Etbarpur, Kurthaul, Parsa and Mahuli.

“The construction of the road would begin this year and 10% of the work would be completed by the end of it. In 2021, 50% of the work would be completed and it would be finally ready for use by 2022,” cabinet secretariat department principal secretary Deepak Prasad said.

“It would have two under-passes near the Chanakya Law University and below the Sipara flyover, besides a mega bridge, seven small bridges and three culverts. There would be service lanes on both sides of the elevated sections of the road,” Prasad added.

The cabinet also cleared the government’s proposals to amend the existing polytechnic education service rules having a bearing on the appointment of principals, heads of departments and lecturers in polytechnic institutes as prescribed by the All India Technical Education Council (AITEC) Rules -2019. Similarly, the Bihar Engineering Service Rules will also be amended for the appointment of assistant professors, associate professors, professors and principals of engineering colleges in line with the AICTE prescriptions.

The requirement of clearing the National Eligibility Test (NET) and GATE for appointment to polytechnic and engineering colleges has also been abolished.

Further, the aspirants would have to clear the written tests for 40% of the weightage, but the examinations would be objective-type tests. The remaining 60% weightage for the appointment of teachers and principals used to get on account of their participation in seminars, or for presenting research papers, or writing research books, or guiding students in PhD, among other academic activities, have also been revised.

The cabinet also gave its sanction to the restructuring of the police administration ranges by dividing them into five big police ranges and seven smaller ranges, including the railways. While each of the five big ranges would be headed by an IG-rank officer, the smaller ranges would be headed by a DIG. “It has been done to improve the efficiency and remove overlapping in the command chain,” Prasad said.

The five big police ranges are Patna Central, Magadh, Mithila, Purnia and Shahabad. The smaller ranges are Tirhut, Saran, Kosi, Bhagalpur, Munger and Begusarai .

The cabinet approved the release of Rs 630 crore for educational institutes which were earlier covered under the non-aided policy of the government. Further, Rs 75.14 crore has been sanctioned for upgrade of Simultala Residential School infrastructure. Of this sum, Rs 2 crore would be released pertaining to the current fiscal.

The cabinet also cleared the release of Rs 380.60 crore to the water resources department for taking up flood-fighting measures. Further, Rs 432 crore has been sanctioned for the repair and restoration of structures damaged during the July and September floods last year.

321,['13/02/2020'],"AAP won by promising freebies, spreading lies: BJP","This story is from February 13, 2020

Coimbatore: Aam Admi Party’s (AAP) victory in the Delhi assembly elections was achieved through promise of freebies and by spreading lies, BJP leader and former Union minister Pon Radhakrishnan said here on Wednesday.

“Shaheen Bagh protests were a drama enacted for the election. It was successful. Tamil Nadu is trying to repeat the same drama,” he told reporters.

Radhakrishnan said BJP had won all seats in Delhi in the 2019 general elections. “Delhi people have faith in PM Narendra Modi,” he said.

Speaking of political strategist Prashant Kishor’s partnership with DMK, he said Kishor is a talented driver. “But DMK, which he is about to drive, is an old tyreless vehicle.”

Taking a further jibe at DMK, the BJP leader said the party is bankrupt. “They lost their talent along with Kalaignar Karunanidhi.”

BJP has no grudge against actor Vijay, said Radhakrishnan. He denied the allegation that the recent income tax searches were conducted on the premises of the actor as he was against BJP’s policies. “The income tax department is an autonomous body and the I-T officials are doing their job. We can’t direct them to conduct raids.”

Speaking about BJP men causing problems at the actor’s shooting spot at Neyveli coal mine, Radhakrishnan said NLC India Limited, an autonomous body, had not sought prior permission from the Centre before giving its nod for the shoot. “When I visited the mine earlier, I was given protective gear and was accompanied by senior officials of the firm. But if a shooting is held there, how could safety be ensured? On seeing a film shoot, people would get distracted and this might lead to mishaps,” he said.

On reports that Rajinikanth was set to tie up with PMK after his political plunge, the BJP leader said his party wished that it was for good.

Welcoming the state’s move of announcing Cauvery delta districts as protected agriculture zone and not allowing hydrocarbon extraction there, he said a long-standing demand of delta farmers has been met. However, he also said hydrocarbon extraction would not affect agriculture.

Speaking of attacks on the houses of Hindu outfit functionaries, Radhakrishnan said the state should take strict action against the miscreants. “Murder of special sub-inspector Y Wilson in Kanyakumari is a threat to the Tamil Nadu police,” he added.

Representative image

COIMBATORE: With the state government seeking to impose 75% attendance norm for board exams, government schools have been driving the point to students with poor attendance by pulling them up and giving them strict instructions.

School education department officials said they have been instructed to make sure that students are regular to classes and have a minimum attendance of 75%. “The move is to streamline their attendance and make them regular. After festivals and holidays, some students take extra leave for a week. This brings down their attendance and ultimately affects their performance,” said an official.

Sources said the directorate of government examinations (DGE) had issued an instruction to implement the norm from next year and drive the point home.

When contacted, a DGE official said they have enrolled all students for the board exams and have not held back anyone for the lack of attendance. “No such norm has been implemented this year.”

Teachers said while they haven’t been asked to detain any student for lack of attendance, an instruction has been sent to schools to make students aware of the norm. For board exams, there is 10 marks for internals, which also is a component for attendance.

“While most of the students have attendance of more than 90%, some have less than 70%. Internal marks of such students will be reduced. In some cases, because of reducing one or two marks for attendance, some students have failed board exams,” said a teacher.

Some students take leaves for genuine reasons, the teacher said. “Some work part-time and some have families to support. Such students might not have the required attendance. It is unfair to reduce their marks.”

Indore: The semester system that will be implemented from the next academic session is more likely to be a bane than a boon for students as well as the state universities.

Calling semester system a global trend and good for students, education minister of Madhya Pradesh, Jitu Patwari had announced that the varsities will implement it again from the new academic session. However, this decision has put Devi Ahilya Vishwavidyalaya (DAVV) in a tight spot.

Due to study pressure, the students will be left with no time for co-curricular activities as the semesters don’t even allow enough time to complete a course.

The varsity will have to follow both annual and semester systems for some years now as there are over one lakh students that now in yearly system who will be continuing with it till the end. DAVV will now have to conduct 31 examinations of over 1.6 lakh students twice every year which will also double the burden of getting the answersheets evaluated.

It was after a long struggle of delays in results that the varsity had started releasing them on time but due to this change, it might go off track again.

“Though most of those students who are in the yearly system will clear the exams and get a degree, there will still be a section of students who will not be able to complete their degrees in the stipulated time and we will have to continue taking yearly exam for them,” DAVV exam controller Dr Ashesh Tiwari told TOI.

The varsity will have to get the answersheets evaluated twice a year which in itself is a burden, but staff crunch will add on to that woe. Apart from the regular evaluation, the revaluation and assessment of Allowed to Keep Term (ATKT) copies will also become a task, he added.

324,['13/02/2020'],Nagpur still dumping 80% mixed garbage in Bhandewadi yard,"This story is from February 13, 2020

<p>Bhandewadi yard<br></p>

NAGPUR: Even after appointing two new agencies — AG Enviro and BVG India — for door-to-door segregated garbage collection, the city’s dumping yard, Bhandewadi , is getting mixed garbage. Though the city generates 1100-1200 metric tonnes (MT) of garbage every day, only 20% of the segregated waste is being transported to the dumping yard.

Municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe on Wednesday stressed the need for scientific disposal of garbage at the Bhandewadi dumping yard. Mundhe also directed the solid waste management department to lift only segregated garbage.

The civic chief visited the Bhandewadi dumping yard in the morning and was accompanied by deputy director of solid waste management, Dr Pradeep Dasarwar, superintending engineer of the water works department, Shweta Banerjee and deputy engineer Rajesh Dupare.

Apart from getting to know the intricacies of waste management at the dump yard, Mundhe also took into account the method behind transportation of waste via weight.

Mundhe was appalled on seeing the mountain-like garbage heap at the yard. He was utterly disappointed to see mixed garbage being brought to the yard.

The NMC owns around 77 acres in Bhandewadi of which 52 acres is being used for dumping garbage, while 25 acres is for the sewage treatment plant. The dumping area is already full to capacity. While nearly 10 lakh MT of untreated garbage is lying in the yard, garbage in lakhs of MT have been gutted in fires.

Since the NMC had entrusted a private firm for door-to-door garbage collection, the city has generated over 40 lakh metric tonnes of garage in the last one decade and dumped it in the Bhandewadi yard.

At present, the city is generating 1100-1200 MT of garbage daily, but only 20% of segregated garbage is being transported to the dumping yard.

Mundhe directed the SWM department to ensure that the two agencies appointed for collecting door-to-door garbage daily should lift segregated garbage only. “Give residents three chances by imposing a fine and if they fail to handover segregate garbage, stop lifting it from their homes,” said Mundhe.

So far, the NMC has imposed fines amounting to Rs8 lakh on both the garbage lifting agencies — AG Enviro and BVG India — since they took over the operations from Kanak Resources Management Limited.

Mundhe has asked the SWM to ensure that both agencies transport only segregated garbage to the yard.

“Due to the unscientific disposal of garbage at the dumping yard, air pollution has increased manifold in this part of the city,” said Mundhe.

The municipal commissioner has given top priority to processing waste in a scientific manner. The NMC has already reclaimed 25 acres of land in the Bhandewadi dumping yard through bio-mining.

Pawan Kalyan with the mother of the girl in Kurnool on Wednesday

Jana Sena chief Pawan Kalyan , who started his tour of Kurnool district on Wednesday, demanded justice for the 14-year-old tribal girl who was brutally raped and murdered at Cattamanchi Ramalinga Reddy school on August 19, 2017. Kurnool SP Kaginelli Fakeerappa had announced on Tuesday that the case was being handed over to the CBI.

Accompanied by family members of the victim, the actor-turned-politician launched his rally from Rajvihar circle in Kurnool demanding speedy probe and justice for the girl. “Three years have gone by, but justice still remains a far cry for the victim’s family. I have assured the family that I will fight for them till she gets justice and the culprits are punished,” he said.

Pawan lamented that the criminal justice system in the country continues to favour the rich and powerful, while the poor is often at the receiving end. “Despite the post-mortem reports confirming that the girl was raped and forensic evidences substantiating the heinous crime, the accused are still roaming around freely as the case investigating officers danced to the tunes of political leaders who stalled the progress of the case,” he alleged.

He also urged chief minister Jaganmohan Reddy to fast-track the investigation. “The incident took place when TDP was in power. The CM should take corrective steps and render justice to the victim’s family,” he added.

Vijayawada: Endangered iron age pillars—known as Menhirs or ‘avenues’ in archaeological parlance—are now under serious threat of being destroyed at Nelatur Gollapalli village, which falls under Kanigiri mandal in Prakasam district. Archaeologist and CEO of Cultural Centre of Vijayawada and Amaravati (CCVA) E Sivanagi Reddy explained that these Menhirs hold archaeological significance as it holds the memory of the dead from the megalithic period.

Based on the information given by Jyothi Chandramouli, an historian based in Addanki, the CEO of CCVA, along with his staff, rushed to the spot as part of their ‘Preserve Heritage for Posterity’, a scheme launched to sensitise the local people on the archaeological significance of various neglected monuments. Reddy said that there are more than one hundred granite pillars erected across 25 acres, towards the north–east corner of Gollapalli village.

The Menhirs, erected in front of burials from the Iron Age indicated by a heap of pebbles spread across the entire area. The Menhirs vary in shape and size measuring anywhere between 3-4 feet at the base and 6 to 10 feet in height above the ground level (and 4-5 feet buried in the ground), with a thickness of 9-18 inches.

“These monuments reflect the engineering skills and collective effort taken by people in the Iron Age in collecting and planting them in front of the burials. It is unfortunate that these archaeological remains, which bear lot of historical significance of not only the Prakasam district but also the state of Andhra Pradesh, are misused by the local people as building materials,” Reddy told TOI.

Villagers say that twenty years back there were more than hundred pillar . Now, there are only 20-25 remaining. Locals revealed that profuse quantity of pot shreds including red-ware, black-ware, black and red-ware along with iron implements were seen at the time of widening the road and the digging for irrigation canal many years ago, which indicated evidence of the Iron Age.

Reddy appealed to the AP government to initiate action and declare the site as a protected monument.

Aurangabad: The Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has sent a detailed project report (DPR) for construction of 110 roads and 11 bridges worth Rs 462.08 crore to the state urban development department for administrative approval.

The civic body has already secured the technical approval from the Public Works Department (PWD). The project was first announced by former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis in January 2019. However, the AMC had failed to finalise the list of roads to be undertaken for makeover under the project.

Later, when the list of 104 roads was sent by the AMC, the urban development department issued guidelines to ensure that the project should only include development plan (DP) roads.

In the meeting held by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray at the divisional commissionerate on January 9, the AMC was directed to prepare a DPR of the road project, get technical approval from the PWD and present it to the government.

Subsequently, the project management consultancy appointed for the project by the AMC prepared a DPR following inspection of the roads keeping in mind the guidelines by the urban development department and based on the list of roads approved by the general body.

Chief engineer of the PWD scrutinised the works estimated by the AMC to be worth Rs 458.46 crore. The general technical approval was given for Rs 462.08 crore.

Mayor Nandkumar Ghodele said that the AMC submitted the DPR with the PWD’s approval to the chief secretary and principal secretary urban development department on February 11.

Indore: They may wind up their show in city in a day or two or maybe a week and then head to Chhindwara for another performance but staff and artistes of Asiad circus are living in a constant state of fear and uncertainty --- fear of losing employment, fear of uncertain future due to dwindling number of spectators.

The 25-year- old circus has set up its stage at Lal Bagh Palace ground and has been churning out performances for last 20 days, but has not able to gain much interest of Indoreans.

The shows have seen around 40 per cent viewership and the low numbers have left staff and artistes wondering --- which show would be the last and when?

“The real essence of circus was lost after Animal Welfare Board banned use of animals in shows. So far 350 circuses across the country have run out of business as audience often came to watch stunts performed by animals,” Asiad circus organizer Satish Raj said.

“Digital era hammered final nail into the coffin of circus industry. The new generation is so busy with gizmos that it has no idea about concept of circus, society’s earliest form of entertainment before TV,’ he said.

The circus management has made last ditch efforts to increase ticket sales. One of them has been hiring trapeze artistes from Russia at a higher pay scale compared to Indian performers.

“How long this hiring of foreign performers to keep show running, will help is a thing to be seen. The concept of circus will be extinct if no campaign is initiated by people to save it. At present, only 13 circuses are operating in country,” circus manager, Kuldeep Balyan said.

With ticket sales falling, the staff and artistes are worried about their source of income. “I have spent more than six decades in circus industry as a ring master, but with the industry now fading away, its’ hard to imagine future without a secure source of income,” ringmaster Bablu said.

“In the old days, average pay of a performer ranged between Rs8,000 and Rs12,000 per day. This has now dropped to Rs2,500-1,500 per day, creating economic turmoil in our lives,” Panchal, who plays, joker said.

Nashik: The city police have proposed to the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) and the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) to set up a traffic signal at Dwarka junction.

The signal will help to manage the flow of vehicles coming from Mumbai, Dhule, Nashik City and Nashik Road routes.

DCP (Traffic and HQ) Pournima Chougule said, “We have already mitigated the traffic problem at Dwarka. The signal system will streamline the vehicular traffic further.”

Meanwhile, there has been an unsuccessful attempt to manage the vehicular flow at the junction with the help of signal seven to eight years back. However, this time, police believe that the traffic signal will help solve the problem to a great extent.

“The main problem is that of heavy goods vehicles and private passenger buses at the junction. Over the past few days, the flow of vehicles at the junction is only of light vehicles and city buses as well as heavy vehicles have been barred from using the junction from 8 am to 10 pm. Hence, we are sure that the traffic signal would be even more convenient for streamlining the traffic,” Chougule said.

Last month, district guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal had called a meeting with senior officials of the NHAI with respect to taking stock of various problems pertaining to the Mumbai-Agra highway passing through the city. He had also instructed the NHAI to set up a signal to get rid of the traffic chaos faced on a daily basis.

Subsequently, city police had plunged into action to streamline the vehicular traffic at the junction. They barred the movement of heavy goods and passenger vehicles at the junction from 8 am to 10 pm.

As a next step, the police have written to the municipal corporation and the NHAI to set up a signal at the junction which will further stremaline the movement of vehicles.

“We are also encouraging pedestrians to use the subway and the concerned authorities responsible for the upkeep of the subway have been instructed to ensure proper illumination inside the underground structure so that pedestrians start using it.” Chougule added.

Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal along with AAP MP Sanjay Singh during a meeting with newly-elected party MLAs

NEW DELHI: The new AAP government is planning to hit the ground running as soon as Arvind Kejriwal takes oath as the chief minister along with his cabinet on Sunday.

In the next six months, the new government will push the pending work of the previous term such as creation of more Wi-Fi hotspots, installation of streetlights and another 1.4 lakh CCTV cameras, and introduction of more public buses. It will also prepare a detailed action plan to improve public transport, fight pollution, and clean the Yamuna and develop the riverfront. Sanitation will be another important area where the government is likely to work in collaboration with the municipal corporations, dominated for long by BJP.

Before the model code of conduct for the February 8 assembly elections came into force, 100 Wi-Fi hotspots came alive. Another 10,900 hotspots are likely to be installed in different parts of Delhi.

Bringing more buses are also high on the priority list to boost the city’s public transport system. At least 1,300 electric buses are to be brought besides 3,000 CNG buses — 1,000 for DTC and 2,000 for cluster scheme — in the first six months. A total of 1,000 cluster buses will be airconditioned.

The previous government had approved 4,300 new buses, some of which were brought in different phases. Among these were 529 standard-floor buses with hydraulic lifts, which were added under the cluster scheme since August 2019.

A total of 1.4 lakh CCTV cameras were installed by the end of the previous AAP government’s term. The cabinet then approved installation of another 1.4 lakh cameras as the previous drive was found to be inadequate to meet the safety needs of the public.

A project to install 2.5 lakh streetlights to make Delhi free of dark spots was also started before the elections but couldn’t be finished. AAP now hopes to complete this project in the next six months.

Backed by the huge mandate in the February 8 elections, AAP is hoping to work unfettered in this term, said a source. Last time, Delhi government had to deal with a power tussle with the Centre and the lieutenant governor (LG), the central government’s representative in the national capital. The contentious issue was settled after the Supreme Court in February 2019 made it clear that the elected government does not need the approval of the LG for policy decisions.

The new government will also build on the gains made earlier in the priority sectors like education, environment, water delivery and road infrastructure. Kejriwal has also promised during the campaign to induce the municipal corporations to do a better job.

Aurangabad: As many as 10,000 people participated on the first day of a signature campaign to seek a stay on shifting of the Bank of Maharashtra’s Roshan Gate branch on Wednesday.

The branch is being merged with another branch of the Bank of Maharashtra at Bajarang Chowk. However, the account holders in the bank said that the move would cause them inconvenience.

The Roshan Gate branch of Bank of Maharashtra is the only nationalised bank within a 2 -km radius.

Mohsin Ahmed, the working president of City District Congress Committee said, “There are 25 primary schools, 15 high schools, three night schools and three to four senior and junior colleges in the area. There is no branch of any nationalised bank closer than the State Bank of India branch at Cidco. Then there are branches at Roza Bagh, Harsul, Shahgunj and Jalna Road.”

The administration and students of Iqra High School, Amanullah Motiwala Primary School, Sarosh Urdu Primary School, Al-Huda Primary School and Amir Primary School, among other schools, participated in the campaign.

Ahmed said that more people are willing to open their bank accounts in the branch. The branch was opened at the location in 2015 and there have been no issues by the account holders or residents, he said. “The people who borrowed loans have been regularly paying off their loans,” he said. Letters have been written to the finance minister and the RBI governor seeking a stay on shifting of the branch.

When asked, zonal branch manager of Bank of Maharashtra Ahilaji Thorat said that in the profitability survey, the branches that have been running in losses for several years are merged with other branches.

“The decision is not specific to the Roshan Gate branch. We have taken a decision for other such branches,” Thorat said. He said that the other bank is also not too far from the existing branch.

Dharmapuri: Students of a government higher secondary school in Alepuram village near Pennagaram here have discovered ancient coins that were in use during the times of Cholas, Haider Ali, Vijayanagar kingdom, Tipu Sultan and Mysore Udayar while they were levelling the playground as part of National Service Scheme (NSS) activity on Tuesday.

Headmaster M Chinnaswamy said a total of 37 coins were discovered by the student team led by history teacher Murugan. He said he had invited C Chandrasekar, assistant professor, history department, Dharmapuri Arts College, and members of Thonmam Historical Research Trust to look into the coins.

According to the team, two copper coins in the collection were used during the Vijayanagara period. Chandrasekar said the coins belonged to the periods of Cholas, Haider Ali, Vijayanagar kigdom, Tipu Sultan and Mysore Udayar (1834).

He said the school playground could have been housed a mint manufacturing unit in the period of Haider Ali. His research team has discovered more coins from the ground. “This could have been a trading place at that time. Dharmapuri is known as the gateway of Tamil Nadu and the Sri Lakshmi Narasimha temple, which still share a portion of the school campus, used to accommodate travellers.”

Chandrasekar said the coins could throw light into the year that were made, ruler at that time, technology was in use, and a country’s border, wealth, weather, metal, crops, animals and culture. He said they would conduct further research to document the historical details regarding the coins. ""The school campus will be carefully monitored by the school management and Thonmam volunteers,” Chandrasekar said.

Nashik: The Nashik police are on the lookout of a private tour operator, who allegedly cheated 14 customers to the tune of Rs 79.50 lakh.

The police received a complaint on Tuesday against the tour operator, who had set up an office of the tour company in the D’souza Colony area of the city. The complainant told the police that between November 7 and December 6 last year, he had paid Rs 16 lakh to the tour operator to arrange a Sri Lanka tour for his family.

Thereafter, though he asked tour operator to give him receipts for the payment made and air tickets from time to time, it was not provided. Finally, when he came to know about others who had been similarly duped, he approached the police. A case of cheating has been registered with the Gangapur police station.

According to the police, the tour operator has allegedly cheated 13 other customers in a similar manner and collected Rs 79.50 lakh from them on the assurance of providing a tour package for Sri Lanka. However, since December 6, the tour operator has closed down the office.

Assistant inspector Naresh Baisane of the Gangapur police station, who is investigating the case, said they had not yet succeeded in locating the tour operator, who is a Nashik resident. “We had gone to the operator’s residence. We were told that the operator has not come home for the past 10 to 12 days and the family has registered a missing complaint. We are investigating the matter,” he said.

Baisane said a large number of people could have been cheated by the tour operator concerned and they should approach the police to register their complaints.

There have been many such incidents in the city in which tour operators have collected money from their customers by offering foreign tours. However, as the date of the tour approached, the tour operator concerned flee.

Citizens have been on a sit-in protest against the CAA for the past 36 days in Aurangabad

AURANGABAD: Around 50 protesters were taken into preventive detention by police when they staged a ‘ jail bharo ’ demonstration against the CAA, NRC and NPR at Aurangabad ’s ‘ Shaheen Bagh ’ on Wednesday. Citizens from different communities, including women and children, have been on a sit-in agitation in front of the divisional commissionerate for the past 36 days.

The protesters intensified their agitation on Wednesday and tried to march towards the divisional commissionerate while deliberately avoiding to take police permission, leading to their detention. Begumpura police personnel soon rounded up 50 protesters, bundled them into two vans and took them to the police station from the spot.

Police inspector Sachin Sanap said that the protesters were detained under section 68 (persons bound to conform to reasonable orders of police) and section 69 (power of police officers to restrain or remove, etc) of the Bombay Police Act, 1951. They were allowed to leave after issuing of a notice and warning. Abhay Taksal of CPI said, “The government has played the CAA card to cover up its failure to provide water, education, jobs and housing. The results of the Delhi assembly elections have amply proved that citizens of the country, including the Hindu community, want education, jobs and basic amenities, rather than CAA.”

A gang of cyber crooks, who were wanted in connection with an online fraud committed in Mydukur, have been arrested by a special team of Kadapa police from Delhi. The gang had cheated a woman of Rs 10,000 in the garb of insurance officers last month and were on the run.

Police said the accused called Giddaluru Umadevi of Mydukur town on the pretext of depositing some bonus in her bank account and managed to persuade her to divulge her ATM card and bank account details.

No sooner did Umadevi reveal the details, an amount of Rs 10,000 got debited from her account. Umadevi then approached the Mydukur police, who handed over the case to the cyber cell at Kadapa.

The cyber cops arrested one Veera Nagaiah, who told the cops that he and three of his friends were offered a call centre job in Delhi by one Siva from Mydukur.

Their job was to call various mobile numbers randomly and secure the bank account details of customers picking up the call by coaxing them with cheap and lucrative offers. They then used to pass on the details to Delhi-based Sumit Bansal, Sivaratri Karthik and Narala Karthik.

Based on Nagaiah’s confession, Kadapa SP KKN Anburajan formed a special team headed by Mydukur inspector, which went to Delhi and arrested the three cyber criminals.

The police also arrested 15 local youth working in the ‘call centre’ and brought them to Kadapa on transit warrant.

Nashik: The Nashik division of the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary & Higher Secondary Education (MBSHSE) has directed the invigilators to reach the examination halls at least half-an-hour before the scheduled commencement of examinations.

The divisional authorities of the board held a meeting a few days back with the school principals and teachers association to discuss details about the forthcoming HSC and SSC examinations

The president and secretary of the Nashik division of the board, Krishna Kumar Patil and Nitin Upasani were present in the deliberations.

In Nashik district, over 75,000 students would appear for the HSC examination scheduled to start from February 18. Similarly, over 97,000 students of the district would sit for the SSC exam beginning March 3. “The meeting was organised to brief the teachers about various aspects of the HSC and SSC examinations so that it passes smoothly,” said officials.

The school teachers have been instructed to ensure that the examiners refrain from adopting unfair means while writing the examination. And the schools must counsel the students before the beginning of the examination to make them stress free.

The board authorities have also asked the principals and teachers to ensure that the oral, practical and internal tests are carried out smoothly. They have advised them to talk to the parents if possible so that they do not create unnecessary pressure on their children taking up the examinations.

On part of the principals and teachers association, they have requested the board authorities to refrain from engaging teachers aged over 55 years and those suffering from various ailments for evaluation of answer scripts.

“We have also suggested to the board that it must involve experienced teachers in the flying squads that the board sets up to visit the examination centres. These experienced teachers can aid in identifying students resorting to unfair practice during the examination,” the association members said adding that they have also demanded an increase in remuneration of teachers involved in examination work.

344,['13/02/2020'],Parents call for closer look at address proofs in RTE,"This story is from February 13, 2020

CLEARED SKHER

Aurangabad: Parent groups have sought crackdown on the use of bogus leave and license agreements to gain admissions under 25% reserved quota in schools.

The process for admissions under the Right To Education (RTE) began on Wednesday across the state. The leave and license agreement is considered a valid address proof of beneficiaries. Parents from Aurangabad claimed that bogus agreements were submitted last year to obtain admission in top schools from the city.

The education department authorities have declared a collective intake capacity of 5,043 seats in 584 schools from Aurangabad district for the academic year 2020-21.

Educational activist Prashant Sathe said the education department should either discontinue leave and license agreement as address proof or ensure stringent scrutiny of the same while screening applications made under the RTE Act.

“The practice of submitting bogus leave and license agreement has become rampant during RTE admissions. We personally came across over 300 such cases last year and brought it to the notice of the education department. The parents are manipulating their address details by making false entries in the leave and license agreement to show that they live in the vicinity of top schools,” he said.

Under section 6 of the RTE Act, the central RTE Rules have notified the area or limits of neighbourhood school as one kilometre, within which a primary school and three kilometre within which an upper primary school, is available.

Claiming that the issue of using false leave and license agreement could have been influencing the RTE admissions across the state, parents have demanded corrective measures in the enrollment and admission process for the benefit of genuine beneficiaries of the RTE Act.

The RTE Act 2005 provides every child of the age of six to 14 years, the right to free and compulsory education in a neighbourhood school till the completion of elementary education. The idea of neighbourhood schools can be traced to the National System of Education as elaborated in the Kothari Commission report, whereby the neighbourhood school is meant to be “a common space, where all children cutting across caste, class, gender lines learn together in the best inclusive manner.”

When contacted, education officer (Primary) with Aurangabad zilla parishad S P Jaiswal assured that he would look into the issue of submission of false leave and license agreements.

Jaiswal, who was busy attending a meeting of the education department at Pune, could not be reached for detailed comments. Dinkar Temkar, joint director of the primary education and RTE in-charge for Maharashtra, did not respond to phone calls made to him in connection with the issue.

Dharmapuri: At least 13 Class XII students of the government higher secondary school in Begarahalli village were admitted to Dharmapuri government hospital with stomach pain and vomiting on Wednesday, after they reportedly consumed sesame balls that were laced with rat poison.

According to the Karimangalam police, the sesame balls were brought to the school by P Dhanapal, a student. “His parents had laced them with rat poison the previous night. However, Dhanapal was not aware of that. He brought the sesame balls to the school and distributed among his friends on Wednesday,” a police officer said.

After having them, the students developed stomach pain and started vomiting. At one stage, they swooned on the floor.

Shocked, the schoolteachers alerted the Karimangalam police and took the students to a nearby primary health centre, where doctors provided them first aid and referred them to the Dharmapuri government medical college and hospital. Doctors at the government hospital said the condition of the students were stable.

The Karimangalam police have registered a case and further inquiry is on.

Delhi BJP Chief Manoj Tiwari meets newly-elected party MLAs, at the BJP office in New Delhi on Wednesday. TOI ... Read More

NEW DELHI: A day after Bharatiya Janata Party’s crushing defeat in the assembly elections, Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari reportedly offered his resignation, but it was refused by the central leadership.

A source claimed that Tiwari had contacted a top party functionary and offered to step down as the Delhi unit chief. “He offered to resign but the senior leadership told him that it was not necessary. He has been asked to continue,” said a BJP functionary, who was privy to the development.

Tiwari, however, told reporters on Wednesday that “neither have I been asked to resign nor have I offered my resignation” in the wake of the party’s poor show in the assembly elections in the capital.

Addressing a press conference on Tuesday after the announcement of the election results, Tiwari said whether he would continue as the Delhi BJP chief or step down was the party’s “internal matter”.

Tiwari, who was appointed as Delhi BJP president in November 2016, has already completed his three-year tenure. The organisational elections of the party, which was due last year, were postponed because of the assembly elections.

A source said the elections for the Delhi unit would be held soon and its new president might be appointed immediately after that. “It does not make sense to run a state unit by an interim president for a couple of months when the organisational polls are due. The incumbent chief can continue till then. There is absolutely no need for his removal now,” said another BJP functionary.

Hoping to make a comeback in the capital after being in exile for 21 years, BJP went all out to impress voters during the campaign. But it managed to win just eight seats in the 70-member House while Aam Aadmi Party has bagged 62. The party’s vote share, combined with those of Janata Dal (United) and Lok Janshakti Party, however, was 8% more in comparison to 2015. The saffron camp won just three seats in 2015.

Confident of the party’s good performance, several BJP leaders had rubbished the exit poll predictions and claimed the party would win 45 seats and form the government. However, the exit polls were proved right on Tuesday.

Aurangabad: With the state directorate of medical education and research (DMER) seeking acquisition of 26.5-acre land, the new medical college in Osmanabad is soon set to become a reality

As per official communication, the identified land is situated near a state-run hospital in Osmanabad where the new medical college is slated to come up with an intake capacity of 150 seats.

Earlier last year, the District Planning and Development Council (DPDC) had already approved the proposal for setting up the medical college and constituted a committee of experts to push the matter. The panel also offered a go-ahead for the proposed institution and it was recently brought to the notice of DMER officials.

With this new college, the total number of medical colleges in Marathwada is slated to go up to five. Aurangabad, Ambajogai (Beed district) and Nanded have government medical colleges in the region along with an aided institution in Latur.

Following a series of ToI reports that highlighted the injustice caused to students from Marathwada due to 70% regional quota in medical admissions in Maharashtra, the state legislature during April 2018 witnessed a heated debate over the issue, prompting the then medical education minister Girish Mahajan to announce setting up of a new medical college in Osmanabad.

While the proposal briefly went into oblivion due back-to-back elections, new Medical education minister Amit Deshmukh recently asked DMER to expedite the related processes.

Shiv Sena MLA from Osmanabad Kailas Ghadge Patil, who followed up the demand for speedy establishment of the new medical college in his constituency, said the proposed institution would help Marathwada overcome the educational backlog in terms of medical seats.

349,['13/02/2020'],Give two helmets or we will stop vehicle registration in Maharashtra: HC to automobile companies,"This story is from February 13, 2020

Representative image

NAGPUR: Reiterating its tough stand on failure of automobile manufacturers and dealers to provide two free helmets to all two-wheeler buyers, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Wednesday warned it would stop registration of vehicles in Maharashtra if they don’t comply with the norms.

Granting six weeks to the state government and transport commissioner to intimate all manufacturers to strictly comply with Central Motor Vehicles Rules (CMVR), 1989, a division bench comprising justices Ravi Deshpande and Amit Borkar directed government pleader Sumant Deopujari to file a compliance report.

While hearing a PIL by social workers Saurabh Bharadwaj and Manish Singh Chauhan contending CMVR’s gross violation, the bench asked respondents to ensure that all rules are strictly followed.

Quoting the CMVR, the petitioners through counsel Avdesh Kesari pointed out that two-wheeler manufacturers and dealers are under obligation to provide two protective headgears (helmets) to buyers, for driver and pillion rider, to conform to specifications of the ‘Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) Act, 1986’. Currently, one helmet is being provided to customers while delivering the vehicle.

Supporting petitioners’ contention, Deopujari said the government had already written a letter, in 2016, to all two-wheeler manufacturers to comply with CMVR by providing two helmets to the buyers, but they didn’t follow it.

Earlier, all 16 dealers appeared before the HC after being summoned in last hearing. They included Tajshree, Sudarshan, Rishikesh, Arun, Nangia, KTM, Kusumgar, Paragon, AK Gandhi, Mascot, Universal, Jaika and Unnati. All of them sell various brands of two-wheelers, but most of them had failed to file replies to HC’s repeated directives.

The dealers tried to pass the buck of supplying helmets to automobile manufacturers and prayed for adding them as respondents in the PIL. The judges, however, slammed them asking why it took them over a year to file replies. They also asked dealers how much cost they would pay for the inordinate delay in filing reply. They further warned they would stop registration of all vehicles in state, but the dealers requested them to reconsider since it would lead to havoc and automobile sales would come to a standstill.

Praying for directives to state transport ministry to initiate probe against RTO and file report, the petitioners requested respondents to act against dealers and manufacturers who fail to provide helmets to customers. They also demanded dealers should pay compensation to family members of victims who died in road accidents without wearing helmets.

351,['13/02/2020'],A designer who saw sense in sustainability,"This story is from February 13, 2020

Wendell Rodricks always stood apart. Be it with his life mantra “lived less is lived more” or his now legendary minimalistic style of garments. But beyond the glamour that was a constant in his life, Rodricks was a visionary and a disciplined one at that.

His vision extended from incorporating sustainability in fashion to reviving the very grassroots of fashion—the weaver. In an interview to TOI, the man whose couture was created around organic fabrics and natural dyes once said, “Fashion, especially fast fashion, is a very polluting industry greatly promoted by disposable income.”

He had gone on to explain how fast fashion did not give a fig for the environment. “No one cares that two tonnes of water go into making a cotton T-shirt or that millions of tonnes of pesticides and dyes are adding toxic chemical waste to the earth, while micro-fibre waste from textiles are suffocating water bodies with plastic overload,” he said, the passion in his voice unmistakable, unforgettable.

These were words he lived by. “I have shirts over 20 years old which I have darned and reused,” he told TOI, while advocating the use of soapnuts instead of detergent. “It affords both clothes and Mother Earth longevity.”

To explain the concept, he said, “Look at women of the older generation. See how they valued every item in their compact cupboard. A tear did not necessitate the garment be scrapped. It would be darned, upcycled or recycled.”

His friend and creative director of Pernia’s Pop-Up Shop, Anjana Sharma, tells TOI, “Whether it was promoting eco-friendly fashion or the weaver or bringing the kunbi weave back from extinction, he was a visionary.”

Another friend and CEO of Malabar Escapes, Shaji Joseph, who still wears classics from his two-decade-old Wendell collection, labels him a genius. “For over a decade I worked with Wendell and the weavers of Cochin. He was fascinated by the mundu and built an entire collection with the weavers in which he lent the fabric contemporary relevance,” he said.

For any designer, volumes are most desirable, or so one would think. But not for Rodricks. In this too he believed in minimalism. Sharma said Rodricks would always tell her to buy fewer pieces, but buy that which would see her through the years. “And his clothes were like that. Timeless. Durable,” she said.

As editor of The Voice of Fashion, an online fashion and design magazine Shefalee Vasudev once said, “Wendell always stood apart. His identity is not just limited to Goa being his muse and inspiration.”

New Delhi: About 15 lakh people from all over the country joined Aam Aadmi Party’s Rashtra Nirman (nation-building) campaign by giving a missed called on a number within 48 hours of its launch, the party said on Thursday.

The number — 9871010101 — was launched immediately after AAP won yet another election with a massive mandate, getting 62 seats in the 70-member Delhi House. BJP, the main political rival, won the remaining eight.

“It is historical that politics of work is getting such a large support for nation building from people across the country,” the statement added.

AAP further said that BJP tried to polarise voters by keeping the election campaign around “Hindu-Muslims” while the Kejriwal-led party sought votes in the name of work done.

“AAP kept the campaign around basic issues and the politics of work. The voters of Delhi have shown faith in AAP and it is politics of development,” the party said. TNN

KOLKATA: Ashura, a rag picker and a mother of five children — the sole “witness” to what had happened inside the Sinthee police station minutes before Rajkumar Shaw (53) died in the police custody on Monday — had gone “missing” on Tuesday morning after she alleged that Shaw had been tortured in the police station.Ashura was “traced 38 hours later”.Late on Wednesday, cops said Ashura was traced to her relative’s home and given police protection. A senior police officer said, “No missing complaint was lodged. She has been traced and she is safe. We are providing her police protection.” He added that the protection was given to her because “she is a prime witness for the case”. Ashura, who was earlier detained as a suspect, reportedly told the police that Shaw had bought stolen goods from her.The victim’s family alleged on Wednesday that the scrap dealer was asked by the Sinthee police to buy “certain items” in kind or pay up in cash to “settle matters.” The cops — three of whom have been “closed” pending departmental enquiry — allegedly used a personal diary page (issued to them by the department to help keep a note of probe progress) to jot down a serial number (E-8072) and list out certain items.These items included construction materials, marble polish and bathroom fittings that match with the ones “stolen” from a Sinthee promoter on January 17. The family claimed Shaw had been told that the only way he could walk out was that he would have to pay for these items. City detectives are probing the allegation.According to Abdul Aziz, a security guard of the night shelter on Raja Manindra Road, Ashura was last seen around 8.30am on Tuesday, hours after Shaw’s death had led to trouble and clashes at Sinthee police station on Monday night.Ashura, who is pregnant, reportedly left with her infant daughter and 14-year-old son, but she left behind three of her other children. On Monday evening, she had alleged how she had been asked to name Shaw as a suspect, to whom she had sold the stolen items.“After interrogating her, cops summoned Shaw to the police station. “They hit him on his face and chest with a boot. He was taken inside a dark room and assaulted. When he was about to die, cops told me to leave, saying they did not know anything about me,” Bibi recounted before the media.“We are contacting both the families soon through the homicide section. We are recording the statement of all three cops who are allegedly involved in this case and have seized all the CCTV footage .

355,['13/02/2020'],Maharashtra Cabinet: State cabinet approves Rs 2 crore annual fund for juvenile homes in Maharashtra,"This story is from February 13, 2020

Representative image

MUMBAI: The Maharashtra cabinet on Wednesday approved a Juvenile Justice Fund for the welfare and rehabilitation of children in juvenile homes across the state .

The cabinet approved a proposal to make a Rs 2 crore annual budgetary provision for the fund.

This will be used for the welfare of more than 21,178 children in over 560 juvenile homes across the state.

Yashomati Thakur, minister for women and child welfare, said the children’s medical expenses for major illnesses, school, higher education and skill development, besides help in setting up businesses, among other things, will be provided through this fund. “This is to help integrate the children into mainstream society,” said Thakur.

The Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, mandates setting up of such a fund for children in institutional care. A similar provision is included in the Maharashtra State Juvenile Justice Rules, 2018. According to this rule, a fund was set up under the Women and Child Welfare Commissionerate, which accepts funds from individuals, trusts and corporate social responsibility (CSR). The new fund has been created to enable the government to provide finances for these children. It will be used to implement programmes that are not covered under any state or central government scheme.

Psychiatrist Dr Harish Shetty, who has been a member of a Bombay high court-appointed committee to investigate sexual assault incidents at some children’s homes in Thane and Panvel, called it a welcome step. “There must be strict monitoring of the disbursement of funds to prevent any corruption or leakage, and ensure that deserving persons get them. Also, there must be an independent panel to oversee the entire process and not just government officials,” he said.

356,['13/02/2020'],Give concession to pre-paid power consumers: Centre,"This story is from February 13, 2020

Existing electricity meters would be replaced by smart pre-paid ones in three years’ time.

NAGPUR: The Union power ministry has advised all state energy ministries to offer concessions in power tariff to consumers who opt for pre-paid electricity .

In her budget, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said that all existing electricity meters would be replaced by smart pre-paid ones in three years’ time.

The letter, dated January 16, 2020, written by Debranjan Chattopadhyay, under secretary to all principal secretaries (energy), states that the power ministry had issued a letter on November 15, 2019, highlighting the reduction in cost of power due to pre-payment in the entire value chain of the power sector.

The letter states pre-paid meters are being provided to end consumers by the distribution companies. With the availability of pre-paid meters, consumers pay in advance for electricity consumed by them to the discoms. In case of pre-payment, the carrying costs will come down, leading to reduced requirement of the working capital for the discoms. Further, this will also eliminate associated costs involved in meter reading, billing and collection. Therefore, wherever pre-paid meters are being installed, the electricity tariff per unit for the consumer should reduce.

The letter further states that states should request the state electricity regulatory commissions (SERCs) to consider reduction in power retail tariff to consumers for power purchased through pre-paid meters. The necessary changes in the relevant regulations should be done within six months of the issuance of this letter.

Power expert RB Goenka, who was a director in MSEB Holding Company, said that Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) had proposed a rebate of 5% for pre-paid consumers, but MSEDCL wants it to reduce it to 2%.

“I support MSEDCL in this case as 5% is too much. It should be 3%. One must understand that pre-paid meters are not feasible for big consumers and only for small ones,” he said.

As of now, MSEDCL offers 1% prompt payment incentive to consumers on energy charges (excluding taxes) who pay their bill within seven days of issuance. Prompt payment increases cash flow of the discom. Prepaid meters will further increase the cash flow obviating the need for MSEDCL to take loans from banks to run the company. Big industries save lakhs of rupees by availing this incentive.

357,['13/02/2020'],Pollution from fossil fuels costing India Rs 10.7 lakh crore every year,"This story is from February 13, 2020

NAGPUR: Air pollution from burning of fossil fuels costs India Rs10.7 lakh crore annually, reveals a latest report. In a first-of-its-kind study, the scientific analysis by Greenpeace Southeast Asia and Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) has quantified the global cost of air pollution emitted from fossil fuels.

Titled ‘Toxic Air: The Price of Fossil Fuels’, the report states that China mainland, the United States and India bear the highest cost of air pollution due to fossil fuels. The cost for India is equivalent to 5.4% of its annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

Highlighting the growing death toll attributed to air pollution, the report states that one million deaths per year in India are caused due to air pollution generated from burning fossil fuels. Apart from this, the pollution is also a major health threat to children. “Over 12 lakh children in India live with asthma linked to fossil fuel pollution. Exposure to pollution from fossil fuels also leads to around 49 crore days of work absence due to illness,” the report adds.

The study stresses transition to renewable energy is essential to combat climate change as well as to protect public health. “Every year, air pollution from fossil fuels takes millions of lives, increases our risk of stroke, lung cancer and asthma, and costs us trillions of dollars. But this is a problem we know how to solve, by transitioning to renewable energy sources, phasing out diesel and petrol cars, and building public transport,” said Minwoo Son, clean air campaigner at Greenpeace East Asia.

TOI recently reported coal-fired power plants across the country have missed the emission reduction deadline for the second time. “Strict action must be taken against non-compliance of thermal power plants. The government must ensure construction of new coal-fired power plants is halted and existing plants must be shut down in phases. Moving our energy generation sector from fossil fuels to renewables would help prevent premature deaths and vast savings in health costs,” said Avinash Chanchal, senior campaigner at Greenpeace India .

He further pointed out the country spent around 1.28% of its GDP on health while air pollution from burning fossil fuels costs an estimated 5.4% of the GDP. “This year, the Central government allocated only Rs69,000 crore for the health sector in the Union budget. This makes it clear that as a country we must fix our priority and stop burning fossil fuels which are harming our health and economy both,” he said, adding that a just energy transition to renewable energy was feasible for the country.

On mitigation measures, the report states clean transport system can significantly reduce toxic pollutants. “Effective public transport system, walking and cycling infrastructure will not just reduce greenhouse gas emissions but also lead to a decrease in cardiovascular diseases, cancer, obesity, diabetes, mental illness and respiratory diseases,” it adds.

NAGPUR: What happens when two clumsy workers in a nuclear facility with a brain that works more into ruining things than mending it? Well, it gives birth to a series of hilarious sequences.

The audience had the same experience while watching silent English drama ‘ Live Nukes ’, written and directed by Kevin Duvall and Taylor Brewerton from the United States. The drama was staged at Sai Sabhagruh as part of the 21st Bharat Rang Mahotsav ’s Parallel Theatre Festival, organized by National School of Drama, New Delhi, on Wednesday.

The play was a classic example of silent comedy, brought to life by these actors without the use of props, technical sound effects and words.

The drama starts to unfold when two boorish government servants working in a nuclear facility accidentally launch a nuclear weapon into stratosphere, leading to utter chaos. The mismatched workers, portrayed by Kevin (blue) and Taylor (red), try to save the world from a certain nuclear disaster.

This takes them to places which one can find only in a person’s imagination. They pretended using props by using their hands and sound language. They created sounds of screwdrivers, lifting of machines and switching the button on.

Their search for the misfired nuclear object begins as they hustle to stop it from spreading radiation in the atmosphere. They set out to find it out. They go to decrepit bunkers, down a sketchy roadside and through the clouds.

Their journey culminates into a valiant duel with the king of demons. They engage in a hilarious fight sequence with the demon, an imaginary one though. But the movement of hand and legs, and facial expressions, made the audience feel the presence of a demon.

Their hunt for the weapon takes them to places which also includes the very depths of hell. After a tiring journey for fixing the nuclear weapon problem and going to various places, they find and mends it and save the world from harmful radiation.

While performing, the actors landed up in the audience and sipped and spat water on each other’s faces. This added to the comic flavour of the act and drew laughter and whistles from the audience. They also did the same with a few people from the audience, who took it sportingly.

The play gives a message that no matter how clumsy someone can get, like the actors, if they have an urge to save the world and work for humanity, they will end up doing good deeds, and deserve all the love.

The quality of actors’ expression and natural sound effects added to the aesthetic and fun element to the drama.

Kevin said, “Our idea was to put up a show that will express the universal language of theatre. Body language, facial expressions and sound effect worked wonders.”

Taylor said, “A trustworthy partner can make a difficult silent comedy easy. Verbal noises, postures and comic timing made the audience split into laughter.”

The internationally acclaimed designer chose to fashion the cops’ new look on the lines of the Singapore police force. Based on his design, Goa Police switched over from the traditional khaki to a combination of navy blue trousers and white shirts with a coconut palm logo.

Although Goa Police chose to switch back to khaki later, the uniform designed by Rodricks is used by the traffic police till date.

Subsequent plans to get Rodricks to design the uniform for the state’s tourist security force did not materialise. He, however, went on to fashion jackets for personnel of the enforcement directorate.

Aurangabad: The Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) has registered an offence against two city consumers for allegedly stealing power by tampering with the electricity meters.

Both the crimes have been registered with the Cantonment police station and relevant sections of the Electricity Act have been invoked to book offenders for power theft.

In a crackdown carried out in Fazalpura, consumer named Mukhtar Khan Ahmed Khan was allegedly caught red-handed for stealing a total of 16,054 units of power. As per the official assessment, the power theft was worth around Rs 3,20,118. In the second case, two consumers D S Jadhav and Ambadas Devidas Jadhav from Gokulwadi area in Aurangpura was booked for stealing 4,810 units of power. The net worth of the power stolen was Rs 32,660, police said.

Acting on a complaint from the MSEDCL staff, the Cantonment police have booked the offenders. No dues were recovered from offenders in both the cases till Wednesday evening, police said.

The state power utility has warned the consumers to refrain from such unethical practices and avoid strict action. As per section 126 of the electricity act, 2003, in case of detection of ‘Unauthorized Use of Energy (‘UUE”), tariff equal to twice the tariff applicable for the relevant category is recovered from the offender if the MSEDCL authorities reach to the conclusion that unauthorised use of electricity has taken place.

Also, section 135 of the act stipulates for initiating police action. “The electricity meters having unexpectedly low power consumption always remain on the radar of the MSEDCL. We carry out inspection of electricity meters which either show zero consumption or that in the range of 0 to 30 units,” said state power utility officials.

It may be recalled that the newly installed electric meters, comprising of Radio Frequency (RF) and Infra-Red (IR) has helped the MSEDCL in detecting as many as 38 power cases without deploying any manpower on the field in Latur during June last year. The RF meters, however, are in place across the region so far with flying squads of the state power utility visit vulnerable areas to keep a check on any malpractices.

KOCHI: V K Krishna Menon , the renowned diplomat, nationalist and politician, was against the formation of the state of Kerala after India attained independence from British and he advised the then Prime Minister and his close friend Jawaharlal Nehru not to create Kerala as it will be a bastion of communism in India, said Rajya Sabha MP and politician Jairam Ramesh . While addressing a discussion on his latest biographical book ‘A Chequered Brilliance: The Many Lives of V K Krishna Menon’, at the Krithi International Book Fest here on Wednesday, Ramesh said that Menon has advocated for the formation of a Dakshin Pradesh instead of Kerala, which will be constituted by parts of regions speaking Malayalam, Tamil, Kannada and Telugu.

“People often mistook Menon for a communist or a pro-communist but he was never one. He told Nehru that Kerala will be the citadel of communism and it should not be allowed. In fact, he supported Nehru to dismiss the communist government led by EMS Namboothiripad in 1959 due to his objection to land reforms brought by the communist party as it led his aristocratic family lose acres of land that time. The Scotland Yard, during 1920-40, made several reports against Menon’s relationship with the Communist Party of Great Britain, the most numbers on any Indian at that time, and stated that Menon was not a communist as he lacked the discipline to be one,” he said.

Ramesh also said that Menon was the face of India’s freedom struggle in Britain and he played a decisive role in negotiating with the British. Also, he said that no man other than Menon has advocated peaceful negotiations with China on border issue with India instead of war. “Menon’s biggest critic was A B Vajpayee since the 1960s and opposed his idea of negotiations with China. But in 2003, he himself signed the treaty with China as Prime Minister to initiate peaceful talks,” said Ramesh.

NAGPUR: Nearly five years after being put on the block, 18 coal mines in the region have found no takers. The BJP-led government had put in place a system of auctioning mines replacing the controversial allocation method followed during the UPA regime leading to allegations of massive coal scam.

The notification for holding auction of these blocks was issued in 2015. The last round of bidding was held around six months ago, but none turned up to take part in it, said sources.

Last month, the government eased norms for private coal mining allowing commercial exploitation as against captive use earlier. The move may not help much in wooing private industries to take up the blocks. It is basically due to the poor demand of coal itself as fuel, say industry sources here.

The 18 mines are spread in an area 1,604 hectare and have an estimated reserve of 121 million tonne (MT). This is nearly double than Western Coalfields Limited’s average output in a year. These mines are spread in Yavatmal, Chandrapur and Nagpur districts.

The BJP government in its previous tenure had scrapped the allocation method that was questioned by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) leading to CBI inquiries and arrests, including in Nagpur.

In Vidarbha, six mines could be auctioned after 2015. Out of these, three are operational, which belong to Topworth Industries, Sunflag Iron and Steel and KPCL. Two of the mines are in Chandrapur and one in Yavatmal.

“Leave aside getting lesser response, no bidder turned up in any of the rounds for the 18 blocks,” the source said.

Govind Daga, a businessman having stake in mining industry, said, even as commercial mining has been allowed, the overall slump in demand for coal is discouraging industrialists to take up the blocks.

“These days, even Maharatna public sector undertaking — Coal India Limited (CIL) — is finding it tough to get enough demand for coal. This is because of increasing trend of using alternate fuel, especially solar power. Coal is being regarded as an undesirable fuel nowadays,” said Daga.

He said even if commercial sale of coal has been approved, private miners will have to mainly depend on power plants for sale. The demand is down in this sector. The complicated formalities for getting the approvals is also a negative factor, he added.

A source in one of companies, which had bagged a mine in an earlier auction, said, “Industries have to face a number of hassles for getting approvals starting from environmental clearance to land acquisition. There is no support from the government. Instead of having a captive mine, industries prefer to get a linkage from CIL rather.”

SECUNDERABAD: Passengers at Secunderabad and Lingampally railway stations took to Twitter on Wednesday to complain against the frequently dysfunctional announcement systems and coach guidance display boards.“In the recent past, trains have not only been delayed by one to two hours but mostly in the morning when the trains are passing through Secunderabad division, passengers have complained that the announcement systems were not working,” said a member of passenger association.Irked passengers said that during morning hours, the display board do not function properly. “Waiting for train no. 20811 for more than an hour and there has been no announcement or any information displayed on the display board,” tweeted an angry passenger.Passengers who have suffered due to the delays, said that it would help if they knew how late their trains are running but in the morning, there is too much confusion and chaos.“Train no 57626 is late again, please provide alternative halt at Jangaon railway station, or at least inform the passengers at the station,” tweeted another passenger, Rajeshwar M.Meanwhile, passengers waiting at the Lingampally railway station complained of dysfunctional coach guidance display boards which led to chaos when the trains arrived. “Everyday, it is like a struggle to get on the train, despite having booked a seat.

Secunderabad: Mohammed Ghouse Pasha (40), who sustained burn injuries in a cylinder blast on Sunday at Warasiguda in Secunderabad, died while undergoing treatment at Gandhi Hospital on Wednesday.

Pasha, who sustained 88% burn injuries, succumbed at around 1.15 am on Wednesday whereas his wife Shabana Begum (35), who sustained 70% burn injuries, continues to remain critical.

The couple’s four daughters, Afiya (9), Shifa (6), Misbah (3) and three-month-old Umema were also injured in the mishap and sustained 30% to 20% burn injuries. They are said to be out of danger but are under observation.

The incident took place at around 6.30 am on Sunday when the family members were asleep.

The police are trying to ascertain the cause of the incident. Police suspect that the LPG might have leaked from the cylinder and spread in the house, and when one of the family members lit a matchstick there could have been a fire and subsequent explosion.

Anti-CAA protest at Jamia

NEW DELHI: Students of Jamia Millia University have alleged that police and CRPF personnel assaulted them on February 10 when they were marching to Parliament in protest against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). According to them, more than a hundred were injured on that day and 55 were admitted to the Ansari health centre on the campus. Twelve students had to be referred to Al Shifa Hospital in Okhla and some had to be admitted to ICU.

Rafiya, a resident of Jamia Nagar , claimed her rib had been fractured and she wearing a belt now. “When I saw police beating up male students, I went towards the barricade. I had gone to help but policemen began hitting me and a police woman pulled me and pinched me. I was also kicked with boots. I could not breathe. I have fractured a rib and was admitted to ICU,” she said, with her voice choking.

At a press conference held on Wednesday, students and residents shared the ordeal they claimed they had gone through as they were stopped from marching. They said there was no lathicharge but they were hit below the belt.

Another student, Mohammad Zubair , said he too had to be admitted to ICU with a fracture that day. “Abuses were hurled at me by the police personnel. They hit me too as they were equipped with and weapons and other gear. I can easily identify the person who hit me,” said Zubair.

Students said the cops told them they were a threat to Constitution. “Aazadi chahiye tum logon ko, le lo aazadi (You want freedom, take it) was allegedly the refrain. “We can identify policemen and CRPF personnel but there were many in plain clothes as well,” said another student, Abhidarga.

Safoora’s experience was similar to that of Rafiya. She claimed she was stomped upon by boots and men were hitting women students. “Why do they need to wear riot gear and come for a student’s march?” she asked.

Many students claimed that even at the Badarpur police station, where they were detained, and while being taken there in a bus, they were beaten and denied water.

A Delhi Police spokesperson dismissed the allegations as false. “Delhi Police, especially south-east district, showed a lot of patience in handling the aggressive Jamia students near Holy Family Hospital where they were forcing their way through police barricades and trying to march to Parliament without permission. These allegations are false. Delhi Police follows the highest standards of professional policing with utmost patience and restraint to ensure safety and security of all, including protesters,” said the spokesperson.

“No such incident was reported,” said a CRPF spokesperson.

370,['13/02/2020'],Disconnect power to illegal brick kiln units: Activists,"This story is from February 13, 2020

Coimbatore: Upping the ante in the fight against unauthorised brick kilns in the Thadagam valley, residents and activists in the region have requested the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB) to disconnect power to the units.

As the region falls under the purview of the Hill Area Conservation Authority (HACA), industries should not be allowed to operate there, the activists said. Before giving power connection to the kilns, TNEB should have verified if the units had approval from the local planning authority (LPA) and the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB), they said citing RTI replies. None of the kilns have got permissions from the two bodies to operate.

S Ganesh of Chinna Thadagam, who has been fighting against unauthorised brick kilns mining red earth in the region, said only if LPA and TNPCB give no-objection certificates to operate, power connections could be given to the units. “There are 192 brick kilns at Chinna Thadagam, Nanjundapuram, Veerapandi, Somaiyampalayam and Pannimadai. None of them have obtained permission to operate as per an RTI reply from LPA. The LPA said kilns had to obtain permission from it to operate heavy machinery with a power connection of 65KVA to 330KVA. But the unauthorised units were given power connection. This is a violation,” he said.

The kilns are also using borewells, Ganesh said. “Rules say two borewells in the area must be at a distance of 250m from each other. But all units have several borewells.”

“We have written to TNEB officials in K Vadamadurai and Seeranaickenpalayam for disconnecting power to the kilns,” he said.

A senior TNEB official said they would act on the issue as per orders from the board.

372,['13/02/2020'],"Designer, environmentalist, mentor and a gentleman","This story is from February 13, 2020

Panaji: Indian fashion ’s ‘guru of minimalism’ Wendell Rodricks passed away at his quiet village of Colvale on Wednesday evening. He was 59.

During his life, he played many roles—designer, environmentalist, writer — but perhaps most long-lasting was his role as mentor to innumerable Goan youths, including Mister Supranational 2018 Prathamesh Maulingkar.

One of the earliest and prominent public figures to come out in the open about his gay status, Rodricks is survived by his partner Jerome Marrel, who he married in 2002 in Paris.

A Padma Shri recipient, Rodricks exerted considerable influence on the fashion world after he turned eco-friendly and glorified the minimal look at a time when the terms weren’t heard of in Indian fashion.

But before taking up fashion designing, Rodricks trained himself as a chef and worked in the hospitality industry.

He turned the tables in the late 1980s with his cotton and linen whites sans embroidery, at a time when brightly coloured silk bursting with embellishment was considered high fashion in India.

“I saw what was happening in the industry and I didn’t want to do the Rajasthani royal highly brocade embroidery. I was looking at a minimal look that was based on the theme lines of Indian geometry, reflecting the peace of South India, the temples, Ayurveda, Indian astrology and Gandhism,” he had told TOI.

He was instrumental in rolling out the carpet for the first Lakme India Fashion Week, which brought professionalism to the fashion industry. He appreciated the Indian figure and labelled his creations at his store in Goa with ‘slim’, ‘medium’, ‘voluptuous’ and ‘voluptuous goddess’ labels instead of the generic ‘large’ and ‘extra-large’ tabs, which he said were an “outright insult to the Indian woman”.

The eldest of four brothers, who was brought up in a “glorified chawl” in Mumbai, Rodricks said his friends told him he was committing professional suicide by retreating to his non-descript village of Colvale.

“Unlike my parents who said they would retire in Goa, I wanted to come and live in my father’s village from the time I knew I could establish my name and didn’t need the big city and it didn’t matter anymore where I could manufacture the clothes,” Rodricks had told TOI.

Rodricks revived the weaving of the traditional Goan Kunbi saree, which was presented to former US first lady Michelle Obama and worn by Sonia Gandhi, Jayalalitha and Pratibha Patil, among others.

In 2016, Rodricks took a step back from his label and retired from the runway. He took the time and effort to dig his hands into setting up the country’s first costume museum—Moda Goa. After years of foraging and generous donations from Goans across the state and around the world, the collection boasts 800 artefacts stretching from the 7th century AD till present date.

Most of these are priceless and one of a kind, but people gladly parted with their family history, content with the knowledge that Wendell was there to look after it.

But it was not all fashion and looms for this son of the soil. When it came to the protection of Goa and all things Goan, Rodricks never hesitated to raise his voice. He protested deforestation and was vocal about protecting Goa’s environment. His role was pivotal in the protection of the centuries-old trees in Colvale that eventually faced the axe for a national highway.

He even pulled his retail store out of a hotel in the state capital owned by a mining company, a week after the Justice Shah report unearthed a Rs 35,000 crore mining scam in 2012. It was something “he did for Goa and not for himself”, he had said.

“I didn’t want mining to shut, I just wanted it to be phased out… we can’t have iron ore for the whole world for eternity, Goa is such a small state,” he had told TOI.

The present uniform of the Goa traffic police, the first ever designer police uniform in the country, and the jacket for the enforcement directorate were designed by him.

On the heels of the historic win for LGBTQ+ community with the Section 377 judgment, Rodricks turned his efforts to the Catholic faith.

In November 2018, the equal rights activist made waves when Cardinal Oswald Gracias of the Archdiocese of Bombay blessed his plans to start a hotline to provide support and guidance to queer individuals and their families to keep the faith.

The ambassador of France to India bestowed him with the medal of the Knight of the Order of the Arts and Letters (Chevalier de l’Ordre des Arts et Lettres) in 2015.

And just when one thought he had done it all, Wendell traded his needle and thread for the mighty pen. He has to his credit three books.

In 2012, he penned his ode to Goa in ‘Moda Goa-History and Style’. The same year also saw his autobiography ‘The Green Room’.

In 2017, he touched on a topic that everyone in Goa knew of, but few dared discuss publicly. His ‘Poskem-Goans in the Shadows’ throws light on the practice of wealthy families taking in young children and usually retaining them as servants.

His funeral will be held at the St Francis of Assisi church at Colvale at 4pm on Thursday.

Hyderabad: After nearly a decade, the fund-starved Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) has sought financial assistance of Rs 3,000 crore from the Centre for the construction of 65 new sewage treatment plants (STPs) proposed under a comprehensive sewerage master plan (SMP) formulated a couple of years ago.

The water board has sought funds from the National River Conservation Directorate (NRCD), which functions under the Ministry of Jal Shakti Department of Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation.

The Telangana government had directed the water board to prepare a detailed project report (DPR) for implementation of a master plan exclusively for the city’s sewerage system, GHMC peripheral circles and Outer Ring Road (ORR) areas.

As per the DPR, which was sent to Municipal Administration & Urban Development (MA&UD) minister KT Rama Rao for approval, the cost of works under the proposed master plan is estimated to be around Rs 15,000 crore. “Keeping the water board’s financial constraints in mind, we have approached the NRCD for funds to construct 65 STPs across the city, in GHMC peripheral circles and ORR limits,” sources in HMWS&SB told TOI.

Between 2005 and 2009, the water board had built four STPs at Amberpet, Nagole, Nallacheruvu and Attapur with a capacity of treating 592 million litres per day (MLD) of sewage with the help of NRCD phase-I funds.

The water board is also likely to urge the MA&UD department for allotment of funds in the next budget for other infrastructure works like laying of sewer inlet and outlet mains and construction of interception and diversion (I&D) structures under the sewerage master plan. “It will take atleast five years to complete the implementation of the master plan,” said a water board official.

Hyderabad: A student of University of Hyderabad (UoH) has secured a job in Adobe Systems for a pay package of Rs 43 lakh – a record in the history of the varsity, both in terms of domestic as well as international placements.

Nandini Soni, a Master of Computer Application (MCA) student of School of Computer and Information Sciences, was selected as part of Adobe’s Empowering Women@SheCodes initiative. Of the four shortlisted candidates for the final round, Soni was selected for the post of a software developer. The 21-year-old student, who decided to skip engineering and pursue computer science, had won the Smart India Hackathon (SIH) in 2019.

“I always had a keen interest in software development. Even during the SIH, 2019, our team was asked to develop an authentication system that was different from the existing ones,” said Soni, who will be joining the Adobe Systems’ Bengaluru or Noida office. She underwent four rounds of interview, including technical, managerial and human resources, for Adobe Systems.

“I was not expecting to be selected as I was not so confident about the technical rounds,” said Soni.

The student, along with her peers, had started a community in the MCA department where students built projects and had discussions on various subjects.

She completed her schooling from Atomic Energy Central School (AECS), Boisar, Maharashtra, followed by Bachelors (BCA) from St Xavier’s, Ahmedabad, and subsequently took up MCA at the University of Hyderabad in 2017.

The UoH authorities claim that there has been a steady increase in the number of placements. “There is an increase in the number of placements for the students from all streams with decent packages. This year, more than 200 students have already been placed, which is very encouraging,” said Prof. Rajeev Wankar, chairman, placement guidance and advisory bureau at UoH.

375,['13/02/2020'],....CBI probe plea reaches high court within hours,"This story is from February 13, 2020

New Delhi: Hours after the Supreme Court refused to intervene , a plea was moved in Delhi high court on Thursday seeking a court-monitored CBI probe into the alleged molestation of students during a cultural festival at Gargi College last week.

The Supreme Court, earlier in the day, had refused to entertain the petition and advised the petitioner, a lawyer, to move the high court.

The plea, filed by advocate ML Sharma, had sought preservation of all video recordings and CCTV camera footage of the college campus and immediate arrest of the people behind the “planned criminal conspiracy.”

Delhi Police has arrested twelve people between the ages of 18 and 25 years in connection with the incident.

On February 6, a group of men broke into Gargi College during the 'Reverie' fest and allegedly groped, harassed and molested the attendees, who alleged that security officials stood watching when the incident took place. The incident came to light after some students took to social media to narrate their ordeal.

Sharma, in his plea, alleged that it was a planned political and criminal conspiracy hatched in the backdrop of Delhi elections, and no action was taken after the incident. “...(N)either principal nor other state authorities tried to stop and arrest the accused persons,” the petition argues, claiming that “deliberate chants of Jai Shri Ram disclose that it is a political, planned conspiracy.” It also blamed the chief minister of Delhi for not taking any action against the accused.

“Apart from the college’s own personal security, the area also had Delhi Police and paramilitary personnel stationed for the assembly polls. Yet no action was taken,” the plea pointed out.

According to the police, a case was registered under IPC sections 452 (house-trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint), 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention).

376,['13/02/2020'],‘Parking can be huge revenue earner’,"This story is from February 13, 2020

Chennai: Monetising parking can turn out to be a big money spinner for urban local bodies and help pay back debts taken to fund major infrastructure projects, Chennai corporation commissioner G Prakash said on Tuesday. He was speaking during a discussion with top officials from German Kfw bank and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) at Hotel Leela Palace after the launch of the Mega streets project.

The Rs 10,000 crore project envisages transforming 886 km of roads by widening footpaths, ducting of utilities to prevent road cuts for 30 years, putting in place neighbourhood parking plans and enhancing livability.

Six consultants have been shortlisted to finalise a detailed project report for the first phase which will cover 70 sq km in north, central and south and include Radhakrishnan Salai, Thiruvottiyur High Road and Velachery Main Road.

When Shreya Gadepalli, South Asia director of Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP), asked how the debt would be serviced considering there was no revenue generating potential in the project, Prakash said that from money given by the banks, the government would allocate 70% as a grant to the corporation and 20% as a loan component. The remaining 10% would be from the corporation’s budgetary allocation. A request for $1 billion has been put up before the banks. “We have our own property tax revenue and we have let out built-up areas. We have never defaulted on servicing debt,” he said.

Prakash said charging Rs 10-Rs 20 for parking two-wheelers and four-wheelers on city roads would ensure huge revenues. While the corporation envisages Rs 700 crore from property tax, Prakash claimed parking could earn Rs 1,200 crore a year. Incidentally, the corporation has rolled out an on-street parking project based on the concept where 12,000 car spaces would be available for paid parking. With mega streets project set to ensure proper ducting of OFC cables, the corporation would get a proper idea on how many km of cables were laid by telecom and internet companies. “Currently not even 10% revenue potential is realised from these companies,” he said, alluding to inefficiency in collection and improper payment by officials and companies.

Another source of revenue would be the cycle-sharing scheme, he said, adding that this was in line with the policy of having more bicycle lanes. Prakash also said funding agencies should give infrastructure loans to civic bodies only if such policies for revenue generation are implemented.

NEW DELHI: A 52-year-old CRPF personnel who suffered a heart attack received treatment at his doorstep recently by a team of paramedics from AIIMS . The team mans India’s first project to provide treatment to people who get a sudden heart attack, even before they reach the hospital.

The project, funded by the Indian Council of Medical Research ( ICMR ), is called Mission DELHI (Delhi Emergency Life Heart-Attack Initiative).

According to Dr Balram Bhargava , the ICMR director general, the Mission DELHI helpline received an emergency call from the CRPF camp in R K Puram at 10.40am on January 31. Within 10 minutes, two paramedics on motorcycles equipped with life-saving drugs and equipment reached the spot.

The patient had severe chest discomfort. Dr Chandini Suvarna, one of the officials, said the first responders administered first aid and preliminary drugs. Then, they conducted an ECG on the spot, the results of which were transmitted to the doctors at AIIMS control room where senior cardiologists confirmed the 52-year-old had suffered from a heart attack.

The patient was, therefore, given clot bluster drugs for immediate relief and transferred to AIIMS emergency for further management, thus saving his life. “This is the first time in India that clot bluster drugs medicine was administered for heart attack at patient’s doorstep before reaching hospital,” the ICMR said.

A heart attack can occur if a blood clot stops the flow of blood through the arteries that supply oxygen-carrying blood to the heart muscle.

Clot busters are almost equal to angioplasty but the latter is expensive, say doctors. “Clot busters can be given within a short time,” said a doctor.

ICMR and AIIMS started the Mission DELHI project in last April and an official said 80 calls have been attended to till date. Under the programme, an assistance unit on a motorcycle can be quickly summoned for emergencies like a heart attack or chest pain in a radius of three kilometres around AIIMS.

While the emergency treatment is being provided, a CATS ambulance will arrive and take the patient for further treatment.

ICMR has signed a memorandum with CATS for this project, Dr Bhargava said.

“The idea is to reach with medical help much faster, given the high-density traffic situation in the city where movement of four-wheeler ambulances becomes difficult. Motorcycle ambulances can reach people in narrow lanes in congested areas,” said Dr Randeep Guleria , AIIMS director.

Panaji: Goa government has decided to scrutinise movie scripts before giving permission to filmmakers to shoot in the state, chief minister Pramod Sawant said here on Wednesday.

The state government’s move comes after alleged portrayal of Goa as a drug hub in a recently released Bollywood film .

“Why should they (the filmmakers) portray Goa as a drug destination?” Sawant said.

He said the Entertainment Society of Goa (ESG), the nodal agency for granting permissions for film shoots in the state, will vet the scripts.

“ESG will look at each story before giving permissions to shoot. It will ensure that the image of Goa as a state is not maligned. We will see how Goa is being portrayed and only then will permission be granted,” he said.

In its manual, the ESG states that it aims “to earn revenue on a long-term basis from ventures in film entertainment and leisure projects...and to bring about worldwide recognition to Goa as an ultimate tourism and entertainment destination”.

HYDERABAD: With Central Board of Secondary Education ( CBSE ) starting psychological counselling for students and parents to overcome exam-related stress from February 8, academicians and parents said the state government should also provide counselling services for class 10 students.They said at least two psychologists should be recruited for each mandal so that students studying in government schools could avail their services. While teachers claimed that there are no counsellors in any of the government schools, education department officials said that two counsellors are available in some schools in the state.“Since the last couple of years, no counselling programme has been organized by the state government for class X (SSC) students. The only thing they are interested in is 100% results. They are least bothered about the mounting pressure on the students. Forget about providing counselling, the government and officials are not even empathetic towards students,” Telangana Progressive Teachers’ Federation vice-president M Ravinder said, adding that state should hire at least two psychologists for each mandal resource centre, which has about seven schools under them.Talking about students in government schools, the teachers said, “Until class 9, the government is least bothered about their performance and takes no initiative to improve their standards, but expects them to produce cent per cent results in class 10.”“Making students follow a rigorous schedule and forcing them to appear for practice tests daily is creating tremendous pressure on government school students. Keeping their background in mind, I feel these kids need counselling more than CBSE students,” K Srinivas, a teacher, said.Teachers at private schools also said that a counselling facility was missing from majority of the schools in the state and added that it would be a wise idea to start a counselling facility at least now as exams were scheduled to begin in a couple of months.“Although counselling is the need of the hour, no school is organizing counselling for class X students. Even those organizing the counselling are conducting it with respect to subject, but not to address the mental health of students. The state should at least form teams at mandal level and organize counselling for all class 10 students in both government and private schools,” said Shabir Ali, president, Telangana Private Teachers’ Forum.While the Telangana government trained one lecturer from each intermediate college, both government and private, to act as student counsellors, such provision is missing at the school level.

For the sake of convenience, the survey of Chilavannoor Lake on the Elamkulam side has been conducted separating it into five portions, A, B, C, D, and E.

Chandrashekhar Azad

NEW DELHI: Former chief information commissioner Wajahat Habibullah and Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad moved the Supreme Court on Wednesday seeking impleadment in the case filed for removal of protesters from Shaheen Bagh and alleged that the Delhi administration had deliberately blocked other roads connecting the capital to Noida and Faridabad to create public inconvenience.

In a joint application filed along with Shaheen Bagh resident Bahadur Abbas Naqvi , they contended that there were other routes which could be used for traffic movement after the main road was blocked due to the protests but the administration had deliberately blocked those roads on the pretext of the ongoing demonstration.

“The applicants seek indulgence of this court to briefly bring to its notice some of the collusive acts of the administration, the home ministry as well as the state of Uttar Pradesh in blocking alternative roads that are far away from Shaheen Bagh to deliberately cause traffic jams for commuters commuting between Delhi, Noida and Faridabad,” the application, filed through advocate Mansoor Ali , said.

Referring to the plea seeking removal of protesters, they said the petition was filed in collusion with the central government, which controls the police in Delhi. They said since alternative routes were blocked by forces under the Centre, they apprehended that the real facts would not be placed and the court may be misled into passing orders that could be misused by the government.

Taking a critical view of protests blocking public spaces, the court on February 10 sought responses from the Centre and Delhi Police on a plea seeking removal of agitators from Shaheen Bagh. The petition said lakhs of commuters were being harassed due to blockage of the main road connecting Delhi to Noida and Faridabad for nearly two months.

Arvind.Chauhan@timesgroup.com

Agra: Police have registered a case against a gram pradhan , his brother and four others on Wednesday for allegedly assaulting a group of women who were heading home in a car after attending a relative’s wedding.

According to sources, the assault occurred in Usmanpur village on Tuesday evening when the victims confronted some teenagers after they pelted stones on their car without any provocation. The group of women — Dinesh, Rakhi and Rajni — were returning home from a wedding with their relative Devender Singh, a private contractor with the Agra municipal corporation and resident of Durga Nagar in Dayalbagh. Singh, brother of Rakhi and Rajni, was driving the car.

Singh said, “We were returning home from our ancestral village Sherkhan after attending a wedding. As we were approaching Usmanpur, some mischievous teens started pelting stones at our car without any provocation. The windshield and window panes of the car were damaged in the stone pelting. We managed to catch one of the teens, who was the nephew of the gram pradhan. When we confronted his parents, gram pradhan Rupendra, his brother Shivkumar and four others started misbehaving with my sisters and aunt.” “When I protested, they started assaulting me. When the women tried to intervene, they started assaulting them too,” he added.

A purported video of the episode, shot by Singh, shows the pradhan and his kin attacking the victims with a stick.

The accused were booked under IPC sections 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees), 506 (criminal intimidation), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace), 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt) and 147 (rioting).

Vijay Kumar Singh, station house officer of Khandauli, said, “The victims were rushed to a nearby hospital. All the accused are on the run. We are on the lookout for them.”

385,['13/02/2020'],Corp to decide bidder for parking plazas,"This story is from February 13, 2020

Kozhikode: The construction work of the automated parking plazas at Kidson Corner and Corporation Stadium will be commenced before the end of current financial year. The city corporation authority will finalize the suitable bidders for the project within a week.

The civic body invited expression of interest to set up the projects under Public Private Participation (PPP) model in the end of 2019 and a total of three bidders have submitted bids. The civic body plans to set up the advanced fully-automated parking and vehicle retrieving system at the proposed parking plazas at an estimated cost of Rs 90 crore.

The parking plaza cum commercial plaza proposed at a cost of Rs 65 crore at EMS stadium can accommodate 580 cars and 800 two-wheelers at a time. The parking slot cum shopping plaza proposed at a cost of Rs 25 crore at Kidson Corner can accommodate 224 cards at a time. There will be food courts, office retail shops, multiplex, entertainment hub at the two-parking plazas.

The shop owners who will be evicted for the construction of parking plaza cum commercial complex at Kidson Corner will be rehabilitated on the ground floor of the shopping complex. They will be shifted to a suitable area till the completion of the construction work.

The civic body has reached an agreement with the shop owners operating their stalls at the corporation building at the Kidson Corner. State government had appointed Thiruvananthapuram-based Centre for Management Development as transaction adviser for the project implementation.

Though the civic body had envisaged the proposal to set up parking plaza at Stadium in 2005, it took more than a decade to materialize the schemes. At present, dearth of parking plazas forced the public to depend on the malls and parking plazas run by private parties to park their vehicles. Shoppers have also been forced to park their vehicles on either side of the busy roads which often creates traffic congestion on the busy city roads.

Corporation town planner A M Jayan said that the selection of suitable bidder is in the final stage. “A final decision on bidder will be made within a week. The civic body plans to begin the construction work at the earliest as the materialization of the scheme will help to put an end to the existing traffic snarl on the busy S M Street and Mananchira and Mavoor Road to a certain extent,” he said.

Hyderabad: The land acquisition process for Road under Bridge (RuB) in Anandbagh, Malkajgiri has been completed and the RuB is likely to be ready by July, said Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) commissioner DS Lokesh Kumar on Wednesday.

The project, which is expected to ease traffic flow from Nacharam, Moula Ali and ECIL towards Secunderabad via Malkajgiri and back, has been pending since 2013. “The project was halted mainly due to delay in land acquisition of eight properties and now the properties have been acquired,” said a GHMC engineer.

According to the Roads and Buildings Department, Rangareddy, which is executing the works, concrete roads will be laid and box drains will be contructed after the retaining walls are built. “The Road under Bridge is the need of the hour, especially during downpour, as waterlogged roads make it difficult to commute for many,” said Prashant Mudiraj, a resident of Anandbagh.

The RuB is being constructed at a cost of Rs 27 crore and 19 properties have been acquired for the project.

The GHMC informed that it also plans to acquire five properties to lay service roads.

“We are in talks with property owners and have approached the court too. Even if the service roads are not laid, the RuB would be made operational,” said a GHMC official.

The RuB was to be made operational by April this year, however, due to several delays, the deadline was extended to July.

AHMEDABAD: Gujarat ’s ‘mehman-nawazi’ is a no-holds-barred affair. And when the visitors are top-notch like the US President Donald Trump and his wife Melania , the list of possible gifts is a repository of traditional excellence.

While a saree , stole or a jacket made of the famed Patan Patola , a fine hand-woven double Ikat weave, is the front runner in the state government’s list of possible gifts, many other traditional handicraft and handloom gems too have been included.

The exhaustive list includes Kutchi Rogan painting, Kutch embroidery pieces or garments, khadi kurta and replica of Mahatma Gandhi’s charkha and tribal artwork, which will be vetted by Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) for final approval.

“Once the PMO shortlists the gift, it will be readied before the President and First Lady reaches Ahmedabad on their maiden visit,” said a key officer involved with the preparations for the high profile visit.

Top sources said that the Gujarat government wishes to gift Trump a memoir of US civil rights leader Dr Martin Luther King Jr's visit to Gujarat when he visited Sabarmati Ashram on March 1, 1959, to pay obeisance to Mahatma Gandhi.

“We are trying to find an elusive picture or a written message by Dr King or his wife Coretta who had accompanied him during his visit. It would make a very relevant gift to the US Prez,"" said the official.

Ever since he took over as the PM in 2014, three high profile heads of state have so far visited Narendra Modi ’s home state.

Modi had reportedly gifted a copy of Bapu’s autobiography, ""My experiments with truth' to Israel PM Benjamin Netanyahu during his visit to Ahmedabad in January 2018. In September 2017, he gifted a marble statuette of Mahatma Gandhi's `Three Wise Monkeys' to Japanese PM, Shinzo Abe and his wife Akie Abe during their visit to the city.

Modi gifted Chinese President Xi Jinping a copy of the Gita written in Chinese along with books and paintings on Gandhi, when the latter visited Ahmedabad on Modi's birthday in September 2014.

Representative image

HYDERABAD: A man who had stolen jewellery from his employer’s house at Road Number 12, Banjara Hills while posing as a cook in December last year was arrested on Wednesday. Police recovered gold and diamond jewellery worth Rs 1.5 crore from his possession.

On December 9, 2019, Banjara Hills police received a complaint from businessman Kapil Gupta stating that valuables from his house were stolen while he and his family had gone to attend a relative’s wedding at Shamshabad. “Their cook, Ramashish Mukhiya, went missing and Gupta lodged a complaint with the police,” city commissioner Anjani Kumar said.

During investigation, police found that an interstate gang led by the absonding accused, Ramashish Mukhiya of Bihar, was behind the offence. Police said that the gang members would take up employment in houses of rich as domestic help through private agencies and steal valuables when they would get an opportunity.

A special team of Banjara Hills police went to Bihar and arrested the gang members, Bhagawat Mukhiya (32), Bhola Mukhiya (35) and Harischandra Mukhiya (35) of Madhubani district in Bihar and brought them to Hyderabad on January 12, 2020. The accused were sent in judicial remand and based on information provided by them, Ramashish was arrested at Road Number 12, Banjara Hills on Wednesday while he was trying to dispose of the stolen items.

Two of the gang members, Rahul Mukhiya and Pitambar Mandal, are absconding.

393,['13/02/2020'],Pay royalty and transport even non-royalty ore: Goa CM,"This story is from February 13, 2020

Pramod Sawant

PANAJI: The state government has given its nod for the transportation of non-royalty paid ore. “Those who haven’t paid the royalty will also be allowed to transport ore after they pay (the royalty),” chief minister Pramod Sawant said on Wednesday.

The January 30 Supreme Court order had cleared the way for mining lease holders in Goa to transport iron ore extracted.

In all, there is 9.5 million tonne ore lying at jetties and on plots.

Sawant had said that as per the Supreme Court order, royalty-paid ore would be allowed for transportation from the jetties and plots and that the state government would not get any revenue.

Goa Mineral Ore Exporters Association (GMOEA) president Ambar Timblo had told TOI that the state government may get around Rs 300 crore in royalty from transportation of iron ore from leases other than the 88 that were part of the 2018 Supreme Court order.

In February 2018, the Supreme Court had quashed the second renewal of 88 mining leases and stopped mining activities in the state from March 15, 2018.

Sources said that after a detailed study of the apex court order, the state government has agreed that transportation of ore from leases other than the 88 that were part of the court order, could be allowed.

Timblo had said that if the government permits the movement of ore of the non-88 leases, which could be a few million tonnes, in the next six months, could earn as much as Rs 200 to Rs 300 crore in royalty. As per the apex court order, the transportation has to be completed within six months.

“People have applied to the Goa State Pollution Control Board (GSPCB). Once those applications are cleared, the transportation of ore shall commence,” Sawant said.

Mining firms had challenged an order of the high court of Bombay at Goa which had stopped transportation of ore from jetties and plots.

Sawant had projected Rs 500 crore revenue from the mining sector for the financial year 2020-2021 in the state budget.

Mangalore University

MANGALURU: Mangalore University will tighten campus security by first securing its area with a compound wall , fencing off the encroached area, appointing security guards and even deploying CISF if the need arises. Installation of high-quality CCTVs at all vantage points in public areas will be part of this move to revamp security to make it safe for all stakeholders on the campus, said vice-chancellor P S Yadapadithaya , here on Tuesday.

Stating this at a meet the press programme organised by Dakshina Kannada District Working Journalists’ Union, the VC said about seven acres of university land has been encroached upon. To prevent further encroachment, 335 acres in its possession will be secured through a compound wall, and seven acres of encroached land fenced, to distinguish between the two, pending settlement of litigation with people who have encroached upon the same.

Post audit of effectiveness of CCTVs already installed on campus, the university will go in for state-of-the-art surveillance of its campus. “There is also a thinking to induct Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) to augment campus security if the governor, also the chancellor of the university, concurs with a proposal to this effect,” the VC said, underscoring the high importance that the 39-year-old university is giving to security of those on its campus.

The university is also planning to divert all public transport on the campus as part of this security move, Yadapadithaya said. Instead, commute inside the campus will be restricted to use of bicycles and battery-operated buggies. The university has plans to relocate public thoroughfare outside the campus with help from the Public Works Department, he said, failing which the university would mull acquiring land to create the thoroughfare bypassing its campus.

With focus on fitness, the university has provided gymnasiums in its four hostels and in constituent colleges. A public gymnasium park to promote the Fit India movement of the Union government will be opened on the Mangalagangothri campus, Yadapadithaya said. Plans are afoot to lay a 400-metre synthetic track with equipped stadium, and construct an Olympic standard swimming pool on the campus to promote fitness, he noted.

HYDERABAD: The city’s obsession with Vaastu continues, with a latest survey indicating that over 80% of homebuyers in Hyderabad – highest in India – are sticklers for this traditional architectural style. And this includes a large section of new-age customers, between 28 and 35 years of age, who are extremely specific about which direction their bedrooms, kitchens and even toilets face. Other Vaastu requirements: location of balcony, prayer room, entrance, shape of house etc.“As much as 82% respondents in Hyderabad (including IT professionals) consider Vaastu to be the biggest influencing factor, as against the national average of 40%. Chennai ranks a distant second along with Bengaluru, with both at 47%,” the ‘Life Slices’ survey by Mahindra Lifespaces, states.Not surprising then, developers in the city are now ensuring that every house in every apartment complex is Vaastu-compliant. “Even tenants are stringent about Vaastu. So, unlike earlier when only a certain section of customers asked for it, today it is across the board. We had to struggle to sell some units that weren’t Vaastu-compliant,” said D S Prasad, director, Aparna Constructions adding how the trend results in tremendous wastage of space and construction material.“Also, every house is either square or rectangular,” said architect Srinivas Murthy. Sharing some non-negotiable Vaastu demands of clients he said: “Entrance and exit are most important: has to face east of northeast, north of northeast, south of southeast or west of northwest (in that order of preference). Bedroom: southwest corner and kitchen: southeast. Then there are also those insist that the toilet cannot be in the northeast corner.”There’s more: position of cooking stove/gas and water which, as per the Life Slices survey, must be on different sides of the kitchen. “East-west sleep direction in the bedroom and windows on the east of the apartment are some other requirements among Hyderabad customers,” said Sunil Sharma, chief customer officer, Mahindra Lifespaces.“In fact, Vaastu in Hyderabad is no more a concept, it’s an obsession.

398,['13/02/2020'],"Farmers hope for crop loan waiver, river linking","This story is from February 13, 2020

Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami promising eight districts in the Cauvery basin would be declared a protected special agricultural zone has raised hopes of farmers, who are waiting for the CM to make it a legislation in the budget session starting on Friday.

Despite legal experts making it clear that the state does not have powers to legislate on Centre’s subjects, fisheries minister D Jayakumar on Wednesday sought to reiterate the government’s commitment to bring a legislation.

For the record, delta districts produce 33.26 lakh tonnes of grains from about 28 lakh acres. The region also cultivates high-value produce like coconut, banana and horticultural crops. Farmers are restive in the region ever since protests began against coal bed methane exploration in Thanjavur and Tiruvarur in 2013. In later years, Kathiramangalam and Neduvasal started boiling over plans to extract hydrocarbon. The Centre’s latest notification, doing away with public hearing for such projects, has made matters worse. ""The state should put an end to our misery by issuing an order, passing a resolution (in the assembly) or through some other means,"" said P Ayyakkannu, TN president of National South Indian River Interlinking Farmers’ Association

The party has not yet kept its promise to waive crop loans, which the AIADMK had announced in the 2016 assembly polls. Bank officials say farmers have made it a practice to default crop loans closer to the polls, hoping that parties would announce crop loan waiver. The Supreme Court had stayed an order of the Madras high court in 2017, which directed the state to extend its crop loan waiver scheme to all farmers. As on January 31, the outstanding crop loan dues stood at Rs7,677.22 crore. During the present fiscal, Rs7,595.51 crore was disbursed as crop loans. ""Farmers in Tamil Nadu have been facing a series of natural disasters in recent years. Procurement price also remains low. Unless farm loans are waived they will be in a lot of difficulty,"" said P Shanmugam, secretary of CPM-affiliated Tamil Nadu Farmers’ Association. Gaja cyclone in 2018 had destroyed more than 65 lakh coconut trees and thousands of acres of standing agricultural crop. Farmers’ expectations are also soaring as states like Chhattisgarh have fixed a procurement price of Rs2,500 per quintal for paddy.

The situation is bleak in the water-intensive sugarcane sector, where farmers have been struggling to get Rs1,470 crore in dues from sugar mills. Much of it is pending since 2013. The production was down to 9.5 lakh tonnes in 2018-19 from 25 lakh tonnes a few years ago. ""While Sugarcane (Control) Order, 1956, mandates payment in 14 days, the state is yet to act against the violators. We want the incentive from the state to be increase by Rs400 per tonne,"" said D Raveendran, general secretary, Tamil Nadu Sugarcane Farmers’ Association.

Waging a legal battle for Thenpennaiar river water, the AIADMK government is working on a rejuvenation programme for water bodies, interlinking of Cauvery-Vaigai-Gundar rivers and restoration of the Grand Anicut canal system that feeds 694 system tanks and 327 branch channels. With an exclusive policy to support farmer producer organisations, the state wants to help farmers overcome challenges like price fluctuations, resource mobilisation and infrastructure. Self-Sufficient Green Village Movement national organiser P Arupathy Kalyanam said, the state should embark on a micro-level programme to identify irrigation, crop patterns and land holdings.

Celebrations

Bhopal: The FIH on Tuesday gave an early birthday gift to Vivek Kumar, the Indian hockey team player from Hoshangabad in MP. Vivek who will celebrate his 20th birthday on February 25, has been named as the ‘Rising Star of 2019’ by FIH. This is the first time that any hockey player from MP has been selected for such a prestigious award.

Talking to TOI, mid-fielder Vivek said, “I am thankful to coaches, teammates and my family for helping me achieve success in my career. I want to keep giving my best game to the country whenever I get a chance”.

Son of a schoolteacher, Vivek hails from Hoshangabad’s Chandon village, a nondescript hamlet with a population of just 1800 people. “It was not easy for my father to spend money on my training. But after seeing my dedication, he and my brother helped me realise my dreams,” Vivek told TOI from Bhubneshwar, where he is playing a tournament. He is presently employed with the Bharat Petroleum.

Coached at MP Hockey Academy in Bhopal, Vivek had made the country proud with his skills as the captain of the Indian junior hockey team two years ago. Notably, after former skipper Sandeep Singh, Vivek was the second youngest player in the Indian team that participated in 2018 Asian Games at Jakarta, Indonesia.

It was not that easy for Vivek to win the award as players from Australia, Argentina and other countries were also vying. Vivek was the only entry in the nominees list from India in this category. FIH had invited players from all categories, fans, media and national associations in the world to vote for the 2019 FIH Player of the Year, FIH Goalkeeper of the Year and FIH Rising Star of the Year, both for men and women.

Votes from national associations, which include some international athletes and coaches votes, counted for 50% of the overall result, while fans and players (25%) as well as media (25%) made the other half of the votes.

The 19-year-old Vivek won the accolade ahead of Argentina’s Maico Casella and Blake Govers of Australia, who finished second and third respectively. Vivek polled 50 per cent of all National Association votes, 23 per cent media votes, 15.1 per cent fans/players votes for a combination of 34.5 per cent votes. Casella polled a combined 22 per cent votes, while third placed Govers got 20.9 per cent combined votes.

CHARMINAR: Students of Nizamia Tibbi College stepped up their protest against CAA and NRC on campus on Wednesday. For the last 37 days, the students have been demanding that the Centre withdraw the controversial law. They also urged the state government to ensure early passage of the resolution in the state assembly against the citizenship laws.

“We have been organising sit-in protest in the campus. After attending classes we joined our fellow protesters and raised slogans of ‘padhenge bhi aur ladhenge bhi’ to safeguard our Constitution,” said a final year student of the college.

Students also demanded that the TRS government take a tough stand against steps being taken against anti-CAA protesters. “If the government is really concerned and claims to support the movement, then why are people not allowed to protest? We want to know why chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao is delaying passage of the resolution in the assembly?” asked Zubair Alam.

The students have been holding protests against CAA on the campus between 3 pm and 8 pm everyday. Wednesday’s protest ended with a candle march.

DURGAPUR: Back home over a month after she was attacked on the JNU campus—her bloodied photograph became the face of the anti-CAA movement— student union president Aishe Ghosh made the most of Wednesday, spending the day with her parents. But the stay had to be brief as Aishe is scheduled to attend anti-CAA and anti-NRC protests in Kolkata from February 13.

“It always feels nice to be back home, to be with parents. I came here for treatment but I can’t spend much time here. I will leave for Kolkata on Thursday for protest meetings there,” she told TOI from her Durgapur DTPS Colony home, where she arrived late on Tuesday. “It is not only us in Delhi, students and people in Bengal have also been protesting against the new citizenship law. This must continue till we put an end to this divisive agenda of BJP-RSS.” Aishe said that much as she liked to be home with her parents, it was important she returned to Delhi quickly. “We plan to continue with our protests,” she said, laughing that she did not even get time to have her favourite prawn curry that is cooked by her mother, Sharmistha.

Her parents are equally disappointed. “Aishe came home after two months and it always feels good to have her around,” said her father, Debashis. “But how do I spend any time with her? She is always on phone. She is getting frequent calls. JNUSU students are also calling her. “She is with us for a day and I need to complete all her medical tests and doctor’s check-up before she leaves.”

Her mother could not stop smiling: “I am very happy. Since I wanted to spend some time with my daughter, I cancelled all my tuitions for the day.”

Aishe’s Kolkata schedule is packed. On February 13, she will attend a rally from Mayo Road Gandhi statue to Shyambazar and also likely to visit the Park Circus protest venue to show her solidarity with the women there.

The next day, she will march from IIEST to Sarat Sadan in Howrah. Later, she is likely to address a Jadavpur University student union election rally at JU Gate 4. The same day, she is likely to go to Presidency University. “Our protests will continue,” she said.

IG Vijay Sakhare and DCP G Poonguzhali at a news briefing in Kochi on Wednesday

KOCHI: Policing in the city is all set to get a fillip as a slew of projects, including a digital software system which enables public to hide their identity while providing anonymous tips. The projects would be launched by the chief minister on Saturday.

Tips can be sent to an app named Yoddhav , and would be primarily for providing tips on narcotics abuse. Anyone from anywhere in the world can use WhatsApp to send an anonymous tip to the mobile application, which would be handled by the police.

“Abuse of drugs is growing despite strict enforcement. People are scared to report crime, fearing reprisal from the goons engaged in such criminal activities. With the app, we expect the public to be fearless in giving us useful information as even we wouldn’t know the identity of the informer,” said Kochi city police commissioner Vijay Sakhare.

The city police chief said that to counter the possibility of miscreants sharing bogus or misleading information to take advantage of the anonymity, the information received will be verified through independent sources.

Another important division set to be inaugurated is the Kochi Cyberdome set up by the city police commissionerate in public-private partnership at Infopark. The facility has already started working and monitors the internet to nab those who engage in extremist activities, child pornography, human trafficking, economic offences, fake news and drug dealings over the internet. Another facility to be launched is a cybercrime police station for prevention and investigation of cybercrimes.

Infopark police station will also be formally inaugurated on the same day. The station would cater to the IT hub, including the multinational companies and IT professionals from across the country and abroad. A regional forensic science laboratory aimed at improving the criminal justice delivery system through scientific analysis of evidence will also be inaugurated on the same day.

The foundation stone for upper subordinate quarters will be laid at Kalamassery. The chief minister will also unveil the model of an integrated police complex in the city.

KOLKATA: Taking cue from the protesters at Shaheen Bagh in Delhi, women in Kolkata have taken the lead in the movement against the new citizenship law in Kolkata. From homemakers to professionals, from students to mothers carrying their kids in their arms, women have transcended age, community and social-strata barriers to raise their voices against CAA and NRC .Placing themselves firmly in the heart of the protests, they have been organising sit-ins, using social media to spread the word, working on creative slogans and managing the logistics behind the scene. Regular visitors to the Park Circus Maidan protest venue could not have missed the impassioned Nousheen Baba Khan, dressed in a pair of jeans, a pullover and an “no-CAA, no-NRC” bandana on her forehead, raising slogans and energising the crowd.The PhD scholar spends 16-to-18 hours at Park Circus every day. “The day the discriminatory citizenship law was passed, I decided I would oppose it from the streets of the city,” said Nousheen, now invited to other sit-ins and protests. “Many women, who are now in the heart of the movement, were apprehensive to step out as they had not done it ever. I explained to them where things were headed to.”Navamita Chandra, who demonstrated her antipathy towards CAA and NRC by refusing to accept her degree at Jadavpur University convocation last year, not only participates in regular rallies but has also come up with a play to explain the nuances of the “anti-people law”. She interacts with other women at various sit-in points in the city to keep their morale high. “The passing of CAA, along with the violence unleashed on students, was a tipping point for all of us. We realised we were being drawn into an abyss. The government is making a fool out of citizens by not even bringing up issues, such as unemployment, safety of women, the slide of India in global hunger index and education,” said Chandra, who has done her Masters from JU.Over the past seven weeks, women, like Noor Mahvish, who comes from a family of freedom fighters, have pinned her hopes on the promise of a change. “I even motivated my mother to join the protests,” said Noor, a law student. She has been active in addressing street-corner meetings and door-to-door campaigns in various neighbourhoods. “Awareness and initiative were lacking among people. We are organising several awareness programmes on the new law.”Rupkatha Basu has been utilising her creative skills to coin catchy slogans, create colourful posters and compose songs for anti-CAA protests. “Art is an effective medium to speak the truth. I am also using it to put history in perspective,” said Basu.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74115271,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-158200,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/women-to-the-fore-take-up-reins-of-anti-caa-movement-in-city/articleshow/74107544.cms

Jaipur: Deputy leader of Opposition Rajendra Rathore raised the issue of threat to RSS leaders and offices from various terror outfits and demanded adequate security from the government in the assembly on Wednesday.

Referring to the Intelligence Bureau's recent inputs, Rathore said the RSS offices and leaders in Rajasthan, Punjab and Maharashtra were on the hit-list of global terror outfits like Al-Qaida, Jaish-e-Mohammed, Lashkar-e-Taiba, Indian Mujahideen, Tehrik-i-Taliban.

He said the IB has alerted the Rajasthan government also that the terror organisations could use IED-laden vehicles to carry out the attacks.

He said the state government should make arrangements for security in wake of the IB alerts.

Rathore said that security arrangements have been made in Punjab and Maharashtra and the matter should be taken seriously in Rajasthan as well.

Rathore raised the issue during Zero Hour but there was no immediate response from the government.

KOCHI: In a bid to further improve the detective skills of police officers, Ernakulam Rural police, in association with the district legal services authority, launched a year-long intensive training programme for police personnel.

Senior police officers said that 100 police personnel will be given day-long training on every Wednesday. “Three personnel each from every police station irrespective of their ranks and are aged under 45 will be selected for the weekly training. The idea, sources said, is to expose the entire 2,800-strong force to training by the end of the year,” said an officer. The training will be non-negotiable and cannot be put off except with the prior permission of district police chief K Karthick in exceptional circumstances.Officers will be divided into categories based on the type of cases they handle, and will be given training in their respective field of specialization.

Sources said that officers from the hurt and homicide wing of police stations across the Rural limits would be trained under the name Red Caps . Those handling property related cases would be trained as Blue Caps and those handling economic offences would be named White Caps.

As many as 105 officers, who were selected from various police units in the Rural district, attended the first class on Wednesday. The classes were led by assistant public prosecutor (court for considering offences by MPs and MLAs) Aaromalunni M S.

The course was inaugurated by district and sessions judge Kauser Edappagath at a ceremony held at the district police headquarters at Aluva. The district judge stressed on the need to bring professionalism in police investigations and the importance of such training programmes.

The event was presided over by additional superintendent of police M J Sojan. Speaking at the event, Sojan said that court will be able to award the right punishment for the culprits only if the investigators exhibit better detective skills.

Experts from various training institutes and agencies will be brought in as faculty to conduct the training. Sources said the training will be a continuous process and wouldn’t end in just a year.

AHMEDABAD: Ahmedabad is under extreme security surveillance and the city police are preparing to sanitize all key venues — Motera Stadium, Sabarmati Ashram , and the SVBP Airport — which are part of the US President’s Donald Trump ’s itinerary.

The security measures comprise anti-sabotage drills with sniffer dogs, night vigil on city roads, checking on visitors to Sabarmati Jail among many others. Meanwhile, Motera Stadium, the world’s biggest cricketing arena, may be handed over to security agencies on February 16 for sanitization, top city police officials said.

A combined security force of city police, National Security Guard (NSG) and officers of Special Protection Group (SPG) has already started cleansing of the other high-security places.

On Wednesday, two high-level meetings were held regarding the review of security arrangements in the city. “Top government officials took part in the meeting that discussed the arrangements threadbare,” a top official said.

According to sources, a census is also underway around Motera and surrounding areas to detect fresh influx in the area. “We are also studying the C Forms in every police station to verify how many foreign nationals have come to the city during recent times, their background and also places they have visited before stepping into the city,” the official added.

A special monitoring unit has been deployed at the Ahmedabad Central Jail where, in collaboration with jail officials, security officials are monitoring movement in and outside the jail premises, especially with July 26 bomb blast accused being lodged here.

All entry and exit points of the city, hotels and guest houses, public transport system, railway and bus stations are also on the security radar, a police official said.

AHMEDABAD: In a rare case, a quarter-century after the Mehsana court had acquitted a man for his wife’s murder , the Gujarat high court has ordered the trial court to get seven important witnesses in the witness box for examination.The high court has found the prosecution was conducted in cavalier manner and the trial unfair. It said that the acquittal of the accused was a travesty of justice because seven witnesses, before whom the man had made extra-judicial confession, are now required to be examined before the court. Their statements were recorded by police, but prosecution dropped them as witnesses during the trial. The led to the acquittal of the murder victim’s husband. The HC has ordered the trial court to complete examination of these witnesses in four weeks and certify their statements to the HC for further proceedings.In this case, Vishnu Patel was accused of murdering his wife Sumitra in 1994 with the help of two friends. He wanted to divorce Sumitra, but the latter did not agree. Patel staged a road accident and lodged a false FIR for accident resulting in his wife’s death. Police filed B summary in this case.However, Sumitra’s father filed a murder complaint. Police arrested Patel and his two friends for Sumitra’s murder, criminal conspiracy and destruction of evidence. Patel had admitted committing his wife’s murder before at least seven persons, who told police about it. But the public prosecutor did not examine these seven witnesses. The court acquitted the trio in 1995.The government challenged the acquittal in the HC in 1996. Twenty-four years later, a bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice B D Karia expressed “shock and surprise” over the prosecution’s decision to drop important witnesses during the trial. The HC observed, “We are of the view that the non-examination of the material witnesses by the prosecution led to travesty of justice. It cannot be said that there was a fair trial.”The HC decided to postpone hearing of appeal and took suo motu decision under provision of Section 391 of the Criminal Procedure Code to direct the trial court to secure more evidence by examining the seven witnesses. It said that if prosecution had failed, it was trial court’s duty to enforce attendance of witnesses.“Acquittal or conviction without following such measures will be negation of justice. Just as wrong conviction without sufficient (evidence) is bad, wrong acquittal is equally bad… No crime should go unpunished. Crime never dies.” The HC has sought more evidence from trial court with the observation, “We are clear that in the case on hand the additional evidence is necessary in the interests of justice.”",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74109404,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-346588,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/25-years-after-wifes-murder-man-faces-heat-from-hc/articleshow/74107613.cms

HYDERABAD: How easy is it to buy a toll-free number? A quick Google search reveals that several websites provide toll-free numbers for as less than as Rs 2,000. Some even provide a 15-day to 30-day free trial.Cyberabad cybercrime cops have received complaints, mostly petitions, involving people cheated by fraudsters using these toll-free numbers. Ironically, police confirm that most of the duped people are IT professionals.“The fraudsters are buying the toll-free numbers and then contacting gullible people. Pretending to call from companies like Zomato, Snapdeal, Axis Bank, etc, they are convincing people to make payments. As the calls are made from toll-free numbers, people give away details on the assumption that the call has been made from a genuine company,” said ACP, cybercrime, Y Srinivas Kumar.A majority of the fraudsters are traced to three districts of Bihar — Nawada, Nalanda and Sheikhpura. Even though cops have received a large number of cases in the last six months, only one case has been detected in the recent past. “If the fraudsters use a mobile phone number, we can get in touch with the service provider and trace the accused. But, with these toll-free numbers, it becomes hard to trace the scammers. Websites providing these toll-free numbers have little or no verification process of those purchasing these toll-free numbers,” the ACP explained.He said most of cases were traced to three districts of Bihar. “But, identifying the accused is difficult.”In a recent case, four persons of Nawada were arrested after they cheated a woman of Rs 2.3 lakh using a toll-free number. The accused sent a message to the victim pretending to be from Snapdeal. The message read like this: “Congratulations! You are a winner of Snapdeal Company Online shopping. You have won the first prize TATA Nexon Car Or an amount Rs 6,90,000/-. You have to pay company registration charges, Rs 6,500/- in SBI bank. For deposit Details contact me Helpline Toll-free Number 1800313xxxx (sic).”After calling toll-free number to claim her prize, the woman paid Rs 2.3 lakh towards various charges and later realised she was conned.

Bhopal: Exactly two years after the Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC) dug and dumped rubble from Reth Ghat intersection in the 250-year-old Qudsia Park, the garden of botanical importance was restored to some semblance of respectability on Tuesday night. The restored park was inaugurated by MLA Arif Masood.

“Without prior information, BMC started dumping construction waste in Qudsia Park. Construction activity will not be permitted within the park,” BMC corporator Raisa Mallik had told TOI in 2017. It took two years for her to restore the BMC park.

On February 11, 2017, the BMC had dug up the park with a JCB machine and dumped rubble from Reth Ghat intersection there. After 5-6 hours since the dumping began, locals objected to BMC’s activity, alleging that dumping rubble in the park would destroy the more than 250-year-old park along the Upper Lake. The local opposition forced the civic body to halt the work.

A year before this incident, the park was designated for building construction by the BMC. Mayor Alok Sharma had mooted the idea to build a library at Qudsia Park.

Qudsia Park has a glorious history. It was one of the main attractions for Allama Iqbal to visit Bhopal. Iqbal penned some 14 nazms (poems) during his stay here between 1934 to 1938. What brought him here was another of Bhopal’s specialities, Unani, an alternate medicine in the form of that follows the Graeco Arabic medicine. Iqbal spent significant time at the park. He lived at Sheesh Mahal located nearby.

Iqbal Maidan, which was originally named as Khirniwala Maidan, used to be the city square of Bhopal with splendid gardens around. People’s sentiments are attached to the Khirniwala Maidan and its adjoining gardens.

AHMEDABAD: A 20-year-old woman on Tuesday filed a complaint against her elder sister, brother-in-law and another man for attacking her in the Paldi area as she denied going along with them on a long drive in an autorickshaw .

In her FIR with Paldi police, Kajal Chaudhari , a resident of Paldi, said that she went to a tea stall near her house on Tuesday afternoon. When she was having tea, her elder sister Guddi Madrasi and her husband, Ajay Madrasi came there in an autorickhaw and told Chaudhari to come along with them.

At that time, autorickshaw driver identified as Chetan Thakor also began insisting that she should come along with them. But Chaudhari denied to go along with them saying that she had some work at home.

This did not go well with the three who indulged into heated arguments and began abusing Chaudhari. The heated arguments took an ugly turn when Ajay pulled out a stick from the autorickshaw and began beating Chaudhari on her thighs.

As she tried to defend, he had hit the stick on her forehead inflicting critical injuries. Chaudhari started screaming for help and people gathered there and rescued her.

Meanwhile, the three accused fled from the spot.

Chaudhari was taken to L G hospital at Kankaria where she was being treated for her injuries. On her complaint, Paldi police have lodged an FIR of assault against the three persons.

NAGPUR: Teachers from three government institutes in Nagpur are up in arms over the joint director’s decision to make them conduct petty inspection at aided and unaided education colleges in Wardha, Gondia and Bhandara. The inspection included confirmation of norms laid down by National Council of Teachers Education (NCTE)/Rehabiliatoin Council of India (RCI).

So far, teachers would get appointed on the important local enquiry committees (LEC) having more powers and bigger role where they checked compliance on parameters as per the pro forma and assess colleges.

The associate professors and assistant professors, who were assigned the petty task, have contested the joint director’s move saying it was the responsibility of non-teaching staff. The visits disrupted teaching and learning from January 24 to 30 at Institute of Science, Vasantrao Naik Government Institute of Social Sciences and Arts and Institute of Forensic Sciences.

Officials said the inspection has to be done by ‘government officers’ and since the teachers come through MPSC cadre they fit the criteria. “The government teachers come under Maharashtra Education Collegiate Branch Class I type. It is part of their duties. When the authority assigns any work, they ought to do it in addition to regular work,” they said.

Officials said such work is assigned only for a week or once and twice a year. “In fact, teachers themselves volunteer for the work. The inspection is related to teaching and at the time of appointment, they accept the rules and regulation,” they said.

Officials said the non-teaching staff is not qualified enough to carry out the inspection.

Contrary to this, teachers said they are deliberately humiliated by the government officers time and again. “The joint director has sufficient non-teaching staff beside he has the powers to requisition more from the other colleges. Our job is to ensure teaching, learning and research. We are not here to whether these colleges fulfil the norms of NCTE regarding staff and infrastructure,” some teachers said.

The joint director’s letter dated January 24 states the inspection has to be carried out by the joint director office and therefore teachers at the government college/institutes are being nominated as government representatives for the task.

Countering the officials, teachers said they say this is assigned only once or twice. “But, after this, we will be told to go for common entrance test. Then, something else will come up,” they said, adding those reluctant to take up the job are threatened with transfer.

AHMEDABAD: Not just AMC officials but even Metro rail officials have gone into top gear over the imminent visit of US President Donald Trump . Metro officials have begun giving final touches to their pillars and bus stands. The only station near the Torrent power station is getting painted.

The road beneath the Metro which is surfaced by the Metro authorities has also been resurfaced so the convoy on its way to Motera Stadium does not have to take turns once it gets down from the Chimanbhai Patel Bridge.

Metro officials said that the pillars are being painted with epoxy paint and every third pillar will have a design with violet paint. The officials said that if time permits all these pillars will be painted with designs.

In all, 60 pillars along the route from Gandhi Ashram to Motera will have to be painted. Officials said that even the elevated route will have railings on the corridor. These railing were to be installed just before the routes commenced.

424,['13/02/2020'],1st arrest in book fair cop assault case is a new face in anti-CAA protests,"This story is from February 13, 2020

Kolkata: The Bidhannagar police made the first arrest in the alleged attack on three cops, including a woman constable, who was reportedly beaten up and dragged by her hair and uniform, inside the Bidhannagar North police station by a group of anti-CAA protesters last Saturday. Police said the accused has been identified as Azizul Rehman (22), a resident of Notunpukur in New Town.

He was produced in a local court on Wednesday and sent to judicial custody for nine days.

Rehman, police claimed on Wednesday, was among those who allegedly stormed the Bidhannagar North police station to raise their voices against the detention of several people who were reportedly involved in a scuffle that broke out between anti-CAA protesters and BJP supporters when senior BJP leader Rahul Sinha visited the VHP stall at the International Kolkata Book Fair .

Rehman has been booked under several IPC sections, including that related to the assault on a public servant on duty and that under destruction of public property (PDPP Act). A molestation case has also been slapped for attack on the woman constable. “We are going through CCTV grabs at the police station and outside. More people might be rounded up,” said a senior police officer.

Rehman, who does odd jobs and lives with his mother in New Town, is part of an ultra-Left leaning outfit, PDSF, and is a passout of Manindra College. “He was a new face to the anti-CAA protest and came to the forefront only a couple of weeks ago. The accused was not part of the 34-odd protesters who were initially detained at the police outpost, the Bidhannagar North or the Bidhannagar East police stations that evening,” claimed a PDSF leader.

Bidhannagar police on February 8 initiated a case against 150-odd protesters, mostly students, for allegedly assaulting police and damaging property at the Bidhannagar North police station. They allegedly barged in, damaged windowpanes and beat up a woman constable, demanding the release of those who had been detained there.

Rights activist Ranjit Sur from APDR said at least one more person had been detained on Tuesday night, a claim denied by cops. A large number of protesters, drawn from universities, like JU and CU, and rights activists, camped outside the Bidhannagar North police station on Wednesday, claiming cop action was restricted to only arresting the protesters. “There is yet to be any arrest on the complaint of molestation by BJP supporters at the book fair,” said Sur.

Thrissur: Even as the festival season continues in the district over 19 injured elephants were returned from parade and 18 elephants ran amok.

On Tuesday, an elephant tried to attack two girls at Chentrappinni near Thrissur and one of them was injured while trying to escape.

The elephant named Nandu Ezhuthachan Sankaranarayanan which was brought to a temple festival tried to attack the students. The students who saw the elephants were standing in front of the gate but the tusker tried to attack them.

When the girls managed to move away the elephant hit his head against the gate.

Then the mahout helped the girls escape. The injured was Ashwathi, a student of S N Vidyabhavan Chenthrappini . Later the forest department returned the elephant from the festival. Last week Guruvayur devaswom’s tusker Sreekrishnan was violent while taking it for the ‘Kootiyezhunallippu’ ceremony of annual festival at Kizhthani Temple and killed the first mahout Nandan, 42.

Heritage Animal task force secretary V K Venkidachalam said, “In January and February 18 elephants ran amok during the temple festivals in Thrissur district. Using elephants in musth was the reason behind this,” said Venkidachalam.

Thrissur ACF P M Prabhu said “We returned 19 injured elephants including the two that ran amok at temple parades.

As per the forest department record there were four elephants that ran amok in January and February”.

“The returned elephants reached the temple parades with fitness certificates from concerned veterinary surgeons. We assured rest and treatment to the all injured elephants,” said Prabhu.

“The forest department will assure to follow the monitoring committee direction in all temple parades. If anyone violates the direction we will take strict action against them,” he adds.

No village has been included in the ESZ, for which the maximum area has been defined as 7.96 km

DEHRADUN: The Uttarakhand cabinet, which met on Wednesday, approved a 377 sqkm area for the proposed eco-sensitive zone (ESZ) for the Corbett Tiger Reserve (CTR). No village has been included in the ESZ, for which the maximum area has been defined as 7.96 km.

The proposal will now be forwarded to the Centre, which will take a final call on the issue. The creation of the ESZ has been a prickly issue, with villagers living near the reserve often protesting against the inclusion of their respective villages in the ESZ fearing loss of livelihood due to the restrictions imposed by the creation of such a zone. To recall, the Uttarakhand high court had earlier directed that a 10km-area around CTR as well as other sanctuaries in Uttarakhand be declared as ESZ.

Urban development minister and government spokesperson Madan Kaushik said that the government had made an amendment in the proposed 10-km ESZ. “As per the approved change, the maximum area of the ESZ is 7.96 km. Besides, for various works such as mining or construction, we have defined and categorised the places from where permission can be sought,” Kaushik said.

Meanwhile, a nod was also given for the budget session, which would start from March 3. “The budget session will be held in Bhararisain area of Gairsain. While we intend to hold the budget session till March 7, the final call will be taken by the speaker, who may extend it further,” Kaushik added.

The cabinet also decided to purchase the remaining land of HMT factory at Ranibagh in Nainital district . The total area of the factory — which is closed now — is 92.26 acres, of which the Centre has returned 33.32 acres to the forest department and 13.32 acres to revenue department. The forest and revenue department originally owned the land.

The Centre-appointed National Buildings Construction Corporation (NBCC) has been asked to find the cost of the remaining land. “The NBCC has estimated the cost of remaining land to be Rs 72.1 crore and the state cabinet has decided to purchase the land for development projects,” added the minister.

In another cabinet decision, now private land owners can directly get lease for mining. “Earlier, there was a provision under which private land owners had to bid for mining on their own land. However, now they can themselves carry mining after getting the permission of the district magistrate concerned,” he added. Earlier the permission for mining on such private lands was given by the state government.

Against the demand of 149 posts, the cabinet had earlier approved 39 posts for Mussoorie Dehradun Development Authority (MDDA) and on Wednesday, it gave a green signal to another 78 posts, which would be filled by regular and contractual employees.

If the student fails to clear the test even after the grace period, the student can be made to repeat the class,” state government spokesperson Madan Kaushik said.

The cabinet has also formed a committee of three ministers headed by forest minister Harak Singh Rawat to study the State University Bill, which the state intends to bring in 2020. “The committee, which also includes agriculture minister Subodh Uniyal and higher education minister Dhan Singh Rawat, will study the matter and make its recommendations in the next few days,” Kaushik added.

Further, the cabinet gave approval to College of Engineering and Technology, Roorkee to upgrade itself to a university.

Starting from February 20, this weeklong cultural extravaganza will see a perfect blend of youth and experience mesmerising the audience in the backdrop of ethereal Khajuraho temples, a UNESCO World Heritage site in Chhatarpur district, with their mastery over various classical dance forms, including Kathak, Bharatanatyam, Odissi, Kuchipudi, Mohiniattam, Sattriya.

This year, the inaugural day will see two virtuoso dancers—gurus Uma Sharma and Jatin Goswami—perform for the discerning audience. Both will also receive Kalidas Samman from MP government at the festival.

Looking forward to attend the event, Uma Sharma said, “This will be my sixth performance at Khajuraho festival, which is very close to my heart. I will be performing there after a gap of 12-15 years, along with my troupe, so it makes it extra special. My focus would be on abhinaya, sadly this aspect is losing its lustre when it comes to all the dance forms today. I would like to revive it, especially for the youngsters.""

Goswami who had performed earlier at the prestigious fest in 2002, shared, ""This will be my second performance at one of the best classical festivals in the world. I really hope that I can inspire the youngsters to take up ethnic traditional dance forms like Sattriya, which are slowly becoming extinct.""

A major tourist attraction, the annual fest is attended by a lot of tourists from India and abroad. Despite the ongoing coronavirus scare, the number of foreign tourists is not likely to nosedive. “People plan their trips to Khajuraho especially during this time because the weather turns beautiful with the advent of spring and sublime aura around the temples adds to the magic of dance performances. This year too, we expect around 200 foreign tourists every day, especially from the United States, Britain, France and Germany, along with Indians,"" said Akhilesh, director of Ustad Allauddin Khan Sangeet Evam Kala Academy, department of culture, Madhya Pradesh, the organiser of the event.

""With each passing year, we have seen the number of youngsters increase at this event,"" said Akhilesh and added, ""We have invited the students of dance from various music colleges across the state, so that they get a platform to watch some of the internationally acclaimed dancers at this unique platform. It is a great learning experience for them.""

Meera das, Pujita Krishna, Krishna Mohan Mishra, Lata Singh Munshi, Shobana Pillai, Suprava Mishra, Anand Shankar Jayant, Y Asha Kumari, Kshitija Barve, Ragini Makkhar, N. Srikanth , Aswathy Srikanth, Nair sisters, Narthaki Nataraj, Bhadra Sinha, Gayatri Verma, Richa Joshi, Deepak Gangani, Mohika Saxena, Srividya, Enakshi Sinha, Sinam Basu, Amita Khare are some of the dancers expected to perform at the event.

430,['13/02/2020'],Sena MP moves bill to promote 2-child norm,"This story is from February 13, 2020

Shiv Sena MP Anil Desai

NEW DELHI: Shiv Sena's Rajya Sabha MP Anil Desai has moved a private member's bill proposing incentives to promote a two-child norm, a proposal that is likely to be discussed when Parliament meets for the second half of the Budget session.

Private member's bills rarely proceed beyond discussion and it is unclear how Sena's new allies Congress and NCP will view the subject of Desai's bill and might be tempted to see the move in political terms as being intended to target Muslims more than other sections of the population.

Desai has proposed that the Constitution be amended to introduce a new provision incentivising those adhering to a two-child norm. The MP told TOI that he had the consent of Maharashtra CM and party chief Uddhav Thackeray to introduce the bill in the upper House.

However, he reiterated that the bill was in a ""nascent stage"" and there was no question of going against the will of allies as the proposal was about incentives to adherents and no forceful compliance was suggested in the bill. The bill, though, calls for withdrawal of benefits to those who violate the norm.

""This is just an idea which I shared with party chief Uddhav Thackerayji. He was okay with the idea. However, there is no point of difference with the alliance partners as the bill has been just introduced,"" Desai said.

He said the bill was framed keeping in view the population explosion, which required a national policy and should be implemented in view of the demographic changes in the country. ""There is a constitutional provision and law should be regulated in its compliance. Some kind of legislation should be introduced to bring a proper law,"" he said

Desai has proposed in the bill that the Constitution be amended to introduce a new provision - Article 47A - which will read as follows: ""The state shall promote small family norms by offering incentives in taxes, employment, education etc to its people who keep their family limited to two children and shall withdraw every concession from and deprive such incentives to those not adhering to small family norm, to keep the growing population under control. ""

Desai said, ""We have to be concerned about population explosion. Our natural resources are extremely over-burdened. The rate of growth of a country is directly related to the size of its population.""

Population control has been a key agenda of BJP, which has been endorsed by RSS as its chief Mohan Bhagwat recently insisted on measures to control population growth.

431,['13/02/2020'],"Elections over, DDA resumes processing of pleas for ownership rights in illegal colonies","This story is from February 13, 2020

New Delhi: With the Delhi Assembly elections now over and the model code of conduct lifted, Delhi Development Authority ( DDA ) has re-started processing applications for ownership rights in 1,731 unauthorised colonies in the capital .

Till date, 134 residents of unauthorised colonies have been given property rights in the form of conveyance deeds or authorisation slips under the Pradhan Mantri Unauthorised Colonies in Delhi Awas Adhikar Yojana (PM-UDAY), a DDA official said. As of date, 2,15,156 unauthorised colony residents have registered on PM-Uday portal. “Geo surveys of 7,997 properties have been uploaded and we have received 958 completed applications on the portal,” said a DDA official.

The process of registration of properties began on December 16, 2019 and 20 residents of two unauthorised colonies in north Delhi — Raja Vihar and Suraj Park — were the first to receive conveyance deeds and registration papers of their properties under PM-UDAY on January 3. However, no conveyance deeds were issued by DDA as the poll code came into effect from January 6, when the elections were announced.

DDA was though later allowed by the election commission to process applications for those who had registered on the portal before January 6. There were about 80,000 such people. But the response to the scheme was lukewarm due to elections, said another DDA official, adding that they expect the number of applications to spiral now.

The Union Cabinet had in October 2019 approved the proposal to grant ownership rights to residents of the 1,731 unauthorised colonies in the city. The boundaries of these unauthorised colonies were then uploaded on DDA website for the purpose of delineation.

The DDA portal was launched on December 16, 2019, facilitating the applicants to apply for ownership rights online. DDA has also created 25 help desks to facilitate applications for ownership rights by residents of unauthorised colonies. DDA has outsourced the work of carrying out GIS mapping of properties for which applications are received on the portal. These firms are taking location coordinates and site measurements of the properties. These companies will prepare the coordinates, maps etc, which the residents will then submit, making DDA’s job of processing the application smoother.

Apart from setting up 25 help desks, DDA has also set up processing centres near these unauthorised colonies. After verification, conveyance deeds of properties will be issued at these processing centres. While the conveyance deed gives ownership rights to a property owner, he/she would need to get it registered to be able to sell it or take a loan.

Five-day weekly work policy by the government of maharashtra

NAGPUR: Following in the Center's footsteps, the state government recently implemented the five-day weekly work policy for all its employees.

The policy, however, comes with a rider — an extra hour of work for five days with Saturdays and Sundays being holidays.

To get a diverse view on the subject, TOI spoke to employees attached to different departments that come under the ambit of the state government.

Manisha Sawale, district information officer at directorate general of information and public relations (DGIPR), Wardha, said, “Generally speaking, it’s not a bad decision. But honestly, for us, there’s hardly anything to gain as my department works from

8am to 7pm. We rarely get weekends as offs because our work revolves around the movement of ministers. Apart from working on weekends, we will now have to put in an extra hour daily.”

Shailja Wagh, assistant director of information, DGIPR (Nagpur), lauded the state government’s move. “We welcome the decision. It was our long-pending demand which has been implemented. The best part is that we will finally get to spend quality time with our families. From the time the central government implemented this policy, we were waiting for the state government to do the same. The move will certainly boost our performance and productivity. The policy is a boon to employees who are posted away from home. They will now get time to catch up with their loved ones in a qualitative manner.”

For Nilesh Gawande, a range forest officer stationed in Bor, the decision will certainly help many employees to relax and recharge their batteries. “It’s indeed a very good decision. If we go by the calculations, then five days per week are sufficient to get the assigned work done. The remaining two days can help employees to unwind and destress. Our union was wanting this decision to be implemented and eventually, it was implemented. However, I feel that the biggest gainers will be the ones who do only office work. For those who have field job responsibilities like maintaining law and order will not be able to gain from this policy,” said Gawande.

On the flip side, some feel that the move will make employees slack and lazy. Chandrakant Chimote, retired range officer, said, “I don’t think this policy will make the right impact. I feel that most employees don’t have the attitude to work diligently. And if you give them an extra off day on a weekly basis, then why won’t they be happy? But in reality, the quantity of work will come down and productivity will take a hit. Workers are entitled to a break from 2 to 3pm. But they leave before 2 and return after 3. People have a tendency to skip work.”

Jaipur: The customs department arrested two persons for smuggling over 1kg gold worth Rs 45 lakh at Jaipur airport in two separate cases.

According to sources, one passenger was travelling from Bangkok and other from Dubai. The person coming from Bangkok landed in Jaipur on Tuesday night and was caught with 589.89 gram of gold, while the person coming from Dubai was found with 475.99 gram of gold when he landed at the airport on Wednesday morning.

The person who landed at Jaipur from Bangkok at 10:40 pm on Tuesday was identified as Mohammad Bilal who hails from Uttar Pradesh and was carrying gold in paste form valued at Rs 24,65,615, while the person who came from Dubai was identified as Mehmood Abdul Nazir who is a resident of Kerala and had gold worth Rs 20,31,438. Both the accused concealed the gold in their rectums.

“We had prior information that the accused were smuggling gold into the country and based on that they were searched on their arrival. We recovered gold in paste form from the accused. They will be arrested as each of them was carrying gold which was valued at more than Rs 20 lakh,” said an official.

Just 10 days back, a woman from Maharashtra was apprehended at Jaipur International Airport on February 2 late night for smuggling gold. The woman was carrying approximately 300 gram of gold valued at Rs 13 lakh in her rectum. The accused landed in a flight from Dubai and has previously also been caught in a similar crime at Ahmedabad. Everything including sandals, iron, fountain pen and even human rectum are being used by smugglers to conceal gold in various forms, to smuggle into India.

According to officials, those involved in smuggling of gold keep changing the airports and Bangkok as well as Dubai are the places where majority of the time the gold is smuggled from. They also said that seizures and arrests are the only deterrents.

Even though the university administration had started the application process in the last week of December, the last date for submission has been extended six times. Meanwhile, students of over two dozen self-financed colleges, whose examination forms have not been submitted, have not been able to appear for the practicals too as their roll numbers have not been generated.

Agra university public relations officer GS Sharma said, “Some of the self-financed colleges have not submitted the examination fees of the students even after repeated notices issued to them. Their forms will be accepted only after the dues are cleared.”

Agra: Anti-CAA activist Sharjeel Imam, who was arrested by the Delhi Police’s Crime Branch from Bihar’s Jehanabad in a sedition case on January 28, will be produced in an Aligarh court next Tuesday.

Confirming this on Wednesday, civil lines circle officer Anil Samaniya said that Imam will be produced in the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM) on February 18. He said, “Aligarh police had lodged an FIR against Imam on January 25 for allegedly making an inflammatory speech at AMU campus on January 16 against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and NRC.”

The PhD scholar at the Jawaharlal Nehru University’s Centre for Historical Studies was booked under sedition and other charges in several states after purported videos of his alleged inflammatory speeches at AMU and Jamia Millia Islamia University in Delhi were widely circulated on social media.

In the video clips, which have gone viral, Imam can be purportedly heard saying that if he can organise five lakh people, it would be possible to “permanently cut off Assam with rest of India... if not permanently, then at least for a few months”.

Aligarh police registered the FIR against him under sections 124-A (sedition), 153-A (provocation with intent to cause riots), 153-B (whoever by words either spoken or written or by signs makes or publishes any imputation, assertions prejudicial to national integration or may cause disharmony) and 505 (2) of the Indian Penal Code at the Civil Lines police station.

MUMBAI: The All India Council for Technical Education ( AICTE ) has put the brakes on engineering education . With a glut of BTech institutes across India, no fresh applications for setting up new institutes will be accepted till 2022. The decision draws upon the experience of the 2019-20 admission season, which saw every other seat in this technical stream remain vacant.India is home to the second largest cohort of STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) graduates after China, but estimates show the country is the world’s capital in terms of engineering capacity. Put together, India has a total of 27 lakh seats —14 lakh in undergraduate, 11 lakh in diploma and 1.8 lakh in postgraduate courses —but only 13 lakh students took admissions in 2019-20, with seven lakh of them joining undergraduate programmes. While most states have reported nearly 50% vacancy in 2019-20, the AICTE is yet to receive the final data from all states.“In view of the large number of vacant seats in various programmes during the last few years and the likely future demand, the council shall not grant approval to new technical institutions at the diploma/ undergraduate/ postgraduate level in engineering and technology,” stated the new AICTE handbook that defines the guidelines for the coming academic year. The council’s committee, headed by IIT-Hyderabad chairman B V R Mohan Reddy, suggested that the ban be reviewed after two years.The National Perspective Plan states that existing colleges asking for new programmes or for increase in student intake in engineering and technology be turned down, barring those that are starting courses in emerging areas.In 2019, merely six lakh graduates found jobs during campus placements, according to AICTE data. And between 2015 and 2019, a total of 518 engineering colleges put up shutters.Experts say the technical education sector needs a massive revamp.“The hopeless engineers and sluggishness in the industry are leading to a massive breakdown of technical education in India,” said G D Yadav, former vice-chancellor, Institute of Chemical Technology.The Reddy report stated if one looked at seats available versus students admitted, the number stood as low as 49.8%. “Creating any further capacity is a big drain on investments since, at the very basic level, it involves the creation of physical infrastructure like buildings and laboratory infrastructure. We recommend that we do not create any new capacity starting from the academic year 2020. The creation of new capacity can be reviewed every two years after that.”When the sun of the new millennium rose, shining on the aspirations of a young India, it marked the golden age for professional education. In the early part of the previous decade, hundreds of new institutes came up and thousands of aspirants queued up to join them. That was a time when the country was bullish on education and India added tens of thousands of seats to its professional colleges every year. Two decades hence, the picture is one of stark contrast in technical professional colleges. Between 2015 and 2019, a total of 518 engineering colleges put up shutters in India.Joining a professional college was once the pinnacle of an Indian student's career. So often students, left with little choice, joined anonymous colleges. But now, they are put off by one or more of these three reasons: Poor quality of teaching, lack of adequate faculty or no job offer at the end. The tables have turned and candidates scoring even a zero in entrance exams are invited to sign up at engineering institutes. Yet, colleges are running half-empty. The engineering space indeed needs re-engineering.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74110981,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-218333,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/with-50-seats-vacant-aicte-bars-new-engg-colleges-for-2-yrs/articleshow/74108507.cms

Panaji: Congress filed a complaint against education director Vandana Rao claiming that she insulted and provoked them when they questioned the delay in payment of salaries to teaching and non-teaching staff on Wednesday. Congress office-bearers filed the complaint at the Porvorim police station, asking for action to be taken against Rao under Section 504 of the IPC.

Congress held a protest at the education department on Monday. However, the protest turned into a scuffle between Congress workers and police personnel after the education director asked workers and students to “get out” of her office.

Congress workers had demanded an apology from Rao but were physically evicted from the department’s premises. “It is apparent that Vandana Rao intentionally insulted Youth Congress members, which provoked us to breach the public peace or to commit any other offence,” said president of the state Congress youth wing Varad Mardolkar.

Mardolkar said the Congress delegation had taken a prior appointment with Rao to discuss the delay in payment of salaries of government primary school teachers and the closure of vocational courses. Rao, in her brief interaction with office bearers, admitted to the delay and said it was because budgetary sanctions had not been given.

“Rao seems to be holding some apparent bias and probably ill-conceived notions of being an IAS officer,” said Mardolkar.

A CD containing footage of the incident has been given to the police.

Jaipur: Amid protest, the Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) on Wednesday organised camps to issue lease deeds to residents of Prithvi Raj Nagar (PRN) scheme.

According to JDA officials, records of above 315 housing schemes are deposited at JDA and these colonies will be regularised. The move has been criticised by the many residents and BJP workers who protested at the zone office in large number. BJP councillor Man Pandit said, “The JDA has not developed facilities in PRN area with Rs 1,250 crore collected after regularisation of plots earlier. The JDA should first give an account of development work done in the area before collecting development fee and other money from PRN residents,” he said.

After applicants applied online, the JDA issued lease deeds to the plot owners. An official informed, applications for regularisation are accepted online at the zonal offices and extensive preparations have been made for the convenience of the residents. “Advisor for assistance of residents has been appointed at the civic service centre at the camp site to help the applicants apply online,” said a JDA official.

The civic body has set a target to issue lease deeds to all the PRN plot holders till November 2020. Residents, who will fail to procure lease deeds on time, will have to pay double development and regularisation rates to regularise their plots.

For a 100 square-yard plot, JDA will charge Rs 300 regularisation charge (per square yard), which will include allotment rates. Similarly, for plot size between 101 and 300 square-yard, JDA will charge Rs 480. The agency will charge regularisation rates of Rs 720 (per square yard) for plots bigger than 301 square yards and up to 1,000 square yards. Owners having a plot of more than 1,000 square yards will have to give 1.5 times regularisation charges.

CHENNAI: An overnight hike inChennai: LPG prices has put several consumers who had booked their cylinders earlier in a fix as agencies have begun demanding that they pay the difference amount of Rs 147 at the time of delivery. The consumers had paid the pre-hike amount of Rs 734 online.

Price of a non-subsidised LPG cylinder weighing 14.2 kg in Chennai has increased by Rs 147 to Rs 881 according to Indian Oil website. The price hike has been the steepest since January 2014 and consumers, especially those who have paid for the cylinders online, are having a hard time making the revised payments.

“When I booked an LPG cylinder yesterday, it was Rs 759 and I paid the amount online. I also received a booking confirmation message on my mobile,” said Ganesan, a government employee. “But on Wednesday, the delivery boy asked me to pay Rs 145 more since the price was hiked at midnight. Would they return the difference amount if the price had dropped,” he asked.

T Narendranath, a resident of Alwarpet, also booked a cylinder and paid online on Monday. But on Wednesday, when the delivery boy came to his house, he had to return because Narendranath and his family were away and their house help at home did not have money to pay the hiked rate. “We had paid the earlier price online so that when we return home we will have the cylinder. But now it seems like we have to go home and request the agency to deliver once again,” he said.

Narendranath also complained that when he went to re-book the cylinder online, he had to make a new payment. “They would neither adjust this with the old payment nor would we get back the money we paid online. The only option we have is to pay the difference in cash. The authorities should have thought through all this before making the announcement,” he said.

K Parthiban, who also paid for the cylinder online, complained about the steep hike. “People who earn well can afford to buy the cylinders but what about others? The caretakers of my house, who draw a monthly pay of Rs 4000, are already worried about making ends meet,” he said.

An official from the oil industry said the steep price hike and increase in online payments by customers was the reason behind the confusion. “But customers only have to pay the amount mentioned on the printed bill and not a rupee more,” he said.

AHMEDABAD: City police on Tuesday booked a 25-year-old man under Parents and Senior Citizens act along with charges of crating public nuisance under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections as he used to drop his 70-year-old grandmother every day for begging at Shyamal Crossroads.

This complaint is the first case under the Parents and Senior Citizens Act in the city.

According to the FIR filed by PSI S K Barad of Anandnagar police, the grandmother — Tara Solanki , a resident of Shrinanadnagar in Vejalpur, was a beggar. Despite her age, her daughter’s son, Jigar Vadashara, used to drop her at Shyamal Crossroads to beg.

This way Vadashara created public nuisance and harassed people and passersby there.

An official of Anandnagar police said that ADGP Anil Pratham of women and children’s cell of the CID (crime) had spotted the woman during his morning walk a few days ago. Pratham had filed an application to file a complaint in the case.

On Tuesday, a team of Anandnagar police led by Barad went to the spot and found the woman begging in the area.

On being asked, she told the cops that her grandson dropped her there.

Another police official said that Solanki started shivering when she was brought to the Anandnagar police station and was given medical care first.

“She was scared thinking that she would be booked along with her grandson Jigar Vadashara, who is an autorickshaw driver,” said the official.

Vadashara was also brought to the police station and was granted bail, added the official.

Solanki’s daughter Madhu is a widow and depend upon her two sons mainly to earn livelihood by rickshaw driving and daily wages.

NEW DELHI: For the third day, students of Gargi College continued their protest against the alleged sexual harassment during its fest last Thursday. Six days after the incident, Delhi University (DU) also issued a statement expressing solidarity with the students.

In a statement issued on Wednesday, the university said the proctor had met Delhi Police officials on both Tuesday and Wednesday and sought round-the-clock deployment of cops outside the college gate. He has also urged police to take “strong action against the culprits”.

Wednesday was the last day of the students’ deadline for the principal to issue an apology letter, provide the detailed budget outlay of security during the fest and make public the functioning of a fact-finding committee.

According to the DU statement, it “stands by the students of Gargi College in their fight against harassment by some anti-social elements during the annual festival on February 6. The university condemns the said incident of hooliganism, trespass and any act violating the modesty of students.” The university has also sought an action-taken report from the principal.

On Wednesday, the proctor met police officials for the second time to discuss the measures required to be taken immediately for the students’ safety. “The university is constantly on the vigil and is taking measures to inculcate a sense of confidence among the students and maintain the sanctity of safe academic campuses,” added the statement.

In December, the university asked all colleges to review the status of safety and security of women students on the campuses. Each college “should ensure implementation of these plans in a transparent manner with an efficient monitoring mechanism”, the letter had stated. In January, a committee was constituted for the same purpose. The colleges were also required to submit an action-taken report on the same.

The wall razed by the AMC

AJMER: The Ajmer Municipal Corporation ( AMC ) on Wednesday demolished the controversial boundary wall constructed at Anasagar Lake Chaupati and warned the public not to disturb the catchment area of the lake.

One Govind Ram Teli had allegedly forged documents and built the wall, but the AMC went to court to recall its previous orders. The AMC approached the site after the construction of the said boundary wall began and found that Govind Ram claimed that the land belonged to him and showed the court order dated January 17 this year.

The area around Anasagar Lake is a no-construction zone but the construction was nevertheless started. “We inspected the orders and the documents which were put in court and found that they were forged,” said official. The walkway around the Anasagar Lake is a no-construction zone.

The AMC then approached the court on February 7, seeking recall of the orders as the land belonged to Ajmer Development Authority (ADA) and there is no other owner of that land. Looking at the papers, the court on Wednesday recalled its orders and said that any previous orders given by the court on this issue will be null and void. On the direction of AMC commissioner Chinmayee Gopal a team of AMC on Wednesday destroyed the wall and put the board saying ‘no construction’ and that the land belongs to the ADA.

AHMEDABAD: A special road of 1.5 km from the backside of the Motera Stadium is being readied for the high-profile entourage to reach the airport in the shortest possible time.The road — a last-minute decision to facilitate the safe passage of the US President and Prime Minister Narendra Modi — ending near the Mother’s Dairy in Bhat, was nowhere on Motera’s map of things, rues the contractor.It must now be readied by February 20, the contractor said.The road will come up on a low-lying water-logged area just behind the airport. According to the contractor, nearly 50 metres of the new road had to be levelled into a cemented road first in just two days, while the remaining 1.3 km will be topped with tar. Both sides of the new road are free from construction activities and have vegetation that can be cleared easily. Only about 50-odd metres of the new stretch has a couple of residential colonies.This road, which will connect with the airport via Indira Bridge , is being constructed jointly by the Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority and Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation . The 1.3 km stretch from Mother’s Dairy, Bhat to Koteshwar is being readied by AUDA, while the remaining is being surfaced by the AMC.The other possible exit route being readied for the Trumps is from Motera village through the Motera-Bhat link road. The small road which can barely allow two vehicles to pass at the same time is now being widened to two lanes on each side.The police are busy scanning every detail with a hawk’s eye — from details on the road to objects along with the path including the height of boundary walls. According to officials, three roads have to be kept ready, of which one will be decided 24 hours before the visit.Officials said that the road connecting Bhat and Motera is a busy thoroughfare with many high-rise buildings dotting its sides. Both sides of the road are being dug up now to install railings. From colouring of trees around the airport to resurfacing of pedestrian lanes, all works have to be trial-ready by February 20, he said.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74110786,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-151868,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/1-5km-shortcut-for-high-profile-guests/articleshow/74108229.cms
446,['13/02/2020'],Flyover project on national highway near Rajaji gets stuck on issue of length,"This story is from February 13, 2020

The WII while giving a thumbs down to the NHAI proposal had recently stated in a letter to the agency

DEHRADUN: National Highways Authority of India ’s (NHAI) endeavour to construct a flyover on a 30 km stretch of National Highway-74 — which passes through Shyampur, Rasiyabad and Chidiyapur forest ranges of the Haridwar forest division – has been stuck, as a debate rages between wildlife scientists, NHAI officials and the forest department on the optimal length of the flyover.

The debate has been necessitated because the road stretch in question has claimed the lives of over 200 animals —big and small — in the past eight months, according to a study by the Doon-based Wildlife Institute of India (WII). While NHAI proposes to build a 800 metre-long flyover here, wildlife scientists recommend that it should be at least 5 km long. The scientists have identified three animal mortality hotspots on the 30 km stretch and suggested a mitigation plan at three places — Chandi Bridge to Tedhi puliya (400 m), Pili River to Rawasan river (5 km) and Gendikhata to Chidiyapur (800 m) – to reduce accident cases once vehicles start speeding on the stretch after NHAI completes the road construction here. A 5 km-long flyover — which passes through a patch of dense forests on both sides — between Rawasan and Pili rivers, according to environmentalists and scientists, will help safeguard both animals and humans from rampant accidents.

Locals in the area say that earlier, the 30km-long stretch used to be a bridle path, which was later changed into a forest road and then into a two-way lane. “Now, it is being expanded to a four-lane national highway, a recipe for disaster for animals,” a local resident told TOI. Interestingly, the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) had given clearance to the project without getting into these details. Later, though, a case was filed in the National Green Tribunal (NGT) highlighting these concerns after which the green tribunal pulled up MoEF, NHAI and state authorities for “failure to adhere to environmental norms”.

The WII while giving a thumbs down to the NHAI proposal had recently stated in a letter to the agency, “A large number of wild animals use the stretch to gain access to Ganga for water. Largest number of ‘wild animal trails’ on both sides of the highway have been observed on the 5 km stretch. Further, our study has documented largest animal mortality on this stretch due to vehicle hits.”

NHAI officials meanwhile said that they had initiated work only after they received clearance from MoEF. Speaking to TOI, BP Pathak , project director of the NHAI site at Najibabad, said, “We started the project only after getting forest clearance. The contract was awarded and the work began only after the recommendations were approved by MoEF. But, since 2016, the flyover’s size was changed four times. We have now approached the state forest department for clarity.”

Reacting to the issue, Bivash Pandav, senior scientist, WII, said, “NHAI sought scientific opinion in order to save the wild animals as well as human beings from accidents and accordingly, we have given our take.”

447,['13/02/2020'],Nixed requests to slap UAPA on activists as home min: Ramesh,"This story is from February 13, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala on Wednesday said he had rejected proposals from police for slapping UAPA against social activists while serving as the home minister.

“Police wanted to book some activists including Grow Vasu of Kozhikode. It is true that they had organized meetings in solidarity of Maoist prisoners. But that was not a reason enough to incarcerate them under UAPA,” Chennithala said during the cultural resistance organized by Allan-Thwaha human rights committee in front of the secretariat. The resistance demanding the release of Allan Shuhaib and Thwaha Faizal who have been jailed since November 1 last year on UAPA charges was attended by hundreds, including social, cultural and academic leaders.

“Despite our repeated requests, CM Pinarayi Vijayan was not ready to disclose in assembly the offences committed by Allan and Thwaha. Police didn’t even claim that Allan and Thwaha took part in any action. The NIA took over the case only because the CM who is arrogant and egoist gave his nod to the police for slapping UAPA against them,” Chennithala said. “Nobody can be branded as a Maoist because they carried a pro-Maoist pamphlet. CPI state secretary Kanam Rajendran also said the same. This government has so far shot down seven Maoists. C P Jaleel was shot on the back,” he said.

The protest gathering was inaugurated by writer Paul Zacharia. He said the act of CPM to abandon Allan and Thwaha is mysterious, especially since the CPM is known for providing all help for their workers who had been jailed for criminal activities.

“A number of officers in Kerala police are under the grip of communalism. It was a surprise for me that kids from hardcore left and secular families were picked up by the police,” he said, adding that the CPM has the responsibility to tell the public why the party had sacrificed the youth.

Veteran journalist BRP Bhaskar warned that Kerala shouldn’t be another Uttar Pradesh where having a ‘particular name’ is viewed as a crime. Muslim League leader M K Muneer, Congress leader P T Thomas, cultural leaders B Rajeevan, K Ajitha, J Devika, Joy Mathew, P Geetha, Dr Azad and Ashiq Abu also spoke.

448,['13/02/2020'],"NGT terms Karva-Kaliasot patch as forest land, wants it to be handed over to state forest dept","This story is from February 13, 2020

Bhopal: While disposing of Rashid Noor’s petition seeking a ban on non-forest activity in the Kaliasot-Kerva patch, National Green Tribunal (NGT) has not only ordered mapping of the area, but also notification of the whole region as forest land and handing it over to the state forest department for upkeep. The tribunal has set a deadline of three months for the state forest department to accomplish the tasks.

In the last paragraph of their order, NGT judges Justice Raghuvendra Singh Rathore and Dr Satyawan Singh Garbyal said, “After having gone through the report submitted by the officer; the details mentioned therein and the recommendation, we are of the considered view that in order to resolve the controversy, the forest department of the state of Madhya Pradesh be directed to proceed on the aforesaid recommendation with regard to mapping, notifying and handing over the land which is so notified to the forest department. This exercise should be completed within a period of three months i.e. 30.04.2020. Thereafter, a compliance report be sent to the tribunal. Accordingly, original application no. 457/2018 stands disposed of with no order as to cost.”

While the forest officials are non-committal on what they would be doing once the area is handed over to the forest department, lawyers associated with the case are describing the NGT order as a landmark judgment with wide implications, the most prominent being the area becoming a protected forest and a complete ban on non-forest activities there. In a related case, persons owning educational institutions, farmhouses, hotel and restaurants in the area are on NGT notice, asking why action should not be taken against them for carrying out non-forest activities in a “deemed” forest area.

When asked about the NGT order’s implications, Omshankar Shrivastava, counsel for MoEF, on whose report the NGT decision is based, said: “As far as the NGT order is concerned, it specifically asks for notification of the entire patch as forest land. Therefore, the state government should not make any delay in declaring the area forest land under provisions of Indian Forest Act, 1927. Once it is done, non-forest activities in the area, which are blatant, would cease as it would become a “protected forest”.

When asked about the fate of constructions already made in the area, he said: “It is for the state government to take action in the matter, the central government or MoEF would come into play only when there is evidence that permission to carry out construction in the area was given under the provisions of Forest Conservation Act, 1980. MoEF, on its part, has offered to take up an intensive compensatory afforestation project in the area, but state forest department has to decide whether it wishes to involve MoEF or not.”

Senior lawyer, Dharmvir Sharma, who is counsel for the petitioner in a related case in which NGT has issued notices to more than 40 persons for carrying out illegal construction in the area, said: “It is a landmark judgement. After three months, the entire area would become a protected forest, and if it is not done, the state forest department would face contempt proceedings. As far as existing constructions in the area are concerned, they are already under NGT radar in Satish Nayak’s petition. If state forest department doesn’t do what it should do, the petitioner can always come to tribunal to report inaction on the part of forest department.”

Counsel for Rashid Noor, Sambhav Sogani, said that the NGT has done its bit to stop non-forest activities in the area but much depends on how the state government responds to the NGT order. If they act according to word and spirit of the order, “deemed” forest in the patch can still be saved, he said.

District forest officer (DFO), Bhopal, H S Mishra, said: “I have received the order, but have not read it. What course of action we would follow would be decided only after taking the NGT order and the existing circumstances in the area into consideration, but first, let me read the order. Then I will be able to respond.”

Representative image

CHENNAI: At least 30% of youngsters who suffer heart attacks may not require a stent because the slowdown or block in blood flow isn’t due to a plaque or a clot as believed until now.

A series of images of the heart analysed by researchers at a core lab at Madras Medical Mission (MMM) showed the attack was caused by blood vessel rupture. Unlike classical heart attacks that may require doctors to dissolve the clot and implant a stent, many young patients may just need medication to dissolve the clot, the researchers found.

The hospital is now working on a multi-centric trial to confirm the hypothesis, the results of which may change the way heart attacks are treated among youngsters. “The hypothesis is the result of analysis of thousands of images. Such analysis will give us answers to many questions we have on heart diseases,” said senior cardiologist Dr S Ajit Mullasari on Wednesday. The lab, which until now looked into structural images of the heart, will start looking at valves too.

The core lab is named after of the city’s senior most cardiologists Dr Mathew Samuel Kalarickal. “It took us more than 15 years to establish a lab of this kind. Doctors here are now looking at treatment protocols, outcomes of angioplasties, error percentages and causes for error in various procedures,” Dr Kalarickal said.

Across the globe, specialists are evaluating their practice and planning surgeries in core labs. A Japanese study showed that calcifications inside the heart need not be drilled unless more than 500 microns thick. “We keeping learning from mistakes,” he said.

In the absence of sufficient funds, the corporation has been unable to pay the compensation for loss of properties caused by the 2015 deluge. There is a shortage of staff also, since the corporation is not in a position to pay salary and therefore, recruitment could not be made.

Both are directed to appear and answer before this court on February 13.”It passed the interim order on a PIL moved by advocate V B R Menon, seeking a direction to the authorities to formulate and notify transparent and uniform rules, procedures and applicable rates for determining property tax for all categories of buildings in the areas under corporation limits.When the plea came up for hearing, the bench said the petitioner was trying to stall the collection of property tax through the PIL.Denying this, the petitioner made it clear he only wanted a fair collection of property tax as there are many malpractices committed by the officials.Recording the submissions, the bench said, “It is known that the last revision of property tax in Chennai was only in 1998. Though, every five years, the tax has to be revised, successive governments deliberately omitted to revise it for their political interest.“They are afraid that due to revision of property tax, their electoral fortunes will be affected.

AGRA: On the thirtieth day of their indefinite strike on Wednesday, traders of Sanjay Place swept streets next to the market to protest Agra Municipal Corporation (AMC) administration ’s imposition of parking fee at the market. They said sweeping streets symbolised cleaning of “corruption caused by the civic body administration”.

The traders have been staging protests since January 14. So far, AMC administration and government officials have failed to address the objections to the levy of parking fee raised by the traders. Claiming that the parking fee is illegal, the traders have been using public address system to urge vehicle owners to refuse paying the fee. On their part, the parking contractors have said they have been authorised by AMC to charge the fee.

Hiren Agarwal, secretary of the market association, said, “AMC administration is trying to exploit traders by illegally charging the parking fee. We have already paid for the parking space when we bought the land. To muzzle the voice of traders, a mischievous FIR has been registered. So far, over two dozen organisations have come out in our supoort against the parking mafia.”

The dispute is sub-judice. The traders want AMC to cancel the parking contracts till the court delivers its final order in the matter.

The president of Sanjay Place computer trader’s association, R S Sengar, alleged that despite the case being sub-judice at a session’s court, the administration issued parking contracts for three years to people associated with BJP. “AMC officials also get a share of the fee collected from the market. We will not withdraw our protest till AMC rolls back its decision,” he said.

New Delhi: Work on development of two ‘model sectors’ — each with an area of 200 hectares — under Delhi Development Authority ’s ambitious landpooling is set to begin soon.

Nearly 6,500 hectares of land has been pooled under the policy in the last one year, and the land-owning agency has started working on ‘model sectors’, which will set the template for development in other areas.

On February 5, 2019, DDA had launched a web-enabled, single-window portal for inviting registration for participation in landpooling. The portal was scheduled to be open for six months, i.e. till August 4, but due to lukewarm response, the date was extended till September 6. DDA extended the date till February 15 for sectors where participation of landowners has been encouraging.

“The web-portal is open for sectors nearing to the eligibility criteria as per the notified Land Pooling Regulations till February 15, 2020,” a DDA spokesperson said.

As of February 12, 2020, DDA has received 6,113 applications from landowners, through which 6,449 hectares of land has been registered. Most of the areas pooled are in Zone N (3,294 hectares), which is 50% of total developable area in the zone, followed by Zone L (1,659 hectares), Zone P-II (1,261 hectares), Zone K-I (231 hectares) and Zone J (4 hectares).

“These applications are being scrutinised and mapping of pooled land on GIS platform is underway by DDA to ascertain the eligibility of sectors and the same will be verified from the state government,” the spokesperson said. “Based on the extent of land pooled and availability of infrastructure and road network, the process for planning of sectors 20 and 21 (near Puth Khurd) of Zone N is under process,” he added.

DDA said that ‘hand-holding’ consultation meetings were held with landowners of village Puth Khurd on January 24, 2020, and Bawana on February 3, 2020. This was done to facilitate communication between landowners for formation of a pre-consortium body. “After formation of the consortium by landowners, land will be distributed between the members and service providing agencies for taking up development as per the policy,” the land-owning agency spokesperson said.

“Planning will be taken up for developing the model sectors on priority basis, incorporating world-class smart infrastructure. First sectors to be developed will foster the development of other sectors,” a senior DDA official said. “DDA is a facilitator and we are trying to ensure that landowners in these sectors form a consortium or some group,” he added.

456,['13/02/2020'],Marandi's return likely to boost BJP after Jharkhand poll jolt,"This story is from February 13, 2020

NEW DELHI: Fourteen years after he quit BJP to float his own party, Babulal Marandi , who was the first chief minister of Jharkhand, is set to return to the saffron fold. He had quit the party three years after being dropped as chief minister due to revolt by alliance partners, which had the backing of a section of state BJP leaders.

Marandi will join BJP at a gala rally at Ranchi on February 17 in the presence of home minister Amit Shah and BJP chief J P Nadda. His return is seen as a major boost for the party, which lost a major chunk of its tribal vote base since he floated Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (JVM).

Talking to TOI, Marandi said he had a better understanding of the state's people now and would strengthen BJP with his experience. A long-time RSS worker, Marandi said BJP was a natural choice as it was based on ideology .

""There were offers from various parties to join hands with them. However, Congress and Jharkhand Mukti Morcha are family affairs and the leadership is reserved for a particular family,"" Marandi said, adding, ""BJP was the natural choice as I was associated with it since childhood.""

A long-time pracharak, Marandi belongs to the tribal Santhal community, which is settled in Jharkhand, Odisha, West Bengal, Bihar and Assam. He also worked as organisation secretary with BJP's Vananchal committee. His presence will help the party in Bengal, which has pockets of Santhal residents. Assembly polls in West Bengal will be due next year.

When Jharkhand was formed in 2000 after bifurcation of Bihar, Marandi took over as its first CM although BJP was short of majority and had to take the support of independents, including Samaresh Singh, who later withdrew support. Marandi was replaced with Arjun Munda .

457,['13/02/2020'],U-turn: NCP-held home dept gives Elgar case to NIA,"This story is from February 13, 2020

MUMBAI: In a volte-face, the NCP-led home department on Wednesday granted permission to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) to take over the inquiry in the Elgar Parishad case.

""We have informed the director general of police that the home department has no objection to entrusting the Elgar case to NIA,"" a bureaucrat said. ""Accordingly, the Pune court will be informed.""

Last month NCP chief Sharad Pawar wrote to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray saying a special investigation team led by a senior IPS officer should be set up to look into the Elgar Parishad case because the Pune police had implicated prominent citizens and innocent persons. Soon after, on January 24, the union ministry of home affairs issued a one-page order saying the NIA would suo motu take over the investigation.

Subsequently, the NIA moved an application before the Pune court to take over the investigation.

On February 8, the state government opposed the NIA plea for transfer of the case records, seized properties and proceedings to the special NIA court here. While the union ministry of home affairs passed the order, the Maha Vikas Aghadi government of the Shiv Sena, the NCP and the Congress in the state asked the Pune police to produce proof to back the sedition charges made against the leading personalities arrested in the case.

Special public prosecutor Ujwala Pawar submitted before the court that the NIA had not given adequate reasons for the case to be transferred to it. The government contention before the special court was that at a juncture when the chargesheet had been filed and charges had been framed, it was wrong to entrust the investigation to a new agency.

Even as the Pune court is expected to give its verdict on the state plea on Friday, the home department on February 12 passed a three-line order saying it had no objection to entrusting the case to NIA.

The NCP had taken strong objection to the union ministry of home affairs decision to entrust the investigation to the NIA. At the time it was stated that in view of the gravity of the offence, the union ministry of home affairs unilaterally directed the NIA to take over the investIgation.

""It was wrong on the part of the MHA to step in, particularly at a juncture when the state government was in the process of setting up a special investigation team. Our view is that all those arrested by the Pune police on the grounds that they have links with Maoists were innocent and that the Pune police arrested them in haste,"" an NCP politician said.

Why cabinet may not have new faces

AAP 3.0: Ministers in Cabinet cannot exceed 10% of the total members in Delhi Assembly

NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal will be sworn in as chief minister for the third consecutive term on the morning of February 16, five days after the party swept the assembly election winning 62 out of 70 seats.The ceremony will be held at Ramlila Maidan, the site of Anna Hazare's fast, where Kejriwal was sworn in as CM in 2015.All ministers in the previous government are likely to be repeated in the new cabinet because AAP believes that people of Delhi have given it a landslide victory for continuing the work it has done in the past five years, party sources said.The swearing-in ceremony is likely to be a Delhi-specific affair and chief ministers of non-BJP governed states are not likely to be invited.Kejriwal has said he wants to continue the work of the AAP government and focus on development of the city. A gathering of non-BJP CMs may make the swearing-in appear to be a political affair which AAP wants to avoid. A large number of supporters besides party functionaries with their family members, all newly-elected MLAs and other dignitaries will be present during the ceremony.After being elected leader of the legislative party by the newly-elected MLAs, who had gathered at his residence on Wednesday afternoon, Kejriwal staked claim to form the government and sent the proposal to lieutenant governor Anil Baijal. The cabinet ministers will also take oath along with Kejriwal. AAP has invited all citizens to the function which is scheduled for 10am.“Everyone in Delhi is invited to come and bless their son, their brother, Arvind Kejriwal, and take an oath for a better Delhi,” senior AAP functionary Manish Sisodia said at a press conference.“This is a historic mandate for AAP, and for the first time in India, people have voted for work. They have rejected politics of hatred. People of Delhi have shown that they are pro-development and pro-work. The meaning of ‘deshbhakti’ (patriotism) is giving good education and health infrastructure, making a better city and ensuring safety of women,” said Sisodia.In the previous government, besides chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and deputy CM Manish Sisodia, Gopal Rai, Satyendar Jain, Kailash Gahlot, Imran Hussain and Rajendra Pal Gautam held ministerial posts. The cabinet gave representation to different sections of society though there was no woman in the cabinet. The names of Atishi, who has been elected from Kalkaji assembly segment; former minister Saurabh Bharadwaj, who was re-elected from Greater Kailash; and Raghav Chadha and Dilip Pandey, who have been elected for the first time from Rajinder Nagar and Timarpur seats, respectively, were being talked about as those who could be appointed ministers.The total number of ministers, including the chief minister, in the Delhi cabinet cannot exceed 10% of the total number of members (70) in the Assembly according to Article 239AA of Constitution which grants special status to Delhi among union territories. There is no clarity on whether the ministers will get the same portfolios or a reshuffle will take place.Lack of space in the cabinet to accommodate the newly-elected MLAs may be a reason behind the AAP chief deciding to go ahead with the old faces to rule out any bad blood among MLAs.LG on Tuesday dissolved the sixth legislative assembly with effect from February 11, after which the cabinet ceased to exit. Kejriwal called upon the LG in the morning. Later, he submitted his formal resignation as CM along with the proposal to form the government. The LG has asked him to continue as caretaker chief minister till he takes oath as the next CM. Now, LG will formally invite Kejriwal to form the next government.In Video: Arvind Kejriwal to take oath for CM’s post on February 16",elections,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74108778,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110703,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/delhi/kejriwal-govt-to-be-sworn-in-at-ramlila-maidan-on-sunday/articleshow/74108769.cms

A search is on for the girls

MUMBAI: Two minor girls, part of a group of four who allegedly bunked school for an outing, are feared drowned in a water-filled stone quarry in Vasai, while taking a selfie on Wednesday. A search operation to find Khushboo Shaikh (14) and Dipti Singh (15), both Std VII students of a civic school in Pali Hill, Bandra (W) is on.

The four travelled by train and the quarry in Rajivali, Vasai (E), around noon. Eye-witnesses said only the girls stepped into the water for a selfie, lost their balance and were feared drowned. Screams for help alerted a group of women who were washing clothes at a distance. They too called for help but in vain. The women told police they had warned the students, who were not in uniform, not to go close to the water.

Residents informed Valiv police and Vasai Virar Municipal Corporation (VVMC) fire brigade personnel reached the spot with a boat. The girls' families have been informed. The minor boys, who were questioned at the police station, said they had not informed their parents.

Realty dispute behind murder of 5 of family?

Bodies Decomposed, They May Have Been Killed A Week Ago

NEW DELHI: Five members of a family, including three children, were found murdered in their house in northeast Delhi's Bhajanpura on Wednesday. Police recovered the decomposed bodies in the ground floor of the house after neighbours alerted cops on detecting a foul smell emanating from the house.Shambhu Chaudhary and his wife Sunita were found dead in their bedroom while three kids - Shivam, Sachin and Komal - were found lying on the floor of their room. Witnesses say all of them had injury marks on their neck, arms and head.The nature of the injuries will be ascertained after an autopsy. Cops found a hammer and a blade from the house, which they suspect could have been used in the crime.Doctors said Shambhu Chaudhary had injuries on his head and arms apparently received during a scuffle. Cops are waiting for Chaudhary’s other family members to arrive to find out whether any valuables are missing from the house. DCP (north-east) Ved Prakash Surya said a case of murder has been registered based on the prima facie inspection of the crime scene. “We will be able to ascertain the weapons used for the murders after the autopsy. All angles are being analysed to establish the motive,” he said.Cops say the bodies have decomposed, indicating the murders might have taken place a week ago. Even though rooms were not ransacked, cops found the bodies of the couple on their bed covered with clothes.The L-shaped ground-floor house had a garage where Chaudhary would park his e-rickshaw. The apartment had two entrances, one of which was found locked from inside while the other was locked from outside. Cops have recovered the footage of two cameras in the complex to identify the people who had entered the building.“I grew suspicious when Chaudhary and his children did not step out of the house for a long time. When I detected a stench emanating from their house, I informed others, who called the police,” said the victim’s neighbour Kishori Lal.Chaudhary’s uncle Shankar Jaiswal said the victim, along with his brother, had shifted to Delhi from Bihar’s Supol 20 years ago. He had set up a juice stall. “He was earning well from the stall and had recently decided to buy an e-rickshaw. The family then shifted to this rented house with a garage eight months ago,” said Jaiswal.Chaudhary’s sons Shivam and Sachin were both preparing for their board exams. “He was concerned about their studies and ensured that he dropped them to their school during exams,” said his cousin brother Mahadev Chaudhary. The family suspects that a dispute over an ancestral property could be the motive behind the murders.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74108790,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-295661,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/five-of-a-family-including-three-kids-found-killed-in-delhi/articleshow/74108783.cms
