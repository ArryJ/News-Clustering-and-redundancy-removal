1,['22/02/2020'],"Rohit Shetty: 'Khatron Ke Khiladi' is not just about action, it offers wholesome entertainment","His movies are known for power-packed action. And so, it’s not surprising that Rohit Shetty is hosting — for the fifth time — the upcoming season of the stunt-based reality show, 'Fear Factor — Khatron Ke Khiladi' (KKK). In a chat with BT, the filmmaker shares how the 10th season of the show offers wholesome entertainment to family audiences. Excerpts:KKK is a family show and it’s popular among children and teenagers, especially. They love watching reality shows and therefore, we have doubled the action this year. We have introduced a train sequence, brought in lions and there will also be more stunts involving choppers. This was our first visit to Bulgaria , so we had to work hard on deciding the kind of entertainment offered in each episode. The show might be based on action and adventure, but at the end of the day, it is not just about action, it also offers wholesome entertainment. Rohit Shetty alone cannot entertain, so it was also about the contestants and the humour they showcase. The show is not scripted, everything is spontaneous and that was challenging.My enjoyment depends on what new we are offering. When we are shooting films, there are many safety measures in place, apart from CGI and special effects. We have adhered to all safety norms in the show, too, but it is tougher. In movies, the animals shown are mostly not real and the stunts can also be done by body doubles, which is definitely not the case here. So, yes, I enjoy hosting the show because it is real. Also, the USP of the show lies in its contestants, and I enjoy helping them push the envelope.At the end of the day, we are all technicians and artistes — be it films or TV shows. Akshay Kumar and Ajay Devgn are superstars because of their body of work. Similarly, the contestants on the show also have a body of work behind them, whether it is Dharmesh Yolande, Adaa Khan or Karan Patel. I don’t see or feel any difference.From childhood, stunts have been a part of my life. It is something very common for me now.Contestants need to be disciplined because this is an action-based show. However, they can’t prep because everything on this show is spontaneous. If the contestants are told about the stunts in advance, the surprise element will be lost.",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74241829,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-44868/74241829.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/hindi/rohit-shetty-khatron-ke-khiladi-is-not-just-about-action-it-offers-wholesome-entertainment/articleshow/74241831.cms
2,['22/02/2020'],Singing a Tamil song is very challenging: Armaan Malik,"Guess who made a quiet trip to Chennai recently? Singer Armaan Malik! He was here to meet Harris Jayaraj for discussions over some songs he was to sing for the composer. Armaan is not new to Tamil films and has already sung the Hindi version of a song for the Rajinikanth-starrer Darbar (Dil Toh Cute Hai, Tharam Maara Single in Tamil); he also sang for the Superstar in Shankar’s 2.0 (Hindi version, again) apart from others.“I have no idea about the film,” laughs Armaan when we speak with him, “I am going to get to know what I am here for in a while; and what I am going to sing will come much later. At the moment, all I know is that Harris sir has approached me to sing a song in Tamil. I have been wanting to sing for him for a long time, and it’s finally happening. So, I didn’t ask any questions, just beat it here pronto. I love it that I sing first and then come to know of the movie down here,” he says.When we insist on knowing the film’s name, he promises us that he will get us the details by the end of the interview. He sends a text to someone about that, and then continues, “They like me singing the way I sing. You know, in Bollywood, sometimes, they ask you to change voice according to the actor. But we also want to be ourselves sometimes — and I am glad that lip-syncing songs are slowly moving away from films and montage songs are taking their place. Dance songs are the trend now, both in south and Bollywood. So, it doesn’t matter who the actor is, we don’t have to modulate our voice. But having said that, I feel my voice suits Allu Arjun a lot — I sang for him in Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo; and in Bollywood, it has to be Tiger Shroff.”But how can one just sing offhand in another language? “I’ve been singing songs in multiple south languages, and I have never had any difficulty singing different languages. I started singing ad jingles in Tamil and Telugu when I was around eight; in fact, that’s when my fascination for trying to sing in different languages started. So, when I got into playback singing as an adult, of course, Bollywood songs were there, but Kannada and Telugu also happened to me. And now, finally, Tamil,” Armaan states.He rates his song for the Vishal-starrer, Paayum Puli, Yaar Intha Muyalkutty, composed by Imman, as one of the best he’s sung in Tamil so far. “I think because of the way the composition had me sing, technique-wise, and the voice modulation involved, it was a challenge, and one of my strongest,” he recalls. “The most beautiful thing down south,” says Armaan, “is that even before the composers approach you for a song, they’d have done their research and background work, listened to the singer’s songs and would have come to the conclusion that you are the best voice for it. They know you can deliver, and that gives you the confidence to do the best, because like I said, everything is tough in a Tamil song and you need a certain skill set with a strong classical base. So, if you’re a pop music person, not formally trained in classical, you’d find it tough. Though I don’t get intimidated by south melodies, if I complete a song in a day, I feel I have done a considerable amount of work,” Armaan laughs.Armaan’s brother, Amaal is also a singer and music director, and the duo has worked together on many films. “There’s no rivalry, but we do have amazing fights in the studio, which everyone knows about. He will say sing one way, I will ask him to change the composition; of course, there’s friendly banter, too. But at the end of the day, when a good song comes out of all this, we’re OK. There’s a comfort level which translates into the song, and the listener can actually figure out this is an Amaal-Armaan song,” says Armaan, who says his 2020 goal is to get more into indie songs and fit in as a solo artiste, “focusing on doing international music”, he says.The interview is about to end, so we ask him, yet again, the name of the movie he’s going to sing for, with Harris. He checks his phone, and reveals, “The movie I am here for, it’s yet-to-be titled, and is directed by the duo of JD-Jerry, lyrics are by PA Vijay, and I am told the actors are debutants.”",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74243029,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-712665/74243029.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/music/singing-a-tamil-song-is-very-challenging-armaan-malik/articleshow/74243029.cms

6,['22/02/2020'],most desirable man: KL Rahul is the Most Desirable Man of 2019,"FacebookTwitterPintrest

He’s grown from strength to strength and become an intrinsic part of the Indian cricket team. It is no wonder that KL Rahul is the Bangalore Times Most Desirable Man of 2019, voted to the top from a select list of achievers, all under the age of 40. He’s back after his maiden win in a T20 series as captain and is already busy shooting for multiple assignments. Here’s him unplugged about desirability, female attention and more...I’m flattered that people think I’m a desirable man. I’m happy, but I won’t look too much into it. Of course, winning a title is always nice. And there’s been so much love coming my way over the last one and a half years, especially from Karnataka. I’m deeply humbled.Most youngsters have a keen eye for fashion and trends and I’m no different. I’m just lucky that I’ve had the opportunity to travel around and see what is happening in world fashion. I’ve never been afraid to try new things and have followed all that’s happening in men’s fashion. It is now good to see people look at me, be influenced by my style and try to follow the same.If I have to pick something about me, it has to be the fact that I’m calm, balanced and have a personality of my own. Being a sportsman, there’s a certain personality we have on the field. This is something that has not changed in me. Over the years, people tend to change and lose their originality, but I’ve always remained humble, irrespective of success or failure. I’ve seen criticism and a lot of things, but I’ve remained true to myself. This is what, I hope, makes me desirable. Looks are there today, I’m young and have certain features. But I hope people look beyond that and see my character traits, kindness and outlook towards life.I enjoy it and I won’t lie about that. It feels special to be loved and desired by people, especially women. It does make me feel happy. Though, compliments about my innate nature, character and personality, rather than looks, make me happier.I’ve never been uncomfortable about who I am or what I do. There is social responsibility that comes with being a public figure and there are times when I’ve had to learn to say the right things. I’ve learnt that certain things are unacceptable to the public the hard way. Those are times when I’ve learnt that I’ve to keep quiet. But, overall, there is nothing that I’m uncomfortable with. I know exactly who I am and I don’t need validation of everyone who is around me. I’m OK being me when I go out. There is nothing that I am doing that I need to hide. I’m comfortable sitting in a bar when I’m in Bengaluru. If people recognise me, I’m fine. This is because I follow the responsibilities I have as a sportsman.

7,['22/02/2020'],"Move over mythology, discover Sudama and Krishna as contemporary men in this play","Presenting mythological tales with a contemporary twist has caught the fancy of many theatre aficionados over the years, and the latest to be besotted by the same are the city-based theatre group Kahe Vidushak. Their latest work, Sudama ke Chawal, written by Basant Deo , revisits the famed Indian mythological fable about Lord Krishna and his childhood friend Sudama in a contemporary setting.In the original tale, when Sudama (who lives an impoverished life), goes to meet his childhood friend Krishna (who has become the king of Mathura), Sudama only has a bit of rice that his wife has packed for him to offer to Krishna. The story then explores their interaction. “Our version of this story is a satire that shows how this story would have transpired had it taken place today. Sudama would have proven to be a conniving soul with a corrupted mind. Instead of sharing his meal with Krishna, Sudama is upset that he gave away the only food he had for himself. As in the original fable, here too Krishna blesses Sudama’s family with wealth. However, when Sudama learns of this from his wife, he begins to doubt her integrity. The double standards and cynical nature of humankind today , is thus brought out,” shares director Srinivas Beesetty The one-act play, to be staged at the Alliance Francaise De Bangalore today, is being presented in Swang , a folk-dance-drama form that is native to Madhya Pradesh . “Staged in the proscenium format, musical elements have been woven into the narrative. The performance will primarily be in Hindi, and will include Braj and Bundeli dialects. Even if people are unfamiliar with the dialects, given the folk-art nature of the performance, there will be no language barriers,” Srinivas sums up.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74242814,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-323164/74242814.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/theatre/move-over-mythology-discover-sudama-and-krishna-as-contemporary-men-in-this-play/articleshow/74242814.cms
8,['22/02/2020'],Adoption: I wanted to adopt since I was a teenager: Nandana Sen,"Not long ago, Nandana Sen was known for her repertoire as an actress. But soon enough, she shifted focus to being a screenwriter, children’s author and child-rights activist and bid farewell to the screen. In Bengaluru, recently, Nandana spoke to us about adoption and being an adoptive parent. You are mother to a six-year-old daughter, whom you adopted. How has your journey been so far as an adoptive mother?The journey for every mother is, at heart, the same. Yes, I work passionately in several fields I care about, but nothing in the world is more important to me than my identity as a mother. Adopting was a true blessing in my life and has been a transformative journey for me. To be able to fill your home with that kind of joy and give a child what she needs the most, which is love and care, is the most powerful gift that could have been given to me.While adoption is something that a lot more people are opening up to, many end up getting cold feet because of the elaborate process and other issues. How was it for you?I knew that I wanted to adopt as early as when I was a teenager. I wanted to create a family by bringing a child home. It was never an issue with my side of the family, since I spoke about it early on. My family has been extremely supportive about it. My sister too adopted a daughter — my niece Hiya. My husband, John, has been an extremely involved and active parent and the bond he has with our daughter Meghla is beautiful.You left one of your passions, films, to pursue other interests. Would you consider a return to films or maybe write a script on adoption? I will always be passionate about films as a medium, and I love writing screenplays. I’m sure I’ll get back to cinema once my daughter is a bit older. But right now, between having three full-time occupations — writing, motherhood, and child-rights advocacy — I honestly don’t have time to miss anything.What’s your take on the current lot of cinema and the space it gives to female characters, considering you did some very atypical roles in your film career?Though there is abundant talent and passion, even today, women have to struggle harder than men to make a place for themselves, especially as directors. This is why there are conspicuously fewer women directors across the world. The film industry, whether in India or the world over, has a huge gender gap to fill in order to become as open to female directors as it is to female actors.Attachments area",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74243138,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-215537/74243138.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/i-wanted-to-adopt-since-i-was-a-teenager-nandana-sen/articleshow/74243138.cms
9,['22/02/2020'],Carnatic ragas have so much versatility: Abby V,"73 Questions’ is a viral video sensation, which poses snappy questions to the biggest celebrities in the American entertainment industry. In ‘73 Ragas With Abby V ’, the titular Tamil origin musician gives a musical touch to the viral format. From Todi in Carnatic to Bhairavi in Hindustani, the Canadian singer gives audiences a whiff of numerous notes.While Abby grew up in Toronto, his training in Indian classical music never took a backseat. His latest video was a product of his passion for Western pop culture and Indian classical music. “The format has become a pop sensation with the biggest celebrities. Since that has been huge, a lot of comedians do a lot of parodies online. People make comedy pieces out of it, so why not make it musical, I wondered. Indian music gives a perfect background for this. The Carnatic ragas have so much versatility,” Abby said on a phone call from Toronto.Abby, who is a disciple of Carnatic music icons Ranjani-Gayatri and Raji Gopalakrishnan, added that Indian fusion music opens up new avenues for diaspora musicians. “There are so many talented Carnatic musicians from all over the world. You have to be in Chennai to perform Carnatic music. While it is not feasible to come to Chennai every year, the passion for Carnatic music is still there. So how do you do that without being part of the kutcheri circuit? That is where these platforms work,” Abby explained.Who is to say that what we are singing now is not an act of fusion that happened a couple of hundred years ago, Abby deliberated. “I remember, Hindustani music was all about Dhrupad music once and then someone came up with the whole concept of Khayal music. Music is always evolving and we are at a beautiful stage where we are accepting classical music at so many different forms,” said Abby, who is looking to merge his Western and classical influences for his future projects.“I do a lot of R&B and pop music in English as well. I have projects coming up in different styles. I have interesting collaborations coming up with a lot of musicians in India, where I try to diversify my body of work as much as I can. It is a beautiful time to be a musician,” Abby said.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74243055,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-600811/74243055.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/music/carnatic-ragas-have-so-much-versatility-abby-v/articleshow/74243055.cms
10,['22/02/2020'],"My first shot: I went blank the minute the camera rolled, says Mehreen Pirzada","I have been the face of multiple brands, and have had a lot of fun shooting for them. My first ad was for a glycerin soap brand. It had a Cinderella theme and I was quite excited at that time. Then, I did another for a beauty brand. I don’t really know if my ads led me to my first film because Hanu sir (Tollywood director Hanu Raghavapudi) reached out to me through a coordinator in Mumbai. That’s how my first film, Krishna Gaadi Veera Prema Gaadha, happened.Shooting for an ad and shooting for a film are different experiences. When I had to do my first shot for the Telugu film, I was a nervous wreck. But only when the camera would roll. I would be perfectly comfortable with my scene while my director was setting up the scene. But the minute he would say, ‘Clap, scene No 1, Take No 1, Camera Rolling, Action’, I would get confused and go blank. This happened five-six times. So, to make me comfortable, he would keep the camera rolling all the time. My first shot was quite auspicious — I would be praying to God and reciting a slokam.In Tamil, Nenjil Thunivirundhal was my first film, but it was also shot simultaneously in Telugu. At that time, I was not very comfortable with both the languages. So, shooting for the film was quite a blur for me. However, I remember the first scene of Pattas — it’s the one in which I’d be this meek girl waiting for Dhanush to give me way on the road. That shot was okayed in the second take. Shooting with a star like Dhanush was quite an experience and has opened doors for me in Kollywood .

11,['22/02/2020'],Kochi Times Most Desirable Woman 2019: Aishwarya Lekshmi,"In 2019, Aishwarya Lekshmi consolidated her position in Mollywood, while also broadening her horizons to Kollywood. The Kochi Times Most Desirable Woman 2018 had bagged prestigious projects with the likes of Mani Ratnam and Dhanush and has been shooting across the world. It is no wonder then that the actress has, through an online poll and our vote, won the Kochi Times Most Desirable Woman 2019 . Two-time winner Aishwarya Lekshmi in conversation with us:Awesome! I didn’t expect to win it, but it feels great to be named the most desirable woman again though I hadn’t worked much in Malayalam, last year.To be frank, when I look at my body of work here in 2019, I’m not satisfied. I always want to impress with my work, which I don’t think I have done in the past year. I feel, however, that some of my characters stayed with people, which made me desirable to audiences. I have also not tried to be someone I am not, be it in my social media posts or interviews. And I feel any genuine person can come across as desirable.I feel, other than physical attributes, which can be subjective, being good at your work makes anyone desirable. Being honest and kind with fellow beings is also appealing. One need not be a Mother Teresa, but being kind and well-behaved with those around us can win people’s hearts.All of the above, plus how respectful and well-behaved he is with women. I meet many men as part of my profession, maybe more so than if I were a doctor and sometimes, I come across those who aren’t sure how to speak to women respectfully, and it’s very sad.I set my boundaries and remain professional with them. But when I come across men who know to keep things professional and treat women as equals, I find them extremely desirable. Being knowledgeable, having opinions but also a heart to listen to others’ views, and the skill to correct others sensibly if required, are also desirable qualities.I often wonder how some men have these qualities, while others don’t. I think more than one’s upbringing, it’s a reflection of how well one has brought themselves up and I find the effort taken for this quite impressive. Last but not the least, keeping oneself well-groomed is also important.I can't say just one name. I feel both Lalettan and Mammukka are equally the most desirable men in Mollywood, be it in terms of their success, the longevity of their careers, their personalities, behaviour towards women or the relationships they have built in both personal and professional lives. The stories we hear about them are enough to inspire us. It isn't easy even to aspire for the kind of space they have carved for themselves in the industry.I was shooting for Brother’s Day when I got a call from Mani sir’s office asking me to meet him. That in itself felt like a lottery win! Right from the time I had taken movies seriously, I had watched all his films like in a movie marathon, during my house surgency period. I had also read a book about him.I knew he was all set to work on Ponniyin Selvan, and bought the book online. It has five volumes and will take ages to finish, but I am reading it. Once we met, he did a look test on me, and also an audition. Later, dialogues for the audition was sent to me. Once at the audition, it was already like I was part of the film. It happened in front of those like Thottatharani sir, Ravivarman sir and the like and so, I was a bit tensed. But I guess other than me, everyone knew I was in. Initially, I wasn’t roped in for the character I’m actually playing now, and though there was a change, I’m fine with it.After one and half years of preparation, the character look tests started with me. I could see the excitement of the crew during this process and I am happy I didn’t disappoint them. Even though I made a few mistakes, Mani sir said I am on board and that meant a lot.My character needs to be quite athletic, so I was given almost a month of training for that and I’m still trying to continue remaining fit. My friends, who know Tamil well, helped me with the dialect used in the film. More than the challenges, what strikes me is the amount of immense learning his sets offer. All departments mingle very freely and actors don’t restrict themselves to just doing their scenes. For instance, sometimes, when I am giving close-up shots, actor Karthi delivers his dialogues so that I can present mine well. I guess any ego I had was wiped out on this set.The post-production work are on. Dhanush sir doesn’t talk much, but when he does, he makes things easy for you, work-wise. Also, if he hears about you facing any issue he finds out what the problem is. We shot in London for about two months for the film. The scenes were quite challenging. Sometimes when I face big names, I get the jitters and I guess I experienced a bit of that on this set too.Yes, the shoot should start in April. Akhil is a renowned name in short film circuits and he is using the same crew for this movie also.I am taking 2020 a bit slow… sometimes you need to restructure and re-strategise as an artiste for things to work well. I need to find out what kind of an actor I am and work on soft skills like dancing, singing and more.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74242377,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-131691/74242377.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/malayalam/movies/news/kochi-times-most-desirable-woman-2019-aishwarya-lekshmi/articleshow/74242377.cms

My friends and I worked on this for couple of years to come out with this album. The reason I call the album Dummy In Love: Detox Overdose is because all of them are love songs, and when one is in love, he/she is a dummy. It’s a very confusing experience when you are in love. It’s more like a detox overdose that one experiences when you’re in that journey.”The song Tera Mera written by Alamsha Wahab is the only Hindi song in the album, whereas, Iddly Vada Dosai is written by Mr. Kev and Souvik Mitra, and the other three songs are written by Mr. Kev. Apart from being the vocalist, Mr. Kev has also played acoustic and electric guitars, mouth organ and shakers for a couple of songs in the album.The musician says that all the songs are written in different stages and moments of his life. He says, “Each song shares some special moment with certain people, who were present at that point in my life. So, those who have been there with me in those certain moments of life, would recognise and connect to the lyrics and perhaps get nostalgic, too.”One of the songs from the album, Shaira has an interesting video with sketches, pictures and stop motion. “I am a huge fan of stop motion works and I have been fascinated about it since my college days. The inspiration came from 1985’s a-ha - Take On Me music video. Don’t be shocked when I reveal that my friend Vishnu J Nair with whom I worked on it, has no professional skills in stop motion but we did it anyway (laughs). It took us three days to finish the first 20 seconds of Shaira, which is a 150-second-long song. Vishnu did the sketches and I was executing the stop motion work. In total, we took two-weeks’ time.

SRINAGAR: Days after the law ministry sought nominations for the delimitation commission for J&K, the newly formed Union Territory is likely to name its chief electoral officer as member and four of its MPs as associate members anytime soon, official sources said on Friday.

Under the law, a delimitation commission is headed by a serving or former judge of the Supreme Court and comprises the Chief Commissioner (CEC) or a representative nominated by him and State/UT election commissioner.

The CEC has already nominated election commissioner Sushil Chandra for the J&K panel, an EC official said.

This commission would be chaired by a retired Supreme Court judge. It is learnt that the Centre has begun shortlisting names.

According to J&K Reorganisation Act, 2019, through the delimitation exercise, the number of seats in the Legislative Assembly is to increase from 107 to 114 with due reservations for SCs and STs.

A resilient Kerala sealed a dramatic 22-25, 25-20, 22-25, 25-21, 16-14 win over Railways to retain the women's title of the Federation Cup Volleyball Championship at Chittorgarh in Rajasthan on Friday.

The M Sruthi-led side had dominated the field for almost a year. They didn't drop a single set to first win the Federation Cup in Amritsar last October before securing the senior national crown in Bhubaneswar last month. But their superiority was challenged en route to their title on the mud court of the Pratap Volleyball Stadium by a resilient Railways unit.

The same Railways side, comprising veteran Minimol Abraham , Nirmal and Anusree Ghosh , that Kerala had humbled 3-0 in both their previous final meetings were determined to fight back. As a result a five-set thriller was on offer, and Kerala, so accustomed to easy wins, went down 1-0 in no time.

Suddenly, coach CS Sadanandan's girls were in uncharted territory; they had thrown a 4-0 lead in the first set to trail 13-14. Nirmal with her vicious serves had turned the tables for the Railways and Kerala were dumbstruck.

The holders managed to regroup in the second set and drew level as Aswathi bagged a few smart dinks and Anusree KP and Rekha got their spikes around the lanky Railways' blockers. But Railways crawled their way back in the third.

Kerala had appeared lost in the early exchanges in the fourth set before Aswathi Raveendran fetched a pair of morale-boosting points to level the score at 14-all. It was the cue and thereafter Kerala were back in their groove. Soorya inspired the comeback, first with a block on Nirmal and then a sublime spike to make it 21-16.

The decider was evenly fought before captain Sruthi got in the act and gave a two-point lead at 10-8. Though the Railways attempted to derail the Kerala charge they had run out of steam.

Super model, actor and now a fitness icon, Milind Soman had women’s hearts flutter when he came to Lucknow recently as the brand ambassador of a half marathon. Having visited the city earlier too for the same event, Milind was pleasantly surprised at the increase in participants and Lucknowites’ enthusiasm for fitness. “It’s heartening to see such a large turnout of runners in Lucknow this time,” said Milind as he cheered the runners at the marathon, adding, “Six years ago when I had come for the first marathon, there were hardly 600 participants. This time it’s ten folds, cheers for you Lucknow!”Surrounded by women of all ages, while wife Ankita Konwar smiled indulgently, Milind put a condition of everyone doing push-ups in order to click a selfie with him. And soon he had bevy women lining up who happily performed the task for that one precious picture with the Made In India song model.Milind Soman with wife Ankita Konwar in Lucknow during the Half Marathon (BCCL/ Vishnu Jaiswal)Not oblivious to the sumptuous food the city has to offer, Milind gave in to the temptation and sampled the winter delicacies while in the city. “It’s been very exciting being in Lucknow especially this time because this is the first time I had makkhan-malai here which is something new for me. And of course it was fun to run because this time we took a new route. And obviously with 6000 people it was amazing,” he said. “I think you can feel the excitement now. 600 are not that many but if the participation is six thousand now that means at least 10,000 have thought about running and are perhaps talking about it and hopefully working towards running next year,” said Soman on the growing number of runners in the city.Ask the actor-model why he is off the screen these days and he begs to differ and says that although he’s not off TV or films, he is doing less of it. “Whenever I find the time, I do some acting. Like I’m doing several content for the web, plus there’s also my show in which I am also the judge, so there’s plenty happening on that front,” says he, adding what makes him be seen less on the screen. “There are also so many other things that I am doing at all times that I can’t be a career actor. I’ve never been one in fact, right from the beginning. I can’t be an actor for 300 days in a year. So I can do maybe 40-50 days in a year as an actor but after that it becomes difficult to manage the time and the dates. Like I can’t give weekends because then I’m mostly travelling. So to only be able to give week days and then also say that I can’t give more than 20 days in month, I feel is not fair to the makers. So I’ll do maybe one project in a year. But theatre and theatrical movies have become less, yes because people want one to be there whenever they are called, which I am not, most of the times. They require a lot of time because they are expensive, the canvas is much larger and I don’t have that much time for it, so why have the producer’s money wasted on me when I won’t be around when I am required.”Milind enjoyed having makkhan malai while in the city (BCCL)The 53 year-old married 28-year-old Ankita Konwar in April 2018, says married life is amazing and is going on strong. Milind and Ankita’s pictures on social media sites are all about their chemistry and for people set relationship goals. The two are also active running partners. Talking about his marriage, Milind says, “Married life has been and is going on amazing. Rather, I would say nothing much has changed except that now I don’t take decisions based on my own desires. I have to ask Ankita like what do you think about this, what do you think about that, will this be okay, would you also like to be a part of this, etc. So now you have to think about somebody else as well. You have to take them into confidence, you have to discuss things.”Ask him when he plans to extend his family and Milind laughs and says, “I don’t have any plans to extend the family. Though, we discuss about having a baby, so let’s see.”A champion for the cause of fitness and running, Milind says his inspiration to do so comes from his mom, Usha Soman , who is 74 years old and still participates in several marathons. “Of course my mum has inspired so many people and even Ankita is super inspired by her. I too am amazed at her as to how she’s managed her whole life and now she’s into fitness and all,” says Milind adding that when it comes to fitness, age is no bar if you want to get fit. “It’s all just in the mind. If you set your mind to do it, you can do it. In fact, we had an event in Bengaluru this time called the Grandmother’s 10K which was a 10 kilometre run only for grandmothers. That was a super success and so inspiring because you are looking at grand moms differently then. Normally you see senior citizens walking or perhaps jogging but when you think of grand moms, you think of them as sitting at home, making achaar or knitting, you don’t see them in tights and shorts and running in marathons . That is the whole idea, to break mind sets that you can’t do this, or you can’t do that especially when you have crossed a certain age. If you want to, you can and you must. Then we had the sari runs where we had women running on the streets in saris! So it’s breaking all these mental taboos and stereotypes because all our difficulties are in the mind, very few are physical and material difficulties.”",lucknow,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74243892,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-270565,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/i-do-not-have-any-plans-to-extend-the-family-but-ankita-definitely-has-milind-soman/articleshow/74243929.cms

Talking about this first international trip as the reigning queen, she says, “It’s quite overwhelming. I’m still getting used to the fact that people recognise me not only in my country, but abroad as well.”Earlier in December, Anntonia had competed against 76 finalists from various nations and became the first Thai to win the coveted title. “I was doing a lot of charity work back home, and the pageant was simply a spontaneous decision that turned out to be so empowering. Now, I feel like I have a voice to help people lead better lives. However, managing school along with these responsibilities can get challenging at times,” says the 23-year-old, who plans to start her advertising and PR firm along with a foundation that focuses on the importance of health and eco-friendly living.Ask her what she looks for in the upcoming pageant, and she’s quick to respond, “The finalists need to be natural and in their element. It’s their purpose that should reflect in the way they speak. I encourage them to live their flow and be spontaneous, confident, unhindered and free as they live in the moment. Having gone through a similar process, I think I’ll completely relate to them.”Catch the exciting journey of the Divas tonight during the live telecast of the finale at 10 pm on MTV — one of India’s popular youth channels.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74244361,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-64455/74244361.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/thailands-anntonia-porsild-is-all-set-to-judge-the-grand-finale-of-miss-diva-2020/articleshow/74244311.cms

23,['22/02/2020'],Dress your age no more: JLo at 50 and other celebs who don't play by the rules,"We couldn't stop talking about Jennifer Lopez in 2019, thanks to the remake of her 2000 Grammys green dress. And yet again, at the Super Bowl halftime, her performance along with Shakira brought the house down.It is infrequent, if not rare, for cameras to zoom in on women past their 50th birthdays. Well, in JLo's case, it happened quite convincingly, as she glistened in a risque bodysuit adorned with mirror work. But not everyone was impressed and social media remained abuzz with viewers decrying the performance as sexually explicit.When middle-aged women, including celebrities, sport outfits that are young, sexy and modish, commotion and hysterics ensues. However, not everyone bows down to the restrictive rules of so-called age-appropriate dressing. Here's how celebs, including Mariah Carey and Madonna, are proving that age is only a number for them.""Why, at the age of 50, did she decide to pitch up ... in a tacky, black-lace bustier?"" commented the former editor of a fashion magazine, Alexandra Shulman, following Helena Christensen's appearance in a sexy bustier at Gigi Hadid's birthday party last year. The ""cheap shot"", as called out by Naomi Campbell, had a perfect response from Christensen. ""Let's continue to elevate and support each other, all you beautiful, smart, fun, sexy, hard-working, talented, nurturing women out there #ooopssheworeabustieragain,"" wrote the former supermodel, along with a picture of her in the 'uplifting' bustier.Before the Hadids and Kardashians, there was Cher. The septuagenarian proved during her Billboard Awards performance in 2017 that she is unstoppable, which in turn, angered the likes of Piers Morgan. ""At what point do Cher's outfits become inappropriate? She's 70,"" he said during his TV show, adding, ""Come on Cher for goodness sake love, she's a grandmother, grow old gracefully put them away."" Later, in the same episode, Morgan spilled tea over himself, leading viewers to joke that it was an act of ""karma"". In fact, when Cher wafted down the stage in a shimmering dress with diamond tassels, impressing Morgan was clearly not on top of her wish list.In 2015, a news website wrote that the constant age-shaming of Madonna has become ""some sort of sport"" after she was criticised for her Grammys outfit. In 2016, yet again, when Madonna wore a bum-baring black outfit to the Met Gala, critics were unforgiving and called for her to start ""dressing her age"". Soon, hundreds of fans leapt to Madonna's defence and the pop queen hit out at the critics. She called out the rampant ""ageism and sexism"" in society, while asking her fans to join her ""fight for gender equality"". Madge's affinity to bold, theatrical looks is no secret and she has always remained true to her style.During the #10yearchallenge, Mariah Carey posted a snap in a sexy lingerie with the caption, ""I don't get this 10 year challenge, time is not something I acknowledge."" While that day Mariah's Instagram was flooded with compliments,internet has not always been kind to her. In 2016, when the singer donned a tiny leotard and fishnets, her look was panned by many of her fans who felt she was ""too old to be walking around in lingerie."" Earlier, the singer was slated for turning up at a wedding in a see-through mesh dress. ""Mariah is not 26 anymore and it's about time she starts to act her age,"" wrote a Twitter user.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74244329,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-35893/74244329.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/fashion/celeb-style/dress-your-age-no-more-jlo-at-50-and-other-celebs-who-dont-play-by-the-rules/articleshow/74244352.cms
24,['22/02/2020'],Is your work life ‘green enough’?,"Start right at the office entrance and bring greenery into the entryway of the room.

Make a green windowsill with plants.

Brighten up the room with a vertical potted plant wall.

Create open shelves with a green hedging.

Use a variety – go with big, bold leafy plants as well as smaller pots.

Do you find yourself stressed out at the end of a work week? This time, instead of checking into a spa, heading for a spin cycle at the gym or driving out of town, to unwind, how about just trying a simple solution that actually starts and ends at your work desk. It’s a desktop plant. That’s right, a study has revealed that a simple potted plant can help you combat workplace stress.Ranjana R Sinha, who is a full-time media professional says, “I have always been someone who just loves plants and greenery and I ensure that I keep at least one or two small indoor plants on my desk. They are easy to care for and maintain. My job as a media professional is a demanding one and keeps me busy 24x7 and the eight -nine hours I spend at my desk with my greens, really is rejuvenating for me. I feel even tending to my plants like watering them or spraying them, de-stresses me completely. I used to be a psychologist and I know how much this can help a person emotionally. Plants at your desktop is a must, I feel.”Adds IT manager Adarsh Shahani, “Plants kind of take my mind out pf work mode. I have a small cactus and philodendron and just looking at them makes me feel relaxed. Ideally, it would be amazing to connect with nature while working, but for those of us who cannot step outside to a garden or nearby park, this is an apt solution.”The next time you have a large pile of to-do stuff at the table or worried about an impending meeting, just gaze at the plant and watch the stress melt away.There is a lot one can choose from. Says owner of a plant nursery of Cyrus Elavia says, “Try peace lily, moneyplant, crypthanus, cholorophytons, sensiveria, peppromia, aglaonema. These don’t require much water, just thrice a week will do. Even if they are not near a window they be fine.”Why stick to just looking at greenery on coworkers’ desks? Bringing the foliage into your personal space in other ways:A cool space saver is to have a round terrarium on your desk. These are low-maintenance little gardens that fit into most spaces. They can be made in round fish bowls or even glasses and bulbs. Says terrarium expert Deepti Pitre, “The biggest advantage is that the terrariums are fuss-free, there’s less mud involved and no water spillage as the base is sealed. You also need very little water. What’s more, you can do with different themes based on your choice – Oriental with a mini Japanese bridge, a zen garden, a beach design with pebbles and sand, ocean theme with a mermaid.”Numerous studies point underline the value of being among greenery. Not only do plants produce oxygen, but they also add to the wellbeing. Experts say, we have a subconscious reaction to nature. It makes people lesser stressed and builds productivity and creativity. This is valuable not just at a workplace, but anywhere.Several offices have made a decision to adopt more greenery into and around their their spaces. From vertical walls on the outside facade to having plants indoors, greenery has been seen to co-relate with a rise in employee output.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74241639,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-19526/74241639.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/is-your-work-life-green-enough/articleshow/74241600.cms

Having visited the city earlier too for the same event, Milind was pleasantly surprised at the increase in participants and Lucknowites’ enthusiasm for fitness. “It’s heartening to see such a large turnout of runners in Lucknow this time,” said Milind as he cheered the runners at the marathon, adding, “Six years ago when I had come for the first marathon, there were hardly 600 participants. This time it’s ten folds, cheers for you Lucknow!” Surrounded by women of all ages, while wife Ankita Konwar smiled indulgently, Milind put a condition of everyone doing push-ups in order to click a selfie with him. And soon he had bevy women lining up who happily performed the task for that one precious picture with the Made In India song model.Milind Soman with wife Ankita Konwar in Lucknow during the Half Marathon (BCCL/ Vishnu Jaiswal)Not oblivious to the sumptuous food the city has to offer, Milind gave in to the temptation and sampled the winter delicacies while in the city. “It’s been very exciting being in Lucknow especially this time because this is the first time I had makkhan-malai here which is something new for me. And of course it was fun to run because this time we took a new route. And obviously with 6000 people it was amazing,” he said. “I think you can feel the excitement now. 600 are not that many but if the participation is six thousand now that means at least 10,000 have thought about running and are perhaps talking about it and hopefully working towards running next year,” said Soman on the growing number of runners in the city.Ask the actor-model why he is off the screen these days and he begs to differ and says that although he’s not off TV or films, he is doing less of it. “Whenever I find the time, I do some acting. Like I’m doing several content for the web, plus there’s also my show in which I am also the judge, so there’s plenty happening on that front,” says he, adding what makes him be seen less on the screen. “There are also so many other things that I am doing at all times that I can’t be a career actor. I’ve never been one in fact, right from the beginning. I can’t be an actor for 300 days in a year. So I can do maybe 40-50 days in a year as an actor but after that it becomes difficult to manage the time and the dates. Like I can’t give weekends because then I’m mostly travelling. So to only be able to give week days and then also say that I can’t give more than 20 days in month, I feel is not fair to the makers. So I’ll do maybe one project in a year. But theatre and theatrical movies have become less, yes because people want one to be there whenever they are called, which I am not, most of the times. They require a lot of time because they are expensive, the canvas is much larger and I don’t have that much time for it, so why have the producer’s money wasted on me when I won’t be around when I am required.”Milind enjoyed having makkhan malai while in the city (BCCL) The 53 year-old married 28-year-old Ankita Konwar in April 2018, says married life is amazing and is going on strong. Milind and Ankita’s pictures on social media sites are all about their chemistry and for people set relationship goals. The two are also active running partners. Talking about his marriage, Milind says, “Married life has been and is going on amazing. Rather, I would say nothing much has changed except that now I don’t take decisions based on my own desires. I have to ask Ankita like what do you think about this, what do you think about that, will this be okay, would you also like to be a part of this, etc. So now you have to think about somebody else as well. You have to take them into confidence, you have to discuss things.”Ask him when he plans to extend his family and Milind laughs and says, “I don’t have any plans to extend the family. Though, we discuss about having a baby, so let’s see.”A champion for the cause of fitness and running, Milind says his inspiration to do so comes from his mom, Usha Soman , who is 74 years old and still participates in several marathons. “Of course my mum has inspired so many people and even Ankita is super inspired by her.

It was an evening of friendship, love and nostalgia, when Montek Singh Ahluwalia , former Deputy Chairman of the erstwhile Planning Commission of India, hosted a get-together for his friends. Conversations flowed from Ahluwalia's St Stephen 's days to his time at Oxford University, and his friends were busy reminiscing about the good old days at the event. From former PM Manmohan Singh to Sharmila Tagore , the party had many big names in attendance.Sarwar Lateef, an economist, who was one of the speakers at the evening, has been friends with Ahluwalia for over six decades. Lateef spoke about Kooler Talk, a campus magazine started by Lateef, Ahluwalia and Mani Shankar Aiyar . Lateef said, ""I first met Montek in St Stephen’s College where we were studying Economics. His fellow students found it puzzling that he kept topping every exam, but no one ever saw him studying. So, it didn't come as a surprise when he got the Rhodes scholarship for Oxford University.""In his address, Manmohan Singh told the guests that he brought Ahluwalia back to India. He said, ""I can make some claim of having introduced Montek to the government system way back in 1973. I don't know about his days at St Stephen's College, but I do know about his days at Oxford. From Oxford, he went on to the World Bank . I tried to persuade Montek to come to India and I made it absolutely clear that I wasn't promising him anything except love for his country. It has been a privilege to work with him.""All the speakers of the evening raised a toast to the bond between Ahluwalia and his wife Isher Judge Ahluwalia , Chairperson, Board of Governors, Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER). Manmohan Singh said, ""It is often said that behind every successful man there is a powerful woman. And in this particular case, everyone knows that Isher is that one woman.""",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74243427,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-30748,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/of-friendship-love-bonding-over-good-old-days-in-delhi/articleshow/74243406.cms

JOHANNESBURG: Australia off-spinner Ashton Agar took a career-best 5-24, including a hat-trick, as they thrashed hosts South Africa by a massive 107 runs in the first Twenty20 International at The Wanderers on Friday.

After being sent in to bat, Australia amassed 196 for six in their 20 overs as South Africa struggled with their line and length and missed a number of catches in the field in what was a sloppy display.

SCORECARD

The home side were in early trouble in their reply when they lost mainstay Quinton de Kock in the first over and it became a precession after that as Agar helped bowl the hosts out for 89, a record low for South Africa.

The second fixture in the three-game series will be played in Port Elizabeth on Sunday, before the finale in Cape Town on Wednesday.

""We set the tone in the field, took a couple of sharp chances and Ashton bowled really well. It was an all-round good performance,"" Australia captain Aaron Finch said at the post-match presentation.

""The way we attacked the crease and bowled a good aggressive length was really impressive.""

It was a record loss for South Africa in the shortest format and comes eight months before the World Cup being be staged in Australia starting in October.

Steve Smith top scored for the tourists with 45 from 32 balls on his return to South Africa for the first time since the 'Sandpapergate' scandal of March 2018, after which he was banned for a year by Cricket Australia along with David Warner .

Opener Warner's return was not as triumphant as he was out second ball for four, but Smith and Finch (42 from 27 balls) put on 80 for the second wicket in only eight overs to lay the platform for the impressive score.

South Africa were in early trouble when an excellent swinging delivery from Mitchell Starc uprooted the middle stump of De Kock, before Agar ripped through the home batting.

He had top-scorer Faf du Plessis (24 from 22) caught on the boundary, before trapping Andile Phehlukwayo leg before wicket with the next delivery.

The hat-trick was complete when Dale Steyn edged his first ball to Aaron Finch at slip.

It is the 12th hat-trick in Twenty20 internationals and the second by an Australian after Brett Lee against Bangladesh in 2007.

""I'm not too sure what happened there. The energy was there but the skills weren't good enough tonight,"" De Kock said.

NEW DELHI/WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump will be accompanied by not just his wife Melania and son-in-law Jared Kushner but also his high-profile daughter Ivanka on his maiden visit to India as president starting on Monday. The entire family is expected to travel together to the Taj Mahal in Agra from Ahmedabad on Monday evening, official sources involved in planning the trip said.Ivanka and Kushner are technically US government officials with status as senior advisors to the president, but India has not been part of their portfolio. Neither are strangers to India in the personal sense, counting many Indians among friends and colleagues.Kushner, in fact, visited India in 2018 for the wedding of his Harvard classmate Nitin Saigal in Jaisalmer. Ivanka came to Hyderabad for the Global Entrepreneurship Summit in 2017.The final list of the heavyweights accompanying Trump now reads Melania Trump , Ivanka Trump , Jared Kushner, commerce secretary Wilbur Ross, energy secretary Dan Brouillette and NSA Robert O’Brien.Like Ivanka, Brouillette is a late addition to the list and his joining Trump suggests that a big energy agreement might be in the offing.Official sources in Delhi said India was informed about Ivanka joining her father on the trip early on Friday. While she is expected to spend an entire day, February 25, in Delhi, her programme is still being chalked out.According to the White House, Ivanka, in her role as advisor to the president, focuses on education and economic empowerment of women and their families as well as job creation and economic growth through workforce development, skills training and entrepreneurship. Ivanka is known to promote women’s entrepreneurship and empowerment world over in the form of her “signature policy’’, Women's Global Development and Prosperity Initiative. Ivanka has shown in the past, even if controversially, that she doesn’t mind dabbling in foreign policy. She famously provided a White House video readout of PM Narendra Modi ’s meeting with Trump from the margins of the G20 summit in Osaka last year.Ivanka had accompanied her father to Osaka as a member of his official delegation and her attempt to “insert’’ herself into a conversation featuring French President Emmanuel Macron , Canadian PM Justin Trudeau and UK PM Theresa May was roundly criticised by the US media.Ivanka, though, has had experience of travelling to India after her father became president. She led the US delegation at the Global Entrepreneurship Summit 2017 in Hyderabad and also interacted with Modi. The focus at the summit was on providing support to women entrepreneurs.In Video: Trump’s daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared to be part of delegation to India",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74250404,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-84661,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ivanka-trump-will-also-accompany-dad-to-india/articleshow/74250399.cms
34,['22/02/2020'],"Uddhav Thackeray: Maharashtra will go ahead with CAA, NPR, says Uddhav Thackeray after meeting PM Modi","Maharastra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray addressing a press conference in New Delhi. (PTI)

NEW DELHI: Disregarding protests from within the Maharashtra coalition, CM and Shiv Sena boss Uddhav Thackeray stuck to his guns that the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) as well as the National Population Register (NPR) will be implemented in the state, sharpening friction with coalition partners NCP and Congress .“I had a good discussion with the Prime Minister over issues concerning Maharashtra. I also discussed the CAA, NPR and NRC with him. No one needs to fear CAA. The NPR is not going to throw anyone out of the country,” Thackeray told the media on Friday.The CM’s public assertion is significant as they came after his meeting with PM Narendra Modi and before he made a courtesy call on Congress chief Sonia Gandhi . Congress general secretary Mallikarjun Kharge , who is in-charge of Maharashtra affairs, had earlier taken exception to Thackeray’s statement about implementation of CAA and NPR in Maharashtra, saying such calls could not be taken unilaterally.Thackeray said there was a detailed discussion on CAA, NPR and the National Register of Citizens. Modi has previously said that his government had taken no decision yet on the implementation of a nationwide NRC, as distinguished from the one in Assam.Congress and Sena refused to confirm whether the divergence over CAA and NPR figured in Thackeray’s meeting with Sonia. Both sides seemed to sidestep the issue and deny there was a division. “There is no friction among the allies. We will run the government for five years,” Thackeray said after calling on Modi with his son and state minister Aaditya.Kharge said the NPR issue would be taken up by the state-level coordination committee. He termed it a “courtesy meeting” and claimed the discussion between Sonia and Thackeray did not touch upon NPR.The CM’s remarks, however, pose a challenge for the coalition as NCP and Congress have strongly opposed CAA and NPR. Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh, who is from NCP, has assured anti-CAA protesters the law will not be implemented, and has opposed rollout of NPR in the state. On one occasion, he appealed to protesters by saying, “I have said multiple times that CAA and NPR will not be implemented in the state.” Congress has passed a resolution against CAA and NPR.In his first meeting with Sonia after taking over as CM with Congress support, Thackeray is learnt to have assured the latter that the government would abide by the common minimum programme in decision-making and that the issues of CAA and NPR would be discussed in the state-level coordination committee.Congress also seemed keen to avoid the impression of a rift. It released a photograph of the CM and Sonia exchanging bouquets, portraying the visit in a cordial light, the visual contrasting with the public divergence over CAA and NPR.According to insiders, Congress has made it clear that being a national party, it takes stand on issues like CAA with a “national perspective” and a regional party can differ. “But a final decision of the state government will be taken by all the parties in the alliance,” a senior leader said.Thackeray has taken the view that he will not support an NRC and that the Centre has also not given any indication that this is on the anvil. On CAA, his position is identical to that of Centre’s, ie, it does not threaten citizenship of any Indian national. On NPR, he has sought to counter apprehensions that questions like age and birth place of parents are a precursor to NRC, saying he will “vet” the queries on the NPR form. He has made it plain he personally does not find it problematic.Sena’s stand puts it at odds with its partners, but might be driven by a desire to signal to its Hindutva base that it is not abandoning the basics — a decision that might be prompted by reports that its cadre has actively participated in pro-CAA rallies and mobilised with Hindutva sentiments.“No one needs to fear about the CAA and the NPR. These are not going to throw anyone out of the country,” Thackeray said on Friday evening.This was Thackeray’s first meeting with Modi after taking over as the chief minister following a stunning post-poll realignment.In Video: Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray meets PM Narendra Modi in Delhi",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74250447,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-315774,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/maharashtra-will-go-ahead-with-caa-npr-says-uddhav-thackeray-after-meeting-pm-modi/articleshow/74250443.cms
35,['22/02/2020'],Shaheen Bagh: Protesters OK with opposite carriageway opening,"This story is from February 22, 2020

Supreme Court mediators Sanjay Hegde and Sadhna Ramchandran hold 3rd round of talks with Shaheen Bagh protesto... Read More

NEW DELHI: The possibility of opening one of the carriageways, which is not occupied by the protesters at Shaheen Bagh , brightened on Friday with the police assuring them adequate security. Though the protesters remained adamant that they won’t move from their present spot, they also insisted that it was the police which had closed the carriageway on the other side, thereby giving the SC-appointed mediators a window of opportunity. This carriageway brings the traffic from the Noida side into Delhi.

During the interaction which started late in the evening, the mediators — Sadhana Ramachandran and Sanjay Hegde — took serious note of the fact that the road from Noida had been briefly opened on Friday morning. Following their dialogue with the protesters, they visited the spot and subsequently suggested that the route could be opened. The two senior lawyers observed that a lot of what the protesters had said was true. “They opened the road and shut it. Whether it was Delhi Police or Noida Police , we don't know, but it was indeed a sign that it can be opened. We will have to tell SC… Whoever did it is answerable to SC,” they said.

“Who has occupied the other carriageway? We need clarity from you,” the mediators asked the crowd. The unanimous response was: “Police has occupied.” Ramachandran probed further: “Are you saying that you are sitting here and the other side has been shut by Delhi Police and you are okay with it as you feel you’re safe that way?” A protester responded, “Delhi Police has shut the other side.”

Hegde then asked if there was anyone from the police on the spot. The SHO of Shaheen Bagh police station stepped forward and gave the assurance that the police were willing to provide the protesters adequate security if they agreed to cooperate. He said they had made the requeste earlier too and proposed to put a barricade on the divider. “Hamari taraf se jo security hai woh poori denge (We will provide adequate security),” he said.

The crowd was unanimous in asking the police to give in writing that they would keep their promise, and in case of any untoward incident, the entire heirarchy — from the commissioner to the beat constable — should face the consequences. Some doubts remained. “It was Delhi Police that beat up Jamia students and one of them lost an eye. Female students were marched out of the campus with their hands raised in the air even as they were being abused verbally,” said a woman, expressing her apprehensions.

Hegde had earlier reminded the gathering that it was Mahashivratri on Friday and his mother used to say that on this day even somebody’s curse turned into a blessing. He tried to convince the protesters that it was essential for them to realise that there was hope and their right to protest was not being taken away in case they decided to clear the road.

JOHANNESBURG: Australia's Ashton Agar said he had felt horrible going into Friday's Twenty20 international against South Africa at The Wanderers but the left-arm spinner came out of the game with the greatest moment of his cricketing life.

Agar took a hat-trick in career-best figures of 5-24 as Australia romped to a 107-run win, inflicting the heaviest ever defeat on hapless South Africa in the shortest format of the game as the hosts were bowled out for their lowest score of 89.

Seamers Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins did some early damage as the home side chased a victory target of 197, before Agar's hat-trick in his first over all but sealed the win for the tourists.

""It was really exciting and obviously the highlight of my cricketing life,"" man of the match Agar said at the post-match presentation.

""But my job is made a lot easier when you have Mitch Starc, Pat Cummins, Richo ( Kane Richardson ) and Zamps ( Adam Zampa ) doing the job before me.""

Agar's previous best figures in Twenty20 Internationals were 3-27, but he matched that wicket haul inside his first six deliveries on Friday.

""It's funny, I was feeling horrible leading into the game,"" he said. ""But I just had that belief at the top of the mark to let it all out and give it my best go.

""Obviously when the wicket turns, you get a bit of assistance and your job is made a bit easier.""

Agar had Faf du Plessis caught on the boundary before he trapped Andile Phehlukwayo leg before wicket.

Captain Aaron Finch then took a superb catch at slip to dismiss Dale Steyn for Agar to become the 12th player to bag a hat-trick in Twenty20 Internationals.

""It was an unbelievable catch, I think he (Finch) enjoyed it as well. He was halfway around the ground when I caught up with him,"" Agar said.

Remarkably, the spinner almost bagged a second hat-trick in the innings when he removed debutant Pite van Biljon and Lungi Ngidi in successive balls, and then narrowly missed the stumps of new batsman Tabraiz Shamsi.

""There was about a 10% chance of me catching that,"" Finch said of the Steyn dismissal. ""He (Agar) bowled beautifully today and deserved it.""

The teams move to Port Elizabeth for the second match in the three-game series on Sunday, before the finale in Cape Town on Wednesday.

NAGPUR: For the second day in succession, city masters Raunak Sadhwani and Divya Deshmukh failed to place their pawns and pieces on right square at the Aeroflot Open chess tournament in Moscow, Russia, on Friday.

While Raunak went down fighting against a much higher ranked and 10th seeded Uzbekistan Grandmaster Abdusattorov Nodirbek, WIM Divya managed to earn a draw against lower rated Adocchio Giampiero of Germany.

In the Open B category, Women International Master (WIM) Divya defended well with her black pieces to carve out a draw after playing a bad move in the opening. After becoming a pawn down in the early stage of her second round contest against unseeded Giampiero, the BVM, Civil Lines, student managed to bring parity in the middle game. Replying to the Queen Pawn opening of her German opponent, the 2322 Elo and 66th seed Divya opted for the Nimzo Indian defence and after playing a wrong move managed to sign the peace treaty in 43 moves.

""I was losing today's game. After choosing the Nimzo Indian defense, where the opening was different I made a blunder in the beginning itself. Later I kept on playing and replying as per the lines and somehow managed to draw the game,"" Divya told TOI.

In the third round, Divya will face unseeded Russian Spichkin Alexander.

While Divya opened her account in the points tally, 14-year-old city's lone GM Raunak Sadhwani lost his second game in a row to a much higher seed in the Open A category. On the 38th board, 61st seed Raunak failed to defend with his black pieces to go down against Nodirbek. On the King Pawn opening of Nodirbek, the Centre Point School, Katol Road, student opted for the Petrov's defence.

Having failed to judge the attacking play of the 2644 Elo Nodirbek, the city master became a pawn down in the 13th move. Thereafter, Raunak tried many tricks but the Uzbekistan GM launched a double pawn attack. By the 38th move, Raunak lost two of his pawns and Nodirbek took firm grip on the game. Despite trying to fight with the reminder of his pawns, Raunak found no gateway into his rivals' defense and finally resigned in the 50th move.

In the third round, Raunak will look to garner full point with his white pieces when he meets Indian IM Rahul Srivatshav on the 47th board.

Venezuela's Yulimar Rojas broke the 16-year-old world indoor triple jump record when she bounded 15.43 metres at the Madrid World Athletics Indoor Tour meeting on Friday.

The twice world champion set the mark with her final jump, adding seven centimetres to Russian Tatyana Lebedeva 's record which had stood since 2004.

The mark is the second longest women's triple jump ever, exceeded only by Inessa Kravets 's outdoor world record of 15.50m which the Ukrainian set in 1995.

Rojas, the Olympic silver medallist, broke her South American indoor record with a leap of 15.29m on her fourth attempt and then, after her third foul of the competition, eclipsed the long-standing world record.

WASHINGTON: Ahead of his first visit to India, US President Donald Trump gave mixed signals about prospects for a trade deal between the two countries, saying India had been hitting the US “very hard” with high tariffs for many years and he would “talk business” with Prime Minister Narendra Modi to promote American products.President Trump and First Lady Melania are scheduled to travel to Ahmedabad, Agra and New Delhi on February 24-25. They are expected to be accompanied by their daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner . More than 100 journalists are expected to accompany Air Force One on a separate charter to chronicle the trip.“I’m going to India next week and we’re talking trade. They’ve been hitting us very hard for many, many years,” Trump said at a ‘Keep America Great’ rally in Colorado on Thursday.He told thousands of his supporters that he “really likes” Prime Minister Modi and they would be talking business. “We’ve got to talk a little... We’ve got to talk a little business. It’s been hitting us hard. They give us tariffs, one the highest in the world is India,” he said.Downplaying the expectation of a trade deal with India during his visit, Trump said the two countries could make a “tremendous” trade deal, but indicated that the talks on this might slow down if he did not get a good deal. “We’re going to India, and we may make a tremendous deal there,” he said in his commencement address at the Hope for Prisoners Graduation Ceremony in Las Vegas.“Maybe we’ll slow down. We’ll do it after the election. I think that could happen too. So, we’ll see what happens,” he said, adding, “But we’re only making deals if they’re good deals because we’re putting America first. Whether people like it or not, we’re putting America first,” he added.Trump, who is seeking re-election in the November presidential polls, indicated that his visit will result in more products “proudly stamped with the beautiful phrase Made in the USA”.At the Colorado campaign rally, the US President once again spoke about the grand welcome he is expecting in India — this time inflating to 10 million the number of people he thinks will turn up to greet him in Ahmedabad on the route from the airport to the newly-built Motera Stadium.“I hear they’re going to have 10 million people. They say anywhere from six to 10 million people are going to be showing up along the route to one of the largest stadiums in the world, the largest cricket stadium in the world,” Trump said.“Prime Minister Modi said, ‘we will have 10 million people to greet you’. Here’s my problem, we have a packed house. We have a lot of people, thousands of people who couldn't get in. It’s going to look like peanuts from now on. I’ll never be satisfied with the crowd. If we have 10 million people in India, how can I be satisfied when we fill up like a 60,000-seat stadium?” he said.It is unclear how Trump expects 10 million people when the population of Ahmedabad is 5.6 million people. One explanation is he may have misconstrued Modi’s mention of lakh as a million.Another widely proffered explanation is the Dunning Kruger Effect, which in psychology is a cognitive bias in which people assess their cognitive ability as greater than it is. In the past, the US President has insisted that crowds at his inauguration were bigger than at Obama’s, which was clearly not true. He has also complained of massive fake voting in the 2016 election to explain his getting 2.87 million fewer popular votes than Hillary Clinton , although there is no basis for the charge.On Thursday, Trump was at it again, inflating India’s population to 1.5 billion — about 10% more than current estimates — while insisting that he topped Modi in Facebook following.“I’m going to India next week, and we’re talking about — you know, they have 1.5 billion people. And Prime Minister Modi is number two on Facebook, number two. Think of that. You know who number one is? Trump. You believe that? Number one. I just found out,” Trump said in Las Vegas.“The head of Facebook Mr Zuckerberg came in three weeks ago. He said, ‘Congratulations.’ I said, ‘On what?’ He said, ‘You’re number one on Facebook.’ I said, ‘That's cool.’ Number one on Twitter too,” the US President said, adding, “That’s because it’s true. And if I wasn’t, I could never say it because it would be breaking news that Trump told a fib. No, number one.”Trump also claimed that he had congratulated Modi about it, saying he told him, “You know, you have 1.5 billion people. I have 350 million. You have an advantage.”In Video: Look forward to make tremendous trade deal with India: Donald Trump",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74250537,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-257366,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/indias-hitting-us-very-hard-will-talk-biz-with-modi-donald-trump/articleshow/74250527.cms

SONBHADRA: Geological Survey of India (GSI) on Saturday denied the claim made by a district mining official about the existence of gold deposits of around 3,000 tonne in Sonbhadra district of Uttar Pradesh.""The total gold which can be extracted from the total resource of 52806.25 tonnes of ore is approximately 160 kg and not 3,350 tonnes,"" the GSI said.Earlier, a mining official claimed that Sonbhadra, east UP’s mineral-rich district, could be sitting on a gold reserve of approximately 3,000 tonnes — five times India’s current reserve of 618.2 tonnes — worth over Rs 12 lakh crore.UP’s geology and mining department sent a team to the district for mapping and geo-tagging of the area. There are two big blocks with gold in Sonbhadra. The total estimated reserve of gold in Sona Pahadi block is 2,943 tonnes. The GSI has estimated that another 646 kg gold reserve could be found at Hardi block, an official note issued by state mining director Roshan Jacob had said.According to the World Gold Council’s (WGC) data, the US has the largest gold holding with 8,133.5 tonnes, followed by Germany with 3,366 tonnes and IMF with 2,814 tonnes. Italy (2,451.8 tonnes) and France (2,436 tonnes) make the top five.“After the completion of mapping, we will submit the report to the directorate for further action, like auctioning of gold blocks for mining,” Sonbhadra’s district mining officer KK Rai, who is a member of the team doing the mapping job, told TOI on Friday.It was earlier reported that the GSI team had also found the presence of ores of other metal and minerals, including Andalusite, aluminium nesosilicate mineral (95.02 tonnes) in Pulawar and Salaidih blocks, Potash (9.46 tonnes) in Patwadh block and iron (14.97 tonnes) in Bharhari block.

Representational photo.

NEW DELHI: Pharma companies often refute allegations that doctors and chemists are sought to be “influenced” to push specific medicine brands, costly alternatives and even needless prescriptions but the evidence is out that this does not prevent them from claiming tax deductions on such expenses.

Around 8,667 pharmaceutical companies claimed income tax deduction under “sales promotion expenses” and “gifts” during 2019-20, the income tax department informed the Madras high court in response to a suo motu case taken up by the court against such unethical marketing practices.

“Though details have been given, it is evident from details furnished by the Income Tax department that about 1,410 companies during the assessment year 2019-20 (ITR-3), 1,915 companies during the assessment year 2019-20 (ITR-5) and 5,342 companies during assessment year 2019-20 (ITR-6) alone claimed deduction under “Sales Promotion Expenses” and ‘Gift’,” a two-judge bench comprising of N Kirubakaran and P Velmurugan said in a February 17 order.

Interestingly, the irregularities initially came to light in a tax dispute case between a pharmaceutical company and the I-T department. While the company wanted to pass the overcharged amounts as mere excess amount collected from consumers and dubbed them as refunds to the drug regulator, the tax authorities said overcharging is a violation of law and the amount paid to the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) was actually a penalty.

The judges said, “It is shocking and surprising to note that the company claimed deduction from Income Tax for the amount spent towards sale promotion expenses as well as for licences & taxes.”

Information provided by the I-T department, prompted the court to take up the issue of unethical marketing practices by pharma companies. In an earlier order, the court said “promotional expenses including payment to the doctors” is “nothing but bribing”.

“It is clear that even though it is prohibited under law, the pharmaceutical companies are still promoting their drugs by providing gifts, travel facilities, hospitality, cash or monetary grant to the doctors. It is also proved that drugs are overpriced illegally by the companies,” one of the orders said pulling up companies for such practices.

The HC directed the I-T department to submit details about such claims made by companies, names of doctors as well as penalties paid by companies for drug overpricing.

BHOPAL: A mentally disturbed man sat in a doctor ’s chair on finding it unoccupied at a hospital in MP’s Chhattarpur on Wednesday, ‘checked’ patients and even scribbled outlandish prescriptions for half an hour before he was caught out. Questioned by the civil surgeon, he advised him to “see a psychiatrist” instead, and even wrote down a prescription.

“An inquiry has been ordered,” minister in charge of Chhattarpur, Brajendra Singh Rathore , said. He hasn’t been identified yet.

The impostor on Wednesday afternoon saw a chamber of mental health programme vacant was at the Civil Hospital and took the doctor’s chair. Soon enough, patients trickled in and ‘doctor sahib’ began checking them. One patient, Bhalloo Yadav, said: “He examined me exactly like a doctor and scribbled down some medicines”.

At least half a dozen patients consulted the doctor and got prescriptions. Civil surgeon Dr Tripathi said, “No one knows his name. After he was removed from the chamber, I spoke to him and realised that the man needed psychiatric help. He, in turn, asked me to see a psychiatrist. He even prescribed some medicines for me before leaving.”

KOTTAYAM: One more nun has come out against rape-accused bishop Franco Mulakkal , saying he had sexually exploited her. The fresh allegation was made in a statement the 35-year-old nun had made to the police, as a witness in the rape case in which Mulakkal, former bishop of Chandigarh, was arrested on September 21, 2018. He was granted bail on October 16, 2018.

A part of the nun’s statement became public on Friday, a day before Mulakkal was to appear before the additional district court-1 judge G Gopakumar for the preliminary hearing on the objection filed by the prosecution on the discharge petition filed by Mulakkal.

Police said a case had not been registered based on the witness statement as the nun did not want it and she wished to continue in the church. Her statement was recorded on June 28, 2018, a day after another nun of Mulakkal’s diocese lodged a police complaint, saying Mulakkal had sexually abused her for two years from 2014.

PM Narendra Modi during a meeting in New Delhi on Friday to hand over a ‘chadar’ that would be offered at the ... Read More

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked members of the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra Trust to ensure that the temple was built peacefully “without any bitterness” in society. “Work should be accomplished at the earliest without hurting anyone,” he told them during a brief interaction at his residence on Thursday.

“We had a courtesy meeting with the PM on his invitation as he wanted to meet senior trust members Nritya Gopal Das and K Parasaran. He suggested that social harmony should be maintained and temple construction should be executed in a way that no one feels hurt,” trust general secretary Champat Rai, who was among the four office-bearers to call on the PM, said. Gopal Das Giri was the other member to meet the PM.

Chairman of the trust Nritya Gopal Das urged the PM to visit Ayodhya which Modi accepted.

Rai said the temple will be built on the model proposed by VHP in the first phase and expansion will be considered only after the first phase is over.

It is learnt that the proposed plan will be altered slightly to increase the temple’s height, and another floor could probably be added to the existing design. “The temple will be built on the base of the VHP map. There can be changes to its proposed shape and scale,” Swami Govind Dev Giri, another member of the trust, said.

Another member of the trust said, “We have received suggestions to make changes to the old design in order to give an ever grander form to the temple. Now, we are brainstorming on building a three-storey structure instead of the two storiys proposed earlier, as well as adding a pavilion and detailing to the 35-feet high 'shikhar'.” The height of the proposed temple could be increased to 160 feet from 125 feet decided earlier by the VHP.

In 1987, craftsman Chandrakant Sompura had prepared a model of the proposed temple based on the VHP's design after being asked by VHP international president Ashok Singhal .

The temple will be built in Lord Vishnu's favourite octagonal shape and its structure will be made with stone without the use of iron.

“There was consensus among the trust members in its first meeting on Wednesday that temple construction should be completed in next two years. Construction of the existing model will be ideal to follow as carvings of major parts of the structure have already been done,” Rai said.

“The date to start construction will be decided in the next meeting in Ayodhya next month,” he said, adding that the Ayodhya administration had been urged to shift the Ram Lalla idol to a permanent structure from the makeshift tent.

All key dates, including start of construction, will be decided as per the Hindu Panchang, which was followed to fix the first meeting of the trust which was on was Vijaya Ekadasi, an auspicious day for Hindus. “Moreover, the day coincided with the birth anniversary of second RSS pramukh M S Golwalkar,” Rai said.

48,['22/02/2020'],"In a first, govt rolls out customised crop insurance policy","This story is from February 22, 2020

NEW DELHI: For the first time, the Centre has come out with customised crop insurance (single peril insurance cover) for states by factoring in one specific natural disaster. Such insurance will first be made available to farmers in Punjab, parts of Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh where farmers are not generally hit by droughts or floods but have to suffer due to hailstorms.

This model, having low premium due to risk coverage against single extreme weather event, will be available to other states or Union Territories (UTs) as well under the existing Prime Minister Crop Insurance Scheme (PMFBY).

“States/UT can offer specific single peril risk/insurance cover under PMFBY even with or without opting for base cover,” said Ashish Kumar Bhutani CEO (PMFBY) and joint secretary in agriculture ministry on Friday.

Bhutani told TOI that the move, part of the revamped PMFBY as decided by the Union Cabinet , would help farmers in states like Punjab, Haryana and western UP where farmers generally do not face other risks such as drought due to assured irrigation facilities. “Farmers in such states have generally been victims of hailstorms. They may now voluntarily like to go for this low premium customised cover,” he said.

This model of providing cover against single extreme weather event may increase the footprints of the crop insurance scheme. Other states may opt for it by analysing impact of region-specific disaster without going for base cover which attracts higher premium.

The Centre will in due course provide more flexibility to states/UTs as a new separate scheme is in the pipeline, exclusively for farmers in 151 highly water stressed districts in Maharashtra, Rajasthan , Uttar Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha and Jharkhand .

“Since the PMFBY is now made voluntary for all farmers, a separate scheme will provide effective risk mitigation tools in 151 districts. The existing scheme will continue till we come out with alternative risk mitigation programme,” said Bhutani.

Under the revamped scheme, the Centre has not slashed its share of premium by 25% or 30% as interpreted by certain political parties and farm activists. The Centre has simply put ceiling of 30% and 25% on premium against sum insured for its subsidy for unirrigated and irrigated districts, respectively.

The move will not increase any burden on farmers as they will continue to pay premium rate of 2% for kharif (summer sown) crops, 1.5% for rabi (winter sown) crops and 5% for horticulture and commercial crops. The remaining premium amount, subject to the ceiling, will continued to be shared equally as subsidy between Centre and respective states.

States will have to pitch in with more only if premium breaches the 30% or 25% ceiling. New provisions will lead the states to work on mitigating risk factors so that the crops do not attract high premium. It will also prevent arbitrarily jacking up of premium of certain crops.

Officials believe that premium of certain crops in selected districts are currently high due to wrong choice of crops. “You should not go for paddy or other water guzzling crops in water stressed districts. This will jack up premium. The move of putting ceiling on premium will also help in crop diversification and rationalisation in such districts in due course,” said an official.

The revamped scheme will now make inroads to north-eastern states as it has increased the central share in premium subsidy to 90% for such states from the existing sharing pattern of 50:50. Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram and Nagaland had not participated in the PMFBY as they could not even afford to provide premium subsidy under 50:50 share

MUMBAI: The administration of the union territory (UT) of Jammu & Kashmir (J&K), formed after the reading down of Article 370 last year, signed MoUs worth over Rs 2,100 crore with India Inc at an investment summit in Mumbai on Friday.

The UT has sought Rs 50,000 crore in investment from business houses in 14 sectors. According to the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), 55% of it has been sought in tourism & hospitality, renewable energy, agri-horticulture and food processing, and the remaining in textiles, manufacturing, healthcare, entertainment and education.

To facilitate investment, the policy offers land parcels of 250-300 acres in each district of the UT. It also proposes to revive cinema halls shut for decades, and create multiplexes and other entertainment zones.

“We want to maximize industrial growth and employment opportunities in J&K. For this we are engaging in six city roadshows,” J&K’s principal secretary (planning, development and monitoring) Rohit Kansal said. “The (remaining) roadshows will (be in) Hyderabad, Chennai and Ahmedabad.” Kansal said the UT has signed around Rs 2,000 crore worth of non-binding MoUs in Kolkata, Rs 850 crore in Bengaluru and over Rs 2,100 crore in Mumbai.

The UT’s lieutenant governor, Girish Chandra Murmu, led its delegation while prominent corporates present included the Taj Hotels, Carnival Cinemas, Volkswagen, Hinduja Group, Ambuja Cements, Club Mahindra, and Kotak Mahindra Bank. The MoUs signed in Mumbai include a Rs 1,000 crore proposal to set up business townships and similar infrastructure, a Rs 300-crore plan for poultry, agriculture and food processing, and a Rs 150-crore financial services proposal. The UT will soon hold a global investors’ summit in Srinagar and Jammu, officials said.

Kewal Sharma, advisor to the lieutenant governor, said, “We are in the final stages of designing an ambitious industrial promotion policy, which will have elements like SGST reimbursement in full, an attractive land policy, stamp duty exemption, support for green industrialization, along with other benefits.”

MUMBAI: Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari has refused to sign an ordinance reversing the erstwhile BJP-led government’s decision of electing a village sarpanch directly from among the people.

The Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi government has decided that a sarpanch will be elected by members of a gram panchayat who belong to political parties. The state cabinet on January 29 reversed the decision taken by the Devendra Fadnavis government of having a sarpanch directly elected. But the governor has asked the MVA government to table a bill reversing the decision in the budget session of the legislature scheduled to begin on Monday.

According to the recent cabinet decision, a village sarpanch will be elected by the elected representatives in the village panchayat, and they alone can vote in the election. Thackeray has also reversed another decision about direct elections in local self-government bodies like municipal councils.

When CM Uddhav Thackeray was asked if there was a dispute between the BJP-appointed governor and the MVA government, he had said, “There is no dispute between the governor and the government. There are a few things which can go ahead and a few cannot, ahead of the state assembly session.”

A senior official said that the state government has now decided to table a fresh bill on the cabinet decision instead of issuing an ordinance.

NEW DELHI: Unseasonal rains in Punjab , Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh have, so far, not affected much the standing rabi (winter sown) crops in most parts of these states, but the forecast of rains and thunderstorms in next 24 hours may spell doom for farmers if these weather events intensify during the period.

Ground reports from parts of Punjab and Haryana show that high wind speed and rains flattened standing wheat crop in areas surrounding Panipat district in Haryana and Ludhiana district in Punjab.

Officials in agriculture ministry, however, said the situation was not as bad in other parts of these states. “Light rains at this stage will, in fact, benefit crops like wheat and mustard. Farmers should worry only if rains intensify in next 24 fours or continue for longer period,” said an official.

The private weather forecast agency, Skymet Weather, on Friday predicted possibility of rains and thundershowers in parts of Punjab, Haryana, west and central Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand during the next 24 hours. It said the rainfall activities will then shift towards east Uttar Pradesh.

54,['22/02/2020'],Change in law to try minors as adults for 'heinous' crimes?,"This story is from February 22, 2020

Representational photo.

NEW DELHI: A group of ministers chaired by home minister Amit Shah on Friday discussed changes in the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act to re-categorise “heinous” and “serious” crimes for determining if a juvenile offender must be tried on par with an “adult”.

The meeting — attended by law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad , women & child development minister Smriti Irani , external affairs minister S Jaishankar , food processing minister Harsimrat Singh Badal and health minister Harsh Vardhan — comes in the backdrop of the Supreme Court’s direction to the Centre in a judgement delivered in January 2020, to urgently fill gaps in the Juvenile Justice Act 2015. The court asked the Centre to pass a legislation or an ordinance to determine the category of crimes which are not heinous like rape, murder and terrorism, but still punishable for seven years or more. The suggestion was to treat such crimes as “serious”, allowing the offender to be tried as a juvenile.

The JJ Act of 2015 defines ‘heinous offences’ as ones for which the minimum punishment under any law is imprisonment for seven years or more; petty offences for which imprisonment extends to three years; and “serious offences” which carry a jail term of 3-7 years.

Sources indicated that while the ministerial group noted with alarm the rising cases of involvement of juveniles in heinous crimes, the possibility of segregating “heinous” crimes that are pre-meditated and those committed in a fit of anger or unintentionally, was discussed. It was felt that the “bent of mind or mental faculty” of the juvenile must be assessed by experts before a call is taken on trying him as an adult.

Given the pendency in the courts and preoccupation of judges with more important matters, the GoM considered the proposal to let district magistrate or additional district magistrate be on the Juvenile Justice Board. Similarly, adoption committee could be headed by district magistrate and not a judge. The GoM also favoured robust scrutiny of agencies handling adoptions.

A Supreme Court bench of Justice Deepak Gupta and Aniruddha Bose had, in an order delivered last month in a hit-and-run case involving a minor four days short of adulthood, which resulted in the victim’s death, temporarily redefined ‘serious’ and ‘heinous’ offences under the JJ Act.

55,['22/02/2020'],Kolkata: Police campaign to teach bikers about truck driver's blind spots,"This story is from February 22, 2020

A photograph published by the cops marking the different blind spots around a large vehicle

KOLKATA: The city police has devised a novel way to sensitize bikers and truckers about the perils of blind spots, asking errant bikers to sit in the driver’s seat of a trailer to learn about the zones around the large vehicle that the driver can’t see even with rear- and side-view mirrors.

On Friday, officers of Southwest Traffic Guard began stopping errant bikers on Hyde Road in Kidderpore — which accounts for a significant number of road accidents involving bikes — and, instead of penalizing them, the officers asked them to get off their two-wheelers and sit at the wheel of a trailer to check out the areas that were in the driver’s blind spot.

Blind spots are locations around a moving vehicle that are not captured in the vehicle’s side- or rear-view mirrors. “If a driver cannot see a vehicle next to him, s/he is more likely to crash into the other vehicle when switching lanes. Especially for drivers of large vehicles, like buses and trucks, it gets impossible when a biker tries to overtake from either side of the vehicle, straying very close. The same is applicable even when a pedestrian tries to run across the road in front of a bus. In these cases, the driver is often not at complete fault and the pedestrian or biker often has no clue about the blind spot,” said a senior officer of the traffic guard.

All vehicles have blind spots, and depending on the kind of vehicle, the location of the blind spot can vary. Mostly, there is a blind spot over the right or left shoulder of the driver. It is commonly an area that is blocked by a side-mirror, a pillar connecting the side windshield, or items in the car. Blind spots may also be caused by the height of the driver, both taller and shorter drivers may have trouble seeing certain areas around the car while at the wheel.

“I never knew the difficulties that drivers of large vehicles face and had no idea that the areas over the left and right shoulders go unnoticed. The cops made me sit at the driver’s seat and informed me about the precautions a biker needs to take while overtaking large vehicles,” said Monojit Ghoshal, a medical representative who was stopped by the cops on Friday.

GSCW orders suo motu enquiry

SURAT/GANDHINAGAR: A day after TOI reported about probationary women clerks for Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) posts being stripped and subjected to ‘mandatory’ pregnancy tests , the state government officials categorically stated that there are no provisions for any such medical examination for females.Kamal Dayani, principal secretary, general administration department (GAD), personnel, told TOI: ""It’s a very shocking and an unfortunate incident. The general recruitment rules mandate only basic medical tests for all candidates. These don’t include gynecology or pregnancy tests.''At least 100 women were allegedly made to stand naked in groups of 10 for physical examination and some even alleged they were subjected to humiliating finger test for pregnancy check on Thursday. The tests were conducted at Surat Municipal Institute of Medical Education and Research (SMIMER).""Privacy during basic medical test is also a must. One cannot force any woman candidate to undertake the tests in a group,'' Dayani asserted.On Thursday, Ashwin Vachhani, head of the gynaecology department, SMIMER, had said physical examination of women was mandatory as per the guidelines to ascertain if they had any specific illness. His cell phone was switched off when TOI tried contacting him on Friday.Dr Vandana Desai, superintendent, SMIMER, said, ""There are no specific government guidelines about fitness test, but majority of the doctors follow the protocol that is commonly practised in all the government medical colleges. In this case, the women must have been tested as per the requirements to check their complete fitness.”Meanwhile, Surat municipal commissioner Banchhanidhi Pani constituted a three-member committee of women to probe the incident and submit a report within 15 days. The members of the committee are Kalpana Desai, former dean of SMIMER, Gayatri Jariwala, assistant municipal commissioner, SMC and Trupti Kalathariya, executive engineer.“Action will be taken based on the committee’s report,” Pani told TOI.The Surat Municipal Corporation Employees Union (SMCEU) had raised the issue with the municipal commissioner and health department after women found the methodology of the tests extremely humiliating. The tests have been going on for the last fortnight.The issue even got a political hue with local Congress workers in Surat barging into SMIMER and sitting on a dharna, demanding that the enquiry report should be out in three days and not fortnight.Gujarat State Commission for Women (GSCW) ordered a suo motu enquiry while National Commission for Women (NCW) condemned the incident as ‘shameful.’ GSCW chairperson Leela Ankoliya said that the commission has asked SMC to submit an inquiry report as early as possible.""This should not happen to any woman, and if these type of tests are done, it is indeed shocking. Courts have also prohibited such tests. We will take further action after examining the SMC report,"" Ankoliya told TOI.""Given our advancement in technology, there are alternate and respectable methods to medically examine women,"" Ankoliya added.",surat,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74251141,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-172375,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/surat-strip-shame-why-pregnancy-tests-when-no-such-rules-exist/articleshow/74250145.cms

RAJKOT: The Ghogha-Dahej Ro-Ro ferry service is likely to resume from February 24, nearly five months after it was suspended due to siltation at Dahej port.

The announcement in this regard was made by the ferry operator Indigo Seaways Pvt Ltd on Friday. Though the dredging work has not begun and the situation remains unchanged as it was five months back, the operator has decided to resume operations after intervention of union shipping ministry.

The Indigo Seaways Pvt Ltd in a statement said, “Presently, the ferry will operate in tide and during day time only. It will make one round trip each day.” The statement also said that the government has assured them that dredging service will provide sufficient draft for ferry for two round trip a day.

The ferry service was suspended in September last year because there was lack of depth at Dahej port and it was posing the threat of accident for the ferry service to operate.

According to sources, the dredging work was not found to be satisfactory for the ferry service to resume. The Bhavnagar Chamber of Commerce and Industry and industrial Association of Alang shipbreaking represented to the minister of shipping Mansukh Mandavia to resume the service. They argued that the service would benefit their business.

Even after the intervention of the Central government the ferry will only make one trip a day instead of two trips, as was the case before the suspension of service last year.

The ferry operator also said that if they do not get depth the required draft at Dahej, they might suspend the service again.

SURAT: An eight-year-old boy had a miraculous escape after he accidentally fell into a 30-foot-deep manhole at Pandal Mohalla in Nanavat locality of the city on Friday afternoon.

Mohammed Abdul Ghani (8), a resident of Pandal Mohalla in Nanavat, was playing with other kids on Friday afternoon when he accidentally fell into the manhole. The other children sounded an alert by shouting for help. The residents rushed to the spot and tried to rescue the boy, but to no avail.

Then a team from fire and emergency service of the Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) immediately rushed to the spot after getting a rescue call from a resident. It was within 15 minutes that the fire fighters were able to rescue the boy.

Fire officer Dipak Makhijani told TOI: “Luckily the manhole pit was non-operational and it was empty. The stone layer covering the manhole was broken when the victim had stepped on it. A man was already inside the manhole to rescue the boy. However, we used the rescue ropes to pull both the man and the child from inside.”

Makhijani added, “When we took the boy from the manhole he was unconscious. He had received minor injuries. He was immediately rushed to the hospital for treatment where his condition has now returned to normalcy.”

Agra: At least twice on its journey, the Bhubaneswar-bound Odisha Sampark Kranti Express train split into two, sending passengers into a tizzy on Friday.

After leaving Anand Vihar Terminal at around 7 am, the train decoupled near Sahibabad junction and was stationed there for nearly one hour till the train operation department of Northern Railway coupled the coaches. According to railway officials, the train’s pantry car’s coupling was damaged due to poor maintenance.

However, as soon the train reached near Hathras at around 11 am, the train split into two for the second time. Since the train has no stoppage at Hathras, the train was cruising at nearly 70 kmph and had travelled 150 km.

Later, the railway mechanics attached the two parts of the train together, and drove it slowly for 48 km to Tundla junction, where a team of engineers decided to remove the defected pantry coach and attached the rest of the train for further journey.

Chief public relation officer of NCR zone Ajit Kumar Singh said, “The train belongs to Khurda road division of East Coast Railway zone. After removing the affected coach which was causing the decoupling, the train was cleared for further journey. The train departed Tundla junction at 2:15 pm with a delay of nearly two hours.”

Rajat Kumar, a passenger traveling to Tata Nagar, said, “There was sense of panic among passengers. At least on thrice occasions, the train decoupled in its journey. It was a stressful journey.”

63,['22/02/2020'],Heritage walks to shape city’s tourism,"This story is from February 22, 2020

Kolhapur: The rise in the number of heritage walks and guided tours in and around the city is ensuring that Kolhapur is mapped as one of the important tourist destinations with historical importance in the state, though the government is doing little to tap and promote the city’s tourism potential.

Since the last few months, around two to three heritage walks are being taken out per week. The guided tours to heritage and cultural sites in and outside the city have opened up new avenues for the local tourism sector.

City-based Indologist and heritage expert Indraneel Bankapure said, “Previously, tourists used to see the city and move out in a day. They hardly stayed here for a night. With the heritage walks and the guided tours taking a formal shape, that trend is going to change soon.”

“Currently, we have very few experts who organise heritage walks. Like many other historical cities, Kolhapur too has a lot of potential to develop as a tourist destination with the help of guided tours and without help from the government. The demand for heritage walks is mostly from senior citizens, students and associations, besides foreign tourists. We are trying to give the ‘tours with guides’ concept a shape by forming a body and regulating tours so that visitors are not exploited,” he said.

Shivaji University, Kolhapur runs a course in tours and travels with a intake of 30 students. However, most of the students who have passed out are absorbed by the travel companies. that too for other cities. Bankapure said, “Many would like to work as tour guides in their own city. We are creating a demand by asking visitors to write blogs, makes videos and trend topics with proper hashtags on digital platform. Many sectors, especially the hotel industry, is keen on developing local talent.”

Increase in the tourist turnout benefits many sectors—hotels, local artisans, lodging, transporters and small vendors. The idea of formalising guided tours is basically to increase the turnout.

President of Hoteliers association Ujjwal Nageshkar said, “Fortunately, we have visitor-friendly people in the city. We have found that autorickshaw drivers, who pick visitors from the bus stand or the railway station, form the heart of the tourism industry. They are the ones who can make visitors comfortable, impart knowledge about the local sites and also the local delicacies to try. Keeping their role in mind, we are going to start grooming some of the learned autorickshaw drivers soon. They will be a part of the whole tourism network.”

A grab of the viral video

Rajkot: A video of a primary school of Upleta town of Rajkot district has gone viral in which girl students of Class IV and V are expressing their angst at being subjected to castiests slurs and discrimination inside the classrooms.

The shocking contents of the video shows the girls, studying in Rajmoti Primary School run by the Upleta primary education committee, complaining to a local Dalit leader Bala Dumiyani on Friday morning, about their daily ordeal. The girls are heard naming three teachers — Jignesh, Rasila and Laxmi. They said that in any invitation for lunch (for religious purposes where young girls are invited), the teachers would pointedly remark that the invitations exclude the ‘Harijan’ girls. They further said that if any girl from the lower caste would dare to defy the trios diktat, she would be thrashed with sticks and also pinched on the legs.

One girl claims that while as a teacher Laxmi teaches nicely, but she often slaps the girls. “Laxmi teacher slaps me often. Once, when my father had come to the school, I went to inform her. But before I could say anything, the teacher slapped me first before asking me why I had come to her,” she said.

The girl further said that even for petty errors while playing a game, the teacher would resort to harsh punishments and even hurl abusive words at these girls.

“They keep asking us if we eat non-veg food? Do we have a tradition in our ‘Harijan’ caste to welcome guests at our homes with meat? Do we have to sacrifice goat while offering Naived (religious ritual)?” the girl was heard complaining agitatedly.

Talkin g to TOI, Bala Dumiyani confirmed the girls’ outburst before him on Friday. “These girls belong to our family. But Friday is a holiday. I will go to the school when it reopens and ask the teachers and principals why they have resorted to such discrimination against lower-caste students,” he said.

Same were the views of Gawlipalasiya sarpanch Ganesh Patidar, who said that whenever the panchayat tried to strictly levy water bill, opposition party members flare up the issue because of which no sarpanch wants to take the risk of recovering the money from villagers.

Panaji: The state cabinet on Friday approved revised expenditure sanction of Rs 17.8 crore for the construction of a commercial complex for the Cuncolim Municipal Council (CMC).

The project involves construction of a commercial complex building with modern facilities for the municipality. It includes basement, ground plus two structures with parking provision in the basement.

The project cost revision was warranted, an official said.

“It was decided to reassess the foundation design as well as the structural design owing to the project site that was inundated after excavation. It was a low-lying area and served as a catchment area for excess rain water,” the official said.

The official said the project’s net anticipated increase in cost of Rs 4.8 crore was purely due to the site condition.

The technical sanction for the project was accorded for an amount of Rs 9.4 crore in September 2015.

The work order was issued in December 2016, and the actual execution of work commenced only in May 2017 due to enforcement of the model code of conduct from January 2017 till April 2017.

The existing shops along the highway will be rehabilitated. They have been proposed to be rehabilitated on the ground floor of the structure.

Bank and corporate offices will be allowed to operate on the other floors, and that will help the municipality generate revenue.

The proposal was approved by the Goa State Urban Development Agency (GSUDA) under the integrated development of the major town scheme funded by the state government in 2013.

JAP-L founder Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav said he will himself take part in the bandh. “This will be do-or-die situation. Now atrocities on backwards, Dalits or minorities will no more be tolerated. No one can play with the Constitution,” he said.

Even RLSP head Upendra Kushwaha has asked his party workers to support the bandh. “The cause behind bandh is similar to those we are fighting for. It is natural we will support it,” said RLSP spokesperson Fazal Imam Mallick.

VIP founder Mukesh Sahni also said his party will support the bandh.

CPI-ML secretary Kunal said depriving Dalits of reservation was an attack on their rights and demanded the central government to bring an ordinance to nullify the SC ruling. Kunal said after the Sunday bandh, they will be marching to Vidhan Sabha on February 25 demanding a resolution to be passed in the house against NPR and will also be raising the issue of displacement of the poor in the name of Jal-Jeevan-Hariyali.

Bhim Army state general secretary Amar Jyoti said they will be disrupting vehicular movement, but will allow ambulance and other emergency vehicles during the bandh. “In Patna, we will not allow vehicular movement on Ashok Rajpath and Bailey Road. Movement of trains at Ara, Buxar and Rajendra Nagar Terminal will not be allowed,” said Jyoti.

CM Nitish Kumar

PATNA: CM Nitish Kumar on Friday announced that a magnificent memorial would be constructed on the premises of police headquarters housed in Sardar Patel Bhavan in Patna to commemorate the state police personnel who die on the line of duty in combat with either gangsters or extremist groups during encounters with them.

The CM was addressing a function organized here to felicitate the wives of 15 police and security personnel, including seven belonging to the state police, three to CISF and five to CRPF, with memento, shawl and Rs51,000 each.

State assembly Speaker Vijay Kumar Choudhary, acting chairman of legislative council Haroon Rashid, industries minister Shyam Rajak, state DGP Gupteshwar Pandey, CISF DIG D Parihar and CRPF DIG Mohammad Hasnain among others were present. They, in their speeches, said honouring those who sacrificed their lives while on duty to save and protect people was akin to upholding good values of society.

DGP Pandey asked the state police personnel to strictly enforce complete prohibition that is under implementation in the state for the last four years, as it would improve social health and give new direction to youths.

The CM said the state police force should show their total commitment to enforcing prohibition. “People of the state have accepted complete prohibition. Only they are talking about home delivery who are anxiously eager to have drink,” he said, adding that the police personnel and legislators had taken resolution to uphold prohibition.

The CM dwelt at length on the construction of a memorial dedicated to the memory of state police personnel who have died on the line of duty. “I have asked the state DGP to initiate steps for the construction of the memorial to commemorate the police personnel who die while performing their duty,” the CM said.

The CM also said he had asked the state DGP to get constructed another structure on the same campus on which would be engraved the names of all the police personnel who have sacrificed their lives while on duty. “The state police headquarters have the record of all such police personnel,” he said, adding that the government would provide the required funds.

Sabzibagh locality protesting against NRC, CAA and NPR

GAYA: As the protest against CAA-NPR-NRC at Shantibagh in Gaya town entered 56th day on Friday, the organisers here said the outcome of Shaheen Bagh (Delhi) negotiations between the SC-appointed interlocutors and protesters would in no way impact the Gaya protest. The non-stop protest here began on December 29.

Conceding that they are keeping a close watch on the negotiations between Shaheen Bagh protestors and the interlocutors, Omair Khan and Satish Das, convener and co-convener of the Samvidhan Bachao Morcha, said, “The only reason why we keep a tab on Delhi developments is that the issue of both the protests was common.”

Asked whether the withdrawal or relocation of the Delhi protest at the instance of the interlocutors would make them revisit their strategy, the duo said the SC has appointed the interlocutors only for Shaheen Bagh and not for other places where anti-CAA protests are going on.

“The nature of protest too is different. Unlike Delhi, the Gaya protest is being held on private land and as such alibis like public inconvenience do not hold good here,” Khan said. The Gaya protest would continue till the CAA is either rolled back by the Centre or the SC passes a verdict on the constitutional validity of the controversial Act, asserted Das.

“The Morcha has full faith in SC as the custodian of citizens’ rights and basic character of the Constitution that does not make any discrimination on the ground of religious belief,” Khan and Das said.

Das complained that some sections wanted to portray it as a purely Muslim protest. “NRC would affect all Indians, more so the poor and as such it does not have any religious overtones,” he added.

Das claimed that the Gaya protesters have got the support of all right thinking people and besides Kanhaiyya Kumar, CPM leader Brinda Karat, CPI leaders Atul Kumar Anjan and Amarjeet Kaur, retired police officer Amitabh Das, ex-Bihar CM Jitan Ram Manjhi, former speaker Udai Narain Chaudhary, leader of opposition in the Bihar assembly Tejaswi Yadav and celebrated poet Imran Pratapgarhi have visited the dharna site to express solidarity with the protestors. On 22 Feb (Saturday) well-known political thinker and activist Yogendra Yadav would be addressing the protesters.

Sources said Sharjil Imam, who is accused in a sedition case, wanted to use the Shantibagh platform, but the Morcha leaders refused to play host to Imam for his “aggressive and provocative” rhetoric.

Altogether 21 ‘shobha yatras’ were taken out by members of different puja committees across the city reached Khajpura Shiva temple where bhajan sandhya, Shiva Vivah and kirtan were organized on the occasion. Tableaux on various aspects of Lord Shiva , including his marriage with Goddess Parvati, were made on the occasion.

Besides, devotees in huge numbers gathered at the temple in order to see tableaux and shobha yatras, he said. “Huge number of devotees were present during the ceremonial Shiva Vivah, which was organized from 9pm,” he added.

Over 400 additional police personnel were deployed near Khajpura Shiva temple to manage the crowd. Apart from that, hundreds of police personnel were deputed at other temples in the city.

Harikant Prasad, an official at the Mahavir Temple near Patna Junction said: “The number of devotees visiting the temple was much more than last year. People thronged the temple since 5am. Devotees, who had booked slots for ‘Rudrabhishek’ on the three ‘shivalingas’ in the temple were given an hour’s time each for the rituals.”

Arvind Pandey, a priest associated with the Shiva temple near Sabjimandi , said people offered prayers and participated in ‘jagran’.

Devotees had to wait for hours at temples to offer puja. “Even though I went early morning, the crowd was unmanageable. It took me around two hours to perform ‘jalabhishek’ on the Shivalinga,” said Pritee Prasad of Kadamkuan.

Chief minister Nitish Kumar extended his greetings to the people on Mahashivaratri. “It is a festival of unbounded faith and devotion. By maintaining mutual trust, love, brotherhood, social harmony and religious goodwill, I wish the state to achieve progress, peace and prosperity,” he said.

Fog blanketed the entire Diamond City with the morning temperature falling to 18°C

Surat: Dense fog enveloped Surat and parts of Bharuch and Navsari on Friday morning. Poor visibility even disrupted flight and train operations in the region with one Spice Jet flight from Delhi to Surat had to be diverted to Ahmedabad. Around five trains too were reportedly running late by more than an hour due to the foggy conditions.

The entire Diamond City wore a blanket of fog with the morning temperature falling to 18°C. The dense fog extended to other parts including Bharuch, Navsari and Valsad where traffic on the national highway too was affected.

Sources in Spice Jet confirmed that the Delhi to Surat flight with about 150 passengers had to be diverted to Ahmedabad owing to poor visibility for fog at the Surat airport. The flight was to arrive at 7.31 am at Surat, but after it had to be diverted to Ahmedabad, it departed at 9am to reach Surat airport at 9.31am, sources added.

A senior airport officer said, “The instrument landing system (ILS) is functioning at the airport, but only a pilot who is trained in ILS can land the aircraft when the runway visual range (RVR) is minimum 200 metres. On Friday, the visual range at the airport was more than 300 metres and the pilot could not land the aircraft and hence, it had to be diverted to Ahmedabad.”

Weather department officials said that the minimum temperature in the morning dropped 18.7°C and humidity was recorded at 91%, which resulted in the dense fog situation.

Area railway manager, Surat railway station, CR Garuda said, “There was a dense fog situation from Bharuch to Surat and Navsari. About five trains including Mumbai-Vadodara Express, Gandhidham Express, Rajdhani Express, Garib Rath and Gujarat Queen were running late by 20 minutes to one hour. The traffic situation was normal after 10am.”

Bhopal: Mystery shrouds the cause of fire which broke out in the parking lot of a four-storeyed building occupied by postal department employees at the Post & Telegraph Colony in Kamla Nagar in the wee hours of Friday. Eight two-wheelers, including bikes and scooters along with a kid's bicycle parked under the building, were completely gutted. No casualty was reported.

The heat and intensity of the flames were so severe that they spread through the entire staircase from the ground floor to the terrace damaging a plastic overhead water tank along and a trunk and other goods kept on the terrace.

After getting information after the incident, minister PC Sharma and the local corporator reached the spot to review the situation.

The police and fire brigade were alerted about the blaze by an alert woman, who resides in a flat in front of the apartment. The apartment, where the incident took place, has 12 flats in which 10 families reside. Fortunately, the three flats on the ground floor were vacant.

All the families were trapped in their respective flats on the upper floors as the staircase was filled with smoke and flames.

The entrance doors of all the flats on the ground floor to fourth floor were burnt from outside and electric metres fitted outside were gutted. Two women employees of the post office, who live in one of the flats, jumped off to safety from the first floor. Ambalika Vishwakarma sustained injury on her legs while Sakshi Patel escaped unhurt.

SHO Kamla Nagar SI Vijay Sisodia said that police have registered a case of arson and are investigating the cause of fire. Prima facie, it seems that short-circuit caused fire. A marriage function was going on in the colony premises, so there is a little possibility of any outsider setting the fire, he said.

There are no CCTV cameras and no security guards in the colony. Building residents and locals suspect foul play and have suggested that miscreants torched the vehicles. They are linking the incident to the series of vehicles vandalised and torched in the area by miscreants.

Surat: The city Congress and youth Congress leaders on Friday held dharna at Surat Municipal Institute of Medical Education and Research (SMIMER) on Friday demanding immediate submission of inquiry report into the episode of allegedly stripping of female employees of the civic body before gynaecological exam.

Congress leaders and elected municipal councillors seated outside SMIMER shouted slogans for completing the inquiry early. “By giving 15 days time to submit the inquiry report the municipal commissioner is trying to cover up the issue. The ruling BJP and officials of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) have lost all humanity,” said Aslam Cyclewala, Congress municipal councillor.

“When we demanded that the inquiry should conclude in three days, we were told that the senior most member of the probe team was busy with some personal assignment due to which the report may get delayed. If one member is busy she should be replaced. But the report should be submitted in three days,” said Cyclewala.

“It seems SMC top officials are trying to pour cold water on a burning issue. We will sit on dharna along with the victims at municipal commissioner's office if the report is not submitted in three days,” said Pradeep Sindhav, a Youth Congress leader.

Women working in different fields expressed shock and disbelief at the insulting manner in which the tests were conducted. They said that dignity and privacy of all individuals should be maintained.

“Everybody has right to privacy. The women should be provided details of such tests in advance and their privacy should be maintained in any situation,” said Vibha Marfatia, a social worker. Marfatia is director of Sahas, an NGO working for awareness in health.

A women doctor employed at a government hospital explained, “For a gynaecology test it is required that proper method is followed where the patient does not feel insulted. In most cases, all the tests are not required.”

Representative image

PATNA: A 24-year-old youth was lynched by a mob on the suspicion of being a thief at Korigama village under the Goroul police station area in Vaishali district in the wee hours of Friday.

The incident took place around 2 am when the youth was reportedly spotted trying to break open the locks of a shop located at Korigama village on the borders of Goroul and Mahua police stations in the district on Friday. The mob thrashed him badly leading to his instant death.

Vaishali SP Gaurav Mangla said the deceased was identified as Subash Rai, a resident of Jadhua village under the Ganga Bridge police station area in Vaishali district. The family members, however, told the police that Rai had left home around 8 pm on Thursday to meet an acquaintance. His body was found at Korigama village early on Friday morning.

The SP said the Goroul police reached the spot after being informed about the incident by the village chowkidar on Friday morning. “The body bore external injuries. The victim had died before police reached the spot. Later the body was sent to the sadar hospital at Hajipur for postmortem,” the SP said, adding that action would be initiated against those taking law into their hands.

Goroul police station SHO Anil Kumar said the identity of the deceased was ascertained with the help of some documents he was carrying with him at the time of the incident. “How he reached Korigama village, which is nearly 30 km from his native place Jadhua, is subject to investigation,” he told this newspaper over phone.

Police said that the antecedents of the deceased were being verified, if any. “So far there is no criminal case pending against the deceased with the Ganga Bridge police station in the district. Efforts are on to collect more information from other police stations in the district,” the SHO said adding that one person involved in mob lynching has been arrested.

A close relative of the deceased, however, claimed that he (Subhash) had called his family members and revealed that he had been held captive by some local residents near Korigama village and was subsequently beaten up mercilessly. “He had succumbed to his injuries by the time his relatives reached the spot,” an investigating officer quoted a family member as saying.

Meanwhile, the deceased’s body was handed over to the family after postmortem. A case has been lodged with the Goroul police station against unidentified persons in connection with the incident. The incident took place a day before DGP Gupteshwar Pandey is likely to address a ‘chaupal’ (public meeting) at Hajipur on crime control and proper implementation of prohibition law.

Visitors during Mahila Udyami cum Rojgar Mela at Gyan Bhawan in Patna on Friday

PATNA: Chief secretary Deepak Kumar said on Friday that state government and Women Development Corporation (WDC)would provide a permanent platform to local artisans of Bihar to sell their handmade products throughout the year.

Speaking at the inaugural function of ‘Mahila Udyami Mela-cum-Rozgar Mela’ organized by WDC at Gyan Bhawan, Deepak said, “I feel satisfied to see that women from different sections of society are coming forward and learning new skills. Women entrepreneur could avail various skill development initiatives provided by the state government to improve their job prospects.”

He said women entrepreneurs should assess the demand of the product before selecting their start-up plans. He urged the women entrepreneurs to be the job creators instead of job seekers. “It is good to see that women have become self-dependent but they should also strive hard to provide employment to other women as well. For example, in Mumbai, dabbawalas start-up has grown leaps and bounds. It has provided employment to large number of people who deliver the food to offices and other places,” Deepak said. He also visited few stalls put up there and encouraged the women entrepreneurs.

WDC managing director Harjot Kaur said permanent premises to display and sell local arts by artisans would be ready within one year. “The state government and the WDC will lay out a plan for the same. Besides, the WDC and Bihar Mahila Udyog Sangh (BMUS) will jointly promote the local artworks of Bihar at national and international level by organizing fairs,” she said.

Additional chief secretary of social welfare department, Atul Prasad, and BMUS president Usha Jha were also present.

Handicrafts, Madhubani painting, Tikuli Art, appliqué work, wall-hangings, live plants and artificial flowers, home decors, kurti and other dress materials, artificial jewellery, accessories, lamps, utensils and edible products were being sold at around 70 stalls put up by the women entrepreneurs at the fair.

Nupur Naryan, who was selling live plants, said, “We also have a unique kit for kids to learn the gardening skill. It costs Rs500.”

Soni Kumari, who is associated with Bihar Upendra Maharathi Shilp Anusandhan Sansthan, was selling Tikuli Art, handicrafts like tea coasters wall-hanging, mirror, painting and tray. “The decorative items cost between Rs60 and Rs4,000,” he said.

The customers were thrilled and hopping from one shop to another. Shalini, a resident of Boring Road, bought appliqué design bedsheets, Sujni handicrafts and Madhubani artwork purse. “I really like the purse. I can carry it in parties as it is unique,” she said.

KOLKATA: The New Town Kolkata Development Authority ( NKDA ), in consultation with enlisted architects, structural engineers and other stakeholders, has adopted several neighbourhood- and environment-friendly construction practices.

Some of the measures to be in place include preventing harmful effluents from piling rigs from flowing into the sewerage and drainage lines, not allowing construction materials to be piled on the blacktop portion of the roads and ensuring use of low-noise alternative machines for work during the day instead of diesel engines or generators between 8pm and 6am. Additionally, all under-construction buildings will have to be covered so that no dust, debris or construction material fall outside the property boundary. Contractors will also have to ensure that there is no water accumulation on the premises.

NKDA officials also suggested that to develop sustainable and eco-friendly buildings, reflective paint could be used on rooftops to reduce room temperature by around 4°C to 5°C to reduce power consumption.

80,['22/02/2020'],Kolkata airport cleanest among eight busiest AAI facilities,"This story is from February 22, 2020

Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport

KOLKATA: The Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport has been declared the cleanest among the large state-owned airports , pipping Chennai and Jaipur that are ranked second and third respectively. Coming after years of passenger grouse on the state of washrooms, the award is a recognition of strides taken in the past year to overhaul the toilets and improve upkeep. However, the improvement in the indoor ambience is offset by terrible experience outside as passengers encounter shabby touts and chaotic traffic on exiting the terminal.

In the Swachhata Awards 2019, announced by the ministry of civil aviation for clean and safe airports, Kolkata has been declared the best AAI airport with annual passenger traffic in excess of 5 million. Of the 13 big Indian airports, eight are operated by AAI — Kolkata, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Pune, Goa, Guwahati, Lucknow and Jaipur. Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Cochin are private airports.

While Kolkata airport has won laurels for terminal design and efficiency, the state of its washrooms — particularly their cleanliness — has been a sore point among travellers. Though maintenance was handed over to private contractors, it failed to impress passengers. Recognizing the need for a complete make-over, AAI decided to redo the facilities, complete with new sanitary ware, fixtures and signage. In addition, airport managers were tasked with diligently monitoring the cleanliness of washrooms and attendants were stationed in each of them round-the-clock.

The difference began to be noticed in the second half of last year with criticism over the toilets on social media beginning to wane.

“Over the past several months, we have been alert about the toilets. Regular feedback from passengers, either on social media or through smiley machines installed near washrooms, were monitored and acted upon,” said an airport official.

While the change in washrooms is obvious, other initiatives that helped Kolkata airport score points include reducing single-use plastic, installing a plastic bottle crushing machine, getting enrolled and achieving level 2 in the Carbon Accreditation Programme, sensitizing employees and passengers, and setting up green walls inside the terminal.

“Outside the terminal, modern grass cutting-cum-collecting machines have been deployed to keep the grounds clean. Rubber deposits on the runway are also regularly removed to ensure that the landing strip has the desired friction level,” an airport official pointed out.

However, the issues outside the terminal continue to fester. The menace of touts — controlled intermittently through police drives — remains a problem as does illegal parking of VIP vehicles in front of the terminal.

Passengers say that if Kolkata airport is to indeed project itself as a world-class facility, it needs to clear the problems outside as well.

BENGALURU: PhonePe ATM , a new service that lets consumers withdraw cash from its offline merchants via the Unified Payments Interface ( UPI ), has angered rivals who have drawn the attention of the regulator to the issue, three people aware of the matter said.On Friday last week, this became the centre of an intense debate during the steering committee meeting of the National Payments Corporation of India ( NPCI ). The meeting saw banks and PhonePe’s rivals — including Paytm — raising questions on PhonePe being allowed to launch this service in the absence of any regulatory framework on cash withdrawal through UPI.While cash withdrawal at point-of-sales (PoS) machines is allowed by the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ), NPCI hasn’t yet formulated norms for this using the UPI platform. Sources said NPCI is now working on framing guidelines for the same.The corporation also debated with banks if the service should be charged to consumers, which PhonePe is not in favour of as it feels a charge on cash withdrawal will “kill” the service. NPCI is considering following the model for cash withdrawal at a PoS device to issue its own circular for a similar service through UPI.Another source aware of the goings-on added that PhonePe being allowed to launch the service in the absence of existing guidelines has been highlighted by its rivals to the regulator, putting NPCI under pressure. The ATM-like service, which clocked 1 lakh withdrawals over Friday and Saturday last week, is available with a million merchants in India. PhonePe has 10 million merchants in total.Sources close to PhonePe added it is not considering stopping its ATM service, which was highlighted as “revolutionary” by Walmart’s international CEO and president Judith McKenna in Tuesday’s annual investor meeting in New York.“It has to be dealt with carefully since some stakeholders can misuse the cash withdrawal without adequate checks and balances. Banks are pushing to levy a charge, which PhonePe is resisting. PhonePe’s UPI rivals are contesting that everyone should be given an equal opportunity when adequate guidelines are not in place,” a source said.Another person aware of the talks said, “Now that NPCI is working on guidelines, anyone with existing products should ideally pause operations until a further update from the umbrella payments body comes.” According to current discussions, NPCI is of the view that a maximum of Rs 10 can be charged for each cash withdrawal via UPI with a daily limit of Rs 2,000 through three transactions.Emailed queries to PhonePe and NPCI did not elicit any response. “We already have a Paytm ka ATM service that offers cash-in and cash-out facility from more than 67,000 locations in India for our customers,” Paytm said in a statement without commenting on PhonePe ATM.Paytm ka ATM was launched in December 2017 via its payments bank, enabled by banking correspondents, or BCs.“If such models are allowed before NPCI frames rules, what happens to the jobs of BCs?,” one of the people mentioned earlier added. PhonePe ATM is part of the company’s aggressive marketing plan, which entails a budget of Rs 800 crore for 2020 with Bollywood actors Aamir Khan and Alia Bhatt as its brand ambassadors.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74252461,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-186646,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rivals-slam-phonepes-atm-biz-question-launch-in-absence-of-rules/articleshow/74249921.cms

NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: Cash-strapped, struggling operations of Vodafone Idea saw a glimmer of hope to raise funds with the department of telecom ( DoT ) approving the merger of Indus Towers with Bharti Infratel to form one of the world’s largest tower companies.The merger, which had been first announced in April 2018 but had been pending, will give an opportunity to Vodafone Idea to divest its little over 11% stake in the combined entity and raise around Rs 5,000 crore. The fund-raising will be crucial for the telco, which has to pay Rs 53,000 crore to the government following the October 24 AGR ( adjusted gross revenues ) judgment of the Supreme Court . So far, it has paid only Rs 2,500 crore, while there is speculation that it may have given another Rs 1,000 crore.The deal is understood to have received a go-ahead after the merging companies received the foreign direct investment (FDI) nod from DoT on Friday evening. Sources attributed the delay in merger to a withholding tax dispute between UK’s Vodafone Group and India. There is no official confirmation from the companies on the matter.According to plans, the combined entity will be called Indus Towers with over 1.63 lakh towers, and this would own the respective businesses of Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers. Indus Towers is a three-way joint venture between Bharti Infratel, Vodafone Group and Vodafone Idea, with the first two holding 42% each. Vodafone Idea owns 11.2%, while the remaining 4.9% is with private equity firm Providence. On the other hand, Airtel has a majority stake in Bharti Infratel.The Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers merger deal was first signed on April 25, 2018, and was to be concluded by October 24 last year. Subsequently, the companies extended the deal completion initially by two months to December 24, and thereafter another two months to February 24.The clearance comes just days after K M Birla , chairman of Vodafone Idea, held a series of meetings with the government regarding the AGR matter and health of the telecom sector. Birla met telecom secretary Anshu Prakash earlier this week, while also meeting FM Nirmala Sitharaman on Thursday. The government has assured Vodafone Idea, and even Airtel (which has to pay Rs 35,000 crore in AGR dues), that it is working out ways to enable the companies to stay afloat.Top officials in the telecom department have said that while adhering to the apex court’s order is “priority number one”, efforts are also on to ensure that existing companies get an enabling environment to save their operations.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74252960,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-118765,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/indus-towers-bharti-infra-can-merge-dot/articleshow/74249945.cms

Ahmedabad has 48 lakh registered vehicles which works out to just 0.54m of road per vehicle.

AHMEDABAD: You may have bought your dream car, but if driving it in the city is proving a nightmare, blame poor town planning and the rapidly growing number of vehicles in the city.

According to an analysis of figures from the government, Ahmedabad city that has 48 lakh registered vehicles which works out to just 0.54m of road per vehicle. The situation is bound to get worse, as the city is rapidly adding vehicles while its road length is stagnant since 2017.

According to the ‘Road Transport Yearbook for 2016-17’ published by the Union ministry of road transport and highways, Ahmedabad’s vehicle population was 39.05 lakh in 2017 and 9.05 lakh vehicles were added till 2019, taking the total to 48.10 lakh.

The vehicle population in Ahmedabad city is increasing by 2.5 to 3 lakh vehicles a year, or 5-6% annually.

Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) officials said that the city’s total road length is 2,580km, which has been stagnant since 2017.

H M Shivanand Swamy, executive director of the centre of excellence in urban transport at Cept University, said that the city’s road length is too low for to meet prescribed road safety standards. “The city should have about two metres of road per vehicle. Authorities cannot control the increasing number of vehicles, but it can always create a strong public transport system,” Swamy said.

“The AMC’s decision to move AMTS buses out of the dedicated BRT corridor has made traffic congestion worse in the city,” said a senior AMC official.

The failure of the BRT and AMTS bus systems has also added to traffic woes, he said. Road safety expert Amit Khatri says, “The public transport system has failed miserably, which is the reason for the increase in the number of private vehicles.”

The report states that the 42 Indian cities with populations higher than 10 lakh have 7.28 crore motor vehicles registered, up to March 31, 2017, or 28.75% of all vehicles registered in India.

Chirag Paswan

PATNA: Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) national president Chirag Paswan on Saturday made it clear that he will not support any hate speech of his alliance leaders and said development should be the only agenda of the NDA. Chirag admitted that NDA had to suffer in Delhi assembly election because of such statements.

Responding to questions regarding controversial statement made by BJP MP Giriraj Singh in Purnea on Thursday that all the Muslims should have been sent to Pakistan during partition in 1947, Chirag before launching his ‘Bihar first Bihari first Yatra’ said, “There are leaders in alliance with whom I do not agree. Even if such divisive statement is made during the election, I will disapprove of it. The way government has been formed in Delhi, development should be the agenda for Bihar election. Everyone should leave the politics of caste and religion and focus on development.”

This is not for the first time that Chirag has opposed controversial statements. Even on the day of Delhi assembly results, he had tweeted, “Today Delhi’s result has proved that people reward for the work done. The way in Lok Sabha election vote was given on PM Modi’s work, similarly in Delhi election Arvind Kejriwal ji has got the blessings. Lots of best wishes for today’s victory (sic).”

On a question pertaining to ongoing protests in the state, including that by sub-inspector aspirants, he replied, “I have talked to chief minister Nitish Kumar to hold dialogue with them. Lathicharge is not the solution.”

Talking about his yatra, he said LJP will be going to all the districts. In the first phase, he will interact with party functionaries to know the local problem of that region. This yatra will conclude on April 14 at Gandhi Maidan in Patna with a proper vision document. Chirag further said LJP will soon be launching a toll-free number on which people could tell about their problem.

“Our aim is to make Bihar the number one state in the country. Though we got independent with other states, we are still lagging behind others on many parameters. We have had a golden history and we have to revive that. Right now migration is a big problem and we have to stop that.”

However, he said, CM Nitish had worked a lot to bring the state out of Jungle Raj era. “A lot has been done and a lot more has to be done,” said Chirag.

Without taking the name of leader of opposition in state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav , Chirag mocked at his ‘Berozgari Hatao Yatra’ saying such yatra had no vision and had negative thoughts attached. On a question regarding poll strategist Prashant Kishor, who too was emphasizing on development of Bihar in the coming election and if there were chances of their coming together, Chirag replied, “That is a hypothetical question. My thoughts regarding development are quite old, but it is good to see that people are now discussing this issue.”

Representative image

PATNA: An SHO and a police constable were put under suspension, while the contract of a village chowkidar was terminated on Friday for releasing six people detained for violating prohibition law , from the police station in Patna district late on Wednesday night.

The disciplinary action was initiated against Dhanarua police station SHO Suman Kumar, driver Yogendra Kumar and chowkidar Amitabh Bachchan by Patna SSP Upendra Kumar Sharma on the basis of a detailed investigation conducted by City SP East Jitendra Kumar.

Confirming the action, the SSP on Friday said, “Such lapses on part of any police officer in the district will not be tolerated. Police personnel found to be lax in implementing prohibition law at Dhanarua police station have already been suspended and departmental proceedings have been initiated against them. In addition, suitable action has also been taken against the chowkidar.”

According to reports, altogether six people were detained at the Dhanarua police station on Thursday night after being found in drunken state. One of them, stated to be nephew of an influential mukhiya of the area, was first released from the police station. Five others were also let off with the connivance of the cops manning the police station the same night.

Patna SSP Sharma swung into action and ordered an investigation soon after receiving complaint from some local residents that those detained at the Dhanarua police station for consuming liquor in violation of Bihar Excise and Prohibition Act 2016 were released from the police station after being obliged by their relatives.

City SP (East) Kumar along with Masaurhi SDPO Sonu Kumar immediately visited the police station and inquired about the allegations levelled against the police personnel. “All six people, who were released from police custody, were summoned at the Dhanarua police station. Breathalyzer test, however, confirmed that five of them had consumed alcohol,” the City SP (East) said.

He said one of them, who had not tested positive in the test, was, however, released after verification. During investigation, it was found that five of the drunken people were earlier released from police custody under pressure. “We didn’t find any evidence of illegal gratification as alleged by some people,” Kumar said.

As per the provisions of the new prohibition law, Suman Kumar, a sub-inspector of police, would be deprived of being posted as SHO of any police station in the state for next 10 years. “The SSP is not in a mood to let off any cop found to be lax in implementing prohibition law under his jurisdiction,” an SP rank officer told this newspaper on the condition of anonymity.

Earlier, DGP Gupteshwar Pandey had ordered the suspension of Gaurichak police station and transfer of all the police personnel posted there on the complaints of residents of Chipura village that the cops were hands in glove with liquor smugglers.

PATNA: Rodents are at it again in Bihar! After the state government had blamed rats for consuming seized liquor kept in police malkhanas (storerooms) in dry Bihar and damaging the river embankments causing floods in 2017, the rodents have reportedly nibbled hundreds of saline bottles stored in the government hospital at Katihar .

The saline bottles meant to be supplied to the primary health centres across Katihar district were found damaged in the storeroom of Sadar hospital a couple of days back. The matter came to light when the acting superintendent of Katihar sadar hospital, Dr Arvind Prasad Shahi, inquired about the saline bottles earlier supplied by the health department.

When contacted, Shahi said, “I have been told by the hospital employees that the saline bottles were damaged by rats. I immediately visited the storeroom where medicines and saline bottles were stored to be provided to patients. I found the bottles badly damaged and some of them not fit for use. I have already ordered an inquiry into the matter.”

Shahi further said the drugs and saline bottles have been stocked outside the storeroom, which is already packed. Moreover, another building meant for the purpose is under construction. He, however, didn’t rule out mishandling of a few cartons full of medicines and saline bottles damaged during the course of unloading from the vehicles or transportation.

Shahi is also holding additional charge of civil surgeon. He said the medicines have been supplied from the central storeroom more than the storage capacity of the storeroom in Katihar sadar hospital. As a result, a few cartons were kept on the verandah of the storeroom. “The storeroom is the centre from where medicines and saline bottles are supplied to the PHCs in the district,” he told this newspaper over phone on Friday.

Efforts to contact senior officials of health department in Patna, however, proved futile. The cellphone numbers of senior officers of the department were either found switched off or went unattended. However, an employee of the department said, “The senior officers are not picking up phone calls due to Mahashivaratri holiday.”

Earlier, rats were accused of drinking hundreds of litres of seized liquor from the police malkhanas in Patna and Kaimur districts. Later, the then state water resources department minister Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan Singh (now a JD(U) MP from Munger) had accused rats for causing holes in many river embankments causing floods in several districts of north Bihar in 2017. Besides, a huge cash stored in the vigilance police station in Patna were eaten by rodents.

PATNA: Hundreds of government schoolteachers staged protest at district education office here on the second day on Friday against the show-cause notices issued to niyojit (contractual) teachers and termination of regular teachers in Patna district.

The protesting teachers also performed ‘havan’ on the occasion of Mahashivaratri and offered Friday namaz outside the DEO office.

Prem Kumar, a niyojit teacher and member of Bihar State Primary Teachers’ Association, told this newspaper that they organized ‘havan’ and prayer to ebb away bad omens. “Tomorrow, we will protest with plate and glass. We will not let them work until they revoke the termination order and show-cause notices,” he said.

Manoj Kumar, a regular teacher terminated, said the state government must hear our demands of equal pay for equal work, pension scheme and service conditions for contract teachers among others.

Rameshwar, another niyojit teacher said, “We will not move an inch till the Patna DEO takes back his FIR against teachers. Protest is our democratic right. We had only gheraoed the DEO office. We neither caused inconvenience to them nor ransacked anything. Then why he lodged complaint against the teachers?”

Patna district education officer (DEO) Jyoti Kumar on late Thursday evening filed an FIR against seven niyojit teachers for gherao and disturbing the office functioning.

Jyoti said on Friday that he cannot revoke the termination order or take back the show-cause notices. “We are acting on the direction of education department. If they keep hampering the office work, we will take action. Today, the staff worked amid heavy police deployment,” he said.

“Altogether 250 show-cause notices were issued to niyojit teachers. Also, two regular teachers were issued termination order and FIR was lodged against seven teachers,” he said.

Around 4.5 lakh teachers of government and government-aided schools have been protesting under the banner of Bihar Rajya Shikshak Sangharsh Samanvay Samiti (BRSSSS) across the state, hampering the academic activities in 75,000 schools in Bihar.

BJP MLC Nawal Kishor Yadav has supported the teacher’s agitation. He said the dismissal of teachers was wrong. “The state government should seriously consider the teachers’ demands,” he said.

42 examinees expelled

Altogether 42 matriculation examinees were expelled on Friday for using unfair means during the ongoing exam being conducted by Bihar School Examination Board. Three impersonators were arrested from exam centres in Gaya district

PATNA: Youths aspiring for assistant professorship in the universities of Bihar would now get more weightage on their research publications and post-doctoral work in selection by the Bihar State University Service Commission (BSUSC). This is a major highlight of the draft statute relating to the appointment of assistant professors finalized by a three-member committee constituted by the chancellor recently.

The draft statute prepared by Magadh University vice-chancellor Rajendra Prasad, Purnea University VC Rajesh Singh and Munger University VC Ranjit Kumar Verma is likely to be assented to be by the chancellor in a week, paving the way for initiating the process of appointment of assistant professors against existing vacancies.

According to sources, the new statutes envisage selection on 115 marks, including 100 marks on academics and 15 on interview. Earlier, the selection was made on 100 marks, including 85 marks on academics and 15 on interview.

The draft statutes provide for a maximum of 15 marks on graduation and 25 marks on postgraduation degrees. A candidate having MPhil degree would get seven marks, while a candidate having a PhD degree as per the UGC guidelines would get 30 marks. Candidates who are NET qualified with JRF will get seven marks, while who is NET qualified without JRF would be awarded only five marks. On the other hand, a BET/SLET qualified candidate would be awarded three marks.

A candidate would get a maximum of 10 marks on research publications (at the rate of two marks on each paper published in journals validated by UGC or Scopus). Similarly, a candidate would get a maximum of 10 marks on teaching experience. Candidates are also entitled for a maximum of three marks on getting state or national awards.

The state education department has already requisitioned the details of existing vacancies of assistant professors in different subjects from all the universities and the same would be advertised by the university service panel shortly, said sources.

It may be mentioned here that with a view to addressing the issue of shortage of teaching faculty in higher education institutions, the UGC had in June last year issued fresh guidelines for recruitment of faculty and had also set a time frame of six months for completing the entire recruitment process. Unfortunately, Bihar failed to meet the deadline. The UGC guidelines state that the higher education institutions should follow the selection process as per their Acts and statutes and in accordance with the UGC (Minimum Qualifications for Appointment of Teachers and other Academic Staff in Universities and Colleges and other Measures for the Maintenance of Standards in Higher Education) Regulations, 2018.

Prashant Kishor

PATNA: In an apparent attempt to counter Prashant Kishor ’s ‘Baat Bihar Ki’ programme, Chhatra JD(U) -- the student wing of ruling JD(U) -- on Friday decided to launch a ‘Chalo Nitish Ke Sang’ (move along with Nitish Kumar ) programme at all 477 constituent and affiliated colleges and 10 traditional universities across the state from March 15.

“Workers of the Chhatra JD(U) will go to all colleges and universities and hold a series of programmes on the campus to inform youths about the works done by Nitish for improving educational scenario in the state,” JD(U) MLC and party incharge for Chhatra JD(U) Ranbir Nandan told TOI on Friday.

He said the Chhatra JD(U) would soon launch a toll-free number also. “Any student can enrol as Chhatra JD(U) member by making a call on that number. We will soon issue the said number,” Nandan said.

Kishor has already launched a toll-free number for enrolling youths under the ‘ Baat Bihar Ki ’ programme.

The JD(U) MLC said the ‘Chalo Nitish Ke Sang’ programme would continue till May 15. During the period, the Chhatra JD(U) activists would hold different types of programmes on the campuses and also make people aware about the benefits of the state government’s flagship programme — ‘Jal-Jevan-Hariyali Abhiyan.’

“Recently, questions were raised as to what Nitish Kumar has done for improving quality of education in the state,” Nandan said without taking Kishor’s name. “Now, Chhatra JD(U) members will move to campuses and make person-to-person contact among students and inform them how Nitish Kumar brought changes in the education scenario in the state,” he said.

Kishor, during his press conference on Tuesday, had alleged that Nitish failed to improve quality of education in Bihar during his last 15 years. More than three lakh youths registered for Kishor’s ambitious programme by Friday evening.

To a question, how the JD(U) will counter Kishor when he had already started enrolling youths by launching a toll-free number, Nandan said, “We do not have competition with any one. But our toll-free number will be released soon.”

KOLKATA: Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Friday announced that models working at the government art college will get a pension of Rs 1,500 per month.

Altogether, 15 models — of which 14 are women — were handed cheques on Friday. “Among the 14 models, 10 are from the art college and four are from Rabindra Bharati University.

Rajkot: Six robbers who carried out a daylight robbery in Bank of Baroda-Dena Bank in Morbi on Thursday are hardened criminals from Punjab and Haryana who are wanted for serious offences in the two states.

It was after a nearly 100 km chase in the internal roads and villages of Morbi that lasted for nearly three hours that four of the six were nabbed said Morbi local crime branch (LCB) sources on Friday. Six pistols which included three pistols of Turkey, Russian and Serbia make and three country-made revolvers alogn with 131 cartridges were seized from them.

Those nabbed were Ranjeet Singh Jat, Mandeep Singh Jat (28), Balveersingh Jat (25), Arunkumar Singh Majabi (30) and Sandeepkumar Gujjar (30) and their unidentified associate. They are history-sheeters in bank robbery, murder and drug trafficking cases. Except Ranjeet Singh and his aide, four others were nabbed by the police with the help of villagers.

LCB inspector VB Jadeja said, “After robbing Rs 6 lakh cash from the bank, the robbers fled in their car towards Halvad.”

“We alerted Halvad police station and asked them to barricade the road. However, the robbers spotted the cops near Halvad and took a U turn. They turned towards Thara village and went to Sundari Bhawani village and then to Mathak,” Jadeja told TOI.

Police then informed Mathak sarpanch Sukhdevsinh Zala who took locals and those from adjoining Naldari and Khetaradi villages and blocked the road by putting tractors, trolleys and bullock carts.

When cornered, the robbers drove their car into a farm. On hitting a dead end, they abandoned their car and started running into the field spreading 30 bighas which had maize crop.

Villagers were already deployed along the fringes of the field and they were armed with bats and iron pipes.

Jadeja formed four teams consisting of 12 cops. While one team caught three robbers, the other team nabbed another.

Police also recovered Rs 6,09,600 cash that was looted from the banks, three cellphones and a digital video recorder from the robbers.

RANJEETSINH WAS THE MASTERMIND

None of the accused had an idea of Morbi except for Ranjeetsingh Jat who was well-versed with the topography of the ‘ceramic town’. “Jat had visited Morbi as a truck driver earlier. He knew how wealthy the city was, and he passed on this information to the other accused. Together they had plotted the bank robbery,” said Jadeja.

THERE WERE REPORTS OF FIRING

Though the police have denied, there have been reports of firing by the robbers. “The villagers say the robbers had fired in the air to scare them away at the road block. The robbers also opened fire in the field,” said a source.

MASTERMIND CHANGED THE CAR

After fleeing in a car from Morbi, Ranjeetsingh alighted at Mahendranagar crossroads, got into another car and fled with another accused, whose identity could not be ascertained.

Kolhapur: The civic administration on Friday slapped fine on two food delivery service firms and a hotel for delivering and packaging food in plastic carry bags.

Municipal commissioner Mallinath Kalshetti had received complaints that the firms involved in food delivery service were using plastic carry bags for packaging food. Kalshetti asked a staff of the sanitation department to order food from Zomato and Swiggy. When the delivery boys arrived at the KMC building with the order, the packages were checked.

98,['22/02/2020'],CA dupes textile trader of Rs 3 crore on overdraft loan,"This story is from February 22, 2020

Surat: Police have registered a complaint against a Chartered Accountant (CA) for allegedly cheating a textile trader of Rs 3 crore by misusing overdraft loan facility against property from the latter’s bank account.

Complainant Pankaj Jain, 42, a textile trader and resident of Ratan Ansh Apartment in Vesu had met CA Pratik Kumar Meghani, having an office in Varachha’s Hirabaug in 2017. Since Jain was in need of money, Meghani lured him to use overdraft facility against his property to get a loan.

Meghani promised Jain to get him approval of overdraft facility from the complainant’s Axis bank account against his property and also by using his influence on Axis bank officials. He also showed Jain his own cash credit worth Rs 1.5 crore in Kotak bank account.

According to the police, Jain had given property documents of his apartment at Satkarm apartment in Saroli to be mortgaged in Axis bank. On March 28, 2017, the accused had informed Jain that the bank has accepted the documents and that an overdraft loan amounting to Rs 3.1 crore would be approved from the Axis bank.

Police stated that the complainant had to visit Delhi for some personal work and also informed Meghani about it. Meghani asked Jain to submit five letterheads of his firm duly signed for presenting in the bank. However, after his return, Meghani told Jain that the bank has stalled the process of approving his overdraft loan and that it will take some time.

In June 2017, the complainant received a call from his bank asking him to pay outstanding interest on his overdraft loan. When he inquired with the bank, Jain came to know that his overdraft loan was approved and Rs 3 crore was transferred to two other accounts.

Talking with TOI, police inspector of Umara police station, ML Salunke said, “When the complainant realised that he was cheated, he approached the CA and threatened him dire consequence. The CA then paid him Rs 35 lakh interest money and promised to pay the remaining amount soon, which he, however, did not till date. The textile trader then lodged a complaint with the police.”

Salunke added, “The CA is on the run and we have launched a manhunt to arrest him.”

Agra: A gang of eight men was busted by Agra police who were allegedly hired by a leading private bank to make threatening calls to customers who failed to pay EMI on time. Operating a fake call centre, the gang also recovered loan money from customers via e-wallets, which were later wired into bank accounts.

Posing themselves as policemen, lawyers and bank managers, the gang used to make calls from SIM cards which were issued on fake IDs. Most of the victims were from Indore, Ranchi, Patna, Lucknow, Ahmedabad, Chandigarh, Delhi, Mumbai and other cities. They received threatening calls for failing to pay EMI on time.

The apprehended accused were identified as Desh Deepak Singh (28), Bantu Singh (27), Kanhaiya Sharma (28), Manoj Kumar (24), Gautam Rathore (24), Dharmender Kumar (27), Sachin Verma (27) and Bhudev Singh (27). All the accused were booked under IPC section 419 (punishment for cheating by personation), 420 (cheating), 384 (extortion) and 507 (criminal intimidation by an anonymous communication).

“The gang was operating for the past six months from a fake call centre based at a rented property on Ukhra road. The gang’s kingpin Desh Deepak Gautam used to charge 20% commission from the private bank for each successful loan recovery. An absconding accused identified as Raj Kumar of Bah area is the broker between bank and the gang. He used to bring the list of bank customers to the gang, who were marked defaulters by the bank for not paying EMI on time. The gang members were extorting money over the phone after threatening them for legal action as well as dire consequences,” said Kamlesh Kumar, station house officer (SHO) of Sadar police.

One of the victims, identified as Santosh from Delhi, who failed to pay EMI of his loan time, said that he had paid Rs 2,500 via e-wallet to the gang, after one of the callers claimed himself to be sub-inspector of Delhi police. While Aryan of Indore said, “They claimed themselves to be lawyers, representing the bank and threatened with legal action if loan taken by mother was not paid on time. I somehow managed to gather the amount and paid it to the gang.”

“Posing themselves as policemen, lawyers and bank managers, the gang used to create an impression on customers that they were actually policemen or associated with police. The gang used to play app on smartphone which emitted sounds of police siren, walkie-talkie, police radio ringtone in the background etc. Even on the true-caller, the phone numbers of the gang were saved as SSP, police inspector, advocate, bank office and with other names,” the SHO said.

The SHO added, “Our investigation will now shift to bank’s involvement. We need to establish as how deep they are equally responsible for threat calls and extortion. Soon, we will lodge FIR against them, once the sufficient evidence is collected.”

He also called on all opposition members to unite and hit the streets to oppose the functioning of chief minister Pramod Sawant ’s government.

Sardesai said that Sawant should lead a delegation of state MLAs to Prime Minister Narendra Modi informing the Centre about the collateral damage that depletion of water flow in Mhadei will have on Goa’s economy and ecology.

“He should resign because there is no moral right for him to continue after he traded something that he calls his mother,” Sardesai said.

Former water resources minister Vinod Paliencar said the state government is allowing Karnataka to institutionalise and regularise the illegalities in the construction of the Kalasa Bandura project.

He said that the BJP was resorting to lies to portray Goa’s loss as a victory.

The primary and middle school were integrated two years back and thus the school has two teachers Jainarayan Ninama and Manish Malviya respectively. Ninama, however, who is a primary school teacher, is forced to teach all the students up to class eight. Malviya, a resident of Indore, allegedly managed to remain attached to the election commission office so that he won’t have to travel to Kushalgarh, 40 km from Indore, daily.

Ninama said that he asks all the students to sit together and manages their studies. Though he tries his best, the parents of students say that their studies were badly affected due to the absence of Malviya.

When contacted, Malviya said that he was working with the election office following the order of higher authorities and not on his own. He said about a week’s work is still remaining on his part.

Indore district panchayat CEO Neha Meena said she will take strict action if the teacher is found guilty and those shielding him will also face action.

Sources said Meena has asked her subordinates working for the education department to submit a detailed report on the matter.

Kolhapur: District guardian minister Satej Patil on Friday directed the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) to draw a plan for developing a truck terminus in the Tawade Hotel area of the city.

Patil, along with civic officials, visited the spaces identified by the KMC for parking of heavy vehicles. Currently, heavy vehicles — both trucks and private transport buses — are parking along the roads.

He visited the proposed site of truck terminus in the Tawade Hotel area, a bus terminus proposed at Shiroli Jakat Naka and the Gaddi Adda area near Venus Corner.

“KMC has acquired three-and-a-half acre space in the Tawade Hotel area to develop Truck Terminus. I have asked the municipal corporation to clean up the space and draw the plan to develop infrastructure. Around 100 trucks can be parked at the site. We are ready to provide funds for the same,” Patil said.

Patil also asked civic officials to clear the space near Shiroli Jakat Naka which can be used for parking private buses. He said that no heavy vehicle should enter the city. “I have asked the KMC to frame a time-bound plan to develop the infrastructure. In case of the Gaddi Adda area, there is need to shift the local shops to an alternate place. The site is proposed for multilevel building for parking of the cars of the visitors of Mahalaxmi temple. The traffic department should take up the lead to get the private transporters to park their buses at the Gaddi Adda area,” said Patil.

The KMC is likely to rope in private contractor to develop infrastructure for truck terminus. The public-private-partnership (PPP) model is likely to be adopted as the KMC lacks funds to develop and maintain the infrastructure. Private truck operators will be charged with parking fare to compensate for the infrastructure building costs. The private transporters catering to the nearby towns will also benefit from the truck terminus.

106,['22/02/2020'],Record of animal volunteers to help in case of emergency,"This story is from February 22, 2020

PUNE: An online open directory compiling information of animal volunteers across India was launched recently with the aim to uplift animal welfare. The directory, which is in the form of a website, makes it easy for people to register as and reach out to animal volunteers.

Entrepreneur Mayuri Jain, who conceptualised the directory, said the open directory of animal volunteers in India would provide an exhaustive database to citizens committed to making animals lives better. “Anyone requiring help in a district can get in touch with a volunteer from their area. The volunteers are not necessarily from any group or animal welfare organizations. They range from people who simply feed the animals in their building to those that engage with governments to change policy. The purpose of the website is to create an army of compassion towards animals,” Jain said.

Jain met Maneka Gandhi in New Delhi around a month ago while she was working with an adoption facility. “During our conversation, she had suggested that I should do something to bring together animal volunteers,” she said, while recalling how the idea germinated.

She added that many times animal-related emergencies happened on the road and nobody is able to help them. “A lot of animal lovers can help the common people, but they normally call the animal centres or municipal authorities seeking help. Each centre has its own limitations in terms of occupancy, limited funds, etc. Even if they are willing, they are unable to help. By the time they reach the site, the emergency is already over because you can’t predict whether the animal would still be there a half-hour after the calamity. Citizens can have the data on their fingertips through the open directory,” she said.

In the five days since the website launch, around 12,000 volunteers have registered from across 27 states. An interactive map shows users every registered volunteer from the Indian subcontinent. In one day alone, over 50 people from Pune registered as volunteers. “It’s a community of people wanting to volunteer and give their time. No professional qualifications are required to be a volunteer,” Jain said.

Khargone: On the lines of Chhindwara’s corn festival, a chilli festival will be organized at Kasrawad town of Khargone district on February 29 and March 1 to establish Nimari hot chilli as a brand.

In a review meeting held recently at Kasrawad with officials of Bhopal directorate, Indore, Ujjain division and local chilli traders, agriculture minister Sachin Yadav said that Nimari hot chilli was not only recognized in the country but all over the world. Due to lack of technical knowledge of chilli cultivation, farmers do not get the desired production, so technical information and regular branding of their products is order of the day.

Talking to reporters, he said the department’s efforts were to brand the crops which are famous for their quality and are in demand in the country and abroad.

During the technical session, he said that scientists from various institutions would give special attention to repel microbial and pest attacks on Nimari chilli.

District collector GC Daad said the festival is being organised to increase the production, provide economic benefits to farmers and to make them aware of the technical aspects. The government is trying to establish Khargone as the chilli capital of north India.

He said now cotton is slowly becoming stable, but Khargone farmers have set record prices and production of chilli. Hence, it was necessary that chilli gets adequate market. The government will try to establish chilli industries and processing units here so that companies can buy their produce directly from farmers, he said.

Khargone is the one of the largest chilli producing districts with 60,000 metric tonne production in 23,000 hectares. Bedia Krishi Mandi of the district is the second-largest chilli market in Asia.

Kozhikode: A coastal bridge , coming up at Kottakkal in the district, will be designed as a fitting tribute to Kunhali Marakkar , who was the naval chief of Kozhikode Zamorin .

The bridge is named after Kunhali Marakkar as it is situated near the ancestral home of Marakkars. The tourism department is also set to convert the ancestral home of the naval chief into a monument.

“The public works department (PWD) has designed the bridge as swords to commemorate the warrior and all other legendary warriors from Kadathanadu,” said P B Baiju, assistant executive engineer of PWD (NH division). The swords designed on the bridge will reflect the tradition of Kalarippayattu and warriors from Kadathanad, including Unniyarcha, said Baiju.

Kunhali Marakkar bridge is one of the two major bridges that are part of the coastal highway in the district. Total length of the coastal highway in Kozhikode is 78km. The design work was completed by the design, research, investigation and quality (DRIQ) wing of the PWD, he said.

The Kunhalimarakkar Bridge connects Vadakara sandbanks with Kottakkal, said Baiju. The total length of the bridge across the Kuttiady river is 547 metres, he said.

The NH division of the PWD has already submitted a detailed project report (DPR) for the Kunhali Marakkar bridge and are soon expecting approval for it.

As per the project report, the bridge will be designed in such a way that solar panels affixed along the walls will help produce electricity worth at least Rs 27 lakh per year.

According to officials with NH division, the innovative design will highlight the history of the region, thus attracting tourists.

While the bridge at Kottakkal is designed on swords, the bridge at Beypore is modelled on a shipping vessel to highlight the tradition and history of these two locations, said an official with the NH division. Both the bridges will be scenic attactions to the tourists, he said.

110,['22/02/2020'],Kathgodam-Nainital highway to remain closed till March 7 for maintenance work,"This story is from February 22, 2020

Nainital: The Nainital district administration has said that the Kathgodam-Nainital national highway (NH-87) will remain closed from February 22 till March 7 due to road-broadening work.

Speaking to TOI, Nainital district magistrate (DM) Savin Bansal said that at some parts, the road is too narrow and the Public Works Department (PWD) has been asked to widen it. “The road is too narrow near the Bedhiya Pakhad area which can cause an accident anytime. Therefore, the PWD is going to start working on the stretch to increase its width. As a safety measure, the motor road will remain closed from 10 am to 5 pm,” Bansal said.

He added that the entire project is expected to take at least two weeks to finish and, therefore, the road will be opened for public only on March 7. “We know that several tourists use the highway to travel from Kathgodam to Nainital. Hence, tourists would be diverted through Bhimtal. However, after 5pm, the road will be open for public use,” he said.

Notably, several tourists come to Nainital from the Kaladhungi side but because trains terminate at Kathgodam railway station and the buses from Delhi also come to Haldwani, NH-89 is the preferred route for most tourists to come to the lake town.

If tourists are routed through Bhimtal, it will add another 10 km to the route. Hoteliers agreed that the work will be an inconvenience for a few days but added that it won’t affect the overall tourist footfall. “Once the road is broadened, it will ease the traffic flow on the route and will benefit us in the next tourist season. We just want the administration to ensure that the quality of the road is maintained,” a Nainital-based hotelier said.

Sharad Pawar

PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The Vishwa Hindu Parishad on Friday demanded action against NCP chief Sharad Pawar and All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen leader Waris Pathan for their recent alleged controversial statements.

Addressing a news conference in Pimpri, Milind Parande, the national secretary of the VHP , said, “Supreme Court has not mentioned anything about formation of a trust for the construction of the mosque (in Ayodhya ).” So, Pawar’s demand to set up a trust for the construction of the mosque was unnecessary and inappropriate, he said.

Pawar, the NCP chief, recently said why the Union government had not set up a trust for the construction of the mosque when it constituted a trust for the Ram temple construction at Ayodhya.

Parande said AMIM leader Pathan’s statement in Gulbarga about 15 crore minority community members outweighing the majority community was a hollow threat.

VHP will take out huge rath yatras from March 20 to April 8 to reach two lakh villages across the country to mark the Supreme Court verdict in the Ram Janmabhoomi case. He also demanded action against cases of anti-national slogans raised during the anti-CAA protests in different parts of the country.

Parande said there were no hard feelings for the omission of the VHP from the Ram temple trust. “They (trust members) are working for the same aim of constructing the Ram temple. We shall cooperate with them,” he said.

He said a nationwide awareness campaign about the CCA would be conducted in the country and all India meeting of Bajrang Dal would be held in Chinchwad on February 22 and 23.

113,['22/02/2020'],Trump visit: AMC begins scientific treatment at drain near Taj to remove foul smell,"This story is from February 22, 2020

Agra: The Agra Municipal Corporation (AMC) on Friday started phytoremediation process to reduce foul smell emitting from a major drain located just 200 metres from the east side of the historical monument ahead of the high-profile visit of US President Donald Trump and First lady Melania Trump. This is the first time the technique is being used to clean any drain in Uttar Pradesh.

Phytoremediation is the direct use of living green plants for in situ, or in place, removal, degradation, or containment of contaminants in soils, sludges, sediments, surface water and groundwater. The process takes 72 hours to remove any foul smell from the time it is implemented.

Additional municipal commissioner KB Singh, who is supervising the cleaning of the drain, said, “Deep cleaning of the drain is taking place on priority basis. We are scientifically treating the area using phytoremediation technique which will show results within 72 hours. Besides reducing the stench, it will also help us to keep pollution in check from the drain.”

The civic body decided to implement this method after CM Yogi expressed discontent over unbearable stench in the vicinity of Taj Mahal while taking stock of preparedness for the high-profile visit on Tuesday.

Mayor Naveen Kumar Jain had informed the CM that the stench comes from the drain on the east side of the main mausoleum following which the CM had issued orders to get time-bound solution of the problem.

The US first couple is expected to enter the Taj complex from the east gate.

Rajiv Rathi, AMC executive engineer (environment), said, “In the phytoremediation process, microbes consume the organic mass of the wastewater and utilize nutrients from sewage for their growth, thereby enhancing the cleaning action. The process also helps reduce biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) in sewage and checks odour.”

The Taj east gate drain, with a catchment area of approximately 815 hectares, is primarily a storm water drain which passes through the Tajganj area. The 4.4km-long drain has over the years been reduced to carrying untreated waste water and sewage from several settlements upstream to the Yamuna river. Five more drains located at Pathak Press, Katra Jogidas, Sevaram and Kapoor Galli, Gudiyai Mandi and Sanjay Colony and Taj Khema also merge into it after Kullayee sewage pumping station, with sewage being dumped directly into Yamuna.

The stench from the untreated waste greets visitors to the mausoleum and creates unhygienic living conditions for the residents nearby. Local residents complained that deep cleaning of the drain has not been done at least in a decade.

114,['22/02/2020'],Kolhapur to soon raise Miyawaki forest,"This story is from February 22, 2020

Kolhapur: The Kolhapur and Sangli districts are set to get man-made forests under the Miyawaki Forest Project.

The technique comprises testing the fertility and water-holding capacity of the soil before the plantation activity is undertaken. Dr Akira Miyawaki, a famous Japanese botanist, found about this artificial forest cultivation process after 60 years of research on the natural forests.

Saplings planted by this method grow 10 times faster and are low on maintenance after two-three years of care. Around 1,600 saplings were recently completed in Sangli district and a similar plantation drive is likely to be held in Kolhapur shortly.

“In this process, the soil where plantation is to be carried out is first tested after which a 1-meter-deep pit is dug where a mixture of rice, wheat skin, coco peat, compost and Jeevamrut (organic manure) is mixed and added to the soil. The sapling is then planted on this organic bed,” Harshad Diwekar, coordinator of the Miyawaki Forest Project in Sangli, said.

“The saplings are planted close to each other. Hence, while growing these plants compete against each other to grow taller in order to get more sunlight. This fastens their growth by 10 times in comparison to the ordinary process. Using this process, a forest is created within 30 to 40 years where the natural process takes around three hundred years,” he added.

Ravi Kempwade, contractor for the project in Sangli, said, “The plantation project in Sangli was undertaken at Chivte colony in Miraj by the Sangli Municipal Corporation and was implemented by Nature Conservation Society of Sangli. Around 100 volunteers contributed in the plantation drive,” he added.

Only Indigenous plants were planted during this drive. Vivek Kuber, a volunteer, said, “Plants such as hirda, behda, fig, jamun, mango, ritha, golden shower, sesame, pongame oil tree, palash, indica, aden apple, jackfruit, among others, were selected so that they can attract birds, butterflies and honey-bees in large numbers. Sangli plantation activity is now complete and now the plantation drive for Kolhapur is at primary stage. It will soon be undertaken with the help of KMC and environment lovers.”

Panaji: Congress has alleged that the reservation exercise for the zilla panchayat polls has been manipulated to favour BJP.

“How could the BJP government reserve 30 out of 50 seats, leaving only 20 to be fought in the general category,” questioned state Congress president Girish Chodankar.

Instead of following the reservation of seats on rotation basis, the government has done it as per the whims and fancies of the BJP leaders, he alleged. Congress has charged that the exercise has been done to ensure that its “strong winning candidates” cannot contest. He also said Congress stronghold constituencies such as Benaulim, Velim and Calangute have been reserved for OBC candidates after knowing that its candidates would sweep the polls.

Stating that there is no level-laying field, Chodankar said that Curtorim, where his party’s state committee secretary is the sitting zilla member, has been reserved for women, while Aldona, Taleigao and Penha de Franca have been reserved for women OBC.

He also alleged that Pale has been deliberately designated as a ST seat to make it easy for CM Pramod Sawant to get his candidate elected. Pale falls in Sakhali constituency represented by Sawant.

Kolhapur: A proposal sent by the Kolhapur police for establishing a commissionerate in the city is under consideration, minister of state for home Satej Patil, who is also guardian minister of Kolhapur district, said.

“The state government will take up the issue on a priority and look into the technicalities to clear the proposal,” Patil told TOI.

As per the proposal sent by Kolhapur police, a total of 13 police stations, including four from Kolhapur city, would be included in the commissionerate. Police have already identified the space for it at Golibar maidan in the city.

“The commissionerate will help in keeping a check on the steadily rising criminal activities in Kolhapur city and Ichalkaranji. Once approved, there will be increased staff of around 1,200 police personnel. This will ultimately help in keeping a check on crime,” said a senior police officer on condition of anonymity.

The government is expected to take a step in the same direction, the recent incidents of police busting ganja nexus, arresting criminals involved in these type of narcotics, the prevalent of an inter-state gang in the district, illegal private money lending business, etc indicate that the local criminals have developed network with the gangs from other parts of the country.

Police stations like Karveer, Gokul Shrigaon MIDC, Gandhinagar, Shiroli MIDC and all the police stations from Hatkanangle taluka except for Peth Vadgaon which include Gavbhag, Shivaji Nagar police stations from Ichalkaranji, Shahapur, Hatkananagle, and Hupari will be included in the Commissionerate.

117,['22/02/2020'],Index II extract of old buildings to go online in Pune,"This story is from February 22, 2020

Representative image

PUNE: Citizens planning to invest in Pune-based properties registered between 1990 and 2002 will soon be able to search for their detailed ‘ Index II extract ’ online as the registration department has decided to upload this data on its website by July this year.

The Index II extract is a document that a person gets after registering the document of immovable property. It is the official document of transaction recorded in the records of registering authority, confirming the completion of the transaction.

For the Pune properties registered from 2002 onwards, this data is already available on the IGR website. “In Mumbai, the data of the old properties is available as a part of e-search facility. The same will be replicated in Pune before covering the entire state,” IGR Omprakash Deshmukh said.

Registration department officials said the data was earlier checked manually. With the hiring of additional staffers as data entry operators, the work of uploading the detailed Index II extract should be completed soon, they said.

Once the online facility for old properties is in place, citizens would no longer have to depend on real estate agents to procure certified hard copies of property transactions. It would also help in checking the possibility of cheating as the buyers would be able to check the transaction history of a particular property before investing in it.

The feature would be made available under the eSearch facility on the official website (igrmaharashtra.gov.in) of the inspector general of registration (IGR).

“If a person is interested in purchasing a property anywhere in Pune, s/he just need to know its city survey number (or the Milkat number or the plot number) and the concerned revenue village. Entering these details on the IGR website will throw up the property’s transaction history,” another official of the registration department said.

Citizens feel that the move would help buyers wishing to invest in old properties. “I recently sold my flat, which was registered in 2000. I had to employ a lawyer for getting the e-search of the property done. Once the search facility for old properties is available, the entire process would become easier,’’ a Kondhwa resident said.

A lawyer, who helps citizens register their properties, said for these old properties, one had to sit with the sub-registrar’s office for hours to check for the data manually. “It is good that they are uploading the data online. This will help citizens,’’ he added.

PANAJI: The several thousands who showed up at Azad Maidan in Panaji on Friday to protest against CAA, NPR and NRC pledged not to furnish “any information whatsoever for the purposes of NPR or even for the purpose of Census 2021” till all three are withdrawn.

The grounds couldn’t contain the massive crowd that climbed up trees and spilled on to streets and in front of the police headquarters, making it the largest anti CAA-NPR-NRC protest the state has witnessed till date. Speakers included students from JNU and lawyers from Assam and Delhi, who spoke about police brutality on college campuses and termed the CAA, NPR and NRC as tools to persecute minorities.

Despite the Church supporting the protest and sending out letters to all parish priests and chaplains to mobilise people for the rally, no Church representative featured among the speakers.

The Goa Alliance Against CAA, NRC and NPR, which organised the rally, stressed on the large number of OCI card holders in the state who have surrendered their Indian citizenship for Portuguese citizenship and noted the apprehension over “arbitrary grounds for cancellation of OCI registration”. Activist and advocate Albertina Almeida said there was no assurance that OCI cards wouldn’t be cancelled.

The lethal combination of CAA, NPR and NRC could render some citizens stateless encouraging land grab, which is affecting the marginalised sections of society, the alliance stated in their resolution to oppose it. Stating that CAA, NPR and NRC go against the principles of justice, equality, secularism, socialism and democracy on which Constitution was founded, the meeting began with the reading of the Preamble. B R Amedkar’s photograph was displayed during the meeting.

Activist Arturo D’Souza urged participants to teach those MLAs who defected to the BJP and who have supported the CAA, a lesson in the next election.

Dalit activist Dadu Mandrekar, who was one of the speakers, said the central government was trying to destroy the Constitution and expressed uncertainty about the rights of the GAKUVED (Gawda, Kunbi, Velip and Dhangar) community, many of whom don’t have proper documentation. Julio Aguiar appealed to deputy chief minister Chandrakant Kavalekar, tribal minister Govind Gaude and tourism minister Manohar Ajgaonkar on the issue, while activist Rama Kanconkar said it was a shame that tribal leaders were assuring tribals in Goa that they would not be affected by the CAA, NPR and NRC.

“Lakhs of people surveyed in Assam have been sent to detention centres,” advocate of the Guwahati high court, A S Tapader, said. Jamia Milia Islamia student Ayesha Renna spoke about police brutality on campus.

PhD candidate at JNU, whose research focuses on Dalit movements and leadership, Rahul Sonpimple said the CAA-NPR-NRC movement is not only anti-Muslim, but anti-Dalit. Advocate Nabila Hasan from Delhi said the purpose of the CAA-NPR-NRC was only to persecute minorities. Hasan filed a PIL seeking Rs 1 crore compensation over the December 15 police brutality at JNU.

Former revenue minister Rohan Khaunte, leader of opposition Digambar Kamat, Congress state president Girish Chodankar, AAP functionary Valmiki Naik and former mayor of Corporation of the City of Panaji Surendra Furtado were present.

NEW DELHI: Congress Friday welcomed US President Donald Trump’s upcoming visit to India as continuation of strategic partnership between the two countries but added that it should yield concrete results for the hosts. It warned that the visit should not become an extension of US presidential election “like Howdy Modi event”.

Addressing a press conference, AICC spokesman Anand Sharma said there are issues with the US having withdrawn the General System of Preference (GSP) status to India, having declared India a developed country and reducing the number of H1B visas. He said restoration of social security to Indian professionals visiting the US is also an agenda item.

He expressed hope that Prime Minister Narendra Modi would take up these issues with President Trump.

“There should be gravitas, seriousness and depth in Trump’s visit as well as tangible outcomes on substantive issues,” Sharma said.

The Congress spokesman said the US President’s visit should not become like “Howdy Modi” rally in Texas where Trump and Indian PM addressed a gathering together.

“This visit should not become an extension of the US presidential campaign for the Indian diaspora. We do not become active party in the polls in another country.” This mistake was made in Texas at the ‘Howdy Modi’ event and the PM ought to be careful as these are setting wrong precedents,” he said.

SECUNDERABAD: Volunteers at Umamaheshwari temple in Sainikpuri ensured Mahashivratri celebrations were plastic-free. Devotees were not allowed to take plastic covers and sachets into the temple. Many were appreciative of the move.

Medha M, who has been behind the ‘Fenko MaTt’ (don’t litter) campaign in the area, was actively involved in the effort. “Religious practices are closely related with water bodies,” said Medha. “Traditionally, puja samagri (offerings) is put into the water to ensure that people don’t stamp on it. But with the introduction of plastic, non-biodegradable substances have made their way into water bodies, choking them.” She said simple flower garlands too have plastic decoration on them, making it tough to segregate.

Medha said, “A group of 20 volunteers asked devotees to leave plastic outside. We provided them reusable bamboo baskets to hold their items.” She bought about 100 baskets for the occasion.

Deepa Shailendra, a Sainikpuri resident, said, “People were asked to avoid plastic sachets to hold their haldi and kumkum and instead use paper. Steel utensils were provided at the temple for pujas.”

Volunteers could be seen nudging devotees to dispose off waste in correct bins placed in the temple complex, with even young children actively involved in the process.

“Three large sacks of plastic were collected. We want to take this message to other temples in the next year. We also hope that flower sellers start using paper for packing,” said Deepa. The plastic would be handed to a waste aggregator from where it would be sent for recycling.

Suryanarayana M, who was among the volunteers, said, “Far from being offended, people were apologetic. There is awareness on the issue, but this must translate into practice.”

Panaji: Waste management minister Michael Lobo said the Goa Waste Management Corporation has set a two-year target to complete the three solid waste treatment plants at Cacora, Baiguinim and Verna.

The minister said that the process to set up the solid waste treatment plant at Bainguinim is on track while the construction of a similar treatment plant at Cacora has already begun.

Lobo said that the expression of interest for the proposed waste treatment plant at Bainguinim would be issued in the coming week.

A month earlier, the department headed by Lobo floated an expression of interest to select an agency to conduct the rapid environment impact assessment for a waste treatment plant at Verna.

“A small garbage treatment plant at Vasco will be setup to treat wet waste till the Verna plant comes up,” Lobo said.

On the show cause notices issued to certain village panchayats, Lobo said that the notices were issued based on the directions of the high court bench.

He said that segregation machines will be installed at Campal and Mapusa to treat legacy waste which remains piled up.

124,['22/02/2020'],Pune: Scientists develop miniature flow reactors,"This story is from February 22, 2020

PUNE: The CSIR-National Chemical Laboratory has developed miniature glass-coated flow reactors with high performance and better compatibility with chemicals in a lesser space.

Such reactors will be used to manufacture agrochemicals and in pharmaceutical sectors, mostly in terms of handling halogenated reactants, intermediates and related products.

Already equipped with US and European patents, the scientists who developed the miniature version said the new reactors would probably be half the cost of the variety currently available in the market.

The NCL on Monday signed a licencing agreement with GMM-Pfaudler Ltd for the design, engineering, fabrication and marketing of the precision reactors.

Amol Kulkarni, one of the lead scientists of the project, said, “At present, the flow reactors’ market is largely dominated by multinational companies. The existing micro and flow reactors are available in metals, polymers, glass and ceramic. The metal reactors need to be coated with an alloy so that it does not react with chemicals. Alloy is costly so even the reactor is high-priced. Reactors can get damaged under too much pressure or extreme temperature changes if only glass is used. However, the glass-coated micro-reactor will not face these problems.”

Kulkarni, Vivek Ranade and a team of scientists worked for six years on the project. Kulkarni explained its uses beyond its compatibility with corrosive chemicals. “The reaction happens in the glass-coated miniature channels. It means a continuous reaction will occur that will be 1/10th or 1/20th of the size of the bulky batch reactors. This smaller size will also ensure better heat dissipation, which will ensure better safety standards.”

AGRA: Taj Mahal will remain closed for the general public from 12 pm on Monday for the US President Donald Trump’s visit . A battery-operated golf cart or an electric bus will take Trump to the monument’s East Gate from hotel Oberoi Amarvilas, where he will arrive straight from the airport.

These decisions were taken on Friday during a high level meeting attended by the advanced security liaison team comprising MEA, IB, MHA, CIA, and ASI, CISF officials, DM and Agra SSP. According to officials, the earlier plan was to take the US President to Taj in his personal limousine ‘The Beast’, but it was decided against it in view of the Supreme Court order which disallows vehicles within a distance of 500 metres from the East Gate of the monument.

According to an ASI official, while battery operated open golf cart was used by Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, eco-friendly bus was provided to former French President Nicolas Sarkozy and British royal couple Prince William and Kate Middleton. He said that both vehicles have been prepared and will ply according to their wishes.

Besides, the district administration has shortlisted three hospitals in Agra, including SN Medical College for emergency purposes. A private hospital in Mathura has also been selected by the US officials for services, if needed.

President Trump would travel a distance of 10.5 km from Kheria airport to Taj Mahal, via Eidgah crossing, Tank crossing, GPO, ASI crossing, TDI mall, Shilpgram and Taj Mahal. The entire stretch would be lined up by 25,000 schoolchildren and nearly 4,000 folk artists, who will perform to welcome the visiting star couple.

ASI superintending archaeologist (Agra circle) Vasant K Swarankar said that US President Trump is expected to spend an hour at the Taj Mahal after arriving in Agra at 4.30pm and would see the monument of love with his family members at sunset. He would leave for Delhi at 6.45pm.

He will walk along the right pathway of the fountain after entering from the Royal Gate, said an official, adding that special shoe cover designed for VVIPs will be provided to them for walking into the main mausoleum.

A three-tier security structure comprising the US Secret Service, NSG and ATS commandos and more than 6,000 UP police personnel will be in place for the US President’s security, according to officials.

PANAJI: The department of ports has moved 30 proposals to the Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) seeking Rs 50 crore from the ministry of shipping under the national waterways project to build small jetties across the state and start fast passenger ferries.

Ports minister Michael Lobo on Friday said most of the proposals moved by the department are for small jetties in villages so that fast passenger ferries can connect the villages to the towns.

“Around Rs 50 crore will be required for the projects , but if it is more than that, the state government does not mind spending. The main tender has to be floated by IWAI. More than 100 small ferries can come up in Goa,” said Lobo.

He asked the minister of state for shipping Mansukh Mandaviya to approve the proposals moved by the state. The ports minister spoke about a comprehensive waterway transport plan to push inland water transport.

Under the centre ’s Sagarmala programme, nine jetties that will exclusively be used for passenger carriages and vessels conducting cruises for tourists are proposed in the state. These are apart from the four floating jetties proposed under the waterways project.

Jetties have been proposed for Old Goa, Banastarim, Borim, Shiroda, Durbhat, Cortalim, Aldona, Bicholim and Ribandar at a cost of Rs 76 crore. The four floating jetties will cost Rs 9.6 crore and the Centre will be funding all these projects.

“Fast ferries to connect Vasco and Panaji will be started. Goan businessmen who want to invest in this are welcome first,” he said adding, Goan youth should start passenger ferry services in the state with the help of the ports department.

“Unemployed youth can take a loan and buy these passenger ferries. We will register them and connect the rivers of Goa. We will give them all the places where our floating jetties will come up,” Lobo said.

Kozhikode: City corporation authorities will take up major developmental works of the crematoriums in its limits by availing the funds of Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board ( KIIFB ).

The corporation has invited the expression of interest seeking the services of an experienced consultancy to prepare a detailed project report to submit it to KIIFB to obtain its fund.

The civic body has initiated plans to switch over it to gas-operated crematoriums and to improve the infrastructure facilities of all the existing crematoriums. It had already commissioned the gas-operated crematorium at Mavoor road.

It will submit the DPR (detailed project report) to KIIFB to ensure funds for the revamping works.

It has begun the official process to switch over to gas-operated crematorium after directions from the state government last year to go for eco-friendly crematorium across the state which is free from smoke and smell. It also aims to bring down the maintenance and operation cost of the crematoriums and to put an end to the public complaints about pollution of the surrounding areas owing to the traditional burial process.

Civic body had commissioned the gas-operated crematorium at Mavoor road last year. Works to set up gas-operated crematoriums at other crematoriums situated at Gotheeswaram, Mankavu, West Hill and Puthiyapalam at a cost of Rs 1 crore under its annual plan for the financial year have been progressing on a war footing.

Bhopal: Kashi-Mahakal Express arrived at Sant Hirdaram Nagar (Bairagarh) on Friday on its maiden run from Indore to Varanasi. IRCTC officials have made it clear that there is no plan to add Bhopal station as its halt in the future. Passengers demanded that the train should have a halt at Bhopal station too.

The Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) operated third train between Varanasi and Indore (Kashi Mahakal Express). The train began its first commercial run from Thursday. The new Kashi Mahakal Express will connect three places -- Jyotirlinga-Omkareshwar (near Indore), Mahakaleshwar (Ujjain) and Kashi Vishwanath (Varanasi in UP).

This train will halt at Ujjain, Sant Hirdaram Nagar, Bina, Jhansi, Kanpur and Allahabad stations in both directions but Bhopal station is not included. IRCTC’s DGM (hospitality), Pinakin K Morawal said, “There is no plan to add Bhopal station with Kashi-Mahakal Express. It will consume extra time,” said Morawal.

Passenger felt that the train should have a stoppage at Bhopal station. “Sant Hirdaram nagar station is a small station. Besides, the station is far for the people living in Arera Colony. I am surprised that such an important train was not given halt at Bhopal station,” said Anuj Sinha, a banker.

Another passenger, Sita Sahay said, “I am told that it is a fantastic train connecting three Jyotirlingas. I look forward to visiting all these places. However, there is no stoppage at Bhopal station, which is very disappointing.”

Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court has ordered the state government to conduct physical test of a pregnant woman candidate for Lok Rakshad Dal (LRD) job three months after her delivery, if she succeeds in her claim to have made to the final merit list.

The high court has issued notice seeking reply from the government and LRD Board by March 27. It said, “In the facts of the case, it is observed that if the petitioner is able to establish her case finally, it will be open for the petitioner to seek and the respondents will be obliged to conduct physical test of the petitioner and permit the petitioner to participate in the entire process of selection.”

In this case, one Parulben Rajput has sought directions to LRD Board to permit her to undergo the physical test after three months of the delivery, as she is six-month pregnant. Physical test is conducted of those candidates who figure in the final list.

Rajput approached the HC after she was turned down by the examiners, when she appeared in the test as a pregnant woman on December 27, 2019. She requested for keeping a seat vacant for her till her selection process gets over.

The petitioner submitted that she did not figure in the first merit list when the cut-off marks were 47 for general category women. But following a litigation, there is a change in cut-off marks and it rendered her eligible for the next stage of recruitment.

The petitioner said that when she did not figure in the merit list, she lost all hopes for getting a call letter and planned and conceived a baby. She has conceived twins, and now is six-month pregnant. She is eligible for the physical test but considering her advanced pregnancy, running for 1,600 metre was impossible and life-threatening for her and her babies.

Aurangabad: The Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) has written to the central and state government authorities that the Medical Council of India (MCI) norms making 80% attendance mandatory was depriving them of their legitimate leaves.

MARD’s state general secretary Vijay Pawar told TOI that this was particularly the case with women doctors going on maternity leave. While women doctors are eligible for six months’ maternity leave, many of them end up losing a term for not fulfilling the attendance criteria or else they cut short this leave and get back to work. Several women doctors also postpone their plans to have children, he said.

Often, resident doctors treating TB patients also get infected with the disease, for which six months’ rest and treatment is required, Pawar said. However, many of them cut short their leave for fear of losing a term, he claimed.

The postgraduate medical studies lasting three years is divided into six terms. Though the respective heads of department assure that they will get 20 days’ leave each year, the resident doctors claim that the shortage of medicos forces them to surrender this leave. Pawar said the residents do not get weekly offs and work on public holidays too.

Maharashtra has 4,378 resident doctors, out of which 2,278 serve with the 19 medical colleges and hospitals in the state.

Pawar, who is pursuing his PG in ENT from SRTR medical college, Ambajogai, said a senior resident doctor recently lost a term after contracting multi drug resistant (MDR) TB, which requires six months of rest and treatment. He cited several examples of other residents cutting short their maternity as well as TB leaves to save their terms.

A woman medico said that despite taking three months’ maternity leave, instead of six, her term was extended. Another woman resident doctor, fearing losing a term, returned to work barely 40 days after delivering her child.

PANAJI: An international training institute for those aspiring to work aboard cruise liners will be set up in Goa in partnership with an international cruise line, minister of state for shipping Mansukh Mandaviya said on Friday.

Inaugurating India’s first floating jetty , setup in Panaji, Mandaviya also announced that Goan seafarers would benefit from a one-time amnesty scheme for seafarers who had secured qualification certificates without attending training.

“I have spoken to chief minister Pramod Sawant about this. I will open one centre in Goa where Costa Victoria will set-up an institute to train youngster and with that training they will get certification to work on international cruises,” the minister said.

Stating that 10,000 jobs are up for grabs in the maritime cruise sector, Mandaviya said Goa needs to develop the maritime sector, which will in turn drive economic growth and employment generation.

Meanwhile, speaking on the occasion, Sawant said, “We are starting with more certificate courses at the marine institute. The Union minister has announced a new institute and this is another opportunity for Goans. Certified courses are important.”

Mandaviya also spoke to Sawant and ports minister Michael Lobo, discussing ways to propel adoption of passenger ferries and waterways transport.

“Congestion on roads, trains and at airports has increased. The best solution is to develop the waterways. This can both, generate economic activity and improve ease of living,” the minister said after inaugurating the jetty.

The new jetty has been built by Marinetek India as per a contract for four floating jetties that will come up in Goa under the national waterways project.

“Floating concrete jetties are the need of the hour for India’s waterways. In the CRZ regime, it is a long, tedious and expensive process to construct fixed concrete piled jetties. Floating concrete jetties, on the other hand, are eco-friendly, with no permanent intrusions in the river or the seabed. Hence, they can be ordered and installed quickly, without the need to wait for formal CRZ sanctions,” Marinetek India, managing director, Gautama Dutta said.

The government plans to commission the remaining three floating jetties in the next three months while the ports department will also prepare a comprehensive plan for waterway connectivity.

Bhopal: A day after the national archives’ team inspected the truck load of Nawab-era documents seized by the crime branch three days ago, cops on Friday registered a case against the two Gujarat-based businessmen under relevant sections of The Antiquities and Art Treasures Act.

ASP (crime branch) Nishchal Jharia said that team from national archives visited the crime branch to check the documents. Their report states that documents sold as scrap were as old as 1858, and some of the documents match the series of erstwhile Bhopal Nawab’s documents available at national archives. Jharia said that accused Bhavik Barod, a resident of Ahmedabad, and Vipul Mehta, a resident of Morbi in Gujarat, had violated many sections of The Antiquities and Art Treasures Act by purchasing these artefacts.

Crime branch had seized the truck load filled with the documents on Tuesday when they were being taken to Gujarat. Cops detained the two Gujarat-based collectors, who had purchased the documents as scrap from an heir of Nawab family for Rs 1 lakh. The goods seized include letters, hand-drawn maps, invitations, two lamps, a metal calendar and other documents. The detained men told the crime branch sleuths that they collect letters and documents having autographs and monograms of erstwhile kings and nawabs. They claimed that they are members of Gujarat Coin Society and organise exhibitions of their collections all over the country.

Police said that the accused had purchased scrap from Nawab’s heirs earlier too. In 2014, they had purchased the items through a middleman, but recently, they contacted the Nawab family directly.

PANAJI: Goa government will file an application in the Supreme Court to restrain Karnataka government from taking up any works to divert Mhadei water, said chief minister Pramod Sawant.

This comes in the wake of reports that Karnataka will move to commence work on its drinking water projects by diverting water from Mhadei following the apex court’s interim order on Thursday.

In the order, the Supreme Court had directed the Centre to notify the Mhadei Water Disputes Tribunal’s final award of August 14, 2018.

“Within three to four days, we will file an application in the apex court so that Karnataka is not granted any permission for carrying out works even as the Mhadei award is notified,” Sawant told reporters on Friday.

Though it will take a few months before the award is finalised, Sawant said, as an immediate response, the government is approaching the apex court so that Karnataka is not granted further permissions.

He said the government is seeking opinions from legal experts on the matter.

Karnataka has been diverting water illegally, even as there has been no control mechanism installed yet to measure the diverted water. “I accepted this in the House that Karnataka has diverted water illegally,” he said.

A legal officer of the government also accepted that the government’s move to file an application is a precautionary measure, taken in view of Karnataka’s history. “We don’t want it to go ahead with its illegal water diversion,” he said.

Goa’s petition challenging the Mhadei tribunal’s award in part, is also pending before the apex court.

Sawant took on the opposition for criticising his government over the Mhadei issue. He said the Supreme Court directing the Centre to notify the award doesn’t mean that Karnataka has won.

“On the Mhadei issue, the government and opposition should be together, but it is not so,” he said.

Reiterating that his government is firm on its stand on the Mhadei issue, Sawant said the final verdict will be in the favour of Goa. The case will be heard in July when a final verdict is expected.

BAREILLY: A 20-year-old man, who was detained by police for questioning since February 17, was found hanging from a Ficus tree outside Hyderabad police station in UP’s Lakhimpur Kheri district on Friday. His family alleged that he was “murdered” while SSP Kheri Poonam, dismissing all allegations, claimed that he committed suicide. The man’s elder brother also alleged that “a married woman was after his brother and was forcibly trying to live with him”.

An autopsy has been conducted in Lakhimpur city and the report is still awaited. The man’s family has now demanded an FIR against guilty officials for “murder”. But, police registered an FIR under IPC section 306 (abetment of suicide).

Identified as Vivek Kumar Verma , the deceased man was a resident of Raipur village and, according to sources, was earlier charged by police under section 498 (enticing or taking away or detaining with criminal intent a married woman) of IPC in non-cognizable report (NCR) registered by one Anjali’s husband, Mukesh. The 27-year-old woman apparently went missing around 10 days ago and later Vivek brought her to Hyderabad police station where the police detained him on February 17. Then, Anjali was sent to her parents while Vivek was kept in custody. According to sources, there was an extra-marital affair between the two for past few months.

After Vivek’s death, both Anjali and Mukesh were taken into police custody. According to FIR registered by police, Vivek’s elder brother Sandeep Verma had alleged that Anjali and Mukesh had deliberately lodged a fake complaint against his brother. The FIR stated that Vivek used to work in a private company in Noida and is said to have met Anjali at Shahjahanpur railway station. Anjali had reportedly come to Noida to meet him on her own and Vivek returned to Lakhimpur to drop Anjali who was “adamant to live with him”.

“After the woman fled from her husband’s house, we ensured that she was brought back to Hyderabad police station on February 17. Police had released the woman but refused to release my brother. I used to visit the police station twice a day to give him food. On Friday morning, my brother called me from a mobile number and he asked me to visit the police station immediately. When I reached within two hours, I was told that my brother had committed suicide. But, how can my brother move out of police custody and commit suicide at a place nearly 70m away from police station and where did he get the rope from? There are many unanswered questions which suggest that my brother was killed,” Sandeep told TOI.

In her official statement, SSP Poonam stated, “We have registered an FIR under section 306 on the compliant of the deceased’s elder brother. Investigation is currently on.”

While Dharamdas Siddharth , the SHO at Hyderabad police station, told TOI, “Vivek was named in an NCR registered at our police station and he committed suicide on Friday morning because he was troubled by Anjali and her husband Mukesh. Vivek was never in our custody and the allegations are incorrect. We have booked Anjali and Mukesh for abetment of suicide and both of them have been arrested.”

Meanwhile, Vivek’s family along with some villagers blocked the Lakhimpur state highway and demanded an FIR against police officials for “murder”. A separate complaint was given to police, but no second FIR was registered at the time of filing this report.

NEW DELHI: Three of the five students, who were injured during the violence at Jamia Millia Islamia on December 15, were questioned by the Crime Branch sleuths on Friday. They were quizzed regarding the identity of the youths, who were seen pelting stones in the videos recovered from the library.

To establish the sequence of events based on the nature of injuries the students had suffered, they were also asked about their whereabouts during the violence. The students claimed to be inside the campus when the cops had entered. They claimed that they could not recognise all the people who were in the university with them from the clips that were shown to them.

Crime Branch had on Thursday issued notices to 10 Jamia students, asking them to appear before it for questioning in connection with the December 15 violence.

The SIT constituted under DCP Rajesh Deo is, meanwhile, probing the role of the people who had obtained the footage from the Jamia authorities on the pretext of filing a court petition. Delhi Police has questioned some university officials as well.

A probe revealed that the videos were selectively cropped and released on social media to create a perception about the police action.

Sources say that the cops would now corroborate the videos from the library with footage and still photos collected from the students and the Jamia authorities to identify a few more people, who had pelted stones at the policemen during the clashes.

He was speaking at the concluding day of the two-day Motor Vehicle Accident Conference (MOVACON) 2020 in the city.

“Reducing the accident deaths is a collective effort — we need accessible and sustainable transport system, inclusion of vulnerable groups of the road users and targeting the younger population,” he said.

Dr Subroto Das, CEO of Lifeline Foundation, said that need of the hour is to improve road management systems, introduce road safety audits for new projects and assessment/ rating system for existing networks. “Along with 3Es of road safety - Education, Engineering and Enforcement - we also need to address the fourth E of Emergency. With improved knowledge of first respondents, we can reduce the fatalities on the road,” he said, adding that the Good Samaritan Act should also be popularized.

AHMEDABAD: If you pawned jewellery or gold to get a loan and failed to repay it, the finance company auctions off the gold and recovers its loan. This lending model coupled with rising gold prices has given birth to a new business in the state. A few players are repaying such loans , selling the pawned gold and making a cut on the extra value of the jewellery or gold.This business has clicked because gold prices have been rising steadily. The difference between the market value of such gold today and the amounts lent against such security leaves room for arbitrage. Such players then pay off or buy the debt, sell the gold and return the margin to the borrower for a 10% commission. There are a dozen or so players in Ahmedabad alone.According to those involved in the business, 30% of those who pawn gold end up as defaulters. Most people pawn gold only after exhausting all other credit options and such people prefer not to tell people that they have pawned gold.These gold refinancing players reach out to such debtors by placing advertisements on autorickshaws or pasting posters in public places. “The customers get the difference between the loan outstanding and the gold prices when we sell the pawned gold. If the lenders auction off such collateral, they do not return the difference to their borrowers. We get a commission on settling such loans,” says Mayursinh Jadeja , proprietor of Meena Gold, who claims to have he introduced this business model to Ahmedabad a few years ago. Jadeja says this service is now available in all cities of Gujarat and he plans to expand his business to UP and Maharashtra as well.Dharmesh Patel of Thomas Gold , another such firm, said that those without enough money to close their loans come to them. “The customers know they will lose the difference if the lender auctions off the pawned gold.

Bhopal: The controversial order of the National Health Mission, that was withdrawn after outrage, has found support from former health officials and activists. The order had enforced minimum performance standards for male sterlisation.

“Sterilisation until the 1980s was male centric. With introduction of laparoscopic tubectomy, 99% of sterilisation is focussed on women. NHM directive of February 11 is in national interest and that of women who have to undergo the high-risk procedure. No-scalpel vasectomy (NSV) for male sterilisation is far more easy and safe,” said former MP health department director (family planning), Dr B Ohri. In 2016, he was felicitated by union government for promoting family planning and resulting reduction in MMR and IMR.

“It is an issue of basic human rights and gender equality. Why should only women always suffer. Seldom do we find posters or IEC campaigns mobilising male for sterilisation. It is a myth that sterilisation makes the male weak, and it needs to be broken,” said NGO Aarambh director and child and women’s rights activist, Archana Sahay. Of the 146 districts, 26 districts are from MP.

The MP Polpulation Policy 2000 states: — While sterilisation would continue to play an important role in the population control efforts, it would be ensured that the profile of the person undergoing sterilisation is of the right quality in terms of age and parity. The no-scalpel vasectomy will be promoted to increase male participation in family planning...”

TOI had earlier reported how police had refused to file an FIR in the case despite court’s order and attempts were made to put pressure on Brijpal’s family for a compromise in this case.

Brijpal was picked up on September 23 last year over his pending power bill of Rs 81,947 and locked up in revenue jail for 11 days during which he fell ill and later died in hospital. Following this, Budaun district magistrate Dinesh Kumar Singh suspended three employees of the revenue department, transferred the tehsildar and naib tehsildar and ordered a magisterial probe.

There were seemingly procedural lapses too.

On Thursday, police booked SDM Sanjay Singh, tehsildar Dheerendra Singh , naib tehsildar Rajkumar Singh and three others under IPC’s section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder). The aggrieved family had staged a protest in Budaun on February 14 and given a memorandum to DM Kumar Prashant requesting him to intervene in this matter and get the FIR registered.

A magisterial inquiry ordered earlier in this case had stated that Brijpal died due to the negligence of the lower staff and not because of SDM or tehsildar.

Brijpal’s brother Mahesh Shakya told TOI that the administration is trying to ""save the culprits in this case"".

The issue went unnoticed until a few local leaders raised it after watching a video uploaded by Shakya went viral on social media.

Later, then district magistrate Dinesh Kumar Singh sought a report from SDM Sanjay Kumar Singh, and suspended naib nazir Madan Mohan , kurk amin Ram Niwas and peon Kanhai Lal , whereas tehsildar Dheerendra Kumar Singh and naib tehsildar Raj Kumar Singh were attached with district headquarters, and were asked to provide a written explanation in three days.

Brijpal’s family members later approached a Budaun court which ordered registration of an FIR against the SDM and others on January 28. A copy of the order was sent to the offices of the DM and SSP. However, the victim’s kin alleged that the police deliberately delayed the registration of FIR and several attempts were made to threaten them to withdraw their complaint.

SP (rural) SP Singh said, “An FIR has been lodged for culpable homicide on the orders of the court and action would be taken after detailed investigation.”

AHMEDABAD: The Motera stadium, world’s biggest cricket ground , was unveiled to the media by Gujarat Cricket Association (GCA) on Friday ahead of US President Donald Trump’s visit on Monday. The stadium will host the ‘Namaste Trump’ event.

There is speculation that PM Modi and President Trump will address the audience at Motera stadium from a revolving podium. A rectangular stage was dismantled on Thursday and a new circular stage about 30 feet in diameter is being erected. Although officials did not confirm this, sources said the plan could be to make a revolving stage.

The stage being erected for the PM and the US President is located along the boundary line just below the pavilion. Two giant LED screens were being installed at the pavilion end and the commentary box end to beam live visuals of the event. Sound amplifiers have been put up on four metal frames placed in the ground. The pitch area, though, has been cordoned off.

The GCA on Friday clarified that the ‘Namaste Trump’ event was being held at Motera stadium only to host the US President and the event will not amount to inauguration of the stadium.

Naveen Polishetty

HYDERABAD: Academics should not only be about securing good marks or a seat in a coveted institute but also for understanding concepts that will help one deal with real-time issues, said actor Naveen Polishetty .

Belonging to a family of IITians, Polishetty pursued engineering at National Institute of Technology , Bhopal , before becoming an actor. Although he was among the toppers during school, he decided to pursue his passion albeit the risk.

After his recent Bollywood movie Chhichorre - based on the rat-race that students participate in to secure admission in coveted institutes such as IIT - Polishetty discouraged students from rote-learning and nudged them towards associative learning.

“Even if a student secures top rank by rote-learning, they will not be able to indulge in conversations about those topics after three years. It’s important that students understand concepts and enjoys the learning process,” said Polishetty.

Sharing his personal experience, Polishetty recalled how he always lived in a dichotomy between pursuing a conventional course vs what he was passionate about. He claimed that there is a need to encourage an education pattern that enables students to learn skill-sets that they will enjoy pursuing as a full-time career.

“We are far behind in terms of encouraging the younger generation in pursuing courses that are unconventional. Many parents don’t want their children to pursue unconventional courses at the risk of financial crisis. There has to be a change in this mindset,” said Polishetty, adding that only when students pursue careers that they truly enjoy will they be able to do justice to all that they have ever learnt.

JAIPUR: A 29-year-old man was arrested with seven lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) stamps, a psychedelic drug, by the organised crime wing of the Jaipur Police Commissionerate on Friday. This is said to be the first such LSD seizure reported from the city.

The accused, identified as Gaurav Soni, has completed his B.Tech and is pursuing a digital designing course. He was among 21 drug peddlers arrested by the police during the ongoing Operation Clean Sweep from Thursday.

Soni got the LSD stamps from a rave party in Pushkar a month ago. “He is not only a consumer but also a drug peddler. It appears that he was planning to deliver the drugs to his clients while he was arrested,” additional DCP (organised crime) Vimal Singh Nehra told TOI.

“One LSD stamp is being sold for Rs 7,000 to Rs 8,000 in the Jaipur market,” said an officer. According to police, LSD is imported illegally to the country from America, Greece, The Netherlands and Germany.

During the current drive, the police dog squad too helped in nabbing culprits from Jhotwara, Kardhani, Jawahar Circle, Aadarsh Nagar, Jawahar Nagar, Mohana, Manak Chowk, Shastri Nagar and other police station areas.

“We have arrested 21 persons involved in illegal smuggling of narcotics since Thursday. This includes the arrest of B.Tech student,” he added.

Other than LSD, police also seized drugs such as cocaine, smack, brown sugar and ‘ganja’ from peddlers.

“We started the Operation Clean Sweep on October 23, 2019. Since then, we have arrested 308 persons and registered 255 cases against them,” said a senior police officer of the commissionerate.

MEERUT: A BJP MLA’s 20-year-old son, Vikas Khatik, was booked for celebratory firing in Khurja town of Bulandshahr . A video purportedly showing the Khurja MLA’s son firing in the air during an engagement ceremony went viral following which, the local SSP ordered an FIR.

According to SP (rural) Harender Singh , who has been entrusted with the task of investigating the case, said, “An FIR has been filed and our investigation is on.”

Surprisingly, Khatik has been booked under IPC’s section 336 (act endangering life or personal safety of others) and not under the Arms Act, though the FIR does mention the incident of celebratory firing. In addition, the name of the accused’s father has been left also ‘unknown’ in the FIR.

When asked if he was carrying a weapon licensed in his name, the SP (rural) said, “The weapon was a licensed one and a report has been sent recommending its cancellation.”

Despite repeated attempts, the legislator could not be contacted.

Just a week ago, 10, including a groom, were injured when pellets hit them during celebratory firing at a wedding in a village in Meerut. This led to violent clash between the two families.

Last year in October, an Army subedar, who was on leave, died after a bullet hit him during celebratory firing. The incidents generally increase during the wedding season.

“We have given strict orders to all police officials of the zone to act swiftly and strictly on these matters. Firstly, if anyone is found involved in celebratory firing, not only a case will be filed against him but his weapon will also be impounded and his licence will be cancelled within 24 hours. Even the organizer of the event will not be spared in that situation and similar penalty will be slapped upon him,” said ADG (Meerut zone) Prashant Kumar

Newly appointed AICC General Secretary and State in-charge Deepak Babaria along with party's State President A... Read More

Bhopal: Major changes in the state Congress is expected within a month. AICC general secretary in-charge of state affairs Deepak Babaria spent three days here earlier this week and met workers and office-bearers from across the state. “Where district presidents have completed five years, by and large changes will be made. In rarest of rare cases, we may retain the same person but overall, there will be changes,” Deepak Babaria said.

Congress party will reward those district presidents who worked hard over the past five years and contributed to the formation of government in the state. “Promotions will be given within the party and their services will be availed in appropriate positions,” Babaria said.

State Congress will also set-up coordination committees at the block, assembly constituency and district levels to address people and party workers related issues. “People usually take their grievances to the MLA, who then takes it forward to ministers. That may not be possible to resolve each case,” Babaria explained.

“Hence, a systematic and methodical approach will be placed. People’s issues can be taken at the block level, then the assembly constituency or the district levels,” he said. If the problem needs further redressal, then it will be brought to the state level where ministers will be involved.

There have been increasing complaints that ministers do not listen to party workers or take their calls. Deepak Babaria said there are two aspects to the problem. Sometimes, workers bring certain issues which cannot be resolved by ministers under the existing laws.

Babaria claimed that he will also hold meetings with cabinet ministers of the Kamal Nath government so coordination between the organization and the government is smooth. Babaria’s meeting with Nath cabinet members maybe held in the coming week.

Appointment of state Congress president, however, may take some more time. “The AICC president (Sonia Gandhi) believes in consensus. And till that consensus is reached over the candidate, PCC chief appointment will have to wait,” he said.

Asked what is the Congress party looking for in the new state Congress president, Babaria replied, “He should be efficient, energetic, inclusive in all respect and charismatic. He will be someone who will work with everyone and take every section with him.

VS Sivakumar

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The vigilance case against MLA V S Sivakumar is likely to end up as a damp squib as investigation hasn’t established anything to directly link Sivakumar with the illegal wealth amassment case. The only case with vigilance sleuths is the assets amassed by three of his aides, which are disproportionate to their incomes.

Top sleuths, who worked in agencies like CBI that have probed several graft cases, said that the FIR registered by VACB against Sivakumar is likely to come against the agency. The FIR statement straightaway has given clean chit to Sivakumar as it begins by saying that “the vigilance inquiry could not reveal disproportionate assets to the known source of income of suspect officers (Sivakumar and three others)”.

It says that the ‘close associates’ of Sivakumar ‘suspected to be the benamis’ have acquired assets disproportionate to their known sources of income. “The FIR clearly says that Sivakumar has no disproportionate assets, which means that the very purpose of conducting a probe against an individual, who has no disproportionate assets, can be challenged in court,” a senior official said.

Also, proving that the three ‘associates’ are the MLA’s benamis is going to be a challenge for VACB; unless there is some piece of evidence to establish a benami transaction, the case will not stand judicial scrutiny, said legal experts. “Being close associates does not mean that they are his benamis. In cases where benami link must be established, there should be some evidence that can establish that the accused had provided funds to associates to acquire their assets,” said former law secretary B G Harindranath.

Sources said agencies like CBI that has vast resources at its disposal, struggle for years in major cases to establish this link and most of the time, it cannot be proved. Sources cited how agencies like CBI had to give clean chit to Maharashtra ’s political leaders whose names came up as accused in the infamous Adarsh housing scam, after the agency could not establish links to prove that they held properties in benami names in the flat complex.

A senior official said there was something fishy in the way searches were conducted in Sivakumar’s home. “The FIR was registered, publicized and the search was conducted a day later. Usually when searches are to be conducted, the FIR is secretly produced in court, a search warrant is obtained and a surprise check is conducted; which was not so in this case,” he said.

Meanwhile, VACB team submitted its search report, along with all documents that were seized during the searches, before the vigilance court on Saturday. On allegations regarding the bank locker, Sivakumar said he had handed over details of the locker to VACB. “We weren’t using it for years. Anyone can understand that by checking the bank’s logbook. The key was misplaced,” he said.

NEW DELHI: Angry over her “secret marriage” with a man of the same gotra, the family of a 25-year-old woman from east Delhi allegedly murdered her, drove to Aligarh in Uttar Pradesh and dumped her body in a canal. The woman, Sheetal Chaudhary, and her boyfriend, Ankit Bhati, belonged to the same community.The murder took place on January 29, but the family managed to keep it under wraps. Bhati lodged an abduction complaint on February 18 after he failed to contact Sheetal.Three days later, cops from New Ashok Nagar police station arrested six members of the woman’s family, including her parents Ravinder Chaudhary and Suman, uncle Sanjay, and relatives Om Prakash, Parvesh and Ankit.

Picture used for representational purpose only

SECUNDERABAD: Residents of Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB) are facing water shortage due to erratic power cuts and scarce supply by tankers. Those dependant on tankers said that they were forced to wait for at least 48 hours to get their supply. However, a source in SCB said that tanker is supplied within 24 hours of booking.

“Even though there are power cuts, we are trying to make sure our consumers aren’t inconvenienced. Slight interruptions may occur twice a week,” the source said.

With Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board being unable to provide the assured quantity, SCB is compensating for the shortage. To ensure that residents do not face shortage in summer if the power cuts continue, ward members have requested coordination between SCB and the electricity department.

Bhopal/Jabalpur: Appearing on behalf of the state government, advocate general Shashank Shekhar assured a division-bench of M P high court that no activities would be carried out in the 300-metre periphery of river Narmada during ‘Narmada Gau-Kumbh’ being organised at Gwari Ghat in Jabalpur from February 24 to March 3.

He was responding to a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Pramod Dinkar Rao, which contended that events like ‘Narmada Gau-Kumbh’ pollute the river terribly as hundreds of people assemble on the banks of the river, stalls are put up and activities of different kinds are carried out. Citing example, he said bhandara (community feast) organized on Narmada Jayanti had generated as much as 35 tonne garbage on the banks of the river. He said epidemic had broken out in Allahabad once after the Kumbh Mela. He further contended that temporary toilets would also be put up during the event and it is not clear where the sewage would be disposed of.

Following preliminary arguments in the matter on Wednesday, the division bench of chief justice A K Mittal and Justice V K Shukla had instructed the district collector and Jabalpur municipal commissioner to present details of arrangements made to ensure that river Narmada is not polluted by the event.

A report presented in the court on Thursday stated that ‘Gau-Kumbh’ would be organized 300 metre away from the river. There are 15 spots identified for performing yagna and 30 acre land has been reserved for parking of vehicles. Besides, tents are being put up for lodging and a temporary hospital is also being arranged at the venue. Dustbins and bio-toilets are being provided so that the garbage and sewage don’t become a menace. The ‘Visarjan Kund’ is also 100 metre away from the river bank, the report said.

After advocate general, Shashank Shekhar, assured the court that adequate arrangements are being ensured to keep the event pollution-free as much as possible, the court disposed of the petition.

MEERUT: A criminal facing over 12 cases in Delhi was on Friday arrested after a brief encounter with UP police in Meerut, just three days after his gang leader and notorious gangster Shiv Shakti Naidu was shot dead in an exchange of fire in the western UP city.

Ravi Malik, who got injured in the encounter before being overpowered and arrested, was also a member of the Naidu gang. Its members were active in Delhi, western UP and Haryana and had carried out several sensational heists and murders in the last few years, including the Rs 8crore robbery in Lajpat Nagat area.

Malik’s three accomplices managed to escape during the encounter near Modipuram area of Meerut, police said.

Senior superintendent of police (SSP) Ajay Sahni said, “We asked them to stop, but they fired on us from the vehicle. In the retaliatory firing, one of them, Ravi Malik alias Bhura, was injured. But his three aides managed to escape in nearby sugarcane fields. We recovered a pistol, a few cartridges and 12 mobile phones.”

Additional director general of police (ADG) of Meerut zone, Prashant Kumar, said, “During questioning, Malik told how he along with Naidu, Tilak Raj and Honey had planned to kill police inspector Vipin Kumar , a property dealer of Shamli, Vipin Chaudhary and Delhi police ’s special cell ACP Lalit Negi .

“However, the plan to kill Negi led to fissures within the gang after which Naidu and Bhura killed Honey and seriously wounded Tilak Raj on January 31 in Meerut’s Kankerkhera area.”

Malik, a resident of Alipur area of Delhi, carried a reward of Rs 1 lakh on his head and was helping Naidu strengthen the gang in western UP. Several cases are registered against him in Delhi, UP, Haryana, Punjab, Uttarakhand and Rajasthan. In fact, in Delhi alone, he is facing over 12 cases.

On Tuesday, Naidu gang’s ringleader Shiv Shakti Naidu was fatally wounded in a gunfight with police in Kankerkhera area of Meerut. Naidu was lodged in Tihar jail before he got the parole and went missing. He shot to infamy following Rs 8crore heist in Lajpat Nagar on January 28, 2014. Naidu and his gang had looted the cash when some businessmen were going to deposit it banks in Karol Bagh.

Sheetal Chaudhary

NEW DELHI: The family of Sheetal Chaudhary, arrested for allegedly murdering her, had told the neighbourhood in east Delhi’s New Ashok Nagar that she was harassed by Ankit Bhati, a neighbour, and now studying from her uncle’s home in Haryana. It was the persistent efforts of Bhati, whom Chaudhary had “secretly married”, and police’s quick action that unravelled the mystery behind her disappearance.

An FIR under IPC 365 (abduction) was registered on February 18 by Bhati, who suspected a foul play behind her disappearance and alleged her family might have harmed her for marrying him.

Chaudhary and Bhati fell in love in 2016. Bhati was handling his father’s dairy business while Chaudhary was pursuing a BEd course from Kurukshetra University. After two years, they decided to spend their lives together, Bhati said. Despite fearing a backlash from the victim’s family, the couple tied the knot at an Arya Samaj temple in October 2018 but decided to keep it under wraps, Bhati told the cops. Chaudhary finally decided to tell her family in the last week of January after her sister’s wedding.

As she spoke to them, all hell broke loose. Her father, a milk trader, was adamant that the marriage in the same gotra would dent the family’s image, police said. The family members allegedly hatched a plot to kill her on January 28. The case was cracked after police checked with the uncle.

Trichy: A day after the city traffic police and city corporation relocated the street vendors occupying the roads in Gandhi market, the hawkers on Friday were back near the roads passing through the market.

Big Bazaar street and Vellamandi road passing through the congested Gandhi market are often encroached on by vendors who occupy a portion of carriageways.

Acting on the complaints, city police and corporation officials removed a section of street vendors from a portion of Vellamandi road and Big bazaar street on Thursday. With the vendors relocated, the market roads became free with little traffic jams for motorists. The happiness, however, was short-lived as the vendors came back to the road again.

A section of street vendors within a day after being evicted returned to Vellamandi road and space near the world war memorial. “Gandhi market roads without traffic snarls on Thursday surprised many. But the traffic jams are now back with the vendors reappearing near the war memorial,” P Venkatesh, a resident of Tharanallur added.

Representative image

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Police are likely to go for a retender of the controversial integrated traffic enforcement system ( ITES ) project in the wake of differences among the members of a technical committee .

According to top police sources, the project, which has reached a stage where the 11-member technical committee is examining the two private companies that have submitted the bids, would be retendered as the committee is divided regarding the choice of companies and also in the wake of recent controversies relating to implementation of multiple projects in police department involving private players, including the central intrusion monitoring system (CIMS) project.

“Transparency will have to be ensured at any cost especially in the wake of recent issues against police. The tender conditions will be modified so as to attract more international players for the project. Since there are no assured returns for the private firms unless people violate traffic rules and fine is slapped, more players are unlikely to bid under the existing tender conditions,” top police sources said.

While in the first two bids, only one player turned up, in the third bid, two players expressed interest. For technical evaluation, the marks were split for various criteria, including number of years that the bidder has been engaged in automated enforcement system, number of sites for which the bidder has demonstrable expertise and experience in automated enforcement system, average annual turnover from enforcement systems of bidder in the last three financial years, average net worth over the last three financial years, manpower deployed for such projects, quality of the proposed project execution methodology and plan, ISO certification and technical presentation.

The technical committee is being headed by crime branch director and ADGP Tomin J Thachankary and also has senior police officials and representatives from IT mission, C-DAC and motor vehicles department. In the absence of the chairman and a section of officers, the remaining members had preferred one company, while the other section ended up choosing the other after verifying its credentials. Ultimately, both the companies ended up scoring good marks well over the qualifying limit (which was 70), because of which the final clearance required from the technical committee could not be granted to one of them. Only after the technical clearance, the financial bids will be opened and the company will be selected which will then have to receive clearance from the government.

Under ITES project, as many as 350 speed-limit violation detection systems (SVDS), 30 red-light violation detection systems (RLVD) and 100 helmet absence detection systems (HADS) will be installed and existing pollution under control (PUC) will be upgraded to enable online issuance of PUC certificates. All components will be connected to the proposed command and control centre to be set up at the police headquarters, in a safe and secured way.

The project has been envisaged in a BOOT (build own operate transfer) mode, in which there will be a concession period of 10 years, wherein the technology will be brought by the bidder, while the data and software ownership will be with the police. The successful bidder will obtain revenue through a service fee on challans generated and PUC certificates issued and at the end of contract period, all assets will have to be transferred to the police at no cost.

People using plastic carry bag in city

TRICHY: Employees in the main and zonal offices of the city corporation have been told to stop using all types of use-and-throw products even if they are completely biodegradable and eco-friendly. The move was to eliminate the use of banned plastic products and to minimise the waste generation capacity of corporation offices by avoiding single-use products .

Officials and workers were warned that use of single-use plastics in offices will attract penalties from officials entrusted with the task of keeping the corporation campuses free of plastics and single-use products. “Even biodegradable plastic carry bags are banned inside the corporation offices. The usage of single-use products, plastic or eco-friendly, will add burden to the waste collection process,” an official source in the corporation said. Employees irrespective of their seniority and rank were told to buy parcel food only in vessels. Even aluminium foil sheets and corn-starch covers, widely used alternatives to plastic, are banned in corporation offices.

“Vessels can be washed and reused but aluminium sheets which become waste ought to be collected, segregated and processed for recycling. To save time, officials were told to use vessels for parcelling food,” the official added. Sanitary supervisors, inspectors and officials in the corporation’s health department will enforce the rule which is already in force. A penalty of Rs 200 to Rs 500 is to be collected from the defaulters and their names will be displayed on notice boards of offices for violating the ban. The objective of the restrictions is to serve as a model for residents in reducing individual waste generation capacity and avoiding banned plastics, corporation sources added.

CHENNAI: Two customs officers and another who retired recently from the department were arrested by Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) on Friday and sent to prison along with 13 passengers on charges of smuggling gold into the country. DRI officials refused to part with details of the charges.

Police sources identified the arrested officials as customs inspectors Vikas Sharma and E V Rajan. The former official is Sathish Kumar. The two serving officers allegedly helped passengers bring in gold, while Sathish Kumar informed the gang about the officials who would be on duty.

According to the case investigated by DRI on Wednesday, 18 passengers who landed in Chennai by flights AK 11 from Malaysia, 6E 1212 from Colombo, EK 544 from Dubai and UL 121 from Colombo, were intercepted and 12.693kg of gold worth Rs 5.44 crore was seized from them. As a follow-up investigation, officials searched the house of a retired tax assistant of the customs department in Kolathur. DRI officials suspect he was co-ordinating the smuggling. Airport witnessed some drama after the seizure on Wednesday. DRI had boarded the passengers in a vehicle outside the arrival hall of the international airport for further inquiry at DRI’s office in T Nagar when some 50 people attacked the officers. In the melee, some of the detained passengers escaped.

Called for an inquiry. 13 of the 18 passengers turned up at the DRI office.

Anand Vihar Railway Station

NEW DELHI: Praveen Kumar hurries into Anand Vihar Railway Station where he has to receive a relative. After looking around for the platform ticket counter, he approaches the helpdesk for assistance. Instead of guiding him to the relevant counter, the staff point to an electric blue machine festooned with garlands. Kumar notices the ‘Fit India Squat Machine’ written on it. The 35-year-old is informed that if he manages 30 squats on the machine in 180 seconds, he will get a platform ticket for free. In the next minute and a half, he catches his breath before smilingly receiving a slip giving him access to the platform.

As part of its effort to improve amenities at the station, Indian Railway Stations Development Corporation Limited (IRSDC) installed the machine not only to meet Fit India campaign goals, but also to make the railway station interactive and fun for passengers. This is the first time that such an exercise machine, common in many stations abroad, has been installed in India. “The Fit India squat kiosk is in line with the Prime Minister’s vision. More squat machines will soon be installed across the country,” said an IRSDC official.

Gaurav Chaudhary of IRSDC, stationed at the helpdesk, disclosed that over 200 people had tried the machine since its installation on Thursday, with many keen to beat the time target. “People who have time are willing to give the exertion a go. Some have even tried completing the 30 squats in less than a minute,” said Chaudhary.

A signboard will take over the task of informing people from the helpdesk. “Since the machine is new, we are here to guide people about how to go about it. No buttons need be pressed; the machine’s sensors detect a person automatically and start the count,” explained Chaudhary. The machine senses whether the squat is ‘correct’ and ‘low enough’ or not.

Among other facilities recently installed is the ‘Pulse Health Kiosk’. It allows people to measure parameters such as body composition analysis and blood pressure. There is also a Robocura massage chair, bottle crushing machines and a Dawa Dost outlet where people can buy medicines at a discount of up to 80%.

S K Lohia, MD and CEO, IRSDC, said, “We are committed to redeveloping the station to give passengers world-class amenities. This is a good opportunity for interested parties to invest too.”

194,['22/02/2020'],Delhi: Trader dies trying to ward off snatchers,"This story is from February 22, 2020

Ravi Singhal

NEW DELHI: A grocery store owner was killed by three men outside his shop in Fatehpur Beri when he tried to stop a gang of men from snatching a cash bag from his helper’s hand. The man attacked the snatchers with a rod he used to pull down the shutter, following which the gang members opened fire.

Atul Thakur, DCP (South) said a case of murder, attempt to murder and robbery has been registered.

The incident happened around 10pm on Thursday when the man, Ravi Singhal, was on his way home to Dera village with his helper Bhagwan Dass and was carrying a bag containing Rs 5 lakh. Singhal, being an office-bearer of the local market association, had collected the cash from the other shopkeepers as membership fee.

He asked Dass to hold the bag while he pulled down the shutter. One of his relatives, who also owns a shop nearby, said that two men riding a bike approached them from behind, snatched the bag from Dass’s hand and started to flee. Hearing his helper’s call, Singhal hit the robbers with the rod. Panicked, the men suddenly whipped out a pistol and fired at him and fled towards Gurgaon. Dass too was left injured.

The incident happened within 100 metres from the trader’s house due to which his family rushed out hearing the gunshot. “We rushed Singhal to a hospital. But on the way, we spotted a PCR team and asked them to clear the way for us, but they asked us to first call 100 after which a team would be deputed. We did not have time. By the time we reached the trauma centre, he died,” said Narender, one of his relatives. The cops said they would find probe if there were any lapses on the PCR’s part.

The family suspects the role of someone known to Singhal behind the incident, since he usually left the shop with Rs 10-20,000. On Friday, however, he was carrying a large amount. Narender said they scanned the CCTV footage and found the criminals lurking around in the area for nearly 40 minutes before attacking Singhal.

K Surendran takes charge as BJP state president on Saturday

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: BJP state president K Surendran assumed office on Saturday. Expressing his unflinching faith in BJP’s potential to emerge as a strong third political alternative in the next few years, Surendran said he would be least interested in building up a Surendran faction in the party.

Surendran was accorded a warm welcome by hundreds of BJP workers assembled in front of Thiruvananthapuram Central railway station this morning. Garlanded with marigold flowers, Surendran was taken to BJP state office in an open vehicle.

“People, even those who are not BJP members or sympathisers, have started thinking aloud about the need for a third alternative front against the LDF and UDF which are wreathed in corruption. There lies ahead a perfect chance for the growth of BJP. One among every six persons who walk in the road in Kerala is a BJP man. Now, its a party that gets 30 lakh votes and has a vote share of 16%. I am grateful to the good work done by my predecessors who occupied this chair before me and I am well aware of the expectations the BJP workers and the general public have on BJP,” Surendran said.

“Communal terrorists have overpowered the LDF. The graft in police department was not limited to state police chief. It was a scam carried out with the concurrence of chief minister’s office. The UDF and LDF were engaged in compromise politics,” he said.

Union minister and BJP former state president V Muraleedharan said it was the first time a popular leader was chosen to lead the party in Kerala. BJP former president P K Krishnadas, former state organizing general secretary P P Mukundan, senior leader O Rajagopal, national secretary H Raja, former state president C K Padmanabhan and state spokesperson M S Kumar spoke.

Those who were conspicuous by their absence were former state president Kummanam Rajasekharan, general secretary Sobha Surendran and spokesperson B Gopalarishnan. Though M T Ramesh and A N Radhakrishnan attended the function, they did not occupy seats on the stage.

NEW DELHI: The portion of Lala Lajpat Rai Marg skirting the Lodhi crematorium has turned into a veritable death trap . Public Works Department is redesigning the central verge of the road to prevent people from crossing the busy thoroughfare and the uprooted kerbstones are heaped along the middle of the road, posing a hazard to unsuspecting drivers.There are no barricades or notices to warn vehicles about the danger. Since the stretch is not well lit, the risk of cars ramming into the stone heaps remains high. It is especially dangerous after dusk when drivers tend to speed on the road. Apart from a few bollards marking the part that has already been restored, drivers are almost blind to the stones.The kerbstones have also reduced the road width by half a lane, thus creating a bottleneck for traffic approaching the Lodhi flyover. As it is, even normally the 100 metre suffers because of its variable width.This is aggravated by vehicles parked on the roadside by mourners coming to the crematorium and two loops of the Barapullah elevated road emptying into the road near the Jangpura metro station.In addition, a petrol pump is located on the stretch, again affecting the smooth flow of traffic.The traffic police claimed to have raised red flags before the Barapullah loops were opened for public use, but nothing was done to rectify the problem in the past four years. “We have requested the contractors to remove the stones from the road, but they seem to be waiting for enough debris to build up before carting it away,” ventured a traffic police officer. PWD officials did not respond to queries on the lack of safety measures taken by the contractors.Recently, a makeshift U-turn also popped up opposite the gates of the crematorium. Even though policemen blocked it with metal barricades, the construction work on the central verge required their removal and people began using the U-turn again.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74252109,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-215419,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/uprooted-kerbstones-pose-threat-to-drivers-on-key-south-delhi-road/articleshow/74249877.cms

Representative image

PANAJI: The state government on Friday finalised an export strategy aimed at identifying potential sectors so as to help develop infrastructure facilities, services and logistic facilities, safeguard interest of exporters and boost exports.

Before implementing measures , each department will be required to take prior administrative and financial approval from the state, the Goa cabinet decided while approving the strategy.

The policy has been formulated with the assistance of the Union ministry of commerce and industry, which looks at boosting sectoral exports of states. It has identified “champion sectors” and “key sectors” as those with export potential.

While pharma, mineral, marine electronics, optical fibre, and chemical come under champion sectors, IT, shipbuilding, tourism and, agriculture and allied sectors, have been identified as key sectors.

The strategy has also identified bottlenecks and suggestions to improve the state’s sectoral exports, besides covering various ease of doing business measures and issues where the state is required to coordinate with the central government.

In addition, the export strategy covered existing infrastructural facilities with suggestions for bettering them and proposed that the government take up measures to improve export via sea, air and land routes.

While Goa hasn’t made any headway in exporting agri products, the strategy pointed to commodities like rice, legumes, spices, flowers, fruits, vegetables and coconut as having export potentials and recommended that the state encourage contract, community and organic farming, set up a plant quarantine facility and promote certain produce as “Brand Goa”. With Goan cashew in great demand, there is a suggestion that the nut be brought into focus.

Another sector that has been highlighted is the marine sector, which contributes 1.6% of the total foreign exchange earned through export of seafood products.

The Kalindi Kunj border was opened twice on Friday morning.

NEW DELHI/NOIDA: The Kalindi Kunj border , which has been closed now for 68 days due to the road blockade by anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protesters at Shaheen Bagh, was opened twice on Friday morning, triggering confusion among commuters who thought the traffic restrictions had been lifted. Police officers said this caused around 3,500 vehicles to collect at the Kalindi Kunj-Molarband crossing, creating a huge traffic jam there.

The police barricades preventing vehicles from accessing the blocked GD Birla Road were first lifted around 9am to let through some kanwariyas. The barricades were again removed a couple of hours later to allow two ambulances, one of which was carrying a body of an accident victim, to reach Delhi past Shaheen Bagh.

The confusion was triggered by a few four-wheelers tailing the ambulances before the cops could put the barricades back in place. News spread in the media that the Kalindi Kunj road was open for traffic, and commuters took the quicker route to south Delhi from Noida only to find their way blocked at the culvert near GD Birla Marg.

The traffic police had to divert the traffic to the Madanpur Khadar-Pushta Road along the Agra canal. This required vehicles on the Mithapur Road to be stopped, causing anxiety among cops that the small culvert on the stretch would not be able to bear the load of the heavy traffic. Police, accordingly, allowed only light vehicles to pass. The heavy commercial vehicles had to idle there until the traffic thinned after the peak morning rush.

The cops had a tough time controlling the agitated drivers. “We tried to stop the cars, but nobody was listening to us,” said a Noida policeman. “Whenever these situations arise, all we can do is click photographs and later issue challans to the vehicle owners.”

It was around 11.30am that Noida Police closed their end of the road again. Movement on the stretch had been stopped at the Noida end to ensure no vehicles crossed the Kalindi Kunj bridge and created a bottleneck at the multi-point Kalindi chowk.

It took police on both side of the border some time before commuters could be convinced that the barricades had been removed only to let through two ambulances. Krishna, who was passing by the area in the morning, however, noted that the route had earlier been opened for some kanwariyas.

Rajesh S, DCP (traffic), Noida, said the road was closed soon after the ambulances drove through. “Only school buses and ambulances are exempt at this traffic diversion, though we cannot stop vehicles in cases of emergency,” the officer said. “The route was opened for some ambulances, which were ferrying accident victims to Delhi, and the border was closed soon after that.”

Asked about the restrictions being lifted for the kanwariyas, the DCP said, “A bus had broken down just ahead of Mahamaya Flyover and a jam had ensued. Only those kanwariyas on foot were allowed past the barricades.”

Later in the day, Noida traffic police tweeted an advisory for commuters. “As per the directions of Delhi traffic police, the diversion due to the protest on Road Number 13A of Jamia Nagar will continue on February 21, 2020. Please use alternative routes to travel towards Delhi/Faridabad,” said the advisory, posted around 2 pm.

People expressed impatience at the continued blockade of the route, which offers the quickest run to south Delhi and Faridabad from Noida. Twitter user Rakesh Kumar Ojha posted, “It’s a complete failure of the government to take control of the situation. Just few thousand people have made life miserable for lakhs of people by blocking the road. All have right to protest but no one has the right to block a common public road. Why was Supreme Court required to pitch in?”

Delhi Police is exploring the possibility of allowing light vehicles to access Okhla Road via Abul Fazl Enclave Road, which skirts the Okhla Bird Sanctuary.

Rajkot: Two murder cases were reported from Pardi village of Lodhika taluka in Rajkot district and Una of Gir Somnath district on Thursday night. According to police, five accused in the Pardi murder case had been arrested soon after the crime on Friday.

Representative image

NEW DELHI: Uncertainty continues to loom over the regularisation of 3,500 domestic breeding checkers (DBC) with the municipal authorities unable to start an exercise to enrol them against the vacant positions of field workers.

DBC workers have alleged that to end their last agitation in January, civic officials promised to finalise the procedure for engaging them in the vacant positions by February-end but no work has started so far.

The domestic checkers are contractual employees engaged for checking house-to-house breeding of mosquitoes. There is no official post for DBCs in the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, forcing them to work on contract for over 20 years. Each of them visits 60 to 70 houses daily to check if coolers, overhead tanks and flower pots have stagnant water, which can be a breeding ground for mosquitoes carrying the dengue, malaria or chikungunya viruses.

“Last year, South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) mayor Sunita Kangra wrote to the finance ministry for creating a specific position. The ministry said the post could be created only after approval of Delhi government and the lieutenant governor,” said Devanand, president of the Anti-Malaria Ekta Karamchari Union.

It was also clarified candidates would be selected through Delhi Subordinate Services Selection Board exams. “But the majority of us have crossed the age to appear for such exams,” he said, adding that civic officials and the deliberative wing assured them of enrolment through an alternative method. “But no work has started,” said another worker.

A health department official claimed the enrolment in place of field workers, a permanent post, was not simple. “The proposal needs clearance from the House, Delhi government and the LG, and then a gazette notification. The entire process is going to take at least two years. Till then, we have to keep them on contract,” he said.

Dehradun: Dehradun Municipal Corporation (DMC) has postponed the last date for residents of the old wards to avail a rebate of 20% on property tax (both commercial and residential) payment. Now, the last date to avail this rebate is February 25.

Also, the residents of the 32 new wards can now avail a 20% rebate on the payment of commercial tax till February 25. These residents have been exempted from paying residential tax until 2028.

The move comes after the civic body received several requests in this regard. At first, January 15 was decided as the last date to avail rebate on property tax payments. However, the last date to avail rebate has been extended several times so far.

Notably, the DMC has set a target of Rs 50 crore for its property tax collection for the current financial year and its officials are confident that they will achieve it.

203,['22/02/2020'],Churchill eye double over MB,"This story is from February 22, 2020

Margao: A lot has changed since Churchill Brothers FC stunned Mohun Bagan 4-2 in the high-scoring I-League encounter in December. Ever since their first and only defeat in 12 games, the Kolkata side have been unstoppable in 10 matches and are now leading the standings with an eight-point gap over second placed Punjab FC.

For Churchill, things have not gone as expected but two back-to-back wins have given Bernardo Tavares’ side some belief they can repeat the feat and do the double when they host Bagan at the Nehru Stadium, Fatorda, on Saturday.

“In football everything is possible. We are training every day and these things can happen. This is a big challenge for us but I have told my boys that it’s against good teams that we can improve. If we win one time, we know we can win for the second time and it is good for the game,” Tavares told TOI on Friday.

Bagan, chasing their second I-League crown, had eight days rest after demolishing Neroca FC 6-2. Kibu Vicuna’s team have been lethal upfront, scoring 27 and conceding just 11. They have secured nine wins and drawn only once in their last 10 league games.

But despite surprising defeats to Indian Arrows, TRAU and defending champions Chennai City FC, Churchill are not far behind with 21 goals and are third in the standings with 19 points from 11 games.

“They (Bagan) are good in defence as well as attack but in some moments in defensive transition, they make some mistakes which we can take advantage. We like to have the ball and play upfront. We like to create opportunities also and I’m sure it will be a good game,” said the Churchill coach.

Churchill had only two days to prepare but will be pleased after captain and star striker Willis Plaza found the net in their 2-1 wins over Aizawl FC and Real Kashmir FC to take his goal tally to seven. Plaza’s striker partner Lalkhawpuimawia has shown what he can do and is the teams second top scorer with four goals. Former captain and medio Richard Costa has undergone a knee surgery and looks to be out for a long period. But Churchill have enough quality in Quan Gomes, Glan Martins and Dawda Ceesay.

Churchill’s centre-back Abu Bakr will have to closely mark Spaniard Fran Gonzalez, the leagues current joint top scorer with nine goals. Then there is former Sevilla and Senegalese striker Papa Diawara, while youngster Nongdamba Naorem also has the ability to create trouble for his markers.

Bagan have seven games more after Churchill and coach Vicuna is not taking anything for granted in their quest for the title.

“Since the beginning, our philosophy, style has remained the same and our teams is playing better every game. It is not possible to get the trophy with 29 points, that means we must continue working and focus on only this game. It is the most important game for us,” said Vicuna.

A win for Churchill will take them to the second spot while Bagan can increase their lead by 11 points.

Dehradun: United Forum of Unaided Schools in collaboration with Principals Progressive Schools’ Association (PPSA) has accused State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (SCPCR) of infringement in the functioning of private schools in the city. The schools’ bodies, on Friday, accused the commission officials of misbehaviour and unruly interference in their work and alleged that the state government itself is not taking the RTE seriously.

Talking to TOI, Prem Kashyap, CBSE member and president of PPSA, said that parents are approaching SCPCR with false and fabricated charges against the schools just to avoid payment of the fees for which they have already availed the services.

Meanwhile, SCPCR chief Usha Negi told TOI that private schools are not following RTE norms and if they feel that commission is biased, they are free to approach court. “We have never taken any action (or passed any order) without listening to both sides. If we have done any wrong to any school, they are free to move court. These schools just do not want to follow orders,” she added.

HYDERABAD: Intense lobbying has started in Telangana Congress to succeed Uttam Kumar Reddy as TPCC president. Party sources said the high command is not only looking at a dynamic leader to replace Uttam but also some one who will revive the party in Telangana.The party leadership does not want a repeat of Delhi where it drew a blank in the recent assembly elections. “The leadership is looking at a dynamic leader who can inspire the masses, youngsters and educated sections towards Congress philosophy. Also, he should be able to strengthen NSUI and Youth Congress and lift the party members’ morale at the grassroots in urban and rural areas,” a senior AICC leader. He said caste equations would certainly play a crucial role in finalising the candidate to take over as TPCC chief. With BJP trying to emerge as the only alternative to the ruling TRS, the choice of the new TPCC president to take on both TRS and BJP and steer the party to victory would be on high the leadership’s agenda, he said.Some of the contenders are already camping in Delhi. Former minister and NDMA former vice-chairman Marri Shashidhar Reddy returned from Delhi. Though AICC was supposed to appoint and send two central observers to Hyderabad by this month-end to start the consultation process with 40 to 50 party leaders to finalise the candidate, sources said this exercise could be delayed owing to the recent death of mother of AICC general secretary in-charge of Telangana RC Khuntia .Khuntia will submit a panel of names for TPCC chief’s post to AICC general secretary (organisation) KC Venugopal.

208,['22/02/2020'],Delhi: Hardayal library books to find temporary home in Town Hall,"This story is from February 22, 2020

The building has also developed cracks at places

NEW DELHI: More than three years after deciding to renovate the Hardayal Municipal Heritage Public Library , the North Delhi Municipal Corporation has issued an order for immediate shifting of its books and records to Town Hall in Chandni Chowk.

As per the order issued on February 13, the records of the establishment department, which are kept in these rooms, will be shifted to the environment management service office opposite Dangal Maidan near Old Delhi station. Rekha Sinha, local councillor and member-secretary of the library, said the shifting was necessary for carrying out the renovation project smoothly. The process is likely to start on Monday.

The project, being undertaken by Indira Gandhi National Centre for Arts (IGNCA), seeks to restore Delhi’s oldest library and preserve its rare collection of books. The library has 1.7 lakh books, out of which 7,000 rare ones were published before 1916 and would be digitised.

“While the repair of the outside plaster started last year, the commissioner recently informed me about the allotment of three rooms in Town Hall for the shift,” said the Jharoda councillor. “While some books and the records will be kept in these rooms and the library staff will also sit there, around half of the books will be packed and kept in the study room of the library itself due to lack of space. All precautionary measures will be taken to save the books from any damage,” she added.

In 2016, Delhi Development Authority granted the corporation Rs 2 crore to restore the building and Rs 1 crore for digitisation. The work was to be undertaken in two phases. “We had to wait for the go-ahead from the Union ministry of heritage and culture. In 2019, we gave the final nod to IGNCA to begin the digitisation of rare books. While the process has started, about 200 extremely rare books will be sent to IGNCA for restoration,” said Sinha.

The work to fix windows, electricity wiring, book racks and illumination will also be taken up. Due to damaged windows, many books, including the Gazette of India, got damaged, said an official. The building has also developed cracks at places.

In September, when TOI visited the place, the library staff said the Gazette of India from 1912 to 1992, kept on the mezzanine floor, got damaged as the window next to its rack was broken.

There is no plan to change the structure of the building because of its heritage status, said a corporation official.

HYDERABAD: A row over high TV volume ended in the death of a man who suffered a heart attack after allegedly being slapped by his tenant at Armoor in Nizamabad .

The deceased house owner, Girmaji Rajender (50), who weighed nearly 120kg and had multiple ailments including diabetes and heart disease, was taken to hospital but was declared dead on arrival.

“Probably fear and weak health triggered a cardiac arrest,” Armoor inspector P Raghavender said, adding that Rajender had stopped working as a labourer due to his illnesses.

According to cops, on Thursday night Rajender increased the TV volume as he could not hear due to the quarrel between his tenant Laxmi Narsaiah and his wife in the portion next door.

“When Narsaiah asked Rajender to reduce the volume, Rajender did not respond. Upset, Narsaiah stormed into Rajender’s house and slapped him,” the inspector said.

Family members along with neighbours of Gol Bangla area in Armoor rushed Rajender to a nearby hospital in an ambulance.

“Rajender was declared brought dead by doctors,” the inspector said. Rajender is survived by his wife and son.

Narsaiah, who makes idlis in a restaurant, fled the house immediately after the incident. Armoor cops have booked a case under IPC Section 304 (ii) (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) against Narsaiah.

Increasing frequency on the Airport Line while reducing fares and a strengthened bus connectivity are some of ... Read More

NEW DELHI: A new metro link connecting Dwarka Sector 21 with Sarai Rohilla , running high-quality EMU trains on the existing Dwarka-Bijwasan-Old Delhi-Ghaziabad line, increasing frequency on the Airport Line while reducing fares and a strengthened bus connectivity were some of the measures suggested by a DDA interdisciplinary committee for sustainable development of the sub-city.

The committee was formed by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal in October 2019 to prepare a “strategic” plan dovetailing all projects, optimising usage of land, and framing a policy to develop a complete ecosystem for Dwarka.

The LG was concerned that while DDA had developed over 90% of the land earmarked for residential use, almost 50% of the land meant for commercial and public and semi-public purposes was yet to be developed. About 1,100 hectares “developable land” in Dwarka was yet to be monetised, the LG had observed.

The committee suggested that running EMU trains would connect Dwarka to Bijwasan, Old Delhi and Ghaziabad and reduce travelling time to just 45 minutes. To minimise interchange, a new metro link could be constructed between Sector 21 and Sarai Rohilla via Palam and Delhi Cantonment. Also, the frequency of trains on the Airport Line could be increased and the fares slashed.

To reduce traffic load on roads, the committee suggested that improved bus connectivity with frequency of 2-5 minutes during peak hours and more direct routes to “job centres” should be planned. It added that BRT or light rail could also be explored. All metro stations in Dwarka along Blue Line could be converted as a boulevard and the areas within 500m of stations could be pedestrianised.

“To support IT/ITES industries, options like co-working spaces in TOD schemes, service apartments, rental housing and entertainment facilities are suggested,” the committee’s report said.

On Friday, DDA said that the strategic plan prepared by the committee looked into issues related to regional connectivity of Dwarka, safety and security of women and children, lack of commercial activities, work centres, public activities, parking issues and social infrastructure.

“While finalising the recommendations, the committee discussed issues being faced by Dwarka, including the sub-city not being seen as an investment destination, fragmented projects, women’s safety and congested entry and exit points. In addition to this, there is inefficient public transport and a weak secondary and tertiary network of roads, which is important for shorter commutes through walking or cycling,” said an official.

This was four months ago. The government, however, has not taken a decision yet.Most of these sub-castes are wandering communities and are neither included in SC or BC category. National BC welfare association president R Krishnaiah said that a majority of these sub-castes are most backward but could not be brought under the SC list as they do not fall under the ‘untouchables’ category.However, a demand for their inclusion in either SC or BC category had been pending for long, BC leaders aver.The Ramulu commission conducted public hearings and found that 15 sub-castes deserved to be extended reservations under BC category. Krishnaiah said some of the sub-sects in BCs are more backward than even SCs and STs.

213,['22/02/2020'],"Delhi honour killing: ‘We expected outburst from our families, but not murder’","This story is from February 22, 2020

Sheetal Chaudhary

NEW DELHI: The love affair between Ankit Bhati and Sheetal Chaudhary had blossomed while they were helping a common friend look for a match. They had managed to keep it under wraps for two years until Bhati’s parents found out about it from a relative. They had reluctantly agreed to their union, but had warned Bhati against marrying Sheetal due to the alleged notoriety of her family in the village.

Sheetal was later allegedly murdered by her family members, who were angry over her “secret marriage” with Bhati, who belonged to the same gotra. The family of the 25-year-old woman from east Delhi allegedly murdered her and dumped her body in a canal in Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh. While the murder took place on January 29, her body was found on January 30.

“I had pleaded with Sheetal’s family members to free her and sort out the differences later. They instead murdered her,” rues Ankit.

The couple had secretly married at Arya Samaj Temple in Kondli, with one of Sheetal’s friends and Ankit’s cousin as witnesses. Their plan was to reveal about it after three months when the court approved their marriage.

“We expected an outburst from our families, but not murder,” says Ankit.

In mid-January, Sheetal had revealed about the wedding to her parents after which they had stopped her from going to the college and even stepping out of home alone. Following Bhati’s persistent efforts to get in touch with her, Sheetal somehow managed to call him on January 29. She informed him that her family was planning something sinister and had called the other members for a meeting.

“Her phone was switched off after this and Ankit was frantically trying to get in touch with her,” says one of Ankit’s cousins. The next day they murdered her. Ankit had, however, presumed the worst and had complained about his wife’s disappearance to the village sarpanch. On February 6, the sarpanch had even called Sheetal’s father, Ravinder Chaudhary , to resolve the issue. Ankit’s kin recalled that Chaudhary had openly claimed to have eliminated Sheetal, and challenged them to bring him to court.

The two families stay in the same locality in New Ashok Nagar. Ankit’s relatives recall how Sheetal was branded as a victim of harassment at the hands of the Bhati family and the neighbourhood was made to believe that she was pursuing further studies at her uncle’s house in Haryana.

Ankit had reached the police station on January 18 with a complaint of kidnapping.

“Sheetal’s family asked her to cut ties with Bhati. But when she refused, they decided to murder her,” police say.

“Ankit has been restless for justice ever since he came to know about the incident. We are trying to counsel him, but it is tough job to do at the moment,” his cousin adds.

“When Ram was exiled to the forest, he took help from monkeys, dwellers in forests and caves and other people from the lower social strata of society to achieve his goal. Likewise, in the construction of Ram temple, donations will be accepted from all including the high and the low and the rich and the poor,” the seer alleged adding that “the bricks brought by karsewaks after shilapoojan and stones being cut for decades will all be used in the construction of the temple.”

216,['22/02/2020'],Kolkata: A city’s dream takes shape 33 metres below the river,"Tracks being laid below the riverbed

KOLKATA: Laying of tracks for the East-West Metro corridor along the 520m tunnel has been going on in full swing 33m below the Hooghly riverbed. The underwater tunnel is the prime attraction of the 3.8km Howrah Maidan-Esplanade section.Under the riverbed, around 1,100m of tracks (520m each way) has to be laid. Of it, 450m inside the river tunnel has been completed and another 650m is left.A lot of water has flown below the Howrah bridge since the twin tunnels crossed the river, snaked through Kolkata’s congested areas to reach Mahakaran station (below Laldighi at Dalhousie Square), and burrowed beyond to Esplanade (from where another set of tunnels are now headed towards Sealdah). “Constructing the tunnels, 33m below the riverbed, has been an engineering feat,” said an engineer of Afcons.Truncated services of East-West Metro between Sector V and Salt Lake Stadium stations have started last week. While tunnelling has resumed from Bowbazar and work is in progress at other stations simultaneously, the underwater part of East-West tunnels are getting finishing touches. But the “touch” is quite an elaborate affair.According to engineers, the track-laying work in underground section is a big challenge, especially under the riverbed, since there are sharp curves along the entire stretch. “The track is being laid and manoeuvered along three major curves,” an engineer of Kalindee-Rahee said. KMRC is committed to complete the work of laying the tracks in another two months.While construction major Afcons, which is currently constructing evacuation pathways inside the river tunnels, is contracted to build the 3.8km underground stretch, Kalindee-Rahee, a joint venture company, is laying the tracks along 16km stretch from Sector V to Howrah Maidan. They have already laid tracks from Sector V till Sealdah. And now it is the turn of the Howrah side of the corridor to get the ballastless tracks.The track contractor started laying tracks inside both east and west tunnels passing through the river in January-end. Tunnelling of the river was done in four months in 2017 and construction of the corridor from Howrah Maidan to Esplanade was over in March 2018, after which the track-bed concretization work was done.Meanwhile, Afcons has completed the “bracketing” work inside the underwater tunnels. Fabricating this many brackets — more than 1 lakh — and installing them along the semi-circular surface of the twin tunnels is no mean business. Electrical cables will be mounted on the brackets, along with lights and other fixtures. It will be followed by ventilation work.In another two years, the entire 16km corridor will be commissioned, railway minister Piyush Goyal had promised last week at the first phase inauguration of the rapid transit link that will have trains cruising at 80kmph.Once fully operational, India’s answer to Eurostar will connect Howrah Maidan with Salt Lake’s Sector V, joining the two iconic railway stations — Howrah and Sealdah — along the way.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74251952,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-603397,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/a-citys-dream-takes-shape-33-metres-below-the-river/articleshow/74249109.cms

Ladakh MP Jamyang Tsering Namgyal gives a lecture at Hedgewar Smarak Samiti, Reshimbagh, on Friday

Nagpur: Abrogation of Articles 370 and 35A of the Constitution of India and making Ladakh a union territory (UT) have started showing results as people are getting many facilities they were deprived of over the last many decades, said Jamyang Tsering Namgyal , MP , on Friday.

He was speaking on ‘Ladakh: Kal aur aaj’ at a programme organized by Jivhala Foundation at Maharshi Vyas Sabhagruh, Dr Hedgewar Smarak Samiti premises, Reshimbagh, to mark Shivaji jayanti.

Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) functionary Shridhar Gadge, president of J&K Study Centre Meera Khadakkar, legislators Anil Sole and Mohan Mate, Manish Meshram and Ashish Vandile were present.

Jamyang, who represents Ladakh in Parliament, said, “Removal of special status to Jammu and Kashmir was a decisive step the Union government took.” Terming the government decision as historic and bold, Jamyang said earlier, no higher education facilities were available to children after schooling while unemployment was a perennial problem. The things are now changing for better with many universities coming up in Ladakh while prospects of job are looking up. This will help develop the region, he added.

“The Union government has beefed up security so that forces inimical to our country’s sovereignty can never dare to resort to any misadventure. People now feel secured. We need a strong government in future also so that attempts to disturb peace are thwarted,” he said.

“Ladakh is not just a piece of land but an amazing destination where people of kind hearts live. It is a place for adventure, meditation, tourism and cultural heritage,” he said.

It is important to ensure proper communication between people and the authorities for development and make the world a better place to live in, he added.

In his address, Gadge mainly spoke about Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) which is being opposed by many parties. He dispelled the notion that CAA will take away the citizenship as is feared by some sections of the society and said it is a misconception.

Canards spread by vested interests, fake news and miscommunication are the major reasons why some parties are opposed to CAA. Tightening security of the country is priority of the government which every law abiding citizen should respect, he added.

The programme started with paying obeisance to Lord Shiva on Mahashivaratri and saluting the great Maratha warrior Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.

Vandile made the introductory remarks.

Anchor Abhijit Muley said it is of paramount importance to inculcate in people values to tread on the right path. Instead of only talking about the valour of Shivaji Maharaj, people should follow the principles Chhatrapati held close to his heart, Muley said.

Tushar Mahajan, secretary of Jivhala Foundation, proposed a vote of thanks.

219,['22/02/2020'],"East-West Metro's tunnelling to end by March 2021, says experts","This story is from February 22, 2020

International experts involved in the project said on Friday.

KOLKATA: The last leg of East-West Metro’s tunnelling that resumed on Tuesday will be completed by March next year , international experts involved in the project said on Friday.

TBM Chundee, which was digging the west-bound tunnel, has now become defunct after puncturing an aquifer in August last year. It’s twin, Urvi, will complete the remaining job. According to the experts, Urvi will take five months to burrow 1km eastwards till Sealdah, four months to get dismantled and another three months to dig back 800m to Bowbazar.

Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation (KMRC), the implementing agency of East-West Metro, had set up the expert panel soon after the August 31 disaster that damaged several buildings in Bowbazar. Now, the committee is mandated by Calcutta high court to rigorously monitor the tunnelling work.

“We are accountable to the court and will be monitoring as per its directions,” said committee chairman John Endicott, the Hong Kong-based British geotechnical expert with 50 years of tunnelling experience. Others in the panel are Endicott’s colleague Christopher Bridges , General Consultants (GC) project director Ken Wong and Thailand-based Yuthana Charoenpak, the tunnelling manager of ITD ITD-Cementation, which is contracted to build the 2.5km twin tunnels between Esplanade and Sealdah.

“We have dug an additional 22 boreholes to view the soil profile. There’s nothing unusual about the water. The initial inflow doesn’t matter. But if there is a slight leakage, there is provision for the refurbished TBM (Urvi) for arresting the water in 60 minutes,” explained the experts.

Bridges informed that Urvi has dug around 20m since Tuesday. “It’s moving very slowly. We are still testing the system. When the TBM gathers speed, it will dig around 10m a day.”

A number of features have been added to the machine, which now has sensors to sense anything unusual. There are steel plates to ward off water, provision to inject grease and grout after mining, as each ring is created and various monitoring points to check the parameters during digging.

Referring to the fateful afternoon of August 31, Endicott said water had continuously flooded into the tunnel for two-and-a-half hours, bringing with it silt and sand that led to large-scale ground settlement and had buildings falling one after the other. “There are aquifers everywhere along the East-West Metro’s tunnelling path. If you can stop the water inflow in an hour’s time, you can prevent silt and sand gushing along with it. And that’s what the upgraded machine is now equipped to do,” Endicott said, adding, “The idea is to keep the seal of the TBM dry.”

The seal, a vital component of the TBM, Endicott said, had given away on August 31. “The seals didn’t work. We don’t know why and this led to flooding of the tunnel in Bowbazar. Now there’s a new seal of the tail skin brush and provision to replace the seal if the existing one goes off,” Endicott said.

KOLKATA: The Commissioner of Railway Safety (CRS) has granted permission to Eastern Railway (ER) to construct a level-crossing across the tracks at Tallah. This is an interim measure to ensure smoother movement of traffic and the crossing will be shut down after the new Tallah Bridge is constructed. A similar level-crossing was constructed at Majerhat after the road overbridge (ROB) collapse there.

“A General Arrangement Drawing (GAD) approval for the ROB at Tallah has also been received and sent for CRS sanction. This is the first step towards start of the ROB construction process. Once the CRS sanction is received, meetings will be convened with the state government to decide the design and other issues. Demolition of the existing structure has already started and we will take special measures when the portion directly above the tracks is brought down,” a senior ER official said.

In another development that raises hopes for quicker completion of the new Majerhat ROB, all documents and drawings sought by the CRS have been sent to him by ER on Friday. Work can start in full swing as soon as the CRS carries out an inspection and grants clearance.

According to the RAILWAYS official, the documents were received by the PWD on Wednesday and no time was wasted in despatching them to the CRS. Though a railway officer, the CRS is a post under the ministry of civil aviation and even the railways has no say in any decision he takes.

Panaji: FC Goa very well know they have to raise their level next season when they become the first Indian club to participate in the AFC Champions League. But for now, the Super Cup champions will turn their focus on the Indian Super League ( ISL ) title that has eluded them twice.

Last year, FC Goa fell short in the final against Bengaluru FC , while in 2015 it were Chennaiyin FC that broke Goan hearts on home soil in a thrilling 3-2 summit clash at Fatorda.

Now, FC Goa could face either one of their familiar rivals in the last-four clash after Chennaiyin sealed their playoff spot on Friday with a 1-0 win over Mumbai City FC. The playoff lineup will be decided on Saturday after defending champions Bengaluru host ATK . And FC Goa will certainly watch it keenly.

“If you go to see, in the next three games there is only one knock out that is the final. Whereas we have two semifinals, home and away. But then it is important we win and give ourselves the best chance over these two semifinals to reach the final,” said FC Goa interim coach Clifford Miranda.

Clifford was put charge of the team only in the last three matches after the management parted ways with Spanish coach Sergio Lobera, who was highly admired for his influence in Indian football in his three-year stay.

But Clifford, under the mentorship of technical director Derrick Pereira, have made the transition smooth without making much changes. They will stick to follow the same pattern and not break FC Goa’s rhythm.

“We will not go any different way because it will mean changing our way of playing. We will go the same way that gets a closer in reaching our objective and will play our natural game,” said the former India midfielder.

Ever since losing 2-0 to ATK in Kolkata, FC Goa have responded strongly in their next five games and remained unbeaten. They scored 14 goals alone in their last three games, conceding only three.

“The players are top professionals and have been working very hard all throughout the season right from day one. Credit should go to each and every one associated with the club right from the beginning. It’s not just last three matches but hard work of everyone who have been there throughout this season,” said Pereira.

FC Goa will get sufficient rest before their first leg semifinal either on February 29 or March 1 but with their current form, look favourites to progress no matter who they play.

230,['22/02/2020'],Trichy-Karur road widening to get going in two months,"This story is from February 22, 2020

Trichy: After sitting on the proposal for six months, the state highways department has finally decided to launch the civil work to widen a narrow 11km stretch of Trichy-Karur national highway in two months. A veritable death trap for commuters, the stretch serves as a crucial link for the western districts with Trichy and delta districts.

In the past five years alone, the road has witnessed at least 82 fatal accidents owing to its narrow width and steep curves. However, six months after the widening proposal received administrative sanction, the delay in starting the work has been frustrating for the local people commuting on the accident-prone stretch. The miscalculation of commuters, mostly two-wheeler riders who try to overtake vehicles along the steep curves, often ends up in fatal accidents.

“We are commuting amidst threat to our lives every day. The widening project should not be withheld further,” P Aiyarappan, a road safety activist, said. Jeeyapuram police station, under whose jurisdiction the Karur road falls, has recorded over 300 road accidents in the last five years of which a majority was reported from the stretch. It was in early 2019 that the state highways department identified the cause of the accidents and proposed to widen the stretch bowing to public demand. The Rs 55crore proposal received administrative sanction in August but there has been no further progress.

Confirming the plan to widen Karur road, highways department said it will float a tender for identifying a suitable contractor on March 18. The 7-metre-wide road will be expanded to 10.5 metres and the steep curves standardised to avert toppling of vehicles. However, the proposed widening seems to have excluded the proposal for a new bridge across Kudamurutti river to replace the ageing two-lane bridge. A new bridge estimated to cost Rs 20 crore is likely to be taken up as a separate project. “The widening project will go on for a year and one end of the road will be widened at a time,” an official with state highways department told TOI.

Representative image

TRICHY: The district administration on Thursday conducted the monthly road safety review meeting to discuss the need to make Trichy roads safer. However, a section of road safety activists lamented that such discussions were often conducted secretly.

For better performance of the road safety council, local people have sought the participation of additional and rural representatives to convey their grievances as the majority of complaints taken up at the meeting pertains to city roads.

The mandatory road safety meeting chaired by district collector S Sivarasu and attended by senior police officials at the district collectorate discussed the road safety concerns of the common public.

The district administration said it is permitting two members belonging to non-governmental organisations to raise road infrastructure needs.

“We were told about the conduct of the road safety meeting only after it was over. District administration should invite more people to hear grievances regarding road safety and suggestions to avoid traffic congestion,” K Shyam Sundar, member of Trichy Intra-City Development Endeavours (TIDES) said.

The demand to allow media coverage at road safety meetings as in farmers’ grievance meetings remains unaddressed. “Most of the demands placed at road safety meetings and the press releases we get to see were city-based issues. Rural roads that are deprived of road safety infrastructure are neglected,” V Baskaran, a resident of Vayalur Road said.

When asked about the possibility of increasing public participation at road safety meeting, officials in the district administration gave an elusive answer. “We will think about adding new members to the road safety council,” an official said.

Street vendors near war memorial in Gandhi market

TRICHY: A couple of weeks after the state government earmarked Rs 700 crore in the budget for the first phase of the Cauvery–Vaigai–Gundar river linking project, farmers in Trichy have urged it to modify the project to benefit rain-fed Manapparai, Marungapuri and Vaiyampatti .

Members of the Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangams of the CPI and CPM as well as of Desiya Thennindiya Nadhigal Inaippu Sangam staged a demonstration in front of the district collector’s office on Friday demanding that the link canal be taken through the three areas instead of directly to Pudukottai from Mayanur in Karur across Cauvery . Trichy collector S Sivarasu was chairing the monthly grievance day meeting when the farmers demonstrated outside.

At present, the project proposes to link Cauvery with Vaigai through the 255.60 km-long canal passing through Trichy, Pudukottai, Sivaganga, Ramanathapuram and Virudhunagar districts. While welcoming the project, the farmers said water problem remains perennial in Manapparai, Marungapuri and Vaiyampatti taluks where farmers depend on rain for agriculture. “This suggestion is not new, so farmers were shocked to find the project omitting the three taluks,” said the CPI-affiliated Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam’s district secretary Ayilai Sivasurian .

“About 70 kms of the canal will have to be constructed to take the project through the three areas but it is worth it for the sake of the people in the area where water crisis is looming. We request the government to conduct a feasibility study on this before launching the project,” said the district secretary of the CPM-affiliated Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam V Chidambaram. State president of Desiya Thennindiya Nadhigal Inaippu Sangam P Ayyakannu also suggested shifting the location of branching out of the link canal from Mayanur to a place parallel to Manapparai, Marungapuri and Vaiyampatti.

Delhi Commission for Women

NEW DELHI: Women and child development minister Rajendra Pal Gautam on Friday met Delhi Commission for Women chief Swati Maliwal to formulate an action plan to ensure women’s safety at the grassroots.

Gautam said ensuring women’s safety was a priority for the AAP government and plans were afoot to deploy mohalla marshals and set up mahila panchayats in the next few months to achieve the goal. “DCW has done exemplary work in the last three years. In AAP’s guarantee card, women’s safety has the topmost priority,” the minister added.

Making Delhi safer for women was among the 10 promises made by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in his guarantee card released in the run-up to the elections. Kejriwal and his cabinet colleagues had held a meeting with officials on Wednesday for the implementation of the guarantee card in a time-bound manner.

Apart from installation of CCTV cameras and streetlights across the city, the government has promised deployment of bus marshals and mohalla marshals to make women feel safer. “The deployment of mohalla marshals will be a revolutionary step in ensuring overall security and safety at the grassroots level,” Gautam said after meeting the DCW chief.

Maliwal said a pilot project on mohalla marshals was done in Burari where civil defence volunteers conducted regular checks at vulnerable locations. “The results were outstanding and the same model should be implemented across all 70 assembly segments,” Maliwal said in a statement.

The minister has asked DCW to set up a special SC/ST women’s welfare cell.

235,['22/02/2020'],Too little of Trichy in govt exhibition on 3 years’ achievements,"This story is from February 22, 2020

Trichy: The photo exhibition organized by information and public relations department near Trichy central bus stand on Friday to highlight the three years of governance by the Edappadi K Palaniswami-led AIADMK government had nothing to offer for Trichiites. The photographs of initiatives implemented in the past three years of the state government had very minimal local connect except for the statewide welfare schemes.

As many as 39 photos were displayed at the exhibition conducted as a report card of the state government. Photographs of events organized by various departments including agriculture engineering, youth welfare and sports development were among those displayed. Interestingly, even the photographs taken in 2014 were displayed at the event intended to project the past three years of achievements. While most of the exhibits were pan-state welfare schemes and initiatives, the exhibition had nothing to boast as achievement or fulfilment of the demands of Trichy.

Ironically, the congested central bus stand where the event was organized is itself a hot topic on the development front as there is a long-pending demand to relocate it to a spacious integrated bus terminus on the outskirts. “As far as Trichy is concerned, there is nothing to hail as achievement in the past three years, Gandhi market was not relocated and Srirangam is yet to get a bus stand. Neither old proposals nor any new announcements were implemented to develop Trichy,” V B Jaganath, a resident of Karumandapam, said.

Among the 39 photographs and a few banners displayed, only three photographs seem to project the welfare schemes or innovative projects focussing Trichy, namely resting room for TNSTC drivers and traffic park at old collectorate. It is to be noted that the traffic park installed at old collectorate was jointly funded by several private organisations here. Officials who organized the exhibition maintained that the photographs were selected to highlight the statewide schemes and not focussing Trichy.

236,['22/02/2020'],Rare snake eye lizard spotted on Kolli hills,"This story is from February 22, 2020

TRICHY: Leschenault's snake eye lizard – from the lacertid lizard family- endemic to Western Ghats in India and eastern Sri Lanka, has been spotted for the first time in Puliyancholai of Kolli hills. Puliyancholai is a popular tourism destination located in the foothills of Kolli Hills near Thuraiyur, which is about 72 km away from Trichy.

Leschenault's snake eye lizard, named after a France botanist, has transparent lower eyelids that are fused with the upper lids to form a cap over the eye. Scientifically known as Ophisops, they look similar to Skinks, which are very common. While Skink have cylindrical body unlike the Leschenault's snake eye lizard, which have conical body, are not spotted in Kolli hills region, which falls in the Eastern Ghats , said Q Ashoka Chakkaravarthy, field biologist from Centre for Ecology and Conservation, Trichy. It took Chakkaravarthy over a month to confirm the species based on the scale and other features.

During British era, this species was locally distributed in Salem and Coimbatore districts only, especially near the banks of river Cauvery, but it has now been recorded at Puliyancholai, Chakkaravarthy said. Fragmentation of the forest is posing threat to reptiles and amphibians, he said and urged the forest department to take steps to conserve these rare species. Chakkaravarthy said that these reptiles are over-exposed to predators such as domestic cats, poultry and birds and climatic change because of degraded habitat.

“Deforestation with consequent habitat fragmentation is the biggest threat to reptiles and amphibians in this region. This could be a reason why population of many reptile species has been considerably declining,” he said.

“Leschenault’s snake eye lizard was last recorded in Gingee hills in Villupuram in 2018,” said V Gokula, head of zoology department, National College Trichy (NCT).

Gokula said that the spotting of this species in Kolli hills is an additional record. He said that it is an interesting range extension for the species as it was so far found only in Coimbatore and Salem along Western Ghats. While Kolli hills, too, is remanence of Western Ghats, Leschenault's snake eye lizard was not spotted yet in Kolli hills.

238,['22/02/2020'],Manish Sisodia seeks Delhi’s share in central taxes,"This story is from February 22, 2020

<p>Nirmala Sitharaman and Manish Sisodia<br></p>

NEW DELHI: In a meeting with Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday, deputy chief minister and state finance minister Manish Sisodia sought a share for Delhi in central taxes, besides allocation of funds for the three corporations on the lines of the Centre providing funds to local bodies of other states.

Delhi government gets a grant in lieu of a share in central taxes, which has remained stagnant at Rs 325 crore since 2001-02. “I urged the Union finance minister to give a share in the central taxes so that work can be expedited on establishing more schools and hospitals, Yamuna is cleaned and adequate water and electricity is supplied in the city,” Sisodia said.

In a letter addressed to Sitharaman, Sisodia referred to the erstwhile Article 270(3) of the Constitution, which defined the share of taxes between the Centre and Union territories. Omission of Article 270(3) in the year 2000 has resulted in Delhi not receiving its rightful share in central taxes.

“The Constitution (80th Amendment) Act, 2000 was passed by Parliament primarily for including corporation tax with personal income tax for resource sharing between states and the Union government. It replaced Article 270 with a new set of provisions. This has had an adverse impact on the state’s finances,” Sisodia mentioned in the letter.

The deputy CM further said: “The 15th Finance Commission in its report for financial year 2020-21 has provided 1% of the divisible pool for the newly formed Union Territories of J&K and Ladakh and assigns the same to the central government. As you are aware, J&K and Delhi are on a similar footing within the Constitution as UTs with legislature. Accordingly, additional terms of reference to the finance commission would bring justice to the people of Delhi and rectify the anomaly created by the inadvertent omission of Article 270(3).”

Sisodia also said that Delhi has not been given any share in central taxes since 2001. “It is important to mention that 42% of central taxes are given to all other states based on the recommendations of the finance commission. Before 2001, Delhi also used to get a share in it,” he added.

Highlighting that Delhi government needs to make large investments in education, health, social welfare, food security, transport, roads, healthcare and other sectors, Sisodia said that if Article 270(3) had not been omitted, then Delhi would have been getting Rs 7,000 crore annually as share from central taxes.

“I requested for funds for the municipal corporations of Delhi in the same way as other states get from the central government,” Sisodia said.

Sisodia also referred to the recommendations of the Arjun Sengupta Committee according to which the central government had in 1997-98 agreed to bring the funding pattern of Union Territories similar to that of other states.

PUNE: The head of an Alandi-based spiritual eduction centre was taken into police custody on Friday on the charge of brutally assaulting an 11-year-old student with a stick because he was allegedly not learning his lessons and left work assigned to him incomplete.

“The boy, Om Raju Chaudhari, failed unconscious due to fluid build up in his chest after the suspect beat him on his chest and other pars of the body. We have shifted him to a private hospital in Pimpri,” senior inspector Ravindra Chaudhar of the Alandi police station said.

Om is currently undergoing treatment at the paediatric intensive care unit of the hospital. A doctor said, “The boy is on ventilator support. His condition is critical.”

The officer said, “We have arrested the suspect, Bhagwan Maharaj Povhane (30), of Alandi. He has been charged under section 307 (attempt to murder) of the Indian Penal Code.”

The boy’s mother, Kavita Chaudhari (28), a resident of Ambi in Vadgaon Maval, lodged an FIR with the police.

The suspect runs a spiritual training centre at Alandi where Om had been studying for a year. In early February, Kavita was informed that Om was not well and the caller told her to take her son home.

“Kavita rushed to the centre and found that Om was unconscious. He was admitted to a private hospital at Talegaon Dabhade,” Chaudhar said.

He said after gaining consciousness Om told her mother that Povhane had brutally beaten him with a stick.

A police team took Povhane into custody from Parbhani district.

Nashik: Two NMC corporators have been booked by the city police for allegedly violating the noise pollution norms in two separate incidents during the Shiv Jayanti celebrations in the city on Wednesday.

The concerned corporators were part of the Shiv Jayanti celebration committees in Nashik Road and the Ambad area ward. While one case was registered with the Nashik Road police station, the other three cases were registered with the Ambad police station.

In the first incident recorded with the Nashik Road police, a BJP corporator heading the celebrations was found guilty of playing sound beyond the permissible limits.

In the complaint registered with the Nashik Road police, the complainant API of the Nashik Road police said that the noise level on the stage was 127.09 decibels, which was more than the recommended sound level.

Corporator, who is also the president of the Shiv Jayanti celebration committee, in his ward said that he doesn’t want to say much on the issue. “I would not like to comment on the issue. The police found that the noise level of the speakers was more than the permissible levels following which they have registered an offence against me,” he said.

Meanwhile, in Cidco area a corporator along with two more individuals were booked by the Ambad police for the same offence.

According to police officials, the members of the concerned committee was informed about the increased sound level. However, the concerned member did not pay heed to the police instructions following which the office bearers of the concerned members, including a corporator were booked by the police.

Shiv Jayanti celebrations were done on a mass scale all over the city and the Nashik Road area. The police were on their toes all through the day to ensure that there was no untoward incident.

249,['22/02/2020'],Dravidar Kazhagam calls for state-wide protests on March 23,"This story is from February 22, 2020

Trichy: Dravidar Kazhagam (DK) president K Veeramani on Friday called for state-wide protests in front of central government offices on March 23 against NEET, the issue of ‘threat’ to the rights of state in education and other issues.

Speaking at the social justice conference of the party held at the Uzhavar Sandhai grounds here on Friday, Veeramani said, “DK is going to organise the protest. It is a token protest against the dangers of orders such as the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) implemented by the BJP.”

Criticising the BJP government of passing the Acts in the Parliament without allowing discussions, Veeramani said the custom of issuing the bills to the members was not followed now. “The guillotining is happening in the Parliament every day in passing the Acts and laws,” he said.

Veeramani also appealed to the people not to consider the protest as something organised by the DMK, VCK, and others against the BJP but a protest against two sides. “It is a protest against the fascist government under the guise of democracy that acts against social justice, secularism, rights of the states, right to education, sovereignty.”

VCK chief Thol Thirumavalavan who spoke on the occasion, termed the recent Supreme Court judgment on reservation in public services a detrimental to the SCs, STs and OBCs. He also recalled the ‘Rath Yatra’ of BJP against Mandal Commission recommendation for reservations for OBCs. Thirumavalavan said that all SC, ST, OBC people should have taken to the streets against the judgment.

Rajya Sabha DMK MP Tiruchi Siva said the anti-CAA protests would not have erupted if the BJP had included Muslims also among the six religions while passing CAA in the Parliament. “Federalism is crumbling, secularism is fading, socialism has become capitalism and democracy is under threat,” Siva said.

CPI state secretary R Mutharasan slammed Tamil Nadu chief minister Edappadi K Palanisami for his government’s pro-CAA stand and not passing a resolution against the CAA in the assembly. tnn

250,['22/02/2020'],Pune: Vehicle papers a must for minors to obtain licences,"Representative image

PUNE: An affidavit from parents seeking licence for their wards and production of vehicle registration documents are now necessary to issue a licence for 16- and 17- year-old minors.The Regional Transport Officer (RTO) Vinod Sagare said vehicle registration documents were necessary to check the class and power of the vehicle before issuing a licence to minors.An RTO official said around four years ago, the Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court had barred 16-year-olds from getting a driving licence.“Granting a licence to a 16-year-old was permitted as per the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 if they rode a motorcycle with the engine capacity not exceeding 50 cc. However, younger children were using 100 cc vehicles, which had greater power. So, granting of such licences was discontinued,” Sagare said.An RTO official said two-wheelers with 50 cc engine capacity were rarely available in India. But, some licences for the category had been issued for children from families who had retained older vehicles, the official said.Sagare said that earlier, parents had to only provide an affidavit granting consent for the issuance of licences to minors. But, now the requirements have changed. “Licences are granted to those over 16 years and below 18 years only after the registration papers are scrutinized as we have to be certain that the minor will use a vehicle below 50 cc engine capacity. However, the number of children and parents opting for such licences is negligible.” he said.Section 4 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, stated, “No person under the age of 18 years shall drive a motor vehicle in any public place: Provided that a motorcycle with engine capacity not exceeding 50 cc may be driven in a public place by a person after attaining the age of 16 years.”Meanwhile, Section 7(2) of the Act stated, “No person under the age of 18 years shall be granted a learner’s licence to drive a motorcycle without gear except with the consent in writing of the person having the care of the person desiring the learner’s licence.”He also said the regional transport office had been taking action against minors found riding on the streets for offences such as driving without a licence or driving a vehicle of a different class that was mentioned on the licence. “It is generally the Pune traffic police that take action against violators. However, if our squad is on ground and comes across such a case, action is taken,” he said.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74254996,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-241606,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/vehicle-papers-a-must-for-minors-to-obtain-licences/articleshow/74249941.cms

Trichy: The state secretary of Communist Party of India (CPI), R Mutharasan, said here on Friday that BJP has come to power for the second term at the Centre. However, they are yet to deliver on their promise about employment that was made before coming to power.

He was speaking after inaugurating ‘Where is my job’ signature campaign organized by All India Youth Federation (AIYF) with the target of getting one crore signatures to remind BJP government of their promise of creating one crore jobs every year.

Addressing at E Pudur, he said unemployment is at its highest in the country. One crore graduates have been awaiting jobs after registering in the employment office in Tamil Nadu alone. “Ruling BJP came to power by promising to take steps to create two crore jobs per year. Five years have passed and they are back again but nothing has been done so far,” he said.

The government agencies conducting competitive examinations for various state government jobs have lost credibility after charges of irregularities.

Today’s youth is losing faith in the government as only those who have money have access to education and job.

A nine-line Tamil inscription was found on the northern face of the sluice pillar.

TRICHY: Two Chola era stone pillars with Tamil inscriptions dating back to 10th century CE have been found near Timmayampatti in Pudukottai district. The inscriptions on granite pillars erected on either side of a sluice of a water tank in the village have mention of people assigned the first right on the water in the pond.A nine-line Tamil inscription was found on the northern face of the sluice pillar. The record identifies the pillar as Neerazhikkal (stone that lets out water). The inscription records that the first water right of the pond had been assigned to a certain Kilavan Pavalakkunru alias Kandankusa Velan. Another inscription, running into seven lines on the southern face of the base, records Vaikai Churri alias Uttamacholan, the headman of Uratturnadu who was given the first right to the water in the pond.“Pillars with Chola records are a rarity even though sluice pillars with inscriptions are found in most districts of Tamil Nadu,” said M Nalini, History faculty member, Seethalakshmi Ramasami College, Trichy who was part of the team that carried out the explorative study. Here, two inscriptions of the same period have been found in a single sluice unit which is rare, she said. R Kalaikkovan, director of Dr M Rajamanikkanar Centre for Historical Research , after examining the two granite pillars, said they have been installed on the inner side of the village tank locally known as Kurunkulam (small pond), near its eastern bund.“They are erected on either side of a sluice locally called as madai. This helps to regulate or divert water collected in the pond for agricultural needs. It is a box-like structure supported on the sides by a pair of such pillars,” he said. Repair work undertaken by bringing larger pipes at the outlet of the pond very close to this Chola structure may cause damage to the existing old sluice. The team suggested that the local people and authorities take proper safety measures to preserve the early structure for posterity.",trichy,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74252353,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-260869,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/chola-era-stone-pillars-with-tamil-inscriptions-found-in-pudukottai-district/articleshow/74249961.cms

Visakhapatnam: The Union ministry of electronics and information technology, in association with the National Association of Software and Services Companies (Nasscom), has sanctioned a Centre of Excellence for IoT ( Internet of Things ) to Visakhapatnam. A delegation of officials from Nasscom and Andhra government recently visited Andhra University to scout for a suitable location for the Centre.

While Nasscom would contribute about Rs 22.5 crore for the Centre, MeitY will provide nearly Rs 9.5 crore for it. The main objective of the Centre would be to develop innovative applications and build domain capability by supporting the startup community. Corporate players will also join hands with the Centre to support young entrepreneurs in healthcare technology, agritech, robotics, automobile, telecom and others.

The Centre would also provide initial business opportunities and market links through their strategic partners, apart from attracting angel investors for the start-ups. The start-ups would get support on various fronts from the team at the CoE IoT such as market research and business model refinement, among others. The CoE will conduct training sessions, lectures and workshops for the enthusiasts.

According to AU sources, AU officials preliminarily identified three buildings for the Centre. “The setup of the CoE has also been discussed with state minister of industries, commerce, information technology M Goutham Reddy during the latter’s recent visit to the varsity on February 19. Once a building is identified and it gets the required infrastructure for the CoE, funds will be released for it,” said the source.

Even though the CoE was sanctioned several months ago, the Centre has not become operational due to various reasons. In fact, there has been no official announcement on the same. It was learnt that the officials from the Software Technology Parks of India recently deliberated on the CoE with AU officials. Now, AU officials want to expedite its setup and make it operational soon.

NEW DELHI: With coronavirus spreading its wings as a global epidemic, Delhi government’s transport department has asked owners of all the passenger vehicles to keep buses, autorickshaws and taxis “disinfected” all the time.The department has also asked the drivers to carry a self-certification stating that the vehicles they are driving are sanitised. The self-certification has also been made mandatory when these vehicles are brought for regular fitness tests at the transport department’s vehicle inspection unit.While asking the drivers to spray “disinfectant” in their vehicles every day, the transport department has urged vehicle owners to ensure that seat upholstery, headrests, handrails, window locks, handles and other parts of passenger transport that are frequently touched by people, are properly cleaned.Hand sanitiser must be available in theses vehicles, the order further stated.The order has been issued by Anil Chikara, the motor licencing officer of Jhuljhuli’s vehicle inspection unit where school and contract carriage buses come for fitness certification once in two years.Chikara said that all public transport vehicles must ensure that they are clean and sanitised. “Even clause 73 of the Delhi Motor Vehicle Rules – 1993 says that all passenger buses shall be disinfected once in two months and the owner shall furnish a certificate to this effect to the state transport authority. Since coronavirus is now spreading as a global epidemic, it should be our duty to ensure that these vehicles do not become the carrier of such infections and diseases,” he added.Chikara further said that nobody is bothered about dirty seat upholstery, stains of hair oil on head rests, stained grabrail along the stairs of the buses and unclean floor of the vehicles. “All of us who travel in public transport and children who board school buses daily come in contact of these parts. The vehicle owners must clean them regularly as first step towards providing hygienic mobility,” added the expert on public transport.According to an estimate, there are about 18,000 buses, over 90,000 autorickshaws and close to 55,000 taxis apart from a large number of e-rickshaws that ply in the national capital.Chikara said he will soon talk to the officials of DTC and DIMTs, which run cluster buses, to ensure that those vehicles are also “disinfected” on a regular basis. More than 40 lakh people travel on these public buses every day.

BALASORE: A 19-year-old woman, who is three-months pregnant , was allegedly thrashed and forced to do sit-ups 20 times by a forest guard on suspicion of stealing wood from the forest.

The incident was reported from Barhapanapashi village under Karanjia forest division of Mayurbhanj district. As news of her harassment spread, Barhapanapashi villagers staged protest and blocked the Karanjia-Baripada road and demanded the arrest of the accused. They also locked the Dudhiani Forest Range office demanding compensation for the victim.

Sarojini Singh, inspector in-charge of Karanjia police station, said a case has been registered on the basis of the complaint filed by the victim. “The forest guard has been detained for questioning and investigation is underway,” she added.

According to the complaint lodged by Sukumati Guria, a team of forest officials led by Kabita Behera, a woman forest guard of Dudhiani Forest Range, raided her house at Barhapanapashi village on Thursday evening, loking for stolen timber.

The woman said the team couldn’t find any stolen item at the house. “Following this, Kabita assaulted me and my 65-year-old mother. Later, she brought me and my brother to the forest range office, where she thrashed both of us and forced me to do 20 sit-ups,” Sukumati said.

She reportedly sustained fracture on her right hand and complained of stomach pain following the assault. She and her mother were first admitted to a local hospital and then shifted to the Karanjia sub-divisional hospital for treatment. Dr Akshay Rath, sub-divisional medical officer of Karanjia hospital, said, “Three months is a critical period of pregnancy. But the woman is doing fine. We have provided her with required treatment and she has been sent back home.”

The incident led her family members to lodge a complaint with Karanjia police. Dudhiani ranger Saroj Kumar Panda said the forest guard has been placed under suspension. “The forest department has also provided an assistance of Rs 10,000 to the victim,” the ranger said.

PUNE: The Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority ( PMRDA ) has placed a proposal before the state irrigation department for charging a one-time water cess of Rs 20,000 from each upcoming flat in the region to build a fund for setting up a water infrastructure system.

While the proposal was earlier cleared for Wagholi in 2018, there is a plan for implementing the same across the 7,000sqkm area in PMRDA.

According to the proposal, the water would be made available from 15 dams of the Maharashtra Krishna Valley Development Corporation. The cost of drawing water from the dams through pipes or canals would be huge and the water cess needs to be collected for this, officials said. However, the same needs to be approved. Already, the PMRDA has placed a demand before the irrigation department for 4TMC water allocation in the area in the next ten years.

The area, which covers 816 villages comprising Maval, Mulshi, Haveli, parts of Bhor, Daund, Shirur, Khed, Purandar and Velhe talukas, has requirement for 12-15 TMC water in the next 30 years.

At present, people in the area rely on groundwater. The estimated current population of nearly 29lakh in the PMRDA limits is also likely to double in the next two decades, which would also push up the demand for water, officials said. A developer said that if the cess has to be paid upfront, then the water should be available when the project is completed as the amount would, in effect, be collected from citizens at the time of booking.

“However, if the housing project is a long-drawn one, then the amount should be collected in phases,’’ said a developer who plans to come up with a project in the area.

263,['22/02/2020'],Why acne refuses to go away in women above 25,"This story is from February 22, 2020

NEW DELHI: Acne in young girls isn’t considered a serious problem. But there are instances when the acne refuses to go or reappears among women who are 25 years of age or older.Use of cosmetics or consumption of diet with high glycaemic index such as pastries, chocolates and ice creams is usually blamed for it.

However, according to a new study by the doctors from Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) hospital, the presence of male hormones may have a significant role to play in such cases. Between November 2017 and March 2019, the dermatology department of RML saw 135 women with adult acne as it is called. These women underwent tests to evaluate their complete hormonal profile. Signs of clinical hyperandrogenism or excessive circulating male hormone were present in 72% of such patients.

More than half of the women (57%), who were tested for hormonal imbalance, suffered from androgenic alopecia (hair loss), 50% had scalp problem, 40% had excessive hair on face and 26% of the women reported history of irregular menstruation, according to findings of the research published in International Journal of Dermatology.

Adult acne has been classified into two major subtypes: persistent acne and late onset acne. The research shows persistent acne patients had a higher incidence of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) and hormonal abnormalities.

Dr Kabir Sardana, the lead author of the study, advised the patients for endocrinological evaluation. “Women above 25 years of age who suffer from persistent acne may benefit from therapy with anti-androgens,” he said. Many women with adult acne may test negative for circulation of increased male hormones, but they have clear clinical symptoms of the same, added Dr Sardana, professor of dermatology at RML. “In our study, clinical hyperandrogenism was seen in 72% cases, while biochemical hyperandrogenemia was detected in only 18% of patients,” he said.

However, doctors advise that one should not start hormonal therapy on their own as it may cause side-effects.

“While young girls have acne mostly on the cheeks and forehead region, those above 25 to 30 years of age have acne in the jawline or chin area. It does not respond to conventional medicines such as antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs. We have to use medicines to reduce oil gland secretion such as isotretinoine and hormonal treatment in the form of oral contraceptive pills,” Dr S C Bharija, who heads the department of dermatology at Sir Ganga Ram hospital, said. He added that the medications continue for up to six months.

He warned against self-medication or use of home remedies with unproven results.

Artistes perform in ‘Kaumarya’ play held at Scientific Society Hall, Laxmi Nagar, on Thursday

Nagpur: Two plays were staged on the opening day of the 59th Maharashtra Hindi Natya Competition, organized by Sanskrutik Karya Shanchalalay, at Scientific Society Hall, Laxmi Nagar, on Thursday.

‘What about Savarkar’, a play written and directed by Pravin Khapre, highlighted the efforts made by the great freedom fighter to bring about a change in the society. Savarkar was a visionary and staunch believer in scientific approach. The drama says his positive approach towards solving the ills afflicting the society will go a long way even in today’s context. The play was staged by Udaan Ek Zep.

It depicted how various ideologies originated in the country and Savarkar’s contribution to the country. The drama depicted how his thoughts were distorted by certain elements. Scenes from the life of Mahatma Gandhi, Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar, Gautam Buddha, and others were also effectively showcased.

Shri Natraj Shaikshanik, Sanskrutik, Krida Sanstha staged ‘Kaumarya’, a play written by Salim Sheikh and directed by Harshad Sasane. It highlighted the life of the people of Kanjarbhat community. It showed that side of the society which is conservative.

The story revolved around a young girl, Surmi, who is forced to marry Suraj due to a promise given by her father. His father was drunk when he promised to his friend that they would get their kids married.

People of this community follow a tradition to check blood as a sign of originality after the marriage. Surmi fails the test and is abandoned by the society. Her husband divorces her and even her parents refuse to accept her.

Surmi refuses to live with the feeling of betrayal by her family. She raises her voice against injustice meted out to her, but the society does not accept her.

The play delivered a message that people should not blindly follow the traditions as there could be some black spots. It forces the society to question the practices harmful to the society.

Various plays will be staged at Scientific Society Hall till March 3.

CLEARED SKHER

Nashik: The Nashik civil hospital could soon have more beds to admit patients.

Public health and family welfare minister Rajesh Tope on Thursday visited the civil hospital and found that all the 540 beds were occupied. He was informed that more beds need to be added to the hospital so that it can better cater to the patients coming from all over North Maharashtra.

District civil surgeon Suresh Jagdale confirmed that that they would soon be sending a proposal of adding 200 more beds to the hospital. The new facilities would be built within the same premises.

“Space is not a problem for constructing the 200 additional beds. The number of floors in each hospital wing can be can be increased. With the addition of beds, more doctors will also be appointed to the hospital,” said Jagdale.

Apart from the 540 beds in the hospital, the out patient department attends to close to 800 patients daily. The hospital is also expected to get good quality equipment for diagnosis and treatment. The hospital has won the first prize in the state government’s Kayakalp award twice in four years.

Steps are also being taken to start a medical college in Nashik. Initially, the medical college is expected to function out of the civil hospital. At present, Nashik does not have a government medical college and there is a proposal to set up 120 seats for postgraduate courses and 100 for under graduate courses here.

The Nashik-based Maharashtra University of Health Sciences would be entrusted with the responsibility of running the college. The college would offer postgraduate courses in 11 subjects.

Recently, Tope and Nashik district guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal chaired a meeting about the project in Mumbai. Bhujbal directed the officials to put the project on a fast-track so that at least PG courses can kick off from the upcoming academic year. Both Deshmukh and Tope had assured that their departments would help in starting the PG classes as soon as possible.

The state government and MUHS will soon sign an MoU outlining the details of the project. The university would be responsible for providing the facility for the college and oversee its functioning. “For the first three years, the college would function at the Nashik civil hospital. Till then, a new medical college and hospital would be constructed within the premises of MUHS. There is ample land available within university,” officials added.

267,['22/02/2020'],Ravi Varma’s dilapidated studio to regain past glory,"This story is from February 22, 2020

The studio of ace painter in ruins inside the Palace campus

Vadodara: Art-lovers in Sanskarinagari will get to walk on the art lanes of yore, a time when Raja Ravi Varma created some of his epochal paintings in his 19th century studio in the Laxmi Vilas Palace compound. The famed studio, now a pale reminder of its vibrant days, will get restored to its original glory in around six months’ time.

The royal Gaekwad family has already started reconstruction of the 1880s’ studio in a renovation project that is being co-funded by Indira Gandhi National Centre of Art (IGNCA) and will cost about Rs 40 lakh in the initial stages.

“It is one of the oldest and important heritage structures in the city. But the studio was in dilapidated condition for many years now. We had been thinking of refurbishing it for quiet some time but the structure was in shambles. There was no possibility of revamping it and so decided to rebuild it,” said Samarjitsinh Gaekwad, scion of royal Gaekwad family.

“Heritage experts and architects were consulted before we took up the project as we want to make the studio as original as the old one. Varma’s studio was a simple structure with a gallery and a room. So the original design will be retained. The building will have the original exposed bricks design and will also use limestone and not cement,” Gaekwad told TOI.

The erstwhile Baroda dewan, T Madhavrao had invited Varma to the state in 1881 and soon his works caught the attention of Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III. Gaekwad got a studio built for Varma near the Motibaug Palace where the artist spent a considerable time creating some beautiful paintings.

A young Sayajirao was so impressed by Varma’s works that in 1888, he invited Varma to Ooty where he commissioned 14 mythological paintings illustrating the national epics – Ramayana and Mahabharata – for the decoration of the new Durbar Hall in the new Laxmi Vilas Palace. Later, Sayajirao even gave Rs 50,000 to Varma for starting his printing press.

Though the old structure has been demolished, the Gaekwad family will use the original bricks as much as possible to retain the studio’s earlier avatar.

When asked about the plans for the studio, Gaekwad said that for a few years, IGNCA will have an office there and then the royal family will take over the premises. “We will then decide how we can use the studio,” he added.

268,['22/02/2020'],"Top energy official in Prez team as US, India eye N-deal","This story is from February 22, 2020

NEW DELHI: The Trump visit could mark the return after a long time of civil nuclear cooperation to the centre stage of Indo-US bilateral ties with the US looking to circumvent India's liability law to sign a fresh agreement for supplying 6 reactors to India. In the absence of a trade deal, the proposed agreement for nuclear reactors between US energy major Westinghouse and India’s NPCIL could turn out to be the biggest takeaway from Trump’s first visit to India as president.

While there was no official announcement, official sources said that the US Friday included energy secretary Dan Brouillette in the delegation of the higher-ups who will accompany Trump to India. This is being seen as another sign that the 2 countries are close to finalising the agreement for 6 reactors in Andhra Pradesh .

US reservations over India’s Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage (CLND) Act 2010 and the fact that Westinghouse went bankrupt before being acquired by a Japanese company in 2018 only delayed civil nuclear cooperation with India. The government sees nuclear partnership with the US as important for India’s energy security and one which adds significantly to its clean energy options. Officials said though that any commercial agreement had to be consistent with India’s law and practice.

Official sources here said India has already done enough to address concerns in the US that CLND may make suppliers liable for any nuclear mishap. Indian officials have maintained that India’s liability law, while ensuring strict liability, is channelled to the operator. They have also repeatedly told their US counterparts that India’s decision to create a nuclear insurance pool will help considerably in overall risk-management.

Without giving anything away on whether or not the MoU would be signed, MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar had Thursday said Westinghouse and NPCIL were involved in a discussion to build 6 1100 MW reactors at Kovvada, Andhra Pradesh. ``Following resolution of Westinghouse’s bankruptcy issues, the two sides are in discussion regarding the division of responsibility of the work. NPCIL has visited the U.S. reference plant to understand Westinghouse’s modular construction methodology,’’ he had said.

The 2 countries are currently also having regular discussions on space cooperation, given their long history of cooperation in, as the official said, civil space arena including earth observation, satellite navigation, and space exploration.

``There is a Joint Working Group to regularly review cooperation and identify new areas. Currently, our sides are cooperating in Mars exploration, heliophysics, and human spaceflight. On commercial front, ISRO has launched 209 satellites from US, on-board PSLV, as co passengers,’’ he said, adding that ISRO is also working with the US government agencies for cooperation in safety of spaceflight through exchange of situational awareness information.

Pune Municipal Corporation

PUNE: Only 27 residents availed the corporation’s accident insurance cover in the past one year, triggering posers on the popularity of the scheme.

The data presented before the general body of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) stated that families of 21 citizens who lost their lives in accidents got the benefit of this scheme. Six citizens got financial help for medical treatment after meeting with accidents, the data stated.

“We are trying to reach out to more and more people and inform them about this scheme. More efforts will be made to create awareness about this initiative,” said mayor Murulidhar Mohol.

The PMC had started this initiative for the citizens paying their property tax regularly.

The civic body pays the policy premium for these citizens. The free road accident insurance scheme was a part of the municipal budget and named after Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay.

Owners of around 4.5 lakh properties pay the property tax before the deadline of May 31.

They are all entitled to the special road accident insurance cover of Rs5 lakh for free. The civic administration made a provision of Rs7 crore in the municipal budget for paying the insurance premium.

As per the scheme details, the insured amount is paid to the beneficiaries in case of death or permanent disability. The expenses of hospitalisation are covered in case of serious injuries to the citizen.

The city traffic police data showed that road accident fatalities in 2019 had gone down by 19%. The city recorded 199 fatal accidents and 206 fatalities in 2019.

The year before, the numbers were 240 and 253, respectively.

Representative image

PUNE: The civic body has filed only 60 criminal cases against illegal constructions in a year.

Though the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) had served notices to over 7,500 constructions, action was taken only against 3,500.

Officials cited staff shortage and court cases as the main reasons for taking fewer action against illegal constructions in the city.

A civic official said criminal cases were only filed against property owners repeatedly found guilty of illegal constructions.

Generally, the PMC’s action involves sending notices to owners of illegal constructions, directing them to show cause for not taking proper permission before construction. The notices offer owners the option of demolishing the illegal constructions themselves. If the property owners do not demolish them, the civic administration razes them.

“In some cases, properties can be partly or fully regularised by paying fines or by using additional transfer of development rights or the floor space index . These compounding cases are dealt with in accordance with the provisions of the development control rule,” said an official.

Details of the action taken so far against illegal constructions were revealed in a reply to a written question in the general body meeting of the PMC. The PMC data showed that the city has been divided into seven zones. On an average, 1,000 notices have been issued pertaining to illegal constructions in each zone. “Many issues have cropped up with regards to illegal construction. Property owners have gone to court in some cases. Some illegal properties are occupied by people which limits the action that can be taken against them,” said a senior civic official.

City engineer Prashant Waghmare stated that the illegal constructions mean those which have been built without the permission of the PMC. Any additional construction carried out other than the sanctioned plan is termed illegal.

Civic activists blamed the nexus among the civic staff, politicians and builders for fewer action against illegal constructions in the city.

“Action is not taken against illegal constructions as politicians are hand-in-glove with the developers,” said Vijay Kumbhar of Surajya Sangharsha Samittee, a citizens’ group.

The tilted six-storey building in Munirka

NEW DELHI: Under curious glances of bystanders through out the day, the engineering teams of South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) tried to pull down a six-storey building in Munirka, which tilted on Thursday, with the help of two JCB earthmovers and attached metal wires, but without much “real” output.

The efforts affected the traffic movement across Baba Gang Nath Marg near JNU’s North Gate, but till late Friday evening, the structure just moved slightly towards the road, creating a gap of around 10 inches with adjacent structures, an official said.

A senior official supervising the demolition efforts said the structure had tilted in a way that demolishing it manually would put the lives of labourers in danger while close proximity of other buildings in this densely developed urban village made use of any explosive impossible. “We are trying to pull down the structure. Sending people up means risking their lives while no support can be provided to the structure as it may fall any time,” he said.

Since the building is located on ridge rocks, no machinery can be sent inside to break the beams and the machines can access the structure only from the road, said an engineer. SDMC may now use heavier machineries, but “such machines can only be brought at night”, he said. These machines can be brought only on trawlers, which can enter Delhi only after 11pm.

Besides the JCB machines, a smaller Poclain machine and 15 engineers have been deployed at the site and the corporation has assured that the building will be brought down by Saturday afternoon.

However, the building is not the only dangerously built structure in the Munirka urban village. It is full of six-seven-storey buildings constructed without following any structural safety norms. Renting out these houses is the main source of income here.

Munirka again is not alone; all 135 urban villages in Delhi are now an unplanned mess. SDMC’s engineers get beaten up every time they try to enter these villages to take action, an official of the building department said. “Before the Government of India notification in 2011, people in these villages were not even required to get their building plans passed by the corporation. The situation hasn’t improved much,” he said.

When Delhi was growing, its villages fell under ‘Lal Dora’ boundaries and were exempted from the building bylaws and other regulations of Delhi Municipal Corporation Act. As per the 2006 Tejinder Khanna Committee report, special building bylaws were to be framed for these villages. But nothing happened.

Vijayawada: The Andhra Pradesh Board of Intermediate Education (APBIE) has taken down one of its web page after a cybersecurity expert from France raised concerns over leakage of personal data of students on Thursday.

The web page was to verify nominal roles of the students by giving hall ticket number as input.

The French cybersecurity expert and hacker identified with his twitter handle as Elliot Alderson tagged official twitter handle of Andhra Pradesh chief minister saying that “one of your website leaks personal data of students including Aadhaar numbers, photos, father and mother names”. He asked to contact him immediately to fix the issue.

The additional chief secretary to the chief minister P V Ramesh responded to his tweet saying that the issue was noted and action will be taken following which the web page was taken down.

Interacting with TOI, Alderson said that the hall ticket numbers are very easy to guess and those with some coding skill can gain access to BIE website and download entire data. There should have been additional security layers while designing the web page keeping in view of privacy of the students he said.

When asked about any additional security measures were taken after his red flag, Alderson said “they simply taken down the page that’s all. They did not really add any additional security features,” he said.

274,['22/02/2020'],2.5 lakh properties in PCMC limits stare at huge tax hike from April 1,"This story is from February 22, 2020

The PCMC failed to decide on a ‘rational’ tax system by Thursday

PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Owners of nearly half of the properties in Pimpri Chinchwad will have to shell out two-and-a-half times more in their property tax from April 1 as the general body (GB) of the PCMC failed to decide on ‘rational’ tax system on Thursday.

Under the provisions of Maharashtra Municipal Corporation (MMC) Act, civic bodies have to decide in their general body meetings about any changes in property tax by February 20 every year. If this doesn’t happen, municipal commissioners have the power to take such a decision for the new fiscal.

The civic administration had tabled proposals about rationalisation of rateable value for property tax of units assessed before 2007 and increasing water charges for 2020-21 during the general body meeting.

The general body, however, failed to decide on the issues on Thursday (February 20) as three hours were wasted in exchange of words between the BJP and opposition corporators over crimes against women. When a bitter war of words broke out between the corporators, the meeting was adjourned till February 26.

Municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar had proposed the rationalisation of rateable value in case of old properties, which had to pay less tax than new properties in the same area. As per the proposal, the owners of 2.5 lakh properties assessed before 2007 will have to pay 2.5 times the existing property tax. This will fetch Rs 100 to Rs 150 crore additional revenue to the PCMC.

“The general body has powers to make changes in tax rates till February 20 but no changes were made,” Hardikar said on Friday.

However, not all is lost as decision on increasing water tax can be taken by the general body any time during the fiscal year.

275,['22/02/2020'],Delhi: Decade-long struggle for Chor Bazaar vendors may end with new address,"This story is from February 22, 2020

The bazaar began at Ajmeri Gate with a few shopkeepers selling discarded and worn-out clothes.

NEW DELHI: After a decade of struggle, the squatters at the Sunday flea market (also referred to as Kabaadi or Chor Bazaar ) are likely to get a permanent address with the authorities allocating them space behind Salimgarh Fort on Yamuna Pushta.

A total of 1,167 tehbazari vendors were provided space to operate on a trial basis for 12 Sundays starting December 12. After getting a feedback, a decision will be taken for giving them permanent spots.

Ashwani Sharma, general secretary of Old Edward Park Bazaar Association, said, “In December, the Union urban development minister directed the authorities to give us permission to display our wares on the service road opposite Salimgarh Bypass near Yamuna Bazaar. NGO Sewa Bharat had met the minister to grant us relief.”

On December 4, 2019, a joint meeting between officials of PWD, traffic police, Delhi Police and the NGO was called to discuss the matter. It was decided that all agencies, including the municipal corporation, would highlight problems, such as traffic jams or chaos, if they noticed them during the weekly bazaar.

“If the bazaar operates without any hitch till March 8, then the vendors will be allotted permanent spots there. Otherwise, the market will be discontinued,” said the order issued on December 13, 2019.

Mobile toilets have been provided at the market and no parking or vehicular spillover that can hamper the movement of traffic is allowed on the main carriageway.

While the site belongs to PWD, it was decided in the meeting that South Delhi Municipal Corporation would prepare the plan defining the space for each vendor once the decision for their permanency is taken.

“South corporation will demarcate the space for 1,167 vendors who were given tehbazari licence between 1985 and 1989,” said Devender Singh, general secretary of Kabaadi Bazaar Welfare Association. He added that the vendors have been running from pillar to post since 2009 to get a proper site after been evacuated from various places at least 10 times in the past 60 years.

The market has history dating back to 1942. The bazaar began at Ajmeri Gate with a few shopkeepers selling discarded and worn-out clothes. In the past 60 years, the number of vendors has not just swollen to 1,167, but the market has changed addresses from Shaaz ka Talab to Chawri Bazaar, Red Fort, Jama Masjid, Subhash Park and Delhi Secretariat.

The market was shifted to Jama Masjid from Ajmeri Gate. Later, the vendors were asked to squat at Subhash Park (earlier known as Edward Park) and Kasturba Hospital (earlier known as Victoria Hospital). By then, the number of vendors had increased to 250.

In 1982, it found a new place behind Red Fort. Years later, it moved to Subhash Park near Daryaganj. The turbulent journey of the vendors continued with them being given a new address beside Indira Gandhi Stadium close to Players’ Building (Delhi Secretariat).

“Our real struggle started in 2009, a year before the Commonwealth Games. We moved court after the authorities failed to allot us space. The issue was later transferred to the town vending committee of the municipal corporation. We now see a silver lining,” said Sharma.

276,['22/02/2020'],Face-recognition system at Nashik Road station soon,"This story is from February 22, 2020

Nashik: The Nashik Road railway station will soon be equipped with a face recognition security system as it has made its way to the list of stations marked by the railways in its pilot project of installing face reading/ recognition of passengers.

Under this project, a software has been developed to recognize and track people wanted in criminal cases or history-sheeters. The software will be synchronised with the CCTV system currently installed at the station.

“The software will be synchronised with the CCTV cameras operating at the station. The development is part of the Integrated Security System (ISS) that is being raised at the Nashik Road railway station since 2019,” a senior railway official said.

The face-tracker or face recognition software is the next step of the ISS programme that is being conducted at the railway station.

The railways first covered all the platforms with the CCTV cameras which enable them to track every person entering or exiting the railway station.

“We now have the CCTV coverage covering the entrances, the station, various passenger circulating areas, including the platforms, the foot overbridges, etc. We also have the tracker system in place — meaning if a person is identified — his/her movement can be tracked and captured across all the CCTV cameras,” a Railway Protection Force (RPF) officer said.

The next step of the security cover is the face recognition security system. It will help track people with criminal background.

“The data of wanted criminals, those on the look out notices, those only to be tracked, history-sheeters, etc will be uploaded on the control system. If the person in the said list happens to cross any of the CCTV cameras, it will alert the control room and flash the details of the person. Also, the system will then track the person’s movement on the station premises,” the officer added.

The Nashik Road station is secured with 110 CCTVs. Nashik Road is among the eight stations in Bhusawal divisions which have been fortified with the camera network.

Representative image

PUNE: The Government Railway Police (GRP) have called the loco pilot , his assistant and the guard of the Mumbai-Latur-Bidar Express for their statements to find out what led to the delay in action in connection with the death of a passenger in an assault by 12 men on February 13.

The guard of the Mumbai-Latur-Bidar Express had sent information about a quarrel in the general compartment to the railway control at the Daund station. But by the time action was taken, Sagar Janardan Markad (26), who was travelling with his family, was fatally assaulted by a group of 12 passengers over a fight for a seat.

Markad’s wife had pulled the alarm chain of the train looking for help. But assistance reached only in Daund. “After the chain was pulled, the loco pilot had checked and found out that a quarrel was on in the compartment between some passengers. He had passed on this information to the guard of the train, who, in turn, passed on the update to Daund,” a Pune rail division official told TOI on Thursday.

According to the regulations, once the alarm chain is pulled at a particular station, the information needs to be passed on to the control of the next station. “In this case, the chain was pulled at Hadapsar, Manjri and Loni stations. But other than Daund, the stations in between do not have adequate GRP or Railway Protection Force (RPF) staffers. So the information was passed on to the Daund Junction,” the official said.

The train, after Pune, passed through Ghorpadi, Hadapsar, Manjri, Loni Yard, Loni, Uruli, Yevat, Khutbav, Kedgaon, Kadethan and Patas stations, before reaching Daund. Railway sources said more clarity was needed as to why the information was provided to only Daund. “The other stations also must have at least some GRP or RPF staffers and they could have prevented the assault. It is not possible that all the 13 stations didn’t have any GRP or RPF personnel,” a source said.

The GRP arrested 11 persons involved in the assault, but one managed to escape. “In their statements, the 11 people said the quarrel was unintentional and that they did not know the victim. We have called the loco pilot, his assistant and the guard of the train for their statements. Our jurisdiction is till Loni. The area after Loni comes under the jurisdiction of Daund ,” Pune GRP senior inspector Suresh Singh Goud said.

Sources in the Pune RPF said they had a staff strength of around 500 and a request to increase the manpower was pending with the Railway Board for two years.

Frequent accidents due to the road blocked by construction materials and waste have sparked strong resentment ... Read More

BALANGIR: Unauthorised stacking up of building construction materials on the roads of Balangir poses great threat to commuters. Frequent accidents due to the road blocked by construction materials and waste have sparked strong resentment among residents.

People alleged that despite specific laws to penalise the violators, the municipality is taking no steps to stop dumping of construction materials.

Recently two severe road accidents took place in which two motorcyclists got injured on their head and leg after they lost control when the bikes ran over a heap of sand. One of them is still undergoing treatment.

Sunil Sharma, one of the accident victims, said, “I was returning to my house taking Rugudipada-railway station road. Suddenly, my motorcycle ran over the sand, which was lying on the road. I lost control over my vehicle. The bike skidded off and my head hit a mount of stone boulders.”

He was lucky as he has recovered from his injury. But another victim was unfortunate and he is limping as his left leg was grievously hurt. He is still under medication, said a resident.

“It is really unfortunate that municipality is not taking any action the issue. People are breaking rules without any fear of action. I wrote to all officials concerned about the issue to take stringent action against law-breakers,” said Sharma.

Everyday tonnes of construction materials like brick, sand, boulders are stacked on the roads without any prior permission from the municipality, said an official. Not a single road inside the town is free from construction waste.

Bipin Bihari Deep, executive officer of Balangir municipality, said, “We have a team which is responsible to enforce laws and penalise those violating them by stacking construction materials as well as waste on roads. The team has penalised many people in the town.”

The team comprises an amin, a tax collector and an official.

“When any complaint is received, the team inspects the area and acts accordingly to enforce the law. We will definitely clear all roads where construction materials are piling up to ensure safety of commuters in the town,” said Deep.

Telangana CM K Chandrasekhar Rao

HYDERABAD: In a decision that is likely impact several thousands of cases pending in the revenue courts, the revenue department has instructed tahsildars and revenue divisional officers (RDOs) not to issue orders pertaining to revenue cases in their jurisdiction. The orders have been issued by the revenue department at a time when the state government has begun the exercise on the new Revenue Act. The government is planning to unveil the new Revenue Act in the upcoming budget session.

Activists and petitioners, however, faulted the government and said this would lead to further pendency of the cases.

Both tahsildars and RDOs have powers pertaining to revenue matters and hold revenue courts on every Saturday. Generally, the revenue courts deal with the cases pertaining to rights of records (RoR), Tenancy Act, Inam lands, land encroachments and Wakf-related issues. It helps people to resolve issues without approaching the civil courts.

Official sources confirmed that the instructions were issued to tahsildars and RDOs in Rangareddy district. There is, however, no confirmation if the orders are applicable to the entire state. “District collectors have been asked to get details of all the cases, especially pertaining ROR, Inam lands and Tenancy Act, pending in the revenue courts by holding revenue conferences. The collectors were asked to review cases where orders were passed without any merit,” a senior revenue official said.

On several occasions, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has expressed displeasure over the functioning of the revenue department and even raised the issue of corruption in the tahsildar offices at the recent collectors’ conference.

Some officials see the latest orders as a move to strip powers of the revenue authorities. The government is even contemplating granting some of the powers enjoyed by tahsildars to departments like panchayat raj and do away with village revenue officers.

Meanwhile, activists criticised the latest move. “The revenue department is not holding hearings on regular basis for the last one year as the officials were involved in elections and other government programmes. If the tahsildars and RDOs cannot issue orders, then cases will drag for several months,” P Sivarama Krishna, an RTI activist, said.

Kumar signed an MoU with M/s.Tele Health Services Pvt., Ltd. to provide toll free services and ECG services on a nomination basis.

“The director agreed to pay Rs.1.80/month for each IP irrespective of calls attended. The director also had an MoU with the same service provider to provide ECG services to the patients at Rs.480/ECG at a time when the same is available in other hospitals for Rs.200,” said the vigilance report.

The report said the service provider claimed the bill by submitting call logs of Telangana state IPs and the directors paid the amount without verifying the call logs. The probe found that the service provider utilised services of PG diploma clinical cardiologists instead of qualified DM cardiologists by violating the agreement.

Similarly, after Atchannaidu moved to transport ministry, new labour minister Pithani Satyanarayana vetoed instructions of labour principal secretary Neerabh Kumar Prasad to selectively clear the bills instead of following the first-come-first basis.

AIIMS in Bhubaneswar

BHUBANESWAR: The row over AIIMS Bhubaneswar ’s directive to use Hindi in official communication has intensified with the BJD saying it would demand a withdrawal of the notice even as the Congress attacked the Narendra Modi government at the Centre, claiming it is an attempt to impose Hindi over the state language, Odia.

The AIIMS Bhubaneswar directive, which was cirulated on Thursday, stirred passions on Friday, the International Mother Language Day, as leaders of different parties and social activists criticized the order which has asked all employees of the hospital to conduct oficial business in Hindi.

Pinaki Mishra, BJD’s Puri MP and the parliament party leader in Lok Sabha, said, “We are the first state to be formed on linguistic basis and we will not allow anyone to sideline our mother tongue, particularly by any institution that is working for the people of our state. We will insist that Odia be used since our people are familiar with it and that will make their task of availing service at AIIMS easier. We will formally lodge our protest with the Union health ministry and ask for a change in this directive.” “All the officers in administration, academic section, hospital administration, finance and accounts and heads of the departments are hereby informed to do their work in Hindi and it should be ensured that the staff members working with them are doing their work in Hindi as applicable under the Official Language Rules, 1976,” read the order issued by P K Ray, deputy director (administration) AIIMS Bhubaneswar.

Reacting to it state Congress president Niranjan Patnaik said, “The circular issued by AIIMS Bhubaneswar imposing Hindi is an insult to Odia language and the rich and vibrant culture of Odisha. There is no place for imposing Hindi in our state.”

Koraput Congress MP Saptagiri Ulaka tweeted, “So AIIMS Bhubaneswar has sent directives to speak and write in Hindi. This is another attempt by the Centre to impose Hindi at the cost of Odia in Odisha. Is the state government aware of this and taking necessary steps to stop this?” Highlighting Ulaka’s tweet, Thiruvananthapuram MP Shashi Tharoor added his own, “This government is squandering the hard-won unity of the country built up over seven decades, based on mutual respect and acceptance of diversity. Their narrow-minded insistence on monolithic uniformity (Hindi, Hindutva, Hindustan) will destroy our unity.”

The directive also drew criticism from All India Congress Committee (AICC) secretary and Virudhunagar MP (Tamil Nadu) Manickam Tagore B, AICC national spokesperson Sharmistha Mukherjee and DMK’s Dharmapuri (Tamil Nadu) MP, S Senthilkumar among others. Defending the AIIMs decision, BJP state president Sameer Mohanty said the institute has issued the office order according to the guidelines of Official Language Rules, 1976. “It is an official procedure. They have not written anywhere that they will issue prescription in Hindi or speak to patients in Hindi only. We should not politicize it,” Mohanty said.

Dillip Dassharma, a member of Utkal Sammilani, said “When the whole world is celebrating International Mother Language Day, AIIMS Bhubaneswar is imposing Hindi on its employees. Most of these employees are from Odisha. This cannot be tolerated.”

With the controversy raging, AIIMS Bhubaneswar deputy director (administration) said they are implementing the Official Language Act. “It is a normal practice in central government offices. We have to follow the Act. It is our administrative practice. It will not be applicable to patients,” Ray said.

284,['22/02/2020'],Pig terror keeps farmers at Chhota Udepur awake at night,"This story is from February 22, 2020

Vadodara: Seeing villagers take turns to keep vigil at night is a common sight across the state. While in most cases, this nocturnal vigilance has a specific target — thieves and robbers. But what keeps Chhota Udepur farmers awake at night is a four-legged menace — pigs!

Armed with wooden sticks, farmers in two villages of Chhota Udepur — Pochamba and Vantda of Naswadi taluka — are spending sleepless nights, guarding their precious crops from the nightly attacks.

The farmers take turns to keep vigil at night to protect their crops, be it maize or wheat, cotton and groundnut. Pigs have destroyed every standing crop that the farmers have sowed. As the farmers have little or no money to fence their farms, at least 25 men keep a watch to protect their farms from sounder of pigs every single night.

“Earlier we had to keep a watch during the day but now even at night. If we are lax, our entire crop will be ruined,” said Ashwin Bhil. He added that after the farmers sow the seeds, the pigs dig up and remove them. “If it is ready for harvest they will partially eat the maize and ruin the entire crop. The crop becomes completely useless as even the cattle do not eat it then,” said Bhil, who owns a 3 acre farm.

Another farmer Surendra Desai, who owns 14 acres, has hired seven farm labourers to keep watch. “The harassment of pigs is terrible. “Even the cotton crop is not safe. If we doze off for only two hours at night, we are sure to face huge loss the next morning,” rued 72-year-old Desai. Farmers tried all tricks under their sleeves to hoodwink the pigs, like tying sarees around their crops. If the six yards failed to rein in on the pig terror.

Last year, Desai had gathered documents from all the farmers to prepare for putting up fences around the farms under government scheme. Desai had submitted all documents to the local office of Gujarat State Land Development Corporation Ltd too. However, the file is gathering dust till date.Bhil and Desai’s son Mitesh said that maize is an important crop for tribal farmers of Chhota Udepur as they grow it for their personal consumption and sell only the access crop.

“Market price of maize is around Rs590 per quintal which we cannot afford. We, therefore, grow our own crop. But when the pigs destroy the crops, we have to shell out money to buy food from the market,” Bhil said.

Tribal families eat flat bread or ‘rotlo’ made of maize flour — a staple diet in every household.

Nashik: The District Consumer Grievances Redressal Forum, Nashik has ordered cab aggregator to pay Rs 20,000 to the consumer for cancelling the service without her consent. The forum termed the service as ‘illegal and unfair trade practice’ as the company claimed that ‘it is not a legal entity’.

Brushing aside the contention by the Ola Cab through its counsellor that it was merely a platform of ANI Technologies for providing services of booking of cabs and collection of payments, the Forum in its judgement dated Feb 14, expressed concern over the safety of the people travelling by their cabs and responsibility in case of a mishap.

“The company provides services to hundreds of people every day and yet the company claims that it has no legal entity. Any company in any business has to be registered with the government through various offices even - if it is a grocers’ shop. It is unfair trade practice by the company that gives the service to the people without informing them about its existence, collects money and on top of it ensures that it does not get into any legal hassles emerging from the same,” said the judgement by the three-member forum headed by Milind Sonawane, including Prerna Kalunkhe-Kulkarni and Sachin Shimpi.

The judgement was delivered in case of the complainant registered by Jaspreet Kaur Rana, resident of Nashik city, who had booked the cab aggregator on Feb 20, 2019, to bring her family members arriving from New Delhi at the Nashik Airport.

When the cab arrived, Rana shared the One Time Password (OTP) with the driver and just when they were above to leave the driver added another passenger in the cab, to which she objected to. The cab driver said that the other passenger was going to pay him Rs 800 and she was to be charged only Rs 400. The same would affect her ride. “The passenger refused to allow the passenger in the car booked by her. Upon this the driver of the cab – Vishal Prakash – and the passenger started quarrelling following which the driver cancelled the booking without her consent and left her stranded,” the counsellor for Rana, AS Kulkarni said.

Replying to the notice issued by the Forum, the cab aggregator through its counsellor VS Talekar said that since the company is just a facilitator and the business was owned by ANI Technologies, it had no role in the dispute between the consumer and the ANI Technologies. “The cab Ola Cab is just in the business of communication between the consumer and the company (ANI Technologies). It does not receive any payment from the person who books the car and hence it is not the consumer of Ola Cab. Basically, it is not a legal entity,” Talekar said in the written reply to the Forum.

The forum took notice of this and questioned the company counsellor that when all the businesses are registered, how does the cab aggregator operate staying out of the purview of legal framework. “The question also arises is that when the company is ferrying hundreds of passengers daily, who will be responsible for any mishap with the consumer?”

The forum found the company guilty and ordered them to pay Rs 20,000 as compensation for mental harassment and Rs 5,000 as compensation for charges incurred.

287,['22/02/2020'],"Telangana high court reverses trial court order, awards seven-year jail for dowry death","This story is from February 22, 2020

Representative image

HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court has reversed an acquittal order of a Medak trial court by convicting a man and his parents in a dowry death case and awarding them a seven-year jail sentence.

The court slapped Rs 20,000 penalty on each of the three convicts and also ordered them to pay Rs 50,000 compensation to the deceased woman’s family.

The case pertains to the death of 20-year-old Bhagyalakshmi of severe burns in her in-laws’ house in Narsapur on September 15, 2011. The victim was pregnant at the time of her death.

Though Narsapur police arrested husband Duddala Santhosh, his mother Balamani and father Narasimhulu, the trio came out of jail after they were acquitted of dowry harassment charges by the trial court on January 23, 2013. Bhagyalakshmi had married Santhosh on May 16, 2010.

A bench of Chief Justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A Abhishek Reddy reversed the trial court’s order after hearing an appeal of Talari Krishna, brother of the deceased.

Krishna said his sister faced severe harassment by Santosh and his parents seeking additional dowry. Conciliatory efforts were made by Krishna’s parents and maternal uncle to reach out to Santosh and his parents with a promise to give extra gold. But, Bhagyalakshmi died by then.

Charging the in-laws with killing his sister, Krishna filed a police complaint. The trial court, however, did not take any of the evidence placed before it into consideration and relied on minor discrepancies in the statements of Bhagyalakshmi’s parents and maternal uncle and acquitted Santhosh and his parents.

The high court bench, in its order, said the trial court had failed to shift the burden of the proof to the accused under section 113-B of the Evidence Act. “It has failed to appreciate the fact that the accused have not disproved the facts established by the prosecution. The trial court has failed to draw a mandatory presumption under the law,” the bench said.

Making it clear that there were compelling reasons for it to interfere in the trial court order which was unreasonable, the bench recalled the evidence available on record to prove the dowry harassment and concluded that the woman’s death was closely related to it.

Madurai: With more than one week left for the nationwide Citizen’s Perception Survey to end, the Madurai Corporation has already achieved more than double the number of the target it had set. The survey is conducted by the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs (MoHUA) to rank 114 cities – 100 smart cities and 14 cities with more than one million population.

While the civic body had set a target of 10,615 by February 15, more than 23,500 people had taken part in the survey, which is 222% higher. The overwhelming participation by the city folk has helped the city to be featured among the top 10 cities in terms of best participation observed by the MoHUA. Madurai has shared 8th spot with Thane Corporation among the top 10 cities, Madurai Corporation officials said.

Surat emerged top and Salem secured got 5th position. Madurai and Salem, the only two cities in Tamil Nadu to have featured in top 10 list, made use of the participation and innovative ideas used by the cities to promote the survey.

“We thoroughly followed the information, education and communication mandated by the MoHUA and put of posters, hoardings, billboards across the city. ‘Namma Madurai’- our campaign was organized to sensitise and guide citizens in taking the survey,” said an official.

Officials said that various colleges and places, where people gather in large numbers were covered to create awareness on the survey. With one more week left for the survey, more people are expected to take part.

289,['22/02/2020'],NMC to hold open auction for leasing its properties,"This story is from February 22, 2020

Nashik: The civic administration has decided to hold open auction for leasing its properties. It has also decided to lease properties at 8% of the ready reckconer (RR) rates as against the previous rate of 2.5%.

Nashik Municipal Corporation ( NMC ) recently conducted an audit of its properties and found glaring loopholes in the lease agreement of 900 properties given to private parties and social outfits. In many cases, properties were leased out to parties without any formal agreement while a few others were paying a very low rent. In some cases, the parties concered continued using the properties even after the expiry of the lease period.

Hence, the civic body has decided to put into effect two new policies to ensure lease agreements are given to credible parties in a transparent manner and elected representatives do not have much say on the issue.

Officials from the civic administration said, “The urban development department of the state government has sent a letter directing us to implement a new policy in leasing our properties. As per the new policy, the properties should be leased in an open auction and at 8% of the ready reckoner rates prevailing in the area where the plots are located. The properties of the civic body will now be leased as per the new policy of the state”

“We will soon inform the corporators about the new policy in the general body meeting,” said the officials.

NMC has over 2,800 properties—1,900 of which have been leased out for commercial purposes. The remaining 900 properties have been leased to different social outfits for setting up study halls, community halls, library, laughter clubs, gymnasiums and a host of other facilities.

A few months back, city-based educationist Ratan Luth had filed a public interest litigation (PIL) in the Bombay high court (HC) over the misuse of civic properties.

During a hearing last year, the HC had directed NMC to submit a report on the status of properties that were given to social institutes and NGOs at nominal rates on May 3. The civic body failed to submit the report.

The court then pulled up the municipal corporation for not maintaining a record of its properties. It also directed municipal commissioner Radhakrishna Game to remain present during the next hearing.

On being taken to task by the HC, NMC started taking action against the properties being misused and sealed 382 of the 945 properties it owns across six divisions.

Thereafter, the HC directed NMC to give a detailed history of each property. The civic body has conducted an audit of all its properties and will present the report before the court in the next hearing.

Amaravati: After the vigilance and enforcement report blew whistle on irregularities taken place in purchase of drugs and surgical items in ESI hospitals during the TDP regime, labour minister Gummanur Jayaram said the state government would not spare anyone who was involved in the scandal.

“We will surely send all those responsible for looting of workers monies including Atchnnaidu to jail. TDP leaders have not left behind even daily wagers,” said Jayaram.

YSRC trade union leader P Gautham Reddy demanded the immediate arrest of Atchnnaidu to bring more facts out.

Atchnnaidu condemned the allegations against him saying that the government was trying to implicate him with false charges. “I dare them to take action against me if my role in the scandal is proved,” Atchnnaidu told the media.

He said that he had merely asked the officials to follow the Telangana model in awarding the contracts to avoid duplication and delay in finalization of the contracts. “It doesn’t mean asking the officials to violate the rules. My family had never compromised on values, ethics and principles,” Atchnnaidu clarified.

He said that he was never involved in corrupt practices during his two-decade-long public life.

Former minister and TDP leader Kollu Ravindra said that YSRC government was targeting Atchnnaidu as he belongs to backward classes community. The false campaign against Atchnnaidu is an attack on the entire BC communities, said Ravindra.

Vadodara: A resident of Mumbai was arrested by detection of crime branch (DCB) on Friday for duping a businessman from Anand.

Abdul Rehman Safri was nabbed after Amit Motani filed a complaint of cheating against him at the crime branch. According to the police, Motani filed a complaint on Thursday following which the cops swung into action.

Motani told the police that he was introduced to Safri by a friend about three and half years ago. Safri told him that he wanted to sell off his office space in Mayfair Atrium as he was in need of money. Motani saw the office and decided to buy it for Rs 50 lakh. He gave Rs 40 lakh to Safri in instalments in 2018 and got the sale agreement in his wife’s name.

In May 2019, when Motani went to the office he bought, he saw the name of Bhagirathsinh Jadeja written outside. Motani tried to reach Safri but his phone was switched off.

When he met Safri’s wife in the city, she said she was not in contact with him since a year. Motani then approached the crime branch and filed a complaint of cheating.

Kalvakuntla Kavitha

HYDERABAD: The TRS leadership is considering the names of former Nizamabad MP Kalvakuntla Kavitha and former Karimnagar MP B Vinod Kumar to fill one of the two Rajya Sabha member slots from Telangana, the elections of which are set to be held next month. For the other Rajya Sabha berth, the party may consider an SC or ST leader, sources said.

BJP MP Garikapati Mohan Rao and Congress MP KVP Ramachandra Rao from Telangana are retiring in April this year. TRS secretary general and MP K Keshava Rao is also retiring this April. Though Keshava Rao claimed that he was transferred to Telangana and Ramachandra Rao shifted to AP, a Rajya Sabha bulletin, however, clarified that such transfer did not take place.

Kavitha had lost from Nizamabad in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Though there was speculation that she could be made an MLA, it did not materialise. Vinod, who also faced a surprise defeat at the hands of BJP MP Bandi Sanjay, was later appointed vice-chairman of Telangana State Planning Board.

Sources in TRS said Vinod stands a better chance because of his contacts in Delhi. “Vinod was deputy floor leader in Lok Sabha between 2014-2019 and has maintained good contacts in Delhi. He used to interact with Union ministers and senior officials in Delhi and take up state’s issues with the Centre. Keeping this in mind, TRS chief K Chandrasekhar Rao may send him to the Rajya Sabha,” the sources said.

Among the other leaders, Khammam former MP Ponguleti Srinivas Reddy, former speakers Suresh Reddy and S Madhusudhana Chary have been trying for Rajya Sabha membership. As of now, only BC and other caste leaders were accommodated by the party. TRS has six MPs in the Upper House. MP D Srinivas, though technically is with TRS, has not been on good terms with the party leadership.

Since TRS has clear majority to secure the two berths from the Upper House, its strength is set to rise to seven. The party is planning to play a key role in the Rajya Sabha where BJP does not have sufficient numbers.

But unlike the film, where two political groups fought, here local politicos and students of Dr Ambedkar Arts College in Vysarpadi are locked in a feud. While the party workers are trying to appropriate the compound wall to draw graffiti, the students are using it to spread social messages.Students from the department of social work said they are on a mission to reclaim the compound wall from political parties. Using art as a medium, they are writing messages on substance abuse, female infanticide, conservation of water, unity in diversity and education for girls.(Photo credit: Ramesh Shankar)The wall and the footpath along the college have been in a state of neglect. A student said pedestrians often urinated near the wall and nearby residents dumped garbage on the adjoining footpath.“We wanted to put an end to this. To keep the surroundings clean, we have taken the initiative. It was appreciated by many, including our college administration,” she said.But this has not gone down well with the local members of the ruling party. The party functionaries are trying to take over a section of the wall and have allegedly intimidated the students from painting on the section they claim as theirs.After the students cleaned and whitewashed the wall, local politicians acted swiftly and engaged painters overnight. They painted graffiti professing their loyalty to their leaders and to mark the 74th birth anniversary of former chief minister J Jayalalithaa. The names of CM Edappadi K Palaniswami and his deputy O Panneerselvam featured in the graffiti.“They said they have reserved the wall for the party. They drew a line and told us strictly not to cross it. Our faculty members took up the issue and tried to talk to them but it headed nowhere,” one of the students said.Students are now working till late into the night to wrap up their mural by Sunday. College principal A Geetha said, “We want to encourage the students to restore the institution walls. But there is pressure. We will try to reclaim it.”AIADMK north Chennai (east) district secretary R S Rajesh said students and faculty of the college brought the issue to his notice and he has taken action. “The compound wall belongs to the college.

Introduction of a new road safety department in the main districts including Madurai would reduce road accidents. They also welcomed the proposal for new medical colleges in 11 districts and reduction of stamp duty from 1% to 0.25%.

The Rs 11,000 crore for cooperative agricultural loans, Rs 200 crore waiver of interest on farm loans and allocation of Rs 11,894 crore for agriculture were also welcomed.

Madurai District Tiny and Small Scale Industries Association (Maditssia) has welcomed the allotment of Rs 100 crore to create new entrepreneurs, hike in interest subsidy for MSMEs from 3% to 5% and increase in the investment cap for unemployed youth from Rs 10 lakh to Rs 15 lakh.

Tamilnadu Chamber of Commerce and Industry welcomed the Chennai – Kanyakumari economic corridor scheme as well as diversion of 1,100 tmc excess water from Godavari to Tamil Nadu. However, Maditssia expressed disappointment over lack of a visionary scheme for the sector. It regretted there were no major infrastructure development projects which were badly needed for Madurai. There was also no announcement on metro rail for Madurai to decongest the city. There was no mention about initiatives for fast-tracking the Madurai – Tuticorin industrial corridor of excellence mooted by former CM Jayalalithaa in 2013. A scheme like the Rs 500 crore allotted for a desalination plant at Nemmeli should have been made for Sayalkudi in Tuticorin.

Foodgrains merchants association expressed concern over no announcement to commence kudimaramath works in Vaigai dam despite an announcement made seven years ago.

300,['22/02/2020'],Civic body to build new office building for Nashik East division at Dwarka,"This story is from February 22, 2020

Nashik: The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has decided to build a new office building for Nashik East division in Dwarka area of the city and necessary financial provision will to be made for it in the civic budget for the financial year 2020-21.

After the existing East division office in a British-era building developed cracks, the civic body moved half of the departments to its existing building in Old Pandit colony. The building also houses the office of Nashik West division.

The issue was also raised by the corporators during the recent General Body meeting. Corporator Mushir Sayyad had complained that moving of some departments to Nashik West divisional office building is causing inconvenience to citizens as it is far away from the existing office.

Mayor Satish Kulkarni said that this British-era building will be repaired and renovated shortly. “The civic body has identified a place for the new office building for Nashik East division and this new building will soon be constructed there,” he said.

This British-era structure had developed cracks due to peepal trees growing behind the building. The cracks were exposed after the NMC axed the trees last year.

Following this, the NMC had urged the archaeology department to suggest measures to repair and renovate the structure. Accordingly, an expert team of the archaeology department inspected the building.

Following the inspection, the team suggested the NMC to immediately put soil bags near the walls so that the structure does not collapse.

The NMC has a total of six divisions — Nashik East, Nashik West, Nashik Road, Satpur, Cidco and Panchavati — and all services to city residents are provided through these offices.

Shagun Mehra is working to save elephants dying in accidents

Vadodara: On Saturday evening, the city will host an auction for saving elephants that have been dying on the rail tracks since decades.

Shagun Mehra, an entrepreneur working for conservation of elephants, has organized an auction of valuable items, photographs, paintings and sculptures at the Laxmi Vilas Palace.

Proceedings from the auction will be used for saving the elephants in the wild.

“During my visit to Spain about one-and-half-years ago, a scientist told me that hundreds of elephants die in train accidents. I was shocked to know about it. When I returned to India, I did some research and learnt that about 300 elephants die due to train collisions every year,” Mehra told TOI.

“Elephants are important part of our ecosystem. So I decided to do something about it and began visiting the states that have population of elephants. I also launched Ear to the Wild Foundation (EWF) for conserving elephants and their habitat,” Mehra said. EWF has partnered with Wildlife Institute of India, state forest authorities and the Indian Railways for bringing down the elephant-train collisions.

She added that the money raised from the auction would be used for buying special sensors, conserving habitat of elephants and building bridges that elephants can use. Member of royal Gaekwad family, Radhikaraje Gaekwad, who has come out in support of the initiative, said, “We all know how elephants are dying due to train accidents and something must be done to save them. So I decided to support this cause. If you see, the emblem of Baroda state too has elephants.”

Apart from items, on auction is tea with Gaekwad, cooking lessons from chef Rahul Akerkar, bat having autograph of Sachin Tendulkar and luxury stay at a hotel in Sindhudurg.

Chief Minister of West Bengal

KOLKATA: Offering tribute on the International Mother Language Day , chief minister Mamata Banerjee built her alternative narrative, projecting language as mother and the need to protect the motherland.

“Our motherland is like our mother. We have to work for the unity of the motherland,” Banerjee said at Deshapriya Park on Friday, laying the primacy on language and not on religion. “There have been attempts to break the nation’s unity. I urge people of all communities to stand united and fight for a united India,” she said.

The chief minister’s emphasis on language made it clear that she was speaking about the languages spoken by people of diverse religions and castes. “It is time that people protected unity in diversity . We have to stay together, irrespective of religions and castes. The mother can never be divided,” she said. Minister of state for information and cultural affairs Indranil Sen sang a song written by the chief minister against the new citizenship law.

Banerjee, who inaugurated a work shed for tanneries at Bantala through remote control and a shelter for cobblers at Janbazar, switched from Bengali to Hindi as she felt people from outside the state would find it easier to understand her.

Political analyst Yogendra Yadav , who was present at the programme, said though Hindi was the national language of the country, it was one of the most recent languages, while Tamil, Maithili and Bangla were older ones. “The best way to celebrate the unity of India is to recognize its diversity. Any attempt to steamroll people would be detrimental to the unity of the country,” he said.

“India is not Europe, it is not Israel either. It has its own features. India is a country, which has a khichdi of languages,” said the political analyst, pointing out that if the stress was solely on Hindi, Hindu and Hindustan, the country would be in pieces. At the end of the programme, Yadav said, he held political discussions with Banerjee.

Bangladesh deputy high commission, too, held day-long events to pay tributes to February 21 martyrs on the International Mother Language Day.

CHENNAI: The ‘ Broken Bridge ’ — that once connected Srinivasapuram in Foreshore Estate with MRC Nagar and Adyar — holds the key to decongest an entire stretch of Santhome High Road and Greenways Road, right up to Besant Nagar beach.Underscoring its potential to emerge as an alternative route for the entire stretch, the Madras high court has asked Greater Chennai Corporation to explore the possibility of constructing a wide road connecting Marina Loop Road to Besant Nagar, via the Broken Bridge, to reduce traffic.“It seems that the existing connecting road from Loop Road to Besant Nagar, which is said to have been destroyed in the floods of 1970s or so, still exists in a damaged condition,” the court noted and suggested the corporation and state authorities to explore the possibilities of recreating the link.This will not only create alternative road to reduce the burden of traffic on the beach road via DGS Dinakaran Road to Adyar up to airport, but also provide alternate suitable motorable road for traffic, observed a division bench of Justice Vineet Kothari and Justice R Suresh Kumar on Friday.At present, the two arterial roads get choked during rush hours. A survey of traffic movement on DGS Dinakaran Road and Durgabai Deshmukh Road by the traffic police in early 2019 had found that 32,353 vehicles ply between 5pm and 8pm. During peak morning hours, about 26,120 vehicles use the stretch that connects Adyar and Fort St George.The court made the suggestions after perusing status reports filed by the corporation commissioner and the joint director of fisheries on steps taken to free Loop Road of encroachments and the enumeration of fish vendors, in response to a PIL by Fisherman Care.According to the enumeration report filed by the fisheries department, a total of 356 vendors have been identified in three areas of the loop road. Noting that the vendors are yet to produce relevant documents, the court directed the authorities to ensure the process is complete within three weeks.In his report, corporation commissioner G Prakash stated that action plan for removal of encroachments other than enumerated fish vendors along the loop road will be taken by the fisheries department with help from the civic body and police. The commissioner also stated that design for the permanent fish market is yet to be finalized and the estimate will be prepared before March 15.Noting down the submissions by the civic body that the proposed fish market will be completed by June this year, the court directed the officials to encourage the fishermen to carry on their business in the allotted space. Taking note of the submission by the additional advocate-general that besides the fishermen residing in the loop road area, other fishermen too sell their fish along the loop road, the court asked the authorities to restrict the other fishermen.“It is expected that both police and corporation will ensure free flow of traffic on the loop road area on all days, especially throughout the congestion hours of morning and evening,” the court said and also suggested the authorities to explore the possibility of constructing two foot overbridges (FOBs) from the sea-side of loop road to the proposed fish market area to facilitate movement of fishermen without having to cross the loop road.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74251036,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-172737,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/rebuild-broken-bridge-hc-tells-authorities/articleshow/74250082.cms

SANTINIKETAN: Visva-Bharati is going through an acute financial crisis, it is “ailing and running on life support”, said the university vice-chancellor , Bidyut Chakraborty, at a programme observing International Mother Language Day on Friday.

He went on to say, “On October 2, one cannot enter Raj Ghat as it is too crowded, with all thieves, wearing caps, queue up there. But they act in the exactly opposite way of Gandhiji’s ideals throughout the year.”

Claiming how many have been “milking” the university Chakraborty said, “Visva-Bharati has become a goose that lays the golden eggs. Most people here are good but a handful are using social media and other mediums to tarnish the image of Visva-Bharati. Local businessmen even dared to abuse the vice-chancellor and lodge a complaint of sexual harassment against him. But everyone remained silent.” Local traders recently were up in arms after the permission for Poush Mela stalls were distributed online.

The VC criticized a “section of media” for misquoting him. “A part of my speech was fleshed out to stir controversy. Some teachers, too, post adverse comments online,” he said, adding he was not scared of criticism.

Coimbatore: Six days after a gang stabbed an engineering student, who had refused to hand over his mobile phone , to death at Sulur here , the rural police on Friday arrested six youths in connection with the case.

Police identified them as R Mohan, 21, of Periyar Nagar at Masakalipalayam, S Sathish Kumar, 20, of Patel Street at Vellalore, R Vijay, 21, of Veeramathi Amman Kovil at Vellalore, S Surya, 19, of Periyar Nagar at Masakalipalayam, S Ganesh Vetrivel, 20, of Ondipudur and V Mohanraj, 18, of Vellalore.

Preliminary inquiry revealed that Sathish Kumar, Surya, Ganesh Vetrivel and Mohanraj had become friends while they were students of a corporation school. “They had dropped out from Class X and were doing odd jobs for some time. They later befriended Mohan and Vijay. Surya was facing two cases for causing public nuisance and Mohan, three cases for selling ganja and one for theft. Mohan used to supply ganja to his friends,” a police officer said.

The six-member gang decided to snatch mobile phones from people to make some quick cash. “They used to roam the streets at night to snatch phones. They would sell the phones and buy liquor,” he told TOI.

Last Saturday, around 11.30pm, they targeted D Tamilselvan, 20, of Sadayan Thottam in Nadu Arasur, a third year Mechanical Engineering student in a private college. “He was on the way to his home from a bus stand. The gang waylaid him and attempted to snatch his phone. When he resisted, Ganesh Vetrivel stabbed Tamilselvan in his right chest. When the student cried for help, the gang escaped from the spot on two motorcycles,” the officer said.

Ten minutes later, the gang snatched a phone from K Mahalingam, 25, of Vasantha Nagar at Arasur, who was on his moped. They also stabbed him before taking his moped. They abandoned the vehicle a kilometre away from the crime scene.

Police superintendent Sujit Kumar had formed six special teams to nab the gang. Though the gang members had removed the SIM card from the stolen mobile phone and had inserted a new one, police tracked the IMEI number of the device and arrested them.

Police also seized two motorcycles, a knife and a mobile phone from them. They will be produced before the Sulur judicial magistrate on Saturday.

Vijayawada: Andhra Pradesh Electricity Regulation Commission ( APERC ) has proposed a six-point formula for salvage the ailing power utilities in the state.

In a review meeting with energy department officials on Friday, APERC chairman Justice C V Nagarjuna Reddy asked them to focus on improving transparency, accountability, quality, efficiency, promotion of new technologies and reduction of transmission and distribution losses.

The commission has decided to conduct fortnightly reviews with the power utilities to monitor the development and progress of the sector. The APERC chairman also said that the commission will conduct scrutiny of all power purchases up to date to ensure savings.

Emphasising the need for power utilities to become financially self-reliant apart from ensuring transparency and accountability, the chairman suggested to make cost effective power available to consumers.

Justice Reddy said the commission has made an extensive exercise in deciding the new tariff order that will benefit 99% of the consumers.

“For the first time the tariff order was fixed based on the consumption of billing month as against to the method of levying charges based on consumption during the previous financial year” he said.

Justice Reddy said the commission would lay more focus on improving efficiency of power sector and to ensure affordable and reliable uninterrupted power supply. Referring to considerable increase in power demand in Andhra Pradesh, the chairman told the officials to take all steps to ensure quality power made available to farmers and industrial sectors as it will spur economic growth of the state.

The chairman also pressed for establishing a grievance redressal mechanism from assistant engineer (AE) level to CMD level by setting up complaint boxes. He said the power utilities should work on establishing an emotional connect with the consumers to achieve better results.

The median on the accident spot is less than a foot. Motorists wanted to increase the height of the median on six-lane national highway by at least three feet.

K Subramaniam, 44, a businessman from Avinashi in Tirupur district, is a regular user of the Salem-Kochi NH road. He said the height of the median on the stretch should be increased at least by three feet. “If the median was at three feet height, the container truck would not have entered the other side of the lane. So, the NHAI officials should think of increasing the height of the median,” Subramaniam said.

U Udhayasankar, project manager, NHAI Project Implementation unit, Coimbatore, said the height of the median is 22 cm on Kochi- Salem NHAI stretch. It is constructed as per Indian Road Congress norms. There is no flaw in the road and median design, he added.

All junctions under the project will be redesigned. “Table-top zebra crossings and pedestrian islands will be set up. Utilities including power lines and telecom cables will pass under the ground,” the official said. “Apart from maintaining green space along the road, more green space will be created. Designated space will be allotted to street vendors. Information boards, water fountains and shaded walkways will also be set up.”

Madurai: The grass on the median along the four-lane highway in Thanakkankulam near Thiruparankundram towards Samayanallur caught fire on Thursday. According to locals, it is an indication that as summer is approaching, the grass and shrubs on medians are prone to fire due to heat. However, the reason for Thursday’s fire is still unknown. “It may be a careless cigarette discarded by a driver,” said K Thirupathi of Thankkankulam, who had seen the fire.

On Thursday, a raging fire went on for several metres, on the median from Thanakkankulam towards Samayanallur, and locals who saw it doused it. Tree saplings and shrubs have been planted on the medians of the national highways (NH) under the Green Highways (Plantation and Maintenance) Policy of 2015.

The objectives of the policy is to reduce the impact of air pollution and dust, provide much needed shade on hot roads during summer, reduce the impact of increasing noise pollution caused due to increase in number of vehicles and arrest soil erosion at the embankment slopes. After rains last year, the trees and shrubs planted under the policy thrived.

The agency that is given the contract for planting the trees is also responsible for maintaining it also. They have to prune the trees and the grass. There are workers, who water the plants, with tankers and they also clean the medians sometimes.

“However, keeping the grass moist is important in the hot summer to prevent any major accident, due to fire on the medians,” said S Shanmugam, another witness to the fire.

Highway department sources said that the agency in-charge would have to comply with rules and ensure through proper maintenance that there are no such fires, failing which, action could be taken against them as per the conditions of the policy, which could be for non-compliance of the Forests (conservation) Act 1980.

Madurai: With more than one week left for the nationwide Citizen’s Perception Survey to end, the Madurai Corporation has already achieved more than double the number of the target it had set. The survey is conducted by the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs (MoHUA) to rank 114 cities – 100 smart cities and 14 cities with more than one million population.

While the civic body had set a target of 10,615 by February 15, more than 23,500 people had taken part in the survey, which is 222% higher.

317,['22/02/2020'],TN relaxes norms for new private law colleges,"This story is from February 22, 2020

Chennai: The Tamil Nadu government has relaxed norms to establish private self-financing law colleges.

Earlier, permission was given only if the college management was able to find the stipulated land — four acres to 10 acres — within 15 radius of a district court or sessions court. Finding such parcels of land is proving to be a costly affair for many people planning to start new law colleges. Now, the condition has been relaxed so that the land could be within 30km radius of a district court or sessions court.

The state law department issued orders in this regard on February 19, making amendments to the Tamil Nadu Establishment of Private Law Colleges (Regulation) Rules, 2018. Tamil Nadu had a blanket ban on private law schools till 2014. The rules, which were introduced in 2018, faced stiff from the DMK which opposed opening up law education to the private sector. Tamil Nadu law minister C V Shanmugham had countered that the amendments were more to regulate the existing institutions and not to encourage new ones.

Following the new rules, however, the number of private institutions in the field has increased from one in 2014 to 14 now. Many among them are deemed universities which offer law courses alongside other professional courses. At present, TN has the highest number of private law colleges in south India. Yet the number is less compared to some states such as Rajasthan, Gujarat, Haryana and Maharashtra.

“Further privatisation will affect the quality of judicial profession,” K Raja, former zonal secretary of Association of University Teachers (AUT) working at Trichy National Law School. Ten years ago, TN allowed private colleges to offer Bachelor of Education (BEd) and teacher training courses in diploma mode. Until then, BEd and diploma graduates were able to find teaching jobs. Now, hundreds of colleges produce graduates, but their quality is poor and not even one-tenth of those passing out finds jobs.

When the number of cases registered in TN is not going to increase much, there is no need to produce more lawyers, said Raja. There is not much scope for law graduates to get employed in private sector except for a handful corporates which recruit one or two legal advisors, he said. S Prabakaran, vice-chairman of the Bar Council of India (BCI), said that BCI recently imposed a three-year moratorium on approval of new colleges across the country and it shall be relaxed only if courts give a direction. But courts have expressed disappointment over opening of too many private law colleges.

318,['22/02/2020'],RTC workers’ union up in arms over allowing private buses to operate on select routes,"This story is from February 22, 2020

Vijayawada: A fresh problem is brewing in Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (APSRTC) over allowing private buses and school buses into bus stations and to operate them on select routes. While the vice-chairman and managing director (VC&MD) of APSRTC justified the move, the workers’ unions have taken the issue up with the management.

The recognised workers union of APSRTC, Employees Union (EU), said in a statement on Friday that the decision has to be rolled back immediately in the interest of the corporation. “There is no other option for us other than taking the protest route if the management decides to go ahead with the decision,” said Palisetti Damodhar, general secretary of EU.

Madireddy Pratap, VC & MD of APSRTC, justified the proposal and said that allowing private buses was in the interest of passengers. He observed that Rs 12 to Rs 17 is being spent per kilometre by the state-run transport corporation on the buses. “APSRTC is not in a position to spend that much. To give better services to the passengers, we have held talks with private operators. Instead of forcing passengers to do a footboard journey, with limited resources of APSRTC, what was wrong in allowing private players to give better services?” he asked, while justifying the move.

However, the proposal is still in discussions and no decision was taken, Madireddy said, at a press conference.

Workers’ unions took serious objections to the comments and termed it as a unilateral decision.

Damodhar observed that on one hand the state government and the transport minister said that to ease the financial burden on APSRTC, all the employees were merged into the government and they do not have any intention to privatise neither buses nor bus routes. “However, the actions of the VC&MD are in contrary to the government promise and creating lot of confusion among workers,” he said.

Damodhar further alleged that since taking over the charge as vice-chairman and managing director, Madireddy is not willing to take up the issues of workers. “He is never available to us to speak over many pending issues because of which the problems are getting aggravated,” Damodhar said.

The chairman of VMC’s school education committee, which operates 105 schools in the city, is eligible for an official car.

A proposal prepared for the procurement of the new car states that the chairman has to visit the schools in the city as well as travel to Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar for meetings.

The proposal adds that the present Toyota Innova that the chairman uses is a decade old and has already clocked 2.82lakh kilometres. Also it keeps requiring maintenance frequently and over Rs 6 lakh has already been spent on the maintenance of the vehicle.

The VMC will procure a new Toyota Innova Crysta for the chairman from a city-based dealer. Recently, the VMC has procured two similar model vehicles for the VMC mayor and deputy mayor.

321,['22/02/2020'],"ART bill will ensure standardization of IVF, IUI protocols, say experts","This story is from February 22, 2020

Coimbatore: Fertility specialists in the city said the effectiveness of the Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) Regulation Bill, 2020 , which was passed by the Union cabinet two days ago, would depend on how well the health department implement the bill’s clauses. They, however , welcomed the move to regulate ART clinics.

Dr Kannagi Uthariraj, head of department of fertility and reproductive medicine at Kovai Medical Centre and Hospital, said, “The bill makes it mandatory for an infertility clinic to register with the state health department and submit paper work to show it has the required staff and infrastructure. It also requires them to document the type of cases that they treat, number of in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intrauterine insemination (IUI) they perform, and the success rate.”

According to Dr Mirudhubashini Govindarajan, clinical director, Motherhood by Women’s Centre, the bill would ensure standardization of IVF and IUI protocols and techniques and that they are performed only when required that too according to guidelines. “It will also ensure that no unnecessary or unproven techniques are forced on patients.”

At 164, Tamil Nadu boasts of the second highest number of fertility clinics and ART centres that are registered with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in the country.

Fertility specialists said multiple issues could occur when couples approach infertility clinics that don’t follow the set rules and protocols. “We have come across cases in which clinics have implanted an embryo that was developed with third party egg and sperm without the couples’ consent. There are also cases in which clinics keep the couples in dark about the plan to use another man’s sperm or another woman’s egg for IVF till the last moment,” Dr Uthariraj said.

There are also infertility clinics that display fake credentials and staff that they do not have.

“The bill has clauses related to required staff and infrastructure that a clinic should have. It is a welcome move as there are clinics that operate with just consultant embryologist and andrologist, who visit the centre once in a week or so. You need a full-time embryologist to maintain the lab 24x7 for the best results. Otherwise, it’s a drain on the couple,” Dr Mirudhubashini said.

Gynecologists, meanwhile, welcomed the move to make insurance covers for egg donors mandatory and stop multiple embryo implantation. “Often, when we do embryo reduction after three of the four implants, it sometimes affects the healthy babies also. So, we are working towards a single embryo implantation, which through genetic testing has proven to be the best. The insurance cover for egg donors would help in preventing their exploitation,” said Dr Meenakshi Priya, fertility consultant at NOVA IVF Fertility.

However, the act has limitations too. “The act mandates submission of paperwork and consents, which clinics could cook up. It would work only if the doctor works with a conscience and clinics’ statements are crosschecked and inspected,” Dr Uthariraj said.

Pointing out that making the genetic testing of embryos mandatory may lead to sex selection issues, as results would reveal the gender, Dr Priya, said, “So, how the government will ensure sex determination does not happen along with genetic testing is yet to be seen.”

Madurai: Class XII students who will be appearing for the state board exam seem to be worried over the entrance exams as they have to perform well in both to secure a seat in a college of their choice.

“Everyone used to say board exam marks will be used for counselling and getting a good seat in college. But now we have to do well in board and entrance exams, which is giving us so much pressure,” said Prithvi R, a Class XII student.

Like him, many Class XII students are questioning the need for them to sweat it out in board exam, especially, since in most cases they are forced to take subjects that will not make a big difference in their future choice of course.

Teachers and career counsellors point out that the main issue is that students need to approach board and competitive entrance exams, including NEET and JEE, in different ways. “Competitive exams demand a different approach as the questions are multiple choice and application oriented. These exams are based on both Class XI and XII syllabus while the board exams are based only on Class XII syllabus. Students cannot afford to pay less attention to board exams as the admissions to state engineering colleges is based on board exam scores,” said Senthilnathan M, president, private schools correspondents’ confederation.

The principal of a corporation school said that preparing for boards makes the students pause preparation for entrance exams. “It requires extraordinary hard work and luck to get success in both. We have to bet on a crash course for entrance exams after board exams for students to succeed,” said the teacher.

However, career counsellors said that children who are unsure of which career to pursue struggle with entrance exams, especially those from government schools and those who have scored less. “The pressure is immense because of the tough competition for getting seats these days. Those who would have scored well in board exams are not guaranteed to do well in entrance exams. Many go into depression as they find themselves unable to perform well in entrance exam. They and their parents do not understand the different scenarios,” said Nivethitha R, a counsellor based in Simmakkal.

Nagpur: After asserting that protests make a safety valve for the society and are a fundamental right, the high court that rapped police for denying a permission to Dalit outfit Bhim Army to hold a meeting at Reshimbagh ground next to RSS’s Smruti Mandir campus has given it a go-ahead, but not for a protest. The permission comes with an express condition that there would be no protests at the site. The court has mentioned that the ground will be available only for the purpose of a workers’ meet as mentioned by the Bhim Army in its application. The meet will be held on Saturday.

The Reshimbagh ground, located right outside Smruti Mandir boundary wall, has also been the site of RSS functions like annual Vijayadashami event when a public meet is held to mark the organization’s foundation day. The meet is addressed by RSS sarsanghchalak (chief). The ground comes under Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT).

The outfit’s petition against police’s denial to hold a meeting at Reshimbagh ground was heard by the division bench of Bombay high court’s Nagpur bench.

The court has now observed that the meet would be held between 2pm and 5pm, against the 10-hour permission sought by the organizers. The orders says, “The meet shall be for the avowed purpose of workers’ meet only as disclosed in the application. It shall not be converted into a public demonstration and protest.”

“The meet will not be used for political purposes. No inflammatory speeches or such speeches that would tend to incite violence or spread hatred among citizens or communal ill-feelings or which would lower down the dignity and reputation of citizens or prejudicially affect the integrity or sovereignty of the country shall be given in the meeting,” says the order.

Apart from internal issues, there was a possibility of raking up issues like opposition to National Register of Citizens (NRC) and Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) during the meet. The Bhim Army founder Chandrashekhar Azad Ravan has been in the midst of controversies over protests against NRC-CAA and was also prevented from entering Delhi. He will now have to give an undertaking to abide by the conditions laid down by the court.

Bhim Army perhaps would be the only non-RSS outfit to hold a mass meet that can be deemed to be of political nature at the Reshimbagh ground at least in recent past. The organizers have sought permission for a gathering of over 10,000 persons.

One of the grounds for which police had denied permission was that both RSS and Bhim Army profess contradicting ideologies due to which holding a programme at Reshimbagh ground could have led to a law and order situation. The reasoning was seriously condemned by the court saying mere location or any other organization’s office nearby cannot be the reason for denial of permission to hold a meet.

File photo of tiger from the Ranthambore sanctuary

JAIPUR: In a sharp blow to conservation, 26 tigers have been reported missing from the Ranthambore National Park (RNP) over a decade. The matter came to light after Diya Kumari , the member of National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), on Wednesday wrote a letter to Union minister of environment and forest, Prakash Javadekar, requesting for a high-level inquiry to probe the missing tigers.

The letter dated February 19 (Wednesday) reads, “In a recent confidential report submitted to the state government, status of 116 tigers of Ranthambore National Park (RNP) is disturbing. It states that as many as 26 tigers are missing from the park.”

The MP also stated in her letter that the attitude of officials concerned and authorities of the park was ""half-hearted and lackadaisical"". “A national park is supposed to conserve the endangered animals and not lead to the decrease in their numbers,” she said in her letter. She also said the poachers must be identified, caught and strict action must be taken against them to prevent recurrence of such incidents. Chief wildlife warden, Arindam Tomar said, “These big cats have disappeared between 2012 to 2018. We are examining the cases one by one to trace the tigers. They are called missing, as their bodies were not recovered.”

According to sources, the forest administration at RNP has numbered 116 tigers, till date. It is claimed, since 2011, nine male tigers and 16 females tigers are missing from the park. According to the ‘missing tiger report’, 2017 was the last time when male tiger T-77 and tigress T-90 went missing. Sources said, “In past two years, no reports of missing tigers have surfaced.”

Wildlife activists have not ruled out poaching of these missing tigers, considering the national park’s history. There are many villages in close proximity of the region that pose a threat to the big cat. The nearby villages include Aanwad, Bhairoonpura, Laxmipura, Lasoda , Jetpur , Godal and Sawaiganj, among others.

Discussions are rife over introduction of bachelor of science courses into AI, machine learning, blockchain technology, data sciences, data analytics, etc.“On a pilot basis, these courses will first be introduced in government and autonomous degree colleges, following which we will extend them to other private colleges as well. These courses will be of 30 credits likely to be divided in six semesters,” said an official on the sidelines of the two-day summit.Given the errors in declaring results in the last academic year, the Telangana State Board of Intermediate Education (TSBIE) has decided to implement AI-based evaluation system from the academic year 2020-21.“The evaluation process will involve computer reading of OMR sheets and intelligent character recognition. After the OMR sheets are evaluated, the descriptive answer sheets will be scanned using ICR to verify marks allotted by each evaluator,” said Syed Omar Jaleel, chief executive officer and secretary of TSBIE, adding that in the final stage, AI will be deployed to check the accuracy of both OMR and ICR.Apart from this, TSBIE has decided to generate audio and video content for the curriculum which can be screened at virtual classrooms that the board intends to extend to 100 more colleges in the ensuing academic year. Currently, there are 64 colleges with virtual classrooms. “We have already tied up with Centurion University and Institute of Chartered Accountants of India to develop digital content for us,” said Jaleel.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74251507,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-199088,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/govt-schools-degree-colleges-to-introduce-ai-robotics-courses/articleshow/74249398.cms

NEW DELHI: Healthcare is going to be an important focus area for PM Narendra Modi and President Donald Trump when they sit down for official talks on Tuesday. The two countries are likely to sign an MoU for strengthening cooperation on mental and emotional well-being, official sources said.

Another MoU on strengthening cooperation in the generic medicine regime is also expected to be signed.

The first MoU is expected to allow India to learn from US’ experience in a field marked by a serious lack of understanding here. It is also expected to facilitate a greater access for Indian traditional therapies and medicines to the large US market.

“In India there is a lack of understanding and caring for mental and emotional issues as health care issues, while in the US exists a strong culture of researching and treating mental and emotional well-being issues as health care issues. There is also a provision in this MoU to use traditional therapies and medicines to address mental well-being issues,’’ said a source on condition of anonymity.

On generic medicines, while US is home to one of the largest markets in the world, India is a large producer of generic drugs. The MoU is expected to allow India to learn from one of the most sophisticated and advanced regimes on food and drug protocols and, as a source said, improve access for India’s generics in the US market as well benefit Indian consumers by ensuring higher standards of generic drug standard compliance.

India and the US also have ongoing cooperation in cancer research, prevention, control, management and research and regular joint working group meetings are taking place on the same.

The two countries had signed an MoU for the establishment and operation of Global Disease Detection – India Centre [GDDIC] with the aim of strengthening the epidemiology and laboratory capacity in India. GDD – India Centre is operative since April 2011.

India has initiated the second round of the Global Adult Tobacco Survey in 2015-16 in technical partnership with the US government, sources said underlining the significance of ties with the US in the pharmaceutical sector. The Indian pharmaceutical industry is one of the largest in the world ranking third in terms of volume and 13th in terms of value. India accounts for 20% of global exports in generics and supplies about 50% of global demand for various vaccines, and about 40% of generic demand in the US.

Ashok Gehlot

JAIPUR: Underlining the importance of Nirogi Rajasthan campaign, chief minister Ashok Gehlot has announced its inclusion in textbooks as part of a curriculum.

“Our aim is to spread information related to health under this campaign,” said Gehlot, while explaining the reason for including it in textbooks.

The announcement was made on Friday during the review meeting chaired by Gehlot on the campaign and the status of new medical colleges across the state. Sources told TOI that this campaign would be included in school textbooks like the way BJP government had introduced the Bhamashah scheme.

Gehlot boasted the campaign among the foremost schemes in the country dealing with preventive healthcare. “This campaign will motivate people to stay fit and to take the right medical care. Soon, we will launch a helpline which will provide health related information to people,” said Gehlot. The campaign was launched to mark the first anniversary of the Congress government in the state on December 17.

Divulging the details of the campaign, Gehlot said soon they would carry out a digital health survey of every individual in the state which include health related data. The survey will be carried out by ANM and the Asha workers.

He expressed confidence that the survey would pave the way for the success of the campaign and make Rajasthan healthy. Directing officials on how to make the campaign successful, Gehlot said they would make sure to provide health facilities to individuals at their doorstep.

“The government will seek help from Bhamashahs (donors), NGOs and civil society in developing the health centres,” said Gehlot. He also announced to start construction of new medical colleges before September. Taking cognisance of the complaints related to poor construction at Churu and Bharatpur medical colleges, Gehlot directed officials to investigate all complaints.

UIDAI had asked the recipients to depose before the IO on February 20

HYDERABAD: Apprehensive of unsavoury sequence of events leading to clashes and violence, UIDAI has now asked the recipients of notices to appear before the inquiry officer (IO) on any day before May 29 by submitting relevant documents.

Eighty seven residents in the Old City have been served notices to clarify on how they ended up in possession of Aadhaar cards .

Initially, UIDAI had asked the recipients to depose before the IO on February 20. Following an uproar from various quarters, including AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi , UIDAI issued a release saying it had cancelled the Feb 20 deposition and instead gave time till May 20 to the recipients.

However, on Friday, UIDAI came up with another relaxation. “Instead of one particular day of inquiry, those who have received the notices can go to the UIDAI office on any day with the documents before May 29,” a senior official said.

Highly-placed sources said the state police had warned the UIDAI authorities about the probability of a clash and violence if the inquiry were to be conducted in a particular function hall in the city.

“It is in this backdrop, UIDAI has decided to change its decision,” sources said.

Officials said they would ask the recipients to correct their documents if there were errors. “If there are no irregularities, the recipients need not worry as their Aadhaar cards will be continued,” officials said.

The inquiry itself is a tedious process since UIDAI had destroyed the hard copies of the all the documents submitted by the residents during the enrolment drive. For document verification, there is an internal procedure from a designated authority within the UIDAI, officials said.

Once investigation of documents is done and if the complicity of operators at the time of enrolment is found, UIDAI will file police complaints. “If the operators are found to have goofed up during enrolment in issuing the Aadhaar cards, the errant staff will be arrested,” an official said.

Meanwhile, officials said notices were meant to be served on 127 residents. While they had been issued to 87 residents, for 40 others the notices are yet to be served.

The roads to Cheena Peak and Kilbury were covered in snow. Mall Road and the other lower regions received hail stones,” said Amar Shukla, a Nainital resident.

The rainfall and the strong winds also caused high waves in the Naini lake. While the tourists enjoyed this sudden change in weather conditions in the lake town, the low-lying areas in the plains of the district got waterlogged forcing many to remain indoors.

The higher reaches around Mussoorie, including Dhanaulti, also received around three inches of snow. “Intermittent snowfall started at around 4 am and continued till around 10 am on Friday,” Devendra Belwal, a Dhanaulti resident, said. Surkanda Devi Peak also got covered in eight-to-ten inches deep snow.

Upper Himalayan regions, including Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri and Yamunotri, also received fresh spell of snowfall. Rain disrupted traffic movements at several places in the region. “The condition of Gangotri National Highway, which was already in bad shape due to the ongoing all-weather road construction works, worsened due to rainfall,” said a local resident.

In Pithoragarh , rain and snowfall disrupted daily life and vehicular movement was halted on Tanakpur-Pithoragarh road after a landslide at Swala in Champawat district.

Kalamuni in Munsyari got covered in four-inch-deep snow. Kailash Mansarowar route in Dharchula tehsil had to be shut for vehicles due to snowfall. Thal-Munsyari Road also got blocked due to road damage at Balik. The weather conditions also disrupted Maha Shivratri celebrations in the region.

Amulya detained by police as she raised Pro Pakistan Slogan at anti-CAA event in Bengaluru

BENGALURU: Amulya Leona Noronha , 19, who was arrested on Thursday for raising pro-Pakistan slogans in Bengaluru, has told police that, in her speech, she had wanted to compare the silence that greets her reference to the neighbouring country with the applause that follows ‘ Hindustan zindabad ’ but she her speech was cut short and she was whisked away.

“I wanted to convey the message that people against CAA and NRC are being labelled anti-nationals and asked to go to Pakistan. I wanted to prove that we too are patriots by comparing the responses to Pakistan Zindabad and Hindustan Zindabad slogans,” Amulya, a II year BA student of NMKRV College, was quoted as saying in her statement to the police.

Booked for sedition, Amulya was produced before a magistrate late on Thursday. She has been remanded to judicial custody for 14 days. A bail petition filed on her behalf was adjourned to Monday.

Police said a team led by assistant commissioner of police, Chickpet, has been formed to check Amulya’s antecedents. “We will investigate her contacts, associates and what motivated her to raise slogans,” police said.

Amulya told police she was involved in many protests including against global warming, corruption and other social issues in the past. However, recent incidents including the killing of journalist-activist Gauri Lankesh and attacks on students prompted her to participate in protests against CAA, she told police.

Explaining what really transpired, Amulya told police, “I began my speech saying Pakistan Zindabad thrice and Hindustan Zindabad. Enraged, organisers tried to snatch the mike from me. I asked them to allow me to convey what I wanted to say, but they refused. After they snatched the mike, I told them, ‘I said Pakistan Zindabad and Hindustan zindabad but the difference between these two is...’ but organisers, police and Owaisi stopped me abruptly and police took me away. Though I demanded that I be allowed to conclude my speech they did not allow me,” she told police.

Vijayawada: Chants of ‘Om Namah Shivaay’ reverberated across the city on Friday on the occasion of Mahashivaratri . After completing a holy dip in the Krishna River at the three main bathing ghats, pilgrims thronged to the nearest Shiva temples.

The old Shiva temple in One Town area and the Malleswara Swamy shrine atop the Indrakeeladri hill not only saw the most number of devotees visiting but also had the most happening events. From performing special pujas to cows, to abhishekams offered to the Shiva Lingas, the atmosphere at the temples was charged with religious fervour.

Lakhs of devotees thronged the temples from the early hours of the morning, with several waiting to witness the Shiva-Parvati Kalyanam (marriage) which was organised by Sri Durga Mallesewara Swami temple authorities. A mass abhishekam for Lord Shiva took place at the Mahamandapam. Officials said that new clothes were presented for the Shiva-Parvati Kalyanam at the Magabahula Ekadasi Tidhi. Not surprisingly, the Durga Ghat was marginally more crowded than the Punnami and Ferry Ghats.

On the other hand, devotees waited patiently in queues for darshan at the Sri Ramalingeswara Swami temple in Yanamalakuduru. Fervent Shiva Bhakts cherished the visual feast of Prabha Mahotsavam at Yanamalakuduru temple. Later, temple authorities conducted a massive procession across Bandar Road.

Cops made elaborate arrangements and diverted traffic flowing through out the Hyderabad highway to make way for the processions. At least 13 different processions were reported to the police across the city in the evening. On the downside, the price for fruits and flowers soared with the demand increasing steeply on account of the festival. The fruit and flower markets in the city witnessed a heavy rush since the eve of the festival, giving vendors a brisk business.

“Business is always good during Mahashivaratri, as most devotees fast during the day and prefer to have fruits. Even though the demand is high and the prices too witness a spike, our margins are pretty much the same,” K Srinivas Rao, a fruit vendor explained.

Union minister Arjun Meghwal interacts with family members of victims

JAIPUR: Union minister Arjun Ram Meghwal on Friday demanded the resignation of chief minister Ashok Gehlot while he visited Dalit youths brutally thrashed and abused in Nagaur a few days ago.

The incident has brought a political storm in the state as a battery of political leaders from various parties, including the BJP, the Congress and the Rastriya Loktanrik Party reached Nagaur as a part of fact-finding teams constituted by their respective parties.

The Nagaur police investigating the assault case of Dalit youths on Friday said that they were in a process of identifying a few more persons who were involved in thrashing the youths.

Police said that they were on a mode to identify some persons who were spotted in the video that went viral.

Police so far have arrested seven persons for the brutal assault and abuse in this case so far. However, the incident has triggered a war of words among political leaders.

An inquiry committee formed by BJP led by Union minister Arjunram Meghwal met the families of the Dalit youths and also talked to them on the incident.

“Law and order has deteriorated in Rajasthan since Ashok Gehlot led government came into power. This incident has crossed all the limits of Dalit oppression. If there is any morality left in the Congress party, chief minister Ashok Gehlot should resign,” he said while talking to the newsmen.

Questioning the functioning of Nagaur police, he said, “They should have acted promptly after the information of Dalit youths beaten badly, stripped and faced inhuman act.”

He demanded security and compensation for the family of victims. BJP team took information from the police, administrative officials, victims and villagers.

Meanwhile, members of committee formed by the Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) also reached Nagaur. This included state’s social justice minister Bhawanralal Meghwal, MLA Harish Meena and other leaders. These leaders also met the victimized youth and assured a fair investigation.

“We assure fair justice to the youths who have faced atrocity and have urged the police not to spare a single person,” Bhanwarlal Meghwal said.

MLA Narayan Beniwal of RLP and party workers also met the victims. Beniwal assured the victims and family members of all possible help. He also started a sit-in Dharna at Khinvsar.

“Victims and their families should be provided security and compensation. Strict action required against the guilty policemen who have shown utter negligence in handling the case,” he added.

344,['22/02/2020'],NU promoting non-existent student cells on new-look portal,"This story is from February 22, 2020

Nagpur: The revamped online portal of Nagpur University (NU) is promoting various facilities for overall development and assistance of students, even as these schemes have either stopped functioning or disbanded for want of funds several years ago.

Among such facility links on the new portal are foreign students cell, research activities, equal opportunity cell, career and counselling cell. Professors who were part of these cells blamed students for bringing the facilities to a standstill. They say students would go for high cost professional training and assistance outside, and don’t care for ‘free of cost’ university facilities.

Students welfare and development director Abhay Mudgal said, “We have been trying to initiate all-round development programmes for students with focus on soft skills and career counselling. There are also initiatives on stress and time management for students,” he said.

NU sources said the department has been taking the initiative of reviving the cells and different forums for students, but it received a poor response from professors coordinating these activities.

Among the plans to activate the dormant cells by December 31 was publishing a manual for students. The deadline for this has now been extended till March 31. An audit of the schemes too was done but its handbook is still not ready, they said.

“The handbook will have crucial information for students, especially those with disabilities, about schemes and facilities for them,” sources said.

Mudgal said as per Section 56 of the Universities Act, it is mandatory to have programmes for overall development of students. “Efforts are on to make more information available to students,” he said.

Slamming the university, senate member and students’ leader Manmohan Bajpai said he had realized the issue of website and incomplete details on it during the previous senate meeting last year. “I would be taking it up during this senate meeting on March 6 too. Bungalows and international hostel are lying idle, even the PG hostel warden’s bungalow is lying empty. These places can be utilized for students welfare,” he said.

On the training, career and counselling cells, Bajpai said the university must fund and keep these cells running. “A committee was formed, of which I was a part too. We had recommended that such cells must be kept open but the finance section said it can’t allocate funds,” he said.

Regarding students’ reluctance, Bajpai said several students complained to him about not finding any details anywhere in the university. “Unless they know, how would students enrol. Such unaware and untrained students going out bring a bad name to the university,” he said.

MYSURU/BENGALURU: Within 12 hours of 19-year-old Amulya Leona Noronha being arrested on charges of sedition, chief minister BS Yediyurappa said investigations conducted overnight indicated the girl had an “association” with Naxals .

“Preliminary investigation has revealed that she [Amulya] had links with Naxal organisations in the past,” Yediyurappa said in Mysuru. In the same breath, Yediyurappa went on to add Amulya was also a “victim” of certain vested groups who are “instigating” youngsters. “If we don’t act decisively, it won’t end. The government will deal sternly with organisations which are brainwashing youths,” the CM said, without naming any organisation.

Congress urged the government to hand out stringent punishment to Amulya, while Former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy of the JD(S) also condemned Amulya’s act and said organisers of events should be careful about such people. “The fact that organisers snatched the mike from her immediately after she raised slogans shows they were unaware of her intentions.”

Ballari BJP MLA G Somasekhar Reddy urged the Centre and the state governments to deport people raising anti-national slogans to Pakistan. He also said Hindus need less than five minutes to show MP Asaduddin Owaisi his place. “The organisation of Owaisi says they want 15 minutes to finish off Hindus. But we don’t 15 minutes. Just five minutes will do,” he said.

DK Shivakumar of the Congress in the morning differed with his party colleagues’ views and said the teenager was trying to clarify her statement, but was not given an opportunity on stage. “I have seen several other speeches of hers but could not find anything [wrong],” the former minister said. However, with his comment attracting a lot of negative publicity, Shivakumar, in a tweet in the afternoon, said he will “never defend any person including Amulya” if they have made anti-national speeches.

Nagpur: Even as the 150-acre Nagpur Central Jail is soon slated to make way for an Inter-Modal Station (IMS) at Ajni, the state home department is approving infrastructure and developmental works there worth crores and meant to last next 50 years or more.

City MP and Union minister Nitin Gadkari had proposed Inter-Modal Station (IMS) on entire 150 acre land of Central Jail two years ago. Nagpur Metropolitan Region Development Authority (NMRDA) has also reserved 150 acres to shift the Central Jail to mouza Chincholi and Babulkheda in Kamptee tehsil.

The home department issued a notification on Thursday giving administrative approval to spend Rs1.20 crore for development of new hanging yard in the Central Jail. “Existing hanging yard is very old and in shambles. Additional general of prisons, Pune, has suggested the work. Accordingly, state’s public works department (PWD) prepared the proposal,” the notification stated.

Sources from Central Jail and PWD told TOI the existing hanging yard was constructed in the British era. The yard does not have the facility for post mortem and offices. The new yard has been proposed on the lines of the hanging yard at Pune’s Yerwada Jail.

The proposed work has raised a big question as the Central Jail us supposed to be acquired by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) for IMS. On September 22, 2017, the then CM Devendra Fadnavis had announced plans to shift Central Jail out of city. In February 2019, Gadkari got approved Rs1,000 crore for IMS and performed bhoomipuja in March 2019.

Costing Rs2,277 crore, IMS will come up in sprawling 490 acre land, including 150 acre of Central Jail.

A NHAI official said, “We will require Central Jail for IMS phase-II. The project has been approved considering land available by shifting Central Jail. At present, we are concentrating on phase-I, which will come up on Central Railway land,” he said.

The new hanging yard costing Rs1.20 crore will have a life of 50 years or more.

Also, the Central Jail does not witness frequent hanging cases. Wankhede Brothers from Amravati were hanged here in 1984. After a gap of 31 years, 1993 Mumbai bomb blast convict Yakub Menon was hanged on July 30, 2015. Since then, no one has been hanged here.

The PWD has also started renovation and expansion of the kitchen in Central Jail for which funds were approved by District Planning Committee (DPC). A few months ago, the home department had given administrative approval for construction of eight new barracks, which is set to begin soon.

Central Jail SP Anup Kumar Kumare said approved works and some in the pipeline are necessary for Central Jail so government sanctioned funds. “We have no intimation from government about shifting of jail from here to new place as on date. Proposal of new hanging yard was submitted a year ago. We are proposing whatever works are necessary for the jail as a regular practice. It is up to the government to approve,” he said.

For the new jail, NMRDA had reserved 150 acre land in Metro Region, that does not need to be acquired as the entire land is owned by the state government. However, the government is yet to begin the process to shift the Central Jail even on paper, creating confusion and leading to wastage of public money.

People depending on water sources such as bore wells and wells could be worst affected by rising temperatures.

KOCHI: Rising mercury levels are expected to leave rural areas of Ernakulam parched . The state water authority is worried that residents who depend on standalone water supply schemes, bore wells, wells and other similar resources will be worst affected as the district heads for a drought-like situation.

“These sources will dry up, and people will be forced to depend on water provided by KWA . The real challenge before the authority will be to ensure enough drinking water supply to these areas,” said assistant executive engineer Shyju Thadathil.

KWA currently provides 225mn litres per day (MLD) of water from Aluva treatment plant and 100 MLD from Maradu treatment plant. Despite the intense temperatures, there is adequate water in Periyar and Muvattupuzha rivers, which feed these plants. “The urban areas of Ernakulam, including Kochi corporation and suburbs, are dependent on water supply from these two plants, where supply is constant,” he said.

However, KWA is yet to get a clear picture on increased demand in rural areas. Sources said discussions are being held at various levels on drought-mitigation measures that need to be put in place.

Meanwhile, officials at the Aluva plant said the number of tanker trucks arriving at filling points has dropped considerably. “During the last two days just 12-13 tanker trucks came to filling points,” said a KWA official, adding that the trucks might be taking advantage of the relaxations with regard to sourcing water.

There are 12 filling points attached to the Aluva plant.

Water tankers have also been cleared to draw water from sources with an FBO licence. The water from these sources are sent to government or NABL-accredited for testing and certified. The testing has to be done once every six months. “So, tankers could now be depending on other authorised sources for water,” the official said. He said the treatment plant at Aluva can share 10 MLD water with tanker trips and can serve 800 to 900 trips.

The Maradu plant has 13 filling points and according to KWA they service around 180 tanker trucks every day. The plant can provide water to 500 tanker trucks a day. “Though the number of trucks at Aluva plant has declined, this is not the case at Maradu,” said an official.

354,['22/02/2020'],File cheating case against tribal dept officials: HC,"This story is from February 22, 2020

Aurangabad: The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court recently directed that offences be registered against the tribal development department officials concerned for misappropriation of lakhs of rupees under the pretext of buying books for the tribal boys and girls, who stay in the divisional level hostels in Aurangabad.

The bench comprising Justices T V Nalawade and M G Sewelikar directed registration of “offences punishable under Sections 420, 468, 471, 409, 120-B, 34 etc. of the IPC and other sections, if the police find that the crime needs, to be registered.’’

The petitioner, Shaikh Hussain Dadabhai of Shirsgaon in Shrirampur taluka of Ahmednagar district, had approached the high court through lawyer Saeed Shaikh seeking directions to the authorities concerned and the police to take action and register offences against various tribal development department officials for fraud and cheating.

Lawyer Saeed Shaikh said that the petitioner had earlier approached different departments against bogus purchase of books for hostels for years 2016-17 and 2017-18 and irregularities in food supply. “When they didn’t act, he approached the high court, which had also appointed court commissioner to ascertain the allegations,” he said.

The state government and different officials of the tribal development department, including wardens and project officers and the police officials at Aurangabad, were respondents to the case. “The allegations were in respect of mainly two activities - purchase of books for hostels and under the tribal development department for the years 2016-17 and 2017-18 and irregularities in respect of diet and food supply.”

While partly allowing the petition, the HC bench observed “there are specific allegations in respect of irregularities noticed in purchase of books and complaint was already given to the tribal development department, the revenue department, the director general of police and the director general of anti-corruption bureau. The complaints were given to the authorities supervising the government hostels created for tribal students in Aurangabad.”

The court said it had appointed court commissioner to inquire into the allegations involving the purchase of books to tune of lakhs of rupees.

The court observed “on the basis of inspection made, the court commissioner came to the conclusion that the persons working in the hostel were not able to show that the books were actually purchased as per the bills.’’

It further observed “the aforesaid circumstances support the allegations made by the petitioner. The circumstances have created probability that the books were actually not purchased, but false record of purchase of books was created and the money, which was made available, is misappropriated. In view of these circumstances, this court holds that direction needs to be given to the police station concerned to register the crime and make investigation into the allegations.”

Soon after the vacancies were advertised in August 2017 by the Uttarakhand Subordinate Service Selection Commission (UKSSSC), forest minister Harak Singh Rawat had the recruitment process stopped demanding that the age limit of candidates be increased to 28 years and the eligibility clause of having a qualification in either Science or Agriculture removed as most of the hill youth were not educated in science and therefore would not be eligible or these jobs. This, the minsiter said, had been told to him by many aspirants from the hills.A cabinet meeting was thereafter called and on May 28, 2018, the amendment in the eligibility criteria was done as per the forest minister’s demand. In July 2018, the forest guard posts were once again advertised and around 1.56 lakh candidates applied for the posts.Meanwhile, the daily wage workers of forest department approached the high court demanding either a stay on the recruitment process or ensuring a quota for workers who had been working in the forest department since a long time so that they get absorbed as forest guards. Even though their demand was rejected by the court, the recruitment got delayed again.The UKSSSC again started the process of recruitment in which it stated that before the written test, a physical test of candidates will be conducted. This was considered ‘impractical’ by forest officials who suggested that the written test be conducted before the physical test.Again, a cabinet meeting was called in August 2019 to make changes in the test process, recruitment advertisements were again published and eventually a written test was held this month across 376 centres in the state.However, one of the candidates uploaded a picture of his OMR (Optical Mark Recognition) answersheet on social media, triggering controversy regarding possible cheating and irregularities in the examination.Forest minister Harak Singh Rawat, when queried by TOI on Friday regarding the controversies surrounding the examination, said, “The special investigation team ( SIT) is probing the matter.

She was declared dead at government medical college and hospital on Thursday.

The family plans to hand over the recording to Nandanvan police to register an offence against the male friend. The victim’s parents also found a torn picture of the male friend at the room where she stayed.

Rane, the elder of two siblings, had eloped with the male friend a few years ago but returned the following day. Her family had lodged a complaint at Nandanvan police station.

Sources said that Rane had distanced herself from the male friend but the audio recording in her cell phone has now stunned her kin.

Rane’s father Gurudutta, a tea seller, said that his daughter was alone at home when she consumed some insecticide. “My daughter had alerted a neighbour on the cell phone after consuming the poison. She was rushed to a private hospital by the neighbours who had later alerted me too. We had later taken her to GMCH where she was declared brought dead,” he said.

“I unofficially made an officer listen to the recorded conversation at the police station. In the recording, my daughter was being repeatedly threatened and abused,” said the aggrieved father.

Nandanvan police have so far registered a case of accidental death.

NEW DELHI/PATNA: Just about a week after he was pulled up by BJP president J P Nadda for his remark that the Deoband seminary was a “Gangotri” of terrorism, animal husbandry minister Giriraj Singh kicked up a fresh row saying the country was paying the price for its failure to send Muslims to Pakistan.

The minister said greater effort should have been made to bring Hindus to India after the Islamic state of Pakistan came into being at the time of Independence. The BJP MP from Begusarai made the remark in Purnea district which has a sizeable Muslim population while canvassing for the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

Though BJP did not offer any comment immediately, Singh’s remarks once again puts it in an embarrassing position. After the recent loss in the Delhi assembly polls, home minister Amit Shah had disapproved of inflammatory speeches by some of his party colleagues.

On CAA, Singh highlighted the need for such a legislation and said, “When our forefathers were fighting for independence from British rule, Jinnah was pushing for creation of an Islamic state. Our forefathers, however, committed a mistake. Had they ensured that all our Muslim brothers were sent to Pakistan and Hindus brought here, the need for such a move (CAA) would not have arisen. This did not happen and we have paid a heavy price for it.”

JAIPUR: Snakebites, wild animal attacks and family life disorders are common for farmers as they go out in the night to irrigate their fields. But these difficulties will be a thing of past if the Budget proposals for providing power during day time get implemented over the next three years.

Chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Thursday announced an ambitious Rs 2,000-crore plan to reboot the power distribution network and enhance the capacity of the existing infrastructure to make day power a reality for farmers.

Gehlot laid out a three-phase timeline with number of districts in each one and said by April 2023, 13 lakh farmers in all the districts able to get day power. In the first phase that would be completed by April 1, 2021, 16 districts have been included in the plan. Five districts have been included in second phase that would be completed by April 2022, while third phase will have 13 districts. “This requires a huge capacity enhancement in transmission and distribution network and putting up new grid sub-stations (GSS). But the benefits to farmers will be invaluable. The chief minister has announced a time-bound programme, breaking down the number of districts in each phase. We are quite confident to achieve the target by April 1, 2023,” said Ajitabh Sharma , principal secretary, energy department. The government has estimated the requirement of 6 new GSS of 220 kv, 30 GSS of 132 kv, 287 GSS of 33 kv so that additional power load can be supplied to the households of farmers.

But Sharma said while the day power would be met through the conventional power, the solar energy will be utilised to reduce the load on peak hour power. “During day time, power consumption is high. But we will tap solar power though Kusum scheme so that demand for thermal power gets reduced,” said Sharma.

Sources said the government would need to spend more for giving peak hour power to farmers. “There will be a small burden on the government to provide peak hour power to farmers but the benefits for farmers outweigh the extra cost,” he said.

364,['22/02/2020'],‘Excessive’ tree cutting at district court irks lawyers,"This story is from February 22, 2020

Nagpur: Many city lawyers are outraged over ‘excessive’ cutting/trimming of trees on district court premises which happened when the court was closed on account of Mahashivratri on Friday.

Photos of chopped mature tree branches went viral in various lawyers’ WhatsApp groups leading to many seeking answers.

Advocate Prakash Jaiswal was part of the team which had planted these trees way back in 2009. “Around hundred trees were planted and these were from the same lot. They had grown beautifully and their height was till our fourth floor. Today, they have been stripped bare,” said Jaiswal.

Advocate Ranjan Deshpande said on one hand huge awareness is being created about saving trees and then such a “thing happens on the court premises itself”.

Though permission had been sought from the civic body for trimming of trees, its officials accepted that the people who carried out the work had exceeded their brief.

Amol Chorpagar, garden superintendent, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), said, “Specific permission was given only for the trimming of the trees and it is ridiculous that the cutting has happened to this level. We will enquire into the matter and take action.”

Advocate Kalyani Deshpande, who is amicus curiae in a tree felling related PIL, said that she will approach the high court over Friday’s incident. “There is a difference between cutting and trimming of trees and that this should be taken into consideration,” said Deshpande.

Advocate Nitin Deshmukh, secretary of District Bar Association, however, felt that things were getting overplayed. “The fire department conducted a survey and found that access to court buildings was an obstacle which would have increased chances of a mishap. Due to this, the decision of trimming the trees was taken. No uprooting of trees has occurred,” said Deshmukh.

Nagpur: Even though ridership of Nagpur Metro may not be impressive, the commercial space in its stations is finding takers. This may help in increasing the ridership. A Metro official said that so far, eleven commercial spaces have been either leased or bids were received for them.

A coaching class has started at the Institution of Engineers Metro station. Metro officials are very pleased as many students use Metro to commute to the class.

Other than this, Naivedyam Group has leased a shop at Lokmanya Nagar Metro station. A bid has been received for a shop in Institution of Engineers, two for Rani Jhansi Square station, one for Subhash Nagar and Lokmanya Nagar each. Mother Dairy has purchased three shops in Jai Prakash Nagar, Khapri and Airport stations. Another bid has been received for a shop in Jai Prakash Nagar.

The shops have been leased for nine years. The rent is on per square feet basis and depends on the location of the station.

Metro’s biggest commercial realty project is the traffic and transport management centre (TTMC) opposite Yeshwant Stadium. It will have a 25 storey tower and two 19 storey ones. The TTMC will be connected to Sitabuldi station with a foot overbridge.

Metro had floated bids for constructing the project on public private partnership (PPP) basis but did not get good response due to slump in realty. It has now prepared a new revenue model for constructing it.

MahaMetro plans to earn more than 50% revenue through non-ticket sources. Most of this will come from rentals of commercial space and sale of commercial and residential space. These projects are, however, years away. Many of them are yet to be designed. The slump in the real estate sector has delayed the plans of the agency.

Meanwhile, co-branding of Metro stations is getting good response from private companies. The last date to submit bids is February 25 and the exact number will be known after that. Under this scheme, a Metro station will have the name of the private agency that pays royalty to MahaMetro.

BENGALURU: Student-activists admit 19-year-old Amulya Leona Noronha ’s chant at an anti-Citizenship Amendment Act rally on Thursday was ""naïve and tactless"" but said her actions did not warrant such a hard charge as sedition to be filed against her.

In a statement on social media platforms, activists labelled her ‘Pakistan Zindabad’ chant ""callous, ill-intentioned and careless"". They also clarified Amulya is neither their spokesperson nor leader and they were unaware of the contents of her speech. They said her slogans discredited efforts of students and youth in maintaining peaceful dissent.

In another post, a student activist also questioned the organisers for washing their hands of Amulya, although she had a speaker’s badge and a VVIP entry tag. ""It is clear that the generation that gave us this country will not protect us from its atrocities,"" the statement read.

Samreen Banu, a student, said irrespective of what Amulya’s intention was, she should have been sensitive to sentiments of people. ""Why was Pakistan even mentioned at a protest against CAA?"" she asked. Teresa Braggs, another student-activist, said, ""We admit it was irresponsible and tactless of her to begin her speech in that fashion. If that is all she had to say, we condemn it. But we also don’t condone slapping arbitrary and draconian charges like sedition on protesters. She was not allowed to finish her speech and was manhandled by men.""

Mariyam Saigal, a poet and student, said she does not support the slogan or any country that oppresses its people on grounds of religion.

""I’m in India because I want to live in a secular nation, not an Islamist state or a Hindu Rashtriya or any extremist country. But can’t we have the maturity to forgive a kid for her naive statement?"" she said.

Mariyam said the way Amulya began her speech was ""immature"", but the manner in which it was cut short was ""unfortunate"" too. ""Many men have harassed Amulya. We are so concerned about what a woman said rather than the violence that follows. We hold student protesters accountable for such petty things, but there are much bigger issues and we don’t hold the government to the same standard.""

Zia Nomani of Hum Bharath Ke Log said Amulya had quit the group on January 20 and that she should have started the speech differently. ""The theatric performances proved to be unfortunate. She could have started the speech with ‘Nepal Zindabad’ or ‘Sri Lanka Zindabad’ instead of this. There is a way and place to speak things and people can pick other platforms to speak what they want. This is about our fight against CAA, NRC and NPR. We need to stick to the agenda.""

367,['22/02/2020'],1% hike in stamp duty to pinch home buyers,"This story is from February 22, 2020

Representative image

JAIPUR: Buying houses will be dearer as the state government has proposed to increase stamp duty on registration of property by 1%. Though the state government decided to slash the district-level committee (DLC) rates by 10%, realtors believe this would not provide a big relief as these rates were increased by 20 to 25 % six months ago.

Currently, the state government levies 5% stamp duty from men and 4% from women on property including 1% registration fee. Increase in 1% on the registry would burn a hole in the pocket of buyers.

A developer explained that if a man plans to purchase a Rs 1-crore property, he has to pay Rs 6 lakh and Rs 60,000 surcharge (1% of the total registration charge). Even if the DLC is decreased by 10%, a man will end up paying more. “Now buyers have to pay total 7% on the value of 90 lakh, which is Rs 6.30 lakh. On this amount, 1% surcharged will be imposed. The consumer will be end up paying 33,000 extra,” explained a developer.

Developers alleged that at a time when the real estate market was facing a slowdown in the state, successive governments increased the rates from 15% to 30% since 2014. “Imposing 1% additional stamp duty will discourage buyers. The government has actually not done much for the realty,” said Ankur Tiwari, a developer.

Gehlot announced that stamp duty on land patta issued by state government and local bodies will be calculated on the amount taken for patta instead of district lease committee (DLC) rates or market price.

“The move will encourage plot owners who are escaping from taking lease deeds. Also it is expected to provide many small plot owners who will be exempted from paying stamp duty as per hefty DLC rates,” said Manoj Agarwal , a plot owner.

Later, the conman called the shop and said that he has sent a QR code to scan, to the shopkeeper’s WhatsApp number, which will help him to make the remaining payment, and the same will be credited to the account. When the shopkeeper scanned the same, all the money from his bank account got transferred to the conman’s account.

“Such incidents are on the rise in Mangaluru . People easily believe it when the person calling introduces themselves as personnel of the Indian Army. In reality, these are conmen with a new modus operandi of conning people, especially those who run shops and restaurants,” said an official from the city cyber police station, on condition of anonymity.

Such cases are increasing every day, and were first reported from December last year. “The cases of QR code scams are on the rise in the city, and in the past three months, city cyber police have registered more than 100 cases,” said a source, adding that all the victims are shopkeepers involved in various business activities.

Due to the QR code scam, victims are losing money, anywhere between Rs 25,000 and Rs 50,000 or more. Apart from it, such fraudsters are active in the online market place. The conmen claim to be Indian Army personnel. “A woman, who put up some household things on sale online, too was a victim of the QR Code scam,” added a cyber police official. Such incidents take place mostly on weekends or public holidays, where banks remain closed.

In 2019, Mangaluru city cyber police station registered about 600 FIRs, and an equal number of non-cognizable reports related to various cybercrimes in the city.

370,['22/02/2020'],"Nagpur RTE seats oversubscribed by 300% as 20,010 apply for 6,797 seats","This story is from February 22, 2020

Nagpur: Even though February 29 is the last date to apply for free seats under the Right to Education (RTE) Act, they have already been over subscribed by 300% in Nagpur, a trend which the district has witnessed for the last couple of years.

The irony is that despite being over subscribed a couple of times over, every year seats go vacant. While this may very well happen again this year, another problem looming is the boycott of RTE admissions by many schools over reimbursement issues. For the 6,797 seats, the state education department has already received 20,010 applications.

Education officials say the irony is a result of parents wanting admission is specific schools. An official, who did not wish to be identified said, “The prospect of getting free education in a specific school is obviously a more lucrative option. So the big brand English medium schools are the preferred choice and if their ward’s name does not figure in the final list, they simply back out.” The official said there was currently no system in place to know in which non-RTE schools these parents then take admissions.

The ‘boycott’ is not reflecting on the application portal as the state education department has automatically entered all schools in the lottery pool. The face off will happen after the lottery is declared and schools refuse to complete admission formalities.

Independent English Schools Association (IESA) has already decided to stay away from the admission process and will soon be putting up notices on their premises announcing the same.

Rajendra Dayma, president of IESA had told TOI during an earlier interaction that this year their association will take a tough stance. “There are many schools who have not got any reimbursement till date citing some or the other reason. Some have been handed part of their claim and are being strung along for the remainder. We take a strong exception this kind of tactic,” said Dayma.

Around 32 children in rural area to get transportation aid

In rural areas where students do not have access to primary school within the specified 1km distance, the government will provide financial aid for transportation to the nearest available school. In Nagpur district, around 32 students have been identified in seven different talukas who do not have access (as per distance guidelines) to primary education.

Police at hostel number 3 Panjab University

CHANDIGARH: A few students of chemical engineering department of Panjab University (PU) clashed with each other at hostel number 3 over a birthday party on the premises in the early hours of Friday, leaving three injured.

The injured are Saurabh Yadav and Rohit Prajapati, supporters of SFS, and Subham of ABVP.

On Friday morning, when student outfits were protesting outside the hostel, members of ABVP and SFS again allegedly clashed with each other. However, no complaint was filed as the two groups reached a compromise.

Students at hostel number 3 said, “We saw a group of students entering the hostel with hockey sticks, baseball bats and sticks after midnight. They went in the hostel and thrashed students.” Later, members of ABVP and SFS started levelling allegations that the supporters of the opposite group were involved in the attack. ABVP and SFS separately presented a memorandum to dean students welfare (DSW) Emmanuel Nahar, holding the other outfit responsible for the attack.

The SFF alleged that ABVP members was indulging in ragging and when its supporters objected, they attacked them. Varinder Singh of SFS in the memorandum said, “Ragging is a punishable offence and an anti-student activity. The authorities have a responsibility to ensure no ragging takes place on the campus.”

Similarly, ABVP, in its memorandum, termed the incident as “SFS ki goondagardi’. They held a protest outside the office of the vice-chancellor and raised slogans against SFS.

Coimbatore: Vice-President M Venkaiah Naidu on Friday called on the country’s youths to come forward and fight corruption, illiteracy, separatism, poverty, and social and gender discrimination that have infected the society at different levels. He was at Isha Yoga Centre to attend the Maha Shivratri celebrations.

“I call on the youths to fight today’s evil and take both the nation and globe on the path of prosperity, peace and harmony,” he said.

Putting emphasis on the importance of unity among the people, Naidu said, “We may speak different languages and practice different faith. We may have different costumes as well. However, all of us are culturally one, irrespective of caste, creed, sex and religion. India is one and that feeling has to be present in everyone.”

He said it was important to preserve the Indian culture and civilization and pass them on to the future generations. “For this, festivals like Maha Shivratri is important as it will help the youth imbibe the age-old cultural values.”

Citing the World Health Organization’s (WHO) report, Naidu said India has the highest suicide rate in southeast region and that was the second leading cause of death. More than prosperity, he said, what the world needed today was happiness and peace, which only could eradicate evil.

Naidu also used the occasion to promote yoga. “For us, yoga is not a belief but a technology to transform self. It is an art and science that brings calmness and peace. It is not a political activity and it should not be seen through political prism. Everyone should practice and promote yoga for our betterment.”

Expressing happiness over prime minister Narendra Modi’s move to take up yoga with the United Nations (UN), he said the UN has recognized yoga and approved it worldwide.

Chandigarh: As many as 500 sanitation workers of the municipal corporation (MC) have refused to collect the GPS-enabled watches that help to monitor their movement on field owing to “health issues”.

The sanitation employees are, however, divided. Some of them have started wearing the watches without any objections. Sources in the department said those directly associated with the Sanitation Employees’ Union are resisting the move, claiming the watches were causing giddiness.

Krishan Chadha, president, Sanitation Employees’ Union said, “We have refused to take the watches from the sanitary inspectors. We will remain firm on our decision not to wear the watches due to health complications. I have called a meeting of the union and other members to discuss a plan to gherao the office of the MC on February 27 against the move.”

The allotted watches are now lying with the sanitary inspector. “We have given the watches to the sanitation department to distribute then to the employees. I will check on who have refused to wear them. The orders will, however, be strictly implemented at any cost,” said Satish Kumar Jain, additional municipal commissioner, who heads the sanitation wing of the MC.

On the other hand, field employees of the engineering department of the civic body have started wearing the watches.

Unavailability of employees on the field, poor working and weeding out ghost employees were the key reasons behind the introduction of the GPS-enabled watches in the MC. Complaints of a majority of the employees of the sanitation wing not working in their area of operation had also been reported in the past.

SALARY LINK PLAN DELAYED

The municipal corporation’s plan to link the salary of the employees with their working hours based on the data collected from GPS-enabled watches worn by them will be delayed. “Employees are not showing reluctance in sharing their Aadhaar card, photos and other details, all of which are required to complete the exercise,” said an official. “Till date, we have managed to get the details of only 50 employees after distributing 2,100 watches in different departments. The attachment of employees’ salary with the GPS-enabled watches will be completed by April instead of March now,” he said.

With 75% work over, Sant Tukaramnagar will be the first Metro station to be commissioned in the city

PUNE: Sant Tukaramnagar station on the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation-Dapodi Metro route is nearing completion at a fast pace after the installation of elevators and escalators.

With 75% work over, Sant Tukaramnagar will be the first Metro station to be commissioned in the city. Its work was expected to get over by February-end but Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Limited (MahaMetro) said another month would be required to complete the remaining work.

The Metro services are expected to begin on the 5km stretch between Sant Tukaramnagar and Phugewadi on priority. About 30% work of Phugewadi station has also been completed.

Officials in MahaMetro claimed that both the stations would have two levels — concourse and platform. There will be escalators and elevators at both ends of the stations in addition to staircases.

The concourse-level will house ticket counters, waiting lounge and other facilities. Only those with valid tickets will be able to go to the platforms, above the concourse-level. Commuters at the ground-level would be able to reach the concourse by climbing the stairs or using elevators and foot overbridges (FOBs), having entry-exit points on footpaths.

The MahaMetro has planned a foot overbridge at every station. The work of FOB at Sant Tukaramnagar station has reached its last phase.

Officials stated that various agencies had been deployed at the stations to expedite the work. “It is a challenging job to maintain coordination in the work. We are putting efforts to finish major works by March-end,” an official said.

MahaMetro said it had completed laying of tracks on about 4km stretch on the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation-Dapodi route. The construction of the viaduct has been completed on most of the stretch.

The work in the crucial patch of Nashik Phata is yet to be completed. Officials claimed that they had started launching steel girders instead of cement segments at the Nashik Phata Junction section.

NEW DELHI: BJP on Friday slammed the recent controversial remarks made by AIMIM’s Waris Pathan and said it sounded eerily like the ‘ Direct Action Day ’ call given by Muslim League on August 16, 1946. The party also questioned the silence of Congress’ Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra .

BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said, “I feel afraid today because of the fact that I am reminded of a date, August 16, 1946, when Muslim League in undivided India had given a call of Direct Action Day.”

He further said, “Today, we have Owaisi and his party almost akin to Muslim League, giving a call of something like Direct Action Day.” The Muslim League had given a call for Direct Action Day and it led to four days of massive Hindu-Muslim riots in Calcutta, resulting in the death of an estimated 10,000 people.

BJP also said the “so-called liberals” have been unmasked as “they carry the Constitution in their hands and have Waris Pathan in their hearts”.

PANCHKULA: Police on Friday questioned a school principal and transport contractor in connection with the rape of a four-year-old student in a school bus on February 14.

The principal was directed to produce all relevant papers of contract between the school management and the transporter along with other documents of provision of security cover and a woman attendant in the school bus as per the Surakshit School Vahan Policy, said assistant commissioner of police (ACP) Noopur Bishnoi. Bishnoi said, “We have ascertained that the school bus did not have a woman attendant, which is mandatory.

Further action will be taken once the probe is completed.” The ACP said nothing concrete whether the driver arrested in the case was involved in any other sexual assault incidents has come out so far. Deputy commissioner of police (DCP) Mohit Handa said, “The case is being investigated under the supervision of ACP Bishnoi. All aspects related to the Surakshit School Vahan Policy are being looked into.”

Jaipur: In a bid to attract tourists, the chief minister in the Budget announced the creation of a Tourism Development Fund and allocated Rs 100 crore to it. The department will prepare a plan for detailing the areas where the corpus would be spent.

A senior official of the department said that they would draw up guidelines for spending the corpus but it would not be exclusively for promotion and marketing. He said that the department has got allocations of Rs 121 crore, including the Rs 100 crore fund and there is no decision as yet on how much would be set aside for marketing and promotion activities. “We have to chalk out the strategy for marketing and promotion. Accordingly, the corpus would be dedicated,” he said. There are plans to build new infrastructure and facilities which would use some of the money from the development fund, another official said.

“We are planning new attractions like promoting Rajasthan as a film shooting destination and creating facilities for adventure tourism. So, some of the corpus would be dedicated for that,” he said.

Last year, the department had got Rs 51 crore for marketing and promotion activities which was criticized for being too less. The industry said that marketing and promotion was the key to attract tourists, which was the main strategy of the previous BJP government.

Nagpur: Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) Sarkaryawah (general secretary) Bhaiyaji Joshi said Devendra Fadnavis’ status as former CM and leader of opposition may not stay for long. “Things don’t last forever so would Devendra Fadnavis’ status as the ex-chief minster or the leader of opposition would also be short-lived,” said Joshi.

Joshi is next to RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat. He was speaking at a function to inaugurate a building of Sadhana Sahakari Bank in Jaripatka on Friday. Fadnavis’ father, late Gangadharrao Fadnavis was among the founders of this cooperative bank.

The statement holds importance in light of recent developments in Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, especially chief minister Uddhav Thackrey's visit to New Delhi for talks with Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. There have been differences between the MVA constituents over the stance on national population register (NPR).

Later talking to news persons, Joshi said nothing is permanent in this world even the post of chief minister. However, it seems that the post of deputy chief minister is permanent for someone. The statement was an apparent indirect reference to NCP’s Ajit Pawar who had been the deputy chief minister in the Congress-NCP alliance and now also in the MVA.

On the sidelines of a function, Fadnavis came down on All India Majlis-e-Itehad-e-Muslimeen (AMIM) leader Waris Pathan on his recent statement. Pathan had said that 15 crore Muslims can prove stronger than the rest of the 100 crore in the country.

Fadnavis said, “Only because it is a Hindu majority nation that Pathan could get away with statements like this. Hindus are tolerant people. There are countries which are known as Islamic countries where none can dare to speak up. Rather the minorities don’t even have the right to express themselves.”

Fadnavis said Pathan should seek an apology from the nation for what he has said.

Construction on of pedestrian underpass between Mini Vidhan Soudha and Town Hall in progress in Mangaluru

MANGLAURU: Though the Mangaluru Smart City Limited (MSCL) has taken up a major project of converting a stretch of road in the city into a Smart Road , the project is languishing due to another development work, and lack of coordination among officials.

The MSCL has reserved Rs 7.6 crore for the development of a Smart Road on the stretch between AB Shetty Circle and Clock Tower Circle . However, the work got stalled soon after another project of a tunnel underpass for pedestrians began near Clock Tower Circle. The pedestrian underpass work involves cutting the existing four lanes between AB Shetty Circle and Clock Tower Circle. Hence, the work on the Smart Road can be resumed only after the tunnel underpass work is completed, says officials.

The Smart Road concept includes broad footpaths with carriageway, railings and bollard system as traffic enforcement method. Placing bollards on either side of each entrance to avoid entry of vehicles on to the footpath, trees to form part of urban design and thereby making the road pedestrian-friendly. Accordingly, the MSCL had begun the work on the Smart Road on the Clock Tower Circle to AB Shetty Circle stretch in August 2018. However, initially they had to revise the plan based on the suggestions of the city police.

Currently, the work remains incomplete due to the construction of a pedestrian underpass at Clock Tower Circle. The underpass between Mini Vidhan Soudha and Town Hall beneath the AB Shetty Circle to Clock Tower Circle road is being constructed at an estimated cost of Rs 6 crore. To facilitate the work, the road from AB Shetty Circle to Clock Tower Circle has been closed, making the stretch one-way. Traffic is allowed from Clock Tower Circle to AB Shetty Circle.

MSCL managing director Mohammed Nazeer said the Smart Road work will be resumed soon after the completion of the pedestrian underpass. “We expect to complete the construction of the underpass on one side by the end of March, and it will be completed before the onset of monsoon. Later, the Smart Road work will be continued,” he said.

Coimbatore: Filled with drumbeats and divine music, the night-long celebration at the Isha Yoga Centre was nothing short of a visual spectacle. Thousands of people from several parts of the globe thronged the centre to witness the 26th Maha Shivaratri celebrations on Friday. The electrifying night began with the Bhairavi yatra. Amid the cheers of participants, Vice-President Venkaiah Naidu took the stage along with Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev, founder of the centre.

The event started with Pancha Bhutha Aradhana at Dhyanalinga that included an initiation with Abhaya sutra, a thread created to remove doubts and fear. Brahmacharis and sanyasis brought in purified soil and water from Velliangiri Mountains, lit fire from pure ghee that was made from cow’s milk and offered it to the Shiva idol.

The Adiyogi bust was then uncovered and a laser display lit up the 112 feet Adiyogi, thus capturing the multiple dimensions of Lord Shiva.

Taking the stage, the Vice-President released a book authored by Sadhguru, Death – an inside story, one of the much-awaited books for his followers.

Several musicians from the country performed at the event. It included highly popular Indian fusion band Kabir Café - the band named after famous poet Kabir – that took the stage along with drummers from Lebanon. Playback singer Karthik and famous Tamil folk musician Dasan also performed. Parthiv Gohil and Adithya Gadvi, two renowned Gujarati playback singers, enthralled the people with their performances.

As the musicians begin to perform, the huge crowd started to dance to their tune. There was never a silent moment, as the breath gap taken by the musicians were filled with cheerful sound of the audience. The foothills of Velliangiri was filled with colourful lights, music and dance.

The participants were offered food as part of Maha Annadhanam, which was prepared by hundreds of volunteers. They were also offered the Sarpa Sutra, which is the snake ring, and the Rudraksh adoring the Adiyogi. Governor of Himachal Pradesh Bandaru Dattatreya, Union Jal Shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat and state ministers S P Velumani, Dindigul Srinivasan and Udumalai Radhakrishnan attended the event.

Although, Jaisalmer MLAs had put forward many demands, but nothing appears to have found a place in the Budget. This was despite a cabinet minister being from Jaisalmer.

For the first time, the state government has announced to form a tourism development fund and has kept a provision of Rs 100 crore for it and this may benefit Jaisalmer, an important tourist centre. The government has announced to train and give license to 1,000 guides at the state-level and 5,000 guides at the district level, both of which are expected to benefit the unemployed in Jaisalmer district. However, the government has not announced any relief to people residing in DNP, where the people had a lot of hopes from the government. Similarly, Jaisalmer has huge reserves of cement grade limestone but there has been no announcement of setting up any cement industry. There has also been no announcement of the conservation of Indira Gandhi Canal. Youths of this area say the government did not pay attention towards generating employment.

Cabinet minister Saleh Mohammad said that the CM has presented the best Budget till now. Jaisalmer has got a lot many things in the Budget and a lot of effort has been included to give employment to youths, he said. Former MLA Chotu Singh Bhati said that the government has made a lot of announcements, but many announcements made during the last year Budget are yet to be implemented. MLA Ruparam said that the CM has given something for each sector in Jaisalmer. He has taken care of everything, whether solar energy or tourism.

CHANDIGARH: Burglars fled with Rs 6 lakh and gold jewellery worth lakhs from a house in Khuda Lahora, police said on Thursday after registering a case.

Shakuntla Devi, the house owner, said she had gone for the marriage of her son at her native place in Hisar, Haryana , on February 10. She said they received a call from their neighbour that the door of their house was broken. When she returned on Thursday, she said she found burglars had taken away three gold rings, a gold chain, a gold necklace, gold bangles, gold mangalsutra, a pair of gold earrings and other silver jewelry apart from the cash. Police registered a case and are scrutinizing CCTV footage installed nearby to identify the accused.

On February 14, burglars had targeted two houses, including one of an IAF official, in sectors 35 and 47 and fled with Rs 19,000, a laptop , three mobile phones and LPG cylinders.

The site of the PMRDA's Mhalunge TP sceme (File photo)

PUNE: As many as 16 self-proposed town planning schemes are under the scrutiny of the Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority .

The Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority ( PMRDA ) officials would review the proposals before giving approval to them. Each scheme would come up on at least 100 acres of land.

A source in the PMRDA said residents from Wagholi, Chakan, Pirangut and Hinjewadi had come forward with a land pool of more than 100 acres each for having a planned town planning scheme on the lines of the Mann-Mhalunge town planning scheme.

The PMRDA officials claimed that they had received a good response from the citizens on self-proposed town planning schemes. After scrutinising the proposals, the authorities would publish the notification, work on the layout and take administrative permissions.

The basic concept of the town planning scheme is pooling together all the land under different ownerships and redistributing them in a properly reconstituted form after deducting the land required for open spaces, social infrastructure, services, housing for people from the economically weaker sections and road network. Under the self-proposed town planning scheme, the land owners part with 20% of their land as against 50%, which is the condition of the PMRDA proposed town planning schemes.

Under the self-proposed town planning schemes, the PMRDA is expected to carry out some of the basic infrastructure work. The landowners, along with the developers, would have to plan the area.

“The PMRDA would help facilitate the schemes. But mainly the landowners, along with the developer, would have to submit their detailed plan. The approach road and surroundings would be managed by the authority. The other facilities would be the responsibility of the developer,” said a PMRDA official.

The PMRDA has six proposed town planning schemes. They will soon be rolled out.

The method followed in the town planning schemes is extensively used in Gujarat and Maharashtra to achieve the objectives of the Development Plan. Town planning schemes are prepared with micro-level planning for smaller areas of about 100 hectares.

CHANDIGARH: Several liquor vends have slashed rates by up to 25% . Reason: traders must exhaust the allotted quota of liquor by the end of the financial year on March 31.A liquor bottle, which was earlier available for Rs 650, is now being sold between Rs 450 and Rs 500.To attract more customers, liquor traders have displayed posters and banners outside their vends stating “Heavy discount on liquor rates”. The discounted price list mentioning different brands can be seen outside many vends. However, there is no discount on beer rates as there is no fixed allotted quota of the alcoholic beverage in the excise policy.Subhash Chander Chojar, a liquor trader who is also a member of Wine Merchants Association of Chandigarh, said there is an allotted quota which the trader has to finish by the end of the financial year. If he fails to do so, the UT administration imposes a fine or charges a fee. To avoid the penalty, traders are offering huge discounts, he said. The drop in the prices has lifted the spirits of Bacchus lovers.“We wait for this particular period. We stock up for two to three months as the vends not only offer good discounts on single bottles but more on cases,” said a city resident.A liquor trader said they offer discounts up to 30 to 40% if a customer purchases a case (12 bottles in one case). The trader is paying from his own pocket just to avoid penalty from the UT excise and taxation department, he added.The administration had recently invited suggestions from different stakeholders on the proposed excise policy to come into force from April 1. Sources said hoteliers, liquor vend owners and Wine Merchants’ Association could submit their suggestions by the end of this month.

JODHPUR: The Sun City received a moderate attention in the Budget presented by chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Thursday. Medical sector has been given a lion’s share of Gehlot’s budgetary announcements for his hometown with a vision to ameliorate the standard of the MDM Hospital in terms of cancer and neuro care, but left the city disappointed on the construction of elevated road, a pressing need of the city to deal with the taxing traffic problem.

“It is welcome that medical field has been given priority in the Budget but absolute neglect for the elevated road which was very important to relieve the traffic problem, has disappointed the citizen,” said a trader Akshit Prajapat.

Jodhpur has been given close to Rs 100 crore for uplift and addition of medical facilities for the cancer and neuro care by announcing installation of PET scan machine, regional cancer centre and neuro intervention lab apart from a paediatric cath lab in MDM Hospital.

Besides, bed capacity of four wards with 30 each and setting up of a homoeopathic college has also been announced for Jodhpur.

Reacting to these announcements for medical sector, Manish Kankaria , a medical practitioner said that these announcements, if landed on the ground, could spell a leap in cancer treatment but he doubted timely allocation of funds for it.

“Linear Accelerator machine had been announced in last budget and wait was still on. Besides this, OPD building at MG Hospital and multilevel ICU are still far-fetched dreams,” Kankaria said.

Gehlot, however, kept the talent generation with regard to refinery in Pachpadra in view, Rs 20 crore budget has been given for upgradation of MBM Engineering College against its proposal of Rs 100 crore to elevate the institution as petroleum university.

Dean of the institution, S K Ojha said that they had expected bigger budget terming 20 crore quite small keeping in view the dreams and vision about the MDM Engineering College.

Industry also has a prominent presence in Jodhpur and the industrialists have been waiting since long for some concrete steps towards new industrial areas near city but while handicraft sector has been given Rajasthan International Export Expo event, textile industry denied textile park, a long pending demand.

Ramesh Maheshwari, said that textile industry is one of the important industries in Jodhpur and is on the target for environmental reasons.

“We had been expecting a dedicated textile park since long so that all the issues could be addressed to ensure smooth functioning of the industry,” said Maheshwari.

Not allocating budget for proposed Jojari River Front, a river, which has been victimized by the industrial effluent, has also disappointed the environment lovers. However, provision of 3 sewage treatment plants and a sewer clearing machine has brought some relief.

389,['22/02/2020'],Govt likely to give booster dose to pharma companies,"This story is from February 22, 2020

Nagpur: The novel coronavirus outbreak in China has negatively affected manufacturing and trade of life-saving injectables, ophthalmic products and anti-cancer medicines in India. Many pharmaceutical companies will be facing a major crisis of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API) by the end of March 2020, as supply of these important chemicals has completely stopped from China.

To fight this crisis, the government is all set to bring in some major booster dose for local pharma industry, especially the makers of API in country. NITI Ayog and the department of pharmaceuticals (DoP) conducted a high-level meeting on February 19 in which representatives of leading API manufacturing companies in India participated. Some of them shared insights of the meeting with TOI on Friday.

“We were given a detailed presentation on the history and status of the API industry and new challenges. Also, a series of options available to make India a powerhouse in key starting materials, intermediates and API were also shared,” said a source.

APIs are chemicals used to manufacture drugs. They are biologically active within the drug and are specific components responsible for the desired effect on the individual taking it. It’s common practice for pharma companies to import API from China. However, some leading drug manufacturers in India also produce APIs. NITI Ayog wants them to work on a global level now.

CEOs of Biocon, Zydus, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, and senior officers of Sun Pharma, Aurobindo, Jubliant Life Sciences, Cipla, Mylan, Alembic attended the meeting.

“Drug makers asked for early environmental clearances. Many companies were ready for global scale of operations. But, they were willing to have guarantee of continuation of supply chain even if the virus threat gets over. Government representatives were very positive on their demands,” the source added.

On Thursday, NITI Ayog CEO Amitabh Kanth also tweeted that the meeting was fruitful. “Constructive and positive meeting with captains of industry in pharmaceutical sector to discuss the options for domestic manufacturing of critical APIs on which India is import dependent. Consensus arrived at on a range of policy measures for creating ecosystem in India,” the tweet reads.

390,['22/02/2020'],Lawyers protest move to transfer 3 imp PILs to Mumbai,"This story is from February 22, 2020

Nagpur: City lawyers on Friday strongly protested the transfer of two important Public Interest Litigations (PILs) to Bombay high court’s principal seat in Mumbai. The lawyers are already at loggerheads with outgoing chief justice (CJ) Pradeep Nandrajog over sudden transfer of justice Zaka Haq to Aurangabad, which was termed as “unnecessary”. The cases were transferred by the HC registry on CJ’s directives, the lawyers claimed.

While terming the move as “shocking and deliberate”, the lawyers sent a requisition to High Court Bar Association (HCBA) president Gauri Venkatraman, requesting her to immediately convene a general body meeting on the “serious” issue and initiate necessary action. Venkatraman couldn’t be contacted while secretary Prafulla Khubalkar didn’t pick up calls.

Lawyers questioned the basis on which the three PILs were transferred to Mumbai. Moreover, there was no demand from any concerned party, like in NDCCB case, where alleged kingpin Sanjay Agrawal had filed an application to move the case to Mumbai. “HCBA’s suo motu PIL was regarding construction of new annex building in the city for accommodating offices and employees of HC administration and also lawyers. We fail to understand the purpose of shifting the case to Mumbai,” they said.

For some pleading the PILs, the move came as a surprise. “They didn’t even take care to intimate us on the transfer. There is no denying the fact it’s the CJ’s prerogative, but it should have some logic. I want to ask them whether they think that judges at Nagpur bench are not competent enough to decide on such issues, that too related to the city. The HCBA should now strongly take up the issue,” HCBA counsel Sudhir Puranik told TOI.

Endorsing him, Bhandarkar, who was pleading for petitioner Manoj Sable in one of the PILs transferred, said the HC regularly passed detailed orders due to which infrastructure of various courts was improved. “The news of transfer came as a bolt from the blue. Entire legal fraternity is absolutely stunned and visibly disturbed. It’s very demotivating for the lawyers, as they put in a lot of efforts to gather the material and study the subject,” he said.

The requisition also signed by former HCBA secretary Kishor Lambat, now practicing at the Supreme Court, said the transfer would hamper progress of judicial infrastructure as HC had issued several path breaking directives. “It’s standing insult a and abject humiliation of our bar association,” it said.

PILS TRANSFERRED TO MUMBAI SO FAR

* Nagpur District Co-operative Central Bank (NDCCB) scam PIL (No 25/2014), where animal husbandry and sports minister Sunil Kedar is one of the accused

* Suo Motu PIL (No 7/2015) highlighting plight of litigants and lawyers suffering from scorching temperatures, particularly in Vidarbha, & also for HC annex building construction

* Manoj Sable’s PIL (No 67/2015) praying for directives to PWD for construction of additional infrastructure like courts and bar rooms for convenience of lawyers and litigants

Udaipur: Despite a reasonably generous fund for rejuvenation of Ayad river, legislators and the public in general are dissatisfied with the state Budget.

With no provisions sanctioned for the ambitious Dewas drinking water project Phase 3 and 4, no funds were announced for replacement of the 30-year-old withering pipeline from Jaisamand to Udaipur.

Chief minister Ashok Gehlot had earlier expressed his desire in completion of the Dewas project and hence, the authorities had pinned high hopes from the government for the project.

The third and fourth phase of Dewas project aims at supplying additional 1,000 mcft drinking water to Udaipur city, which would have solved the water crisis of urban dwellers.

The Gehlot government has sanctioned Rs 75 crore for the restoration and cleaning of the Ayad river. Former home minister and Udaipur MLA Gulabchand Kataria said had the government sanctioned funds for the drinking water project, it would have benefited the region immensely.

“Restoration works are already going on for Ayad under the SMART city and UMC projects. What was really needed was funds for Dewas, which has been overlooked,” Kataria said.

Udaipur rural legislator Phool Singh Meena said the 30-year-old pipeline carrying water from Jaisamand to Udaipur is withering and needs to be replaced. A proposal of Rs 215 crore for laying new a pipeline was sent to the government, but it has been ignored resulting in wastage of crores of litres of water.

Another major project that has been overlooked is the drinking water supply plan from Bhageri to Mavli that would have covered 12 panchayats in the block.

BJP leaders said besides drinking water issues remaining unattended, the government has not granted anything to boost tourism. They also claimed that there was no sanction of new colleges in the tribal areas which would prove a setback to higher education.

Meanwhile, the announcement for an organ retrieval centre in Udaipur has come as a cheering news for the residents. “The centre would be advantageous for the common man as it would help people facing life threatening diseases. This is a welcome step,” P.C Jain, a physician said.

“he government has given Rs 25 crore for drinking water project in colonies under the affordable housing scheme. This would benefit the middle and lower income families to a large extent,” Pankaj Sharma, general secretary, PCC said.

Kota: Despite three cabinet ministers from Hadauti region, the Budget announced by chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Thursday failed cheer up people of Kota, Jhalawar and Baran districts.

The ministers are Shanti Dhariwal (UDH), Pramod Jain Bhaya (mining) and Ashok Chandana (sports).

Announcement of oxygen zone (city park) with fund of Rs 100 crore in Kota city, cancer hospital in super specialty wing of Kota Medical College, a share in 800 megawatt solar power plant in Kota Thermal Power Plant, development of new industrial area in Bundi and Rs 970 crore for drinking water supply system in 286 villages and 287 vicinities of Hindoli–Nainwa area of Bundi district have, however, given small relief to the local want, not the satisfaction.

No announcement in the budget was made on IIIT which has failed to hold its classes in Kota even after nine years of its establishment as the classes are still running in Jaipur, on set up of new industries in Kota to fill up the vacuum of a number of industries including IL having been shut down in last decade, on state government’s initiative to speed up process for new airport in Kota and on relief to nearly 2 lakh coaching students by announcement to strap off state’s share of tax on coaching.

Besides, chief minister’s announcement of setting up coaching hub in 65,000 square metre area of Pratap Nagar in Jaipur has further disappointed the locals in Kota as the move for coaching hub in Jaipur is being viewed as an attempt to shift Kota’s blooming coaching industry to the state capital.

Tourism industry in Hadauti has also been ignored in the state budget, however, the CM has announced to create tourism development fund with Rs 100 crore, there is no clear roadmap to utilize the fund to promote tourist industry. The concept of village tourism has got no place in the Budget, while promotion of village tourism is the need of hour to give a boost to tourism industry in the state, believe the people associated with tourism industry.

Meanwhile, the interests of farmers in Hadauti have also not been protected as no announcement for the forming new agro industries, processing units has been made in the Budget.

The farmers expected the government would announce to open purchase centres on government supported price at gram panchayat level, but regrettably no such move has been made in the budget, said Kota division convener of Akhil Bhartiya Kisan Sayukt Sangarsh Samiti, Fatehchand and added the paddy cultivators in Hadauti also expected that the CM would declare Rajasthan export state for paddy like Punjab and Haryana but absence of such declaration has disappointed the paddy cultivators, who currently have to bear loss while selling their crop.

Representative image

MANGALURU: From 158 PhD students at Manipal Academy of Higher Education ( MAHE ) in 2014 to 350 in 2019, the number is expected to be around 450 this year.

“At MAHE, the focus clearly has to be on top-quality research. We want to push our doctoral programmes and ensure that enrolment crosses 1,000 per year very soon,” said vice-chancellor Dr H Vinod Bhat .

Dr H Shyamala Hande, director of the Centre for Doctoral Studies, said a substantial number of the students will be supported by the Dr TMA Pai scholarships for full-time PhD programmes. “MAHE is now an institute of eminence. We are also looking forward to having more UGC-CSIR-NET, DST-Inspire and other national scholarship holders. We offer incentives like fee waiver, conference travel and project support for those with national scholarships,” said Hande who teaches histology at Melaka Manipal Medical College.

“We are proud that 61% of the enrolled candidates are women, although there is no such discrimination during admissions. This year, we are expecting a decent number of international students too,” she added

One of the reasons for the increase in registrations is that PhD is now the minimum qualification for an academic career in universities in India. Soon after doing masters, students aged 22-25 enrol for PhD and complete the course in four or five years. “During the last admissions, the boom was in pharmacy and engineering. These streams require a lot of funding and lab facilities for PhD projects and MAHE supported many competitive projects through intramural funding. The numbers have increased in health and biological sciences; and momentum is picking up in management, commerce, humanities, social sciences and some not-so-common disciplines such as European studies, geopolitics and hospitality management,” said Hande.

The Centre for Doctoral Studies selects, enrols, supports and retains academically distinguished students. A final count of students is taken in December, as MAHE gets applications through the year. Besides, admission is only one step, students have to register their research topics and defend their proposals before they can be counted. There are two orientation programmes in the year which is followed by the admissions of Dr TMA Pai scholars. Admissions for this category are done in January and July, said Hande.

Questioning chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s stance, he said Pathan’s statement can hurt communal sentiments. “If they speak like that then even we cannot keep quite and take it lightly,” said Vyas.

“Everyone has the constitutional right to express their views on a subject. However, such statements can only lead to riots,” he said. tnn

395,['22/02/2020'],Should’ve sent all Muslims to Pakistan in 1947: Giriraj Singh,"This story is from February 22, 2020

Giriraj Singh

PATNA: Union minister Giriraj Singh , known for making controversial statements, has said that the country is paying the price for not sending Muslims to Pakistan in 1947.

“Had Muslim brothers been sent to Pakistan at the time of partition in 1947, we would not have to face a situation like this (protests against CAA) today,” Giriraj said at a BJP event in Purnia, adding, “It was a major lapse for which we are paying the price.”

The Begusarai MP’s remarks at a BJP event on Thursday snowballed into a controversy when the video of his speech went viral on Friday. The Union minister was on a two-day visit to create awareness about the Citizenship Amendment Act among the local party workers and leaders.

“Time has come to dedicate ourselves for the cause of country. Before 1947, while our forefathers were fighting for Independence of the country, (Muhammad Ali) Jinnah was planning to make Bharat an Islamic state,” Singh said. Purnia, where he made the remarks, is a major town in the Seemanchal region, which has a sizeable Muslim population.

He stressed the need for CAA, which seeks to fast-track granting citizenship to persecuted non-Muslim refugees from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. “If Bharatvanshi (people of Indian origin) will not get a place in India, then which other country will give them asylum,” the firebrand BJP leader said.

However, Giriraj’s statement has been opposed by BJP’s NDA allies in Bihar —LJP and JD(U). Both parties strongly disapproved his remark saying such “polarising” remarks by saffron leaders had resulted in setback for NDA in the recent Delhi assembly polls.

“Many times, our coalition partners say things which the LJP does not agree with at all. This is one such statement. Had a person of my party spoken in this fashion, I would have taken responsibility and acted against the person,” LJP chief Chirag Paswan said here on Friday.

“Giriraj Singh is such a leader that he does not even care to obey the advice of his party president J P Nadda. Nadda had recently said BJP faces embarrassment due to such leaders. Giriraj Singh should give more attention to the activities of his departments, instead of issuing controversial remarks,” JD(U) spokesperson Arvind Nishad told TOI.

KSRTC employees paying tributes in front of the photographs of bus driver Gireesh and conductor V R Baiju

PERUMBAVOOR: At Shanthinilayam in Okkal, heart-rending scenes unfolded as Devika Girish, the teenage daughter of VD Gireesh, the driver of the ill-fated KSRTC Volvo bus , bid farewell to her father. Devutty, as she was called by her father, broke into frantic crying, a sight unbearable to watch.

Gireesh, who was loved by everyone professionally and otherwise, had a hero’s farewell at the Pulluvazhy village near Perumbavoor on Friday. Hundreds poured in to the small house since six in the morning to pay their last respects . Former KSRTC MD Tomin J Thachankary, who had once written a letter of appreciation to Gireesh and his conductor V R Baiju , reached the house in the morning and paid his tributes.

Valavanayath house at Valayanchirangara, built in less than four cents by Gireesh through his hard work about three years ago, was not enough to hold the crowd, almost the entire village, which arrived to bid adieu to their friend. By 11.15am the body was taken to Okkal for cremation.

Thampy, a close friend, said that Gireesh was a gem of a person. “I have known him for years. Before he got his job about 10 years ago, he used to work in my bus. Even after he stopped working with me, we continued our friendship. He was there for any kind of help, and now he is gone, leaving all of us,” said Thampy.

Devika, a Plus One student at NSS Higher Secondary School, Valyachirangara, used to make a call to her father every morning. Her call on Thursday, however, was unanswered.

His mother, Lakshmi, wife Smitha and sister Sindhu was at home when the horrific news started to spread. Neighbours and relatives initially tried to shield the family from knowing the news from TV. They had cut the cable to the home and kept quiet for a while before formally telling them about what has happened. A heartbroken Smitha couldn’t even go to Shanthinilayam, where the cremation took place. Gireesh’s nephew Naveen performed the funeral rites.

At Veliyanad near Piravom, the native village of V R Baiju, the KSRTC conductor who lost his life in the accident , Baiju’s wife Kavitha was inconsolable. She was completely shattered as she couldn’t even get a final glimpse of her husband, whose body was crushed beyond recognition in the accident.

Their only daughter, Bhavita, was preparing for her Class X examination when she lost the guidance of her father. Hundreds, including his colleagues, turned up to pay their last respects to Baiju, who was a popular figure in the locality. The cremation was held on the house premises around 10am.

“Baiju was a socially aware individual. We know him as a person who helps anybody in trouble. We are yet to recover from his demise,” said Balu C A, a friend of Baiju. Baiju’s brother Biju performed the rites.

JAIPUR: The Board of Investment under the chairmanship of the chief minister proposed in the state Budget announced on Thursday will seek to expedite approval process for large investment proposals which currently takes 3-6 months. Similarly, the government also announced to strengthen the existing a single window mechanism, rechristened as ‘One Stop Shop’, with time-bound clearances to enhance ease of doing business.

As per the existing practices, investment proposals above Rs 100 crore are cleared by a state-level empowered committee, after which they go the cabinet for final approval. But once the new board gets instituted, the proposals would not require cabinet approval in normal cases.

A senior official in the government said that the chief minister is ‘very determined’ to make the approval process completely hassle-free as he wants bigger investments in the state. “The success of new MSME Act that requires no state approvals up to 3 years has vastly influenced his views. He wanted the decision making process to be faster and approval mechanism time-bound. That’s how the idea of a board of investment came about,” said the official.

He said that for the One Stop Shop, the department studied the best models available in the country and that took them to Punjab and Andhra Pradesh. “Punjab and Andhra Pradesh have the best single window clearance mechanisms. We took them for our reference and made improvements keeping the specific needs our state. Under the new system, approvals will be under one roof and time-bound,” he added.

The One Stop Shop cell will have officers from 14 departments (the number will increase gradually) and housed in Bureau of Investment Promotion department. “For every approval and clearance, there will be a fixed time. If the officer of a particular department fails to provide the clearance, the BIP commissioner will have the power to approve the proposal of the investor,” added the official.

Ease of doing business has been a major concern for the industry as they do not want to lose precious time and opportunities thereof. “The new MSME Act indicates that investors like to commit capital if there are less bureaucratic hurdles,” added the official.

(Representative image)

HYDERABAD: A day after GMR group said it is selling 49% stake in its airports business to Aeroports de Paris SA (Groupe ADP) of France, the deal has been approved by the competition watchdog Competition Commission of India (CCI).

The clearance was granted by the competition regulator on Friday under the green channel route. Applications made under the green channel route are deemed approved, subject to certain combinations.

CCI said on Friday in a release that it received a green channel combination filing from ADP SA for acquisition of 49% stake in GMR Airports Ltd (GAL) and 100% stake in GMR Infra Services Ltd (GISL), an operating and holding company.

“There are no horizontal overlaps, vertical links or complementary businesses between ADP and GAL and GISL…In the absence of any overlaps between the parties in India, the proposed combination does not raise any risk of adverse effect on competition in India and is accordingly being submitted through the Green Channel route under Regulation 5A of Competition Commission of India,” ADP said in its application to the competition regulator.

While GISL is an operating and holding company whose primary business is to hold shares in GAL, GAL is an unlisted public company that is a subsidiary of GMR Infrastructure Limited. GAL is engaged in developing, managing and operating airports in India and around the world along with associated business activities.

GMR Group had, on Thursday, announced that it will be selling 49% stake in GAL, which operates the Hyderabad and New Delhi international airports, to the French airports operator for a consideration of Rs 10,780 crore. This includes Rs 9780 crore towards secondary sales of shares by GMR group and Rs 1000 crore equity infusion in GAL.

As per 2019 passenger statistics, the combined passengers handled by GMR Airports and Groupe ADP stand at 336.5 million, which is the highest across the world.

Apart from the Hyderabad and Delhi airports, GMR group also operates the Mactan Cebu International airport in Philippines and has under development greenfield projects like Mopa airport in Goa and Heraklion airport at Crete in Greece.

399,['22/02/2020'],Centre can’t notify Mhadei award for 6 more months,"This story is from February 22, 2020

PANAJI: Even as the Supreme Court passed an interim order directing the Centre to notify the August 14, 2018 order of the Mhadei Water Disputes Tribunal, the Union government cannot notify the award for six more months as its Jal Shakti ministry has extended the time for submission of the final order till August 19.

The tribunal was given an extension after it requested the Centre for more time to reply to clarifications sought by the riparian states—Goa, Karnataka and Maharashtra—to the August 14, 2018 order.

Once the award is passed, the affected parties get one-year time to seek clarifications from the tribunal.

“All three states—Goa, Karnataka and Maharashtra—had sought clarifications from the tribunal. With the notification of the Jal Shakti ministry, it will take minimum six months to notify the Mhadei award,” advocate general Devidas Pangam told TOI.

Incidentally, the Centre’s notification giving an extension to the tribunal to submit the final order was issued on Wednesday by Jal Shakti ministry additional secretary T Rajeshwari, while the Supreme Court, hearing a Karnataka government’s petition for notifying the tribunal’s August 14, 2018 award, had passed an interim order on Thursday.

Pangam also said that once the tribunal gave its clarifications, it will submit its final award to the ministry for notification. “Depending on the decision, the tribunal can modify its earlier award given on August 14, 2018,” Pangam said.

Sources said one of the clarifications sought by Goa and Karnataka was on the tribunal’s order that diversion would be permitted only during the five monsoon months—from June 1 to October 31.

Though the tribunal had said that no diversion would be permitted during the non-monsoon period—from November 1 to May 31—“even if some inflows are observed into the reservoir (s)”, sources said they wanted a clarity from the tribunal about it.

The Supreme Court’s interim order carried a condition that the notification of the tribunal’s award was subject to the outcome of the petitions filed by Goa, Karnataka and Maharashtra against the August 14, 2018 order.

The Supreme Court also admitted Goa government’s special leave petition challenging the award and posted it for final hearing on July 15, 16 and 24.

In its SLP, Goa has sought quashing of the tribunal’s award allotting 3.9tmc (thousand million cubic) ft water to Karnataka for drinking purpose.

In August 2018, the three-decade old dispute between the three states over sharing of the Mhadei water ended with the tribunal rejecting Karnataka’s demand for 36.5tmc ft of water and allotted it only 13.4tmc ft, including 3.9tmc ft for drinking purposes through diversions, against its demand for 7.5tmc ft.

File photo. (PTI)

GUWAHATI: Less than six months after Assam ’s updated National Register of Citizens ( NRC ) was published, the new state coordinator for the exercise has raised doubts about the quality of screening and enumeration on the basis of a list of “ineligible persons” who have allegedly made it to the citizenship rolls.

In a circular to the deputy commissioners and district registrars of citizen registration, former state coordinator Prateek Hajela ’s successor Hitesh Dev Sarma said he had been informed that people declared as foreigners by tribunals, doubtful voters identified by the Election Commission and their descendants had found their way into the NRC.

“A list of such persons has already been shared from your end... As such, you are requested to share the details of such persons who are ineligible for inclusion in NRC, but whose names got included,” states the circular issued last Wednesday. “You are requested to note that this matter is of utmost importance as the details received from your end have to reported to the Registrar General of India urgently...Send the details within tomorrow (February 20) positively.”

A total of 3.3 crore people had applied for inclusion of their names in the NRC in 2015. Three years later, the final draft was published, containing 2.89 crore names. Of the over 40 lakh names that were excluded, 36 lakh filed claims. On August 31 last year, the final list was published with 3.11 crore inclusions and 19 lakh exclusions.

Several organisations, including Aasu, have since moved the Supreme Court seeking re-verification on various grounds. While Aasu claims the list of inclusions is far smaller than it should be, the BJP-led government insists that many Hindus have been erroneously left out. The state government is arguing for re-verification of at least 20% of the data, especially in the three districts bordering Bangladesh , where it believes the exclusion rate was “abnormally low”.

Assam Public Works, the NGO whose 2009 PIL led the SC to order the NRC exercise, has filed a plea seeking “100% re-verification”. It claimed the final list contains names of almost 80 lakh foreigners, including jihadis.

401,['22/02/2020'],2016 ISIS module case trial to resume at Cherlapally jail,"This story is from February 22, 2020

Hyderabad: After the verdicts in the 2013 Dilsukhnagar twin blasts and 2007 Gokul Chat-Lumbini Park twin blasts, the Cherlapally jail will yet again witness trial in a terror case.

Trial will resume in the 2016- ISIS conspiracy module case, in which eight persons, including the Yazdani brothers, were arrested and chargesheeted by National Investigation Agency.

The trial against the accused — Abdullah Bin Ahmed Al Amoodi, Mohammed Ibrahim Yazdani, Habeeb Mohammed, Mohammed Illyas Yazdani, Muzaffar Hussain Rizwan, Yasir Naimathullah, Mohammed Ataullah Rahman, Abdul Raoof — was taken up by Nampally court in 2018. However, it got discontinued because of technical reasons, and the accused have been languishing in Chanchalguda jail.

After some of the accused approached the Telangana High Court, based on its direction, they were recently shifted from Chanchalguda jail to Cherlapally jail, where the trial will resume at a court hall, which is located inside the prison premises.

When contacted, sources in Telangana prison said that once they get the new schedule, which they are expecting shortly, from the Nampally court for the trial to resume, they will make arrangements in the prison premises.

NIA had earlier in their chargesheet alleged that the eight accused planned to commit subversive activities by using explosives, besides targeting police stations or policemen in Hyderabad.

The investigators claimed that during their investigation, they found that the accused had pledged allegiance to self-proclaimed ISIS leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. They were also accused of being in touch with a foreign handler.

They were booked under charges like conspiracy, Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), Arms Act, and Explosives Substances Act.

At Cherlapally court, when trials were conducted few years ago in Dilsukhnagar twin blasts, all the five accused of the Indian Mujahideen outfit were awarded death penalty in 2016. Similarly, in the Gokul Chat-Lumbini Park blasts case, two accused got death penalty while one got life imprisonment in 2018.

402,['22/02/2020'],Maharashtra: Jayant Patil justifies winding up of Jalyukta Shivar,"This story is from February 22, 2020

Jayant Patil

PUNE: State water resources minister Jayant Patil on Friday justified his department’s move to scrap the Jalyukta Shivar scheme initiated by former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis , claiming that the work executed as parts of the project were “substandard”.

The minister said his department would carry on water conservation projects across the state, but asserted that the government could not afford to spend public money on the “poor quality” Jalyukta Shivar scheme.

“We had repeatedly raised our voice in the Assembly over the issue. Payments were made before the elections for work that were incomplete and of substandard quality. The chief minister has now told to stop payments to such works and go ahead with their execution only after a review,” Patil said here on the sidelines of a function.

The minister said the Maha Vikas Aghadi government was “not intentionally suspending any scheme or project” taken up by its predecessor. “The execution of the water conservation projects and other schemes will continue in a better way,” he said.

Alarmed by a series of droughts, Fadnavis had in December 2014 launched the scheme in 34 districts across the state. The aim was to make Maharashtra drought-free by 2019. The scheme provided for deepening and widening of streams, construction of cement and earthen dams, work on nullahs and digging of farm ponds. It was proposed to make 5,000 villages drought-free every year and water empowerment for 25,000 villages across the state.

Referring to the state’s economic development, Patil said the Patil said the rate had slowed down in the past four years and the citizens’ expectations were not met.

He said, “Many projects were announced, but failed to gather pace. The Metro projects implemented in the state have not received the expected response. The Nagpur Metro is facing losses. The state is incurring expenses on the metro and will face a financial burden.”

At another function in the city, the minister said there was a need to initiate steps for “judicious use of water” because of the increasing demand, especially from the urban areas. He emphasized on the need to recycle and reuse water and install pre-paid meters to curb wastage.

HYDERABAD: LB Nagar police arrested four notorious burglars and recovered Rs 9.5 lakh cash and an iPhone from their possession.

LB Nagar sleuths intercepted the accused when they were moving under suspicious circumstances at LB Nagar. The accused include a private employee from Kawadiguda identified as Annaram Mallikarjun (24), auto driver R Rakesh (22), food delivery boy from Khairatabad Md Aslam (21), and a businessman from MS Makhta Abdul Nadeem Qureishi (35).

According to the police, Mallikarjun and Rakesh are relatives. “Mallikarjun used to work as a cluster manager at Nikkou Logistics in LB Nagar. He lost his job due to improper behaviour, and he decided to take revenge on the company by stealing money from the office,” LB Nagar inspector V Ashok Reddy said.

As per his plan, Mallikarjun stole the office keys before quitting the job and gave them to Rakesh. Using the keys, Rakesh entered the Nikkou Logistics Office, removed the CCTV camera as well as the digital video recorder before stealing Rs 9.91 lakh cash from the locker.

“While Rakesh was committing the burglary, Mallikarjun stayed in constant touch with him through WhatsApp call. After the burglary, the duo kept about Rs 3.2 lakh cash with them and gave rest of the amount to other accused asking them to exchange it for commission,” the inspector said.

By analysing the CCTV cameras and cellphone details, the police arrested the accused.

JAIPUR: Though the third detailed project report of Jaipur Metro phase II is ready, the dream project of Ashok Gehlot government didn’t get any budgetary allocation. Without any budgetary provision, it will be very difficult to complete the project.

Metro phase II will be from Ambabadi to Sitapura which was considered to be better route looking at the number of passengers in that section. In the last two DPRs, metro was supposed to be underground but as the expense was high, third DPR said to have mentioned entire route to be elevated. It is said that after making it elevated, 60% budget of the metro was reduced. Department was expecting some kind of budgetary allocation on Thursday.

Sources in the department said, “It was a dream project for Gehlot which was inaugurated in 2015 but still nothing was allocated. It is said that allocation was made last year so we can expect that this will continue in 2020 year as well. Nothing has been certain as of now.”

It is expected that around 4.2 lakh passengers will travel every day in the metro phase II. From Ambabadi, it will cross Sindhi Camp bus station, Maharani College, Tonk Road, Sanganer airport to finally reach Sitapura.

Whether the government will allocate the budget in the middle of the year that is also not certain and if nothing has been done, this year phase II work will have to wait.

AURANGABAD: The Beed Municipal Council (BMC) on Friday issued a notice to its staffer responsible for the disruption in water supply in some areas of the city.

The residents of Beed city are getting water supply once in five or six days. Over the last few days, the residents from several areas of the Old City faced disruption in water supply schedule. Acting on the complaints of residents, Beed municipal council’s water supply committee chairman Ravindra Kadam held a meeting of the water supply department staff on Friday .

He asked the staff to ensure that the residents are getting uninterrupted water supply. He also ordered an inquiry abput the allegations made by the residents.

After conducting an inquiry, it was found that supervisor SH Pardeshi deputed on the Bindusara Dam supply line had taken a leave of 5 to 6 days without any application or information to the administration. Subsequently, the water supply on the said line was affected. Nikam said that a show-cause notice has been issued to the staffer in this regard. In the meeting, Nikam asked the staffers to ensure that the residents get water on time.

Incidentally, the Old City area of Beed receives water supply from the Bindusara Dam which is 10km away from the city. The new area located on the outskirts of the city receives supply from backwaters of Majalgaon Dam which is at a distance of 80km from the city.

Nikam told TOI that the poor water supply frequency of the city will be addressed soon. “A repair work on leakages in the supply line will be carried out. Also, a new distribution line from the backwaters of Majalgaon Dam has been installed. The connections will be completed in a year’s time and then we can supply water on every third day to the residents,” he said.

406,['22/02/2020'],"Govt transfers NHM director, scraps sterilisation circular","This story is from February 22, 2020

Bhopal: The Madhya Pradesh government on Friday withdrew a controversial order that asked male health workers to ensure at least one male sterilization per month or lose pay and job. Minister P C Sharma acknowledged the “fault”, and National Health Mission state director Chhavi Bharadwaj, who issued the order, was removed in the evening.

The circular, issued on February 11, said that all 3,000-plus multi-purpose health workers (MPHWs) must mobilise at least five to 10 ‘willing beneficiaries’ for male sterilisation. Those who fail to get even one man for sterilisation by March 31 will have their salaries withheld until they complete the task, it warned. District collectors and chief medical and health officers (CMHOs) were asked to identify MPHWs who don’t perform their task and apply the no-work no-pay principle. If the situation didn’t improve, collectors could recommend compulsory retirement of MPHWs, it said.

The order sparked outrage despite damage control by the administration. BJP tore into the Congress government on Friday, saying that it reminded of Emergency-era forced sterilisations. Former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan dubbed it “Emergency part-II in MP”. “If health workers fail to meet targets, the government can take action but the decision to cut their salary and retire them shows dictatorial attitude,” Chouhan tweeted. Newly-appointed BJP state president V D Sharma questioned the “real motive” of the government behind the order, and tweeted: “The government is trying to save the minister by taking action against an official.”

On the back foot, the government withdrew the order and launched into damage control. Health minister Tulsi Silawat condemned the warning issued to male health workers in the NHM order, and said it stood revoked with immediate effect. PR and legal affairs minister PC Sharma, said, “The order has been quashed. It was a fault at some level.”

Late Friday evening, the government transferred IAS officer Chhavi Bhardwaj — the driving force behind Bhopal’s Swachh Survekshan silver in 2016-2017 — as officer on special duty at the secretariat. No reason was mentioned in the transfer order, which was issued despite Mahashivratri being a government holiday, but it’s understood she was removed for the ultimatum given to male health workers to meet sterilisation targets.

Following the fiasco, top health department officials pointed out that the order was issued by Bhardwaj in the light of dismal sterilisation figures — districts like Betul, Morena and Balaghat don’t have a single male sterilisation. The order cited the National Family Health Survey-4 report, which says only 0.5% men opt for sterilisation in Madhya Pradesh. Of the 3.03 lakh people who underwent sterilisation in 2018 in Madhya Pradesh, an overwhelming 98.8% were women. Only 3,727 males underwent the far easier procedure of vasectomy.

“There is nothing wrong in male participation in sterilisation and family planning. The order could have been lightly worded,” said a senior health department official. “Tubectomy and vasectomy are voluntary, and couples choose the method best suited to them. There is no coercion,” the official added.

407,['22/02/2020'],Coaching hub plan gets thumbs up,"This story is from February 22, 2020

The CM has earmarked land for coaching centres at Pratap Nagar

JAIPUR: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot has proposed a separate 67,000 sqm land belonging to Rajasthan Housing Board for a coaching hub in Pratap Nagar here in his Budget speech on Thursday. This was a long-standing demand of traders and residents of Gopalpura Bypass Road and Barkat Nagar area where these centres have become a nuisance.

Commissioner of Housing Board Pawan Arora on Friday welcomed the move. “We have been planning it for a long time and this Budget proposal will give a final push. We are planning to build a eco-friendly coaching hub in Pratap Nagar. Once this plan is implemented, we plan to implement in other cities as well,” said Pawan. There are hundreds of coaching institutes at Gopalpura Bypass and surrounding areas. Most of the coaching institutes do not have parking space that usually creates traffic problems.

President of Gopalpura Bypass Traders Union, Pawan Goyal , said students of coaching institutes are harming them financially. “None of the coaching institutes have parking space and in the evening traffic jam is routine. Hundreds of vehicles are parked encroaching roads in the area. Many banks, clothing shops, malls and other business have shown interest in the area but due to coaching centres, no contract is finalised. If these students are shifted outside the city, it will be profitable for us,” said Pawan.

There is no provision for fire safety as well. Last year, Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC) closed down many coaching centres in the area due to lack of fire NOC.

Residents of the area also complained of disturbance created by the hostellers. Shyam Sundar, a resident of Mahesh Nagar, said group fights, rash riding of bikes, disturbance in parks have become common. “There are many houses where students are vacating on time. It is no longer a safe area for family members and it is better if these coaching institutes are shifted out of this area,” said Shyam.

The government is yet to finalise the DPR for the coaching hub which will give a push to this scheme.

Kottayam: The relatives and friends of Narendra Babu , the music teacher who committed suicide after being an accused in POCSO case , still maintain that the case was framed against him and he was innocent .

The music teacher had written a very detailed suicide note along with complaint letters to the district collector, magistrate and the SP. The relatives hope that the police will initiate a probe based on the letter’s content.

Anil, a relative of the deceased said that they will wait for a couple of days for the police to initiate action. “We will move legally if there is no action by police,” he said. Meanwhile, Vaikom CI said that they will probe the issues raised by Babu in the letter.

Babu, 51, an Arattukulangara native, was found hanging from a tree near his house in the premises of a volleyball court, on Thursday morning. He was a music teacher in an Ettumanur school. Several handwritten papers were pinned on to the net of the volleyball court in which he had explained his innocence. He had also displayed the complaint by the students.

“He was unable to face people after serving 45 days in jail. He was a popular artist,” said Anil. Three school staff, including a woman, were behind framing him as an accused, he added.

None of the complaints by 14 students and two parents had anything to do with sexual abuse, Anil said. The woman was instrumental in making the students file complaints, he added.

“The complaints were strange: the teacher calling one student ‘chetta’ (elder brother) always, catching hold by the collar of the shirt, laying his palm over that of the student while using a computer mouse, making one student sing in class always, raising one of the eyebrow, etc,” said Anil.

PUNE: Satara residents will take out a protest march on Sunday to demand toll exemption for Satara-registered vehicles (MH11) at Anewadi toll plaza.

The protest comes days after Union minister for road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari announced toll exemption for MH12 (Pune) and MH14 (Pimpri Chinchwad) registered vehicles at the Khed Shivapur toll plaza along the Pune-Satara highway.

The residents will start the protest march from Powai Naka to Anewadi toll plaza at 10am on Sunday. “We are seeking exemption for MH11 and MH50 (Karad) vehicles at this toll plaza. Besides, our demands include construction of public toilets at 10km distance each as well as completion of the highway,” Satara resident Jay Shedge said.

Pavanjit Mane, who has been spearheading the movement for completion of work along the highway, said, “Leaders from Pune availed exemption at Khed Shivapur due to poor roads and incomplete bridges. We are also facing the same problems. We have communicated with the district collector about completion of work along the highway. They have improved road condition but the work is pending.

BHOPAL: A mentally disturbed man sat in a doctor’s chair on finding it unoccupied at a civil hospital in MP’s Chhattarpur on Wednesday, ‘checked’ patients and even scribbled outlandish prescriptions for half an hour before he was caught out. Questioned by the civil surgeon, he advised him to “see a psychiatrist” instead, and even wrote down a prescription.

“An inquiry has been ordered to find out how the man posed as a doctor undetected for so long,” minister in charge of Chhattarpur, Brajendra Singh Rathore, said. He hasn’t been identified yet.

The impostor was roaming around the Civil Hospital on Wednesday afternoon when he saw the chamber of mental health programme vacant and promptly took the doctor’s chair. The doctor posted in the room was assigned some other duty so it was vacant, civil surgeon R S Tripathi said.

Soon enough, patients trickled in and ‘doctor sahib’ began checking them. One of the patients, Bhalloo Yadav, said: “I peeped into the room and found a doctor sitting in the chair. I told him I had fever and body-ache. He spoke like a doctor and did not give any impression that he was mentally disturbed.”

Yadav said he showed him the parcha or OPD slip. “He examined me exactly like a doctor and scribbled some medicines,” he said.

At least half a dozen patients consulted the doctor and walked away with prescriptions. In the medical store, hospital employee Anoop Shukla grew alarmed on seeing the bizarre prescriptions, written in red ink.

He asked one of the patients where the doctor who checked them was sitting, and sprinted there. One look at the ‘doctor’, and he ran pell-mell to get senior officials and the security.

The impostor was removed from the room. Civil surgeon Dr Tripathi said, “ No one knows his name. After he was removed from the chamber, I interacted with him and immediately realized that the man needs psychiatric help. He, in turn, asked me to see a psychiatrist and left my room. He even prescribed some medicines for me before leaving.”

KOLHAPUR: With an aim to increase tourism and boost the image of Kolhapur as a pilgrimage destination, the Paschim Maharashtra Devasthan Samiti ( PMDS ) has decided to conduct a structural audit of Mahalaxmi temple in the city and the Jotiba temple on the Panhala hills in Wadi Ratnagiri village as part of the conservation and restoration works.

PMDS looks after more than 3,042 temples in Western Maharashtra. As per a release issued by the PMDS, the restoration work of Mahalaxmi temple and Jotiba temple is underway. Before the work is completed, the samiti plans to conduct a structural audit of these temples.

A private firm has started the restoration work at the temples from February 10.

Kolhapur: With passenger traffic crossing 1.25 lakh mark within 14 months of resuming operations and taking more destinations under its purview, the Kolhapur airport has opened new avenues for the city’s development.

Kamal Kumar Kataria, director of Kolhapur Airport, said that with the current development work, the airport will be an integral part of the city.

He said that two new routes — Kolhapur-Panaji and Kolhapur-Ahmedabad — are on the cards for the convenience of passengers. “The decision on the same is yet to be taken, but we will soon see these new destinations on offering,” he said.

The officials from the traders’ union said that the connectivity of the airport to the metro cities has highlighted its importance.

According to Kataria, the airport currently hosts refuelling facility which has proved to be an important asset. When asked on its impact on the current aviation scene, he said that earlier when any aircraft arrived at the Kolhapur airport, the operators had to ensure that they carry extra fuel before departing to their next destination. The limited availability of the fuel restricted the number of passengers to be boarded on a plane. However, it is not a scenario any more. With the availability of aviation fuel, the airlines are able to carry more passengers than before.

Kataria said that they are working relentlessly on the development of the airport which is now an integral part of the city’s transportation needs.

He said that during the floods in August last year, the airport was the sole land mass that was available for rescue and rehabilitation operations which averted any unwarranted situation in the region.

According to Kataria, the air service resumed from December 9, 2018, with Bengaluru and Hyderabad as its to and fro destinations by Air Alliance. At present, the airport is served by Air Alliance, IndiGo, and TruJet on the Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Tirupati and Mumbai routes respectively.

He added that the airport registered a total of around 2,500 flight movements — 2,000 by scheduled operators and over 500 non-scheduled — till date. The non-scheduled flights were mostly witnessed during the election phase and the flood situation when the city was totally blocked by floodwater and the only mode of transport available was airways.

According to Kataria, the airport is also going through development works worth Rs 274 crore which includes 14 km compound wall, Rs 80 crore runway expansion, Rs 65 crore terminal building and air traffic control tower.

It has to be noted that the Kolhapur airport is located at the Ujalaiwadi neighbourhood which is around 9 km from the main city.

Both will certainly provide jobs to locals, experts said. Another important announcement was the setting up of a minority resident school in Masuda for which 17 hectares have been allotted.

However, the marble sector and the spices market did not get any mention in the Budget as CM Ashok Gehlot did not announce any industrial areas. Being as largest producer of quartz, the former Vasundahra Raje government in their state budget had announced a ceramic hub for Ajmer. The DNA test lab has already been constructed in Ajmer on Lohagal Road at a cost of Rs 23 crore and tests like toxicology, biology and serology are being done. Another important announcement is the government homeopathy college which will make Ajmer as a technical education city.

Similarly, the government hospital of Kekeri will get CT scan and MRI machines which will help patients of that belt. At present, patients have to come Ajmer city to get these tests.

Resident school for minorities will help to educate children, mostly girls from the backward regions of rural Ajmer. The Masuda rural belt has a large population of minorities and is backward in terms of education.

The announcement of repairing Bisalpur dam will certainly help the district in improving water supply.

AHMEDABAD: A 25-year-old woman was acquitted of charges of abusing to a woman cop because the cop could not remember in court as to which expletive the accused had actually hurled towards her.

The case involved a Gora resident, Supreetkaur Sahota and a woman assistant sub-inspector Bhavnaben Vankar. In July 2018, the ASI stopped Sahota on her two-wheeler at Hebatpur for alleged violation of traffic norms. The ASI tried to fine the rider for not wearing a helmet and driving the vehicle without documents, but Sahota allegedly began a quarrel and abused the cop.

Vankar lodged an FIR against Sahota for causing hindrance to her in performing her duty under Section 186 of IPC, and also under Section 294B of IPC for using vulgar words against her. The court dropped Section 186 because the proper procedure was not followed.

So far as charge of hurling abuses to the cop was concerned, Vankar could did not remember as to which particular obscene expletive was uttered by the accused.

After conducting a trial, a magisterial court at the Mirzapur rural court acquitted Sahota by giving her the benefit of doubt.

Indore: Inmates at Indore’s district jail are gearing up to start selling pizza, cookies and bread produced from their newly-opened bakery. They have received manufacturing and selling licence from food and drugs department for their bakery for five years.

“We have been allowed Rs 12 lakh yearly turnover. If the amount exceeds it, we will have to renew licence,” district jail superintendent Aditi Chaturvedi told TOI.

She said that products and items will be sold at competitive rates, probably a bit less than the market price without compromising the quality and taste.

For past few months they were preparing variety of products only for inmates and jail staff. But now, their products will be sold to public and they are happy to work as bakers.

Team of bakers, who have been trained by experts, say they are now ready to take up any challenge and aim to create their own products in future.

Jail superintendent Chaturvedi said that they will now target schools, institutions and local market to sell their bakery products.

“The highest selling item till now is bread. We supply at least 10kg of bread every day to Central jail. Since there are more inmates who require medical attention, they are advised to have bread and milk. Even foreigners whose wheat intake is not as good as Indian inmates are allowed to have bread. Children are also sometimes given bread for a change from regular food,” she said.

By selling products, inmates also have a chance to make money which is deposited in their bank accounts. The official said that according to government norms, inmates earn Rs 72 per day for unskilled labour and Rs 120 a day for skilled labour.

The authorities also claimed that they will try selling the bread in Indore jail circle, which will help them in increasing their revenue. “It will be done through proper procedure. We will float our bids for tenders and hope to get contracts,” she said.

The inmates are also planning to create a new range of chocolates.

The paddy harvesting will come into full swing by March. The harvesting is delayed in many paddy fields as sowing was behind schedule in several areas due to rain and a shortage of seeds.

“Though ‘puncha’ harvesting has begun, we are worried as farmers face shortage of combined harvesters. We are also concerned of the distribution of price for our paddy by the state government. Kerala state civil supplies corporation (Supplyco) procures paddy from the farmers and the government has announced that the procurement price will be credited to the farmers’ accounts within a week. However, several farmers are yet to receive the price for their second crop cultivation last year,” said Tinto K Edayadi, a farmer.

Till date 34,000 farmers in the district have registered online with Supplyco for selling their produce this season. Supplyco has extended the deadline for online registration to February 25.

The agriculture officials said that they are expecting a bumper crop this season. “The procurement price offered this season is Rs 26.95/kg. This includes the minimum support price of Rs 18.15 and the state incentive bonus of Rs 8.80,” the officials said.

Kuttanad peasants of 1,217 ‘padasekharasamithies’, famous for biosaline farming, have indulged in ‘puncha’ farming in 26,268 hectares. A farmer needs 50 to 60kg seeds per acre for ‘puncha’ farming. The cost of 1kg seeds was Rs 32 and the state government distributed 40kg to farmers free of cost. The farmers have used ‘Uma’ seeds and are expecting at least 2,200-3,000kg paddy this year. The price of 1kg paddy is Rs 26.95. A farmer may get at least Rs 59,000 per acre if everything is on track.

For puncha farming, a farmer, who does not have his own land, should pay a lease amount of minimum Rs 20,000 per acre. Apart from that, he also needs to spend at least Rs 30,000 per acre for the cultivation.

Besides, a farmer has to pay Rs 180 labour charge per quintal for loading harvested paddy crops from water-locked paddy fields onto trucks. To fill 45kg harvested paddy in sacks, the labour cost is Rs 35 per sack.

HYDERABAD: Serpentine queues were seen outside temples across the city as devotees performed abhishekams, kalyanams and special pujas to seek blessings on the occasion of Mahashivaratri on Friday.

Mahashivaratri is celebrated to observe the union of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati. Some people also celebrate it as the day Shiva saved mankind by consuming a pot of poison during Samudra Manthan or the mythical churning of the ocean.

“I and my family went to the temple early in the morning. The temple had organised a jaagran where we sang devotional songs,” said Suresh M, a resident of Srinagar Colony.

Devotees gathered in large numbers at Pancha Janyeswara Swamy temple in Hare Krishna Golden Temple in Banjara Hills. Shivala Ghat Temple at Puranapul, Shankar mutt at Nallakunta and Keesragutta in the outskirts of the city also saw huge crowds.

The popular Shiva temples at Vemulawada, Bala Brahmeshwara temple in Alampur and Ramappa temple also saw huge turnouts.

Chief minister K Chandrashekhar Rao conveyed his greetings to the people of Telangana.

GIR-141 was born on March 10, 2015, in Gujarat and brought to MP when it was one year old

BHOPAL: Meet India’s most 'potent' bull. A six-foot-tall, 600-kilo hunk of the Gir breed at Bhopal ’s Central Semen Station has been certified by the Centre as the “best bull in the country”.

Around 7ml of its semen, collected every 72 hours, is enough to impregnate 900 cows, says its bio-data. Named GIR-141 , the big-horned bull is so precious that you need to don a biological protection suit to get within a few feet of him.

Demand for its semen has been shooting up for the past few months, ever since word of its.. er..special quality got around. But as of now, MP authorities are still in the possessive stage and reluctant to share it outside the state. “We have to improve local indigenous breeds first,” reasoned an official.

“There are 53 semen stations in the country, where select high quality bulls are kept for semen doses for breed improvement. Data of each bull is available with the Union government, which ranks the best bulls in the country. GIR-141 was identified as the best bull in India and we are proud to have it in our semen station,” said Bhopal semen station manager Dr Deepali Deshpande.

GIR-141 was born on March 10, 2015, in Gujarat and brought to MP when it was a year old. Its semen collection started a year-and-a-half ago.

The brawny, tan coloured bull is fed a diet of over 24kg a day — 10kg each of wheat straw and green fodder, 4kg of ‘concentrate’ (protein supplements, cereals and bran) and 100gm mineral mixture — to remain in top shape.

No one without proper kit is allowed beyond the bio-security wall that surrounds its enclosure, and GIR-141 is given horn to hoof medical every three months.

A semen straw from GIR-141 costs Rs 24. Over 25,000 semen straws have been sold so far in MP, and its price may go up once it is offered to other states, officials believe. Nitin Chourey, who is into artificial insemination in Harda, said: “I am always in search of high quality bull semen and locate bulls from different parts of country. I got GIR-141 semen last year and it has given birth to healthy calves. The results are the best I have got so far”.

H B S Bhadoria, managing director of MP Livestock and Poultry Development Corporation, said GIR-141 is the best bull in the country. “It has been certified by the Union government. The certification was based on milk yield potential — the milk capacity of GIR-141’s mother was 7,468 litres in 305 days, the highest ever in the country. This bull is being used to transfer its mother’s genetic potential to future generations and the results are way better than expected,” he said.

PANAJI: BJP on Friday said that the Supreme Court ’s order allowing the Mhadei Water Disputes Tribunal (MWDT) award to be notified was not a setback for the state as Karnataka would not be able to divert any water from the river basin till Goa’s petition is heard in July.

Former South Goa MP Narendra Sawaikar said that even if the tribunal’s award was notified, it would take Karnataka two to three months to get the remaining clearances required to begin diverting water.

“Assuming the notification comes out and Karnataka jumps up, it does not mean anything till the Supreme Court does not pass an order on Mhadei,” Sawaikar said.

He said that the Supreme Court’s decision to allow Goa’s appeal and to hear it on priority over a period of three days in July indicated that the apex court found merit in Goa’s contention.

Sawaikar, who is also a BJP spokesperson, said that the state government and BJP would keep a close watch on the critical river to ensure that water is not clandestinely diverted.

“We will represent to the Supreme Court if they are playing mischief with the award. We won’t allow Karnataka to divert any water from Mhadei,” he said.

BJP state president Sadanand Tanawade said that the party had finalised its state executive committee, which includes permanent invitees and special invitees. BJP women’s wing, youth wing and other wings will be formed after the zilla panchayat polls.

Assuming the notification comes out and Karnataka jumps up, it does not mean anything till the Supreme Court does not pass an order on Mhadei.

Kolhapur: From big-budget films to low budget ones, the city and the outskirts in the district are witnessing an increase in the number of shooting films for the past couple of years.

According to a local production manager, in locations like Rankala, Panhala, Jotiba, Gaganbawda, Gargoti, and Radhanagari, films are shot every year due to the scenic beauty, easy availability of the place and cheap facilities.

The development of Chitranagari is playing an important role in the city’s development as a production hub.

Milind Ashtekar, a local production manager, said the shooting locations mainly depend on the demand of the story. If the story needs scenic beauty, then the locations in Kolhapur are the best ones.

Panhala, Jotiba, Gaganbawda and several villages witnesses good number of productions.

Ashtekar, who has been in the film production business for over 20 years in Kolhapur, said that for a film or serial production, the basic requirements are to look for easy transportation facility, food facility, lodging facility and the easy availability of local artists.

“The production team has to arrive in Kolhapur with their production team and their main artists, everything else is available here,” he said.

He said that every year 10-15 films, 5-10 serials, and several short films are shot in the vicinity of the city.

“A film production lasts a week to four weeks or more, depending on their story, locations, and budget,” he said.

According to Ashtekar, depending on the scheduled shoot, the final cost varies for a film but it is cheaper compared to Pune or Mumbai.

When the Chitranagari was shut down due to lack of funds and non-availability of infrastructure, the industry was going through its worst phase, said a local artist.

The centres in Pune and Mumbai was recognised as the best locations for the Marathi film shoot. But the scenario is changing and Kolhapur is being recognised.

He added that the short film directors from the city had won the last two year’s Filmfare people’s choice award for their respective short films. This shows the budding talent.

Sayaji Shinde, the veteran actor who acted in more than 300 Marathi, Hindi, and South’s film industry said that Kolhapur has always been recognised by many filmmakers and that needs to be retained. If serious producers could invest in their projects in the city, it will be good for the industry as well as the city.

Agra: The replicas of the graves of Mughal emperor Shahjahan and his wife Mumtaz Mahal are undergoing a clay-pack treatment for a ‘facelift’ ahead of US President Donald Trump’s visit to the 17th century monument on February 24.

Ever since the two were buried here 389 years ago (Mumtaz Mahal in 1631 and Shahjahan in 1666), this would be the first time that the replicas of their graves are being treated to look clean. The real graves of the royal couple, much austere than their false marble copies, lie in a chamber below the crypt containing them. The real graves are opened only for three days in a year for devotees who come to offer prayers during Shahjahan’s Urs. The 22-step staircase leading to the real graves is narrow and no visiting foreign dignitary in the past expressed desire to see the real graves.

Confirming this, superintending archaeologist (science branch) of Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), M K Bhatnagar, said that the mud-pack treatment on the graves was started last week and will be finished by Friday evening.

The clay-pack treatment is based on a traditional mix which is used by Indian women to restore their natural glow on the face. “A thick layer of lime-rich clay is plastered over the affected part and left to dry,” said an official, adding that when it dries the flakes are removed from the surface with a soft brush and washed with distilled water to clear the impurities.

The huge brass chandelier installed over the graves has also been cleaned with “tamarind water”. The red sandstone platform at the royal gate, the Chameli floor, the central tank and the sides of the pathways of the fountain inside the monument are also being cleaned.

Besides, the ASI has also undertaken cleaning of the monument in a big way to remove the dark spots on the walls and the floors.

Earlier, a joint study to look into the factors behind the discolouration of the Taj Mahal by the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kanpur, ASI and US-based Georgia Institute of Technology (Atlanta) and University of Wisconsin (Madison) had revealed that air pollution is the real cause behind the damage to the monument. The study was published in Environmental Science & Technology journal in December 2014. As per recommendation of Parliamentary Standing Committee in the year 2015, the science branch has been carrying out scientific cleaning by using clay pack therapy for entire main mausoleum of Taj Mahal including minarets.

The monument had been given the mud-pack treatment five times in the past. While the maiden mud-pack treatment took place in 1994, the second and third ones were given in 2001 and 2008. In May 2014 to get rid of decades of paan and gutkha stains left by the visitors on the interior walls of the world heritage building. In February 2019, the four minarets and north side of the Taj Mahal were again given fresh mud-pack treatment.

Aurangabad: Members of a citizen group appealed to people visiting Shiv temples on the occasion of Mahashivaratri on Friday to avoid pouring milk on the deity and instead give it to them.

Around 70 litre of milk was collected and given to a children's home and the relatives of the patients' at Government Medical College and Hospital.

The citizen group, Maheshwari Paryavaran Group, carried out the campaign during Mahashivratri for the fourth successive year this time.

Along with the representatives from Baba Sai Home for children with AIDS and Roti Bank, that serves food to the patients’ relatives at the GMCH, the group members had placed cans to carry milk at the temples the day before the occasion.

On Friday, volunteers deployed at the temples requested the people to give the milk to them instead of pouring it on the deity. The members said that this year, there was an increase in awareness about the cause of collecting milk instead of pouring it.

“Without much insistence, the people poured only a spoonful of milk over the deity and gave the rest to us. Many avoided bringing milk at all,” Jamuna Mandhani of the group said.

In order to prevent water pollution and wastage of food, the volunteers of Maheshwari Paryavaran Group carried out the campaign.

This year too, the group members had coordinated with the temple authorities several days before Mahashivratri. The campaign was mainly implemented at Khadkeshwar Temple in Khadkeshwar and Rameshwar Temple in Shahgunj which witnesses hundreds of people offering their prayers on the occasion.

Agra: The visit by US president Donald Trump and his wife Melania here on February 24 has given artists a chance to literally paint the walls on the VVIP route in the city in a hue of colours. Teams of artists from Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar University, Agra College and an NGO, ‘India Rising’, are now busy decorating the walls on the route to be taken by the couple with a series of messages and paintings. A proposal to the effect was made by the district administration and Agra Municipal Corporation (AMC) in a bid to spruce up the city for the visitors.

The themes vary from Prime Minister Narendra Modi shaking hands with president Trump, flags of US and India, Mahatma Gandhi and depiction of Swachh Bharat Mission.

These paintings on the VVIP route from Kheria Airbase to the Taj Mahal also carry messages like “Jai Shri Krishna”, “Radhey, Radhey Trump” and “Athithi Devo Bhava (the guest is god)”. These messages are being painted on the walls on both sides of the road.

The artists said the work would be completed by Sunday evening.

Shardul Mishra, a teacher at Agra University’s Institute of Fine Arts. said, “A team of 20 students and teachers are making wall paintings on the VVIP route. We will be covering 150 stretches of wall on both sides of the road.”

Sandeep Agarwal, president of ‘India Rising’, said, “We are voluntarily making wall paintings to welcome the US president. District authorities have asked us to use our creativity to make the visit of the state guest look as a festive occasion.”

Panaji: Even as chief minister Pramod Sawant inaugurated the country’s first floating jetty, which is an extension of the captain of ports jetty, bouncers hired by Big Daddy Casino were deployed at the entrance of the jetty and on the floating jetty to prevent entry.

Ports minister Michael Lobo said that he would “investigate” why private security personnel were hired by the off-shore casino to prevent locals from viewing the floating jetty.

“The floating jetty is connected to the main jetty and has nothing to do with casino Big Daddy,” said Lobo when asked if the floating jetty had been leased to Golden Globe Hotels Private Limited and its associate company Worldwide Resorts and Entertainment Pvt. Ltd, which owns Big Daddy Casino.

However, when the matter of the private company deploying security guards for a public function was raised with the chief minister, he laughed it off and went on to inaugurate the jetty.

440,['22/02/2020'],Gujarat: ‘Saving animal culture can help climate change adaptation’,"Representative image

GANDHINAGAR: Humans aren’t the only species that can be identified by their cultures. Other primates including chimpanzees, bonobos, two species of gorillas and three species of orangutans can be identified by culture .With animal culture — learning of non-human species through socially transmitted behaviour — for the first time being linked to conservation at the 13th Conference of Parties to the CMS under way in Gandhinagar , their odds to survive climate change may have improved, experts say.“For the last thirty years scientists have been observing and writing of culture in non-human species. There is enough evidence today that apart from the seven species of great apes, some species of elephants, whales and dolphins acquire knowledge and skills through social learning. For instance, one can identify the area of a certain subspecies of chimpanzee based on culture. Some have tribes, some have a certain kind of dance,” said renowned conservationist and biologist Ian Redmond in an interview with TOI.Redmond, known for his work on apes and elephants and the Ambassador for the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Convention on Migratory Species (CMS), said that in the face of climate change when there isn’t enough time for genetic evolution, cultural evolution can happen faster, increasing chances of survival.CMS has been leading efforts to use knowledge of animal culture to protect endangered wildlife. It is the only United Nations treaty that addresses migratory species and their habitats across borders.Two proposals will be presented to delegates this week to consider conservation measures for the Eastern tropical Pacific sperm whale and the nut-cracking chimpanzee. Apart from individual learning, some animals learn socially from adults or peers about various behaviours, including optimal migration routes the proposals claim.“Animal culture allows us to understand how animals live as individuals rather than thinking they are all copies. In some migratory birds, when juveniles first migrate with their parentsthere is direct transfer of information. If we destroy a population, and this has happened or cranes in the US, efforts to re-introduce them are difficult as there were no adults left,” said Fernando Spina, chairman, Scientific Council CMS Italian Ringing Centre ISPRA.Supporting individuals that act as ‘repositories’ of social knowledge such as elephant matriarchs could be as important as conserving critical habitat, he added.Species like elk or mountain sheep can modify migration paths and combat climate change due to their cultural learnings, said Giuseppe Notarbartolo di Sciara, president, Tethys Research Institute.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74251282,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-214941,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/saving-animal-culture-can-help-climate-change-adaptation/articleshow/74250319.cms
441,['22/02/2020'],FIRs brushed under the rug to maintain a clean record?,"This story is from February 22, 2020

Bhopal: Kamla Nagar police station area, which has become infamous for cases related to window/windscreen smashing, tops the list of police stations with the highest number of crimes in the city in 2019. Most of these crimes are registered as Non-Cognizable Reports (NCR).

The 2019 data suggest that in almost all the police stations the number of NCRs registered was higher or equal to the number of FIRs (crimes under IPC) registered.

Retired senior police officers maintained that the high ratio of NCR indicates that police were not registering all the offences reported and filing NCRs to avoid the burden of investigations. It is not only tarnishing the image of cops in society and creating a distrust for them, but also leads to an increase in the number of serious offences.

In NCR, police cannot conduct a probe on their own. If the complainant wants action against the accused, he/she will have to approach the court with the NCR and then on the court’s order, police will investigate the case. A police officer said that less than 1% of the complainants approach court after police register NCR.

In many cases of vandalising vehicles reported at Kamla Nagar police station, police registered NCR and avoided a thorough investigation. As a result, more than 100 vehicles parked outside houses in the locality were vandalised and some even torched by miscreants. When the situation got out of control, police swung into action and nabbed the accused. It was found that the incidents were the result of gang wars between hardcore criminals.

A senior city police officer, on condition of anonymity, told TOI that the number of NCRs show the grim picture of crime rate, which is on the rise in the city. Most of the SHOs in the city try to avoid registering FIR as it reflects poorly on the crime graph of the police station concerned. Only the FIRs are reviewed in crime meetings and not NCRs, so the actual rise in the city's crime rate is not assessed.

He added that Bhopal being a state capital has many law and order duties on regular basis. Most of the times, SHOs and even the second in command at police stations are deployed on duties outside the police stations. Only 3-4 men run the police stations and they try to avoid registering cases to avoid documental formalities.

Retired DG Arun Gurtoo said this is a serious issue. Rise in the NCR ratio clearly indicates that the police are not registering all the offences reported. He said senior police officers must monitor the Rojnamcha or daily report regularly and analyse NCRs specifically.

Speaking on the large number of NCRs registered at police stations, DIG Irshad Wali said that mostly in offences in which there is no injury or disputes within family members, NCR is registered. The complainant approaches police under sudden provocation, but the very next day starts pleading that the case be cancelled. He admitted that many times, police staff do not register FIR to evade the trouble of investigation. But in many cases, people do not want to pursue the case themselves, so NCR are registered.

442,['22/02/2020'],Beware! This gang steals from car by diverting your attention,"This story is from February 22, 2020

Indore: Beware, better safe than sorry — police are on the lookout for a gang of thieves, who accost car drivers by saying that they ran the vehicle on their foot. While trying to pick up a fight with drivers, other gang members steal mobile phones, cash and expensive items from vehicle.

Almost half a dozen such incidents have been reported in past one week ringing alarm bells in police department. Incidents where child beggars helped accused steal mobile phone from car of victim have also come to fore. “They surrounded the car and started banging on windows and scratching doors,” said complainant RK Gupta while speaking to police. Gupta was also attacked, when he returned and asked for his phones back.

The modus operandi of gang includes scaring victim and making him panic in the moment such that he doesn’t pay attention to items kept in the car and his attention is diverted to accused, who is shouting at him. One of the accused might also come to the victim from left side of the car and tell him that he ran the vehicle over his foot. The other one would come from right side and bang on the window. If window on the left is open, the accused would steal the items while the one on the right would shout at him and keep him engaged.

Victim Rajneesh Khare said that accused deliberately do things that make the person sitting in the car panic. “They bang on windows from different sides incessantly. So in order to avoid any damage, one rolls the window which makes it easy for them to open the door from the side you are not watching and steal items kept on seat or elsewhere within their reach,” said Khare.

Senior police officials claimed that preventive actions are being initiated to stop such incidents and traffic officials on signals as well as officials on duty have been alerted about such incidents and have been asked to take stringent actions.

The victims told TOI that the only way to avoid such an incident is to avoid what the accused is saying, make a video of them and leave the spot without opening the doors or window. “If they do not let you leave the spot, park your vehicle by roadside, dial 100, get out of the car, lock it and only then speak to them,” said Khare.

NEW DELHI: In a bid to make flying safer, flight crew and air traffic controllers (ATCO) will now be tested for drug abuse, just like the breath-analyser (BA) checks to ensure they are not tipsy.

Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) chief Arun Kumar has ordered “random drug testing for the consumption of (10) psychoactive substances” like cocaine, marijuana/hashish, MDMA or ecstasy and morphine/opiate. A pilot or ATCO testing positive for drug abuse for the first time will be grou- nded and undergo de-addiction/rehabilitation programme. Failing for the second time will mean cancellation of licence, which means such a person will not be able to work as a pilot or controller again.

People refusing to undergo this test “shall be removed from the safety sensitive duties until they clear detailed drug testing profile within a week, failing which the license of the involved person shall be suspended for three years,” the order stated.

While a start has been made with key positions, the DGCA will gradually bring more aviation personnel under the drug test. Testing will be done by a DGCA-authorised laboratory at six airports of Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Bangalore and Hyderabad in phase 1. Airlines and Airports Authority of India (which provides ATC services) “shall ensure that at least 10% of (their flight crew and ATCOs) are covered in a year.”

Apart from random checks, pilots and ATCOs will have to be tested for drug abuse at three stages: before getting hired; after an accident and follow-up testing of confirmed cases. All positive cases will have to be reported to the DGCA within 24 hours. Testing will be done on urine samples collected from the randomly selected staff. Samples shall be collected only with consent of the person required to undergo test.

Visakhapatnam: Vegetables grown by inmates of the central prison is seeing an increased demand. Authorities of the central prison have set up a stall at Adavivaram where prisoners can sell the vegetables they grow. The jail administration is even considering increasing production to meet high demand.

Speaking to TOI, S Rahul, superintendent of Vizag central prison said that of the total amount of vegetables grown by the prisoners, nearly 300kg is consumed by them per day. “Since the inmates are growing organic vegetables, the demand for prison-grown vegetables has gone up among people travelling through the Adavivaram route in the morning.”

More than 60 inmates of the central prison grow brinjal, ladies’ finger, tomato, bottle gourd, ridge gourd and other vegetables in around six acres land at the central prison. Vegetable production itself fetches Rs2,000 to Rs3,000 for the department per day. The prisoners sell the vegetables between Rs 30-Rs40 per kg based on market demands.

A number of inmates have previous agriculture experience. They use the drip and sprinkler irrigation method to water the crop. Water is drawn from three water bodies in the vicinity.

T Anil Kumar, a resident of Arilova who comes to buy vegetables from this stall said, “The inmates are trying to make their farming 100% organic. The quality of vegetables is really good. I purchase these prison-grown vegetables whenever I pass through the area.”

S Rahul, the superintendent of the prison said that inmates also grow good-quality red chilli and turmeric powder. “These are expected to hit the market by March. The spices unit will be inaugurated on February 24.”

Prison authorities plan to produce over Rs50 lakh worth chilli powder and turmeric powder per year. They have procured red chilli from Guntur and organic turmeric from Narsipatnam and Chintapalli.

With the average expenditure per inmate increasing every year, the Andhra Pradesh prison department is providing skill development training to prisoners under the Skill-India programme to increase revenue and to ensure that inmates find employment upon being released from prison.

Visakhapatnam: A medical camp was held at Homi Bhabha Cancer Hospital and Research Centre (HBCH&RC), Aganampudi, that sought to screen pairs of mothers and daughters for human papillomavirus ( HPV ), which is one of the main causes of cervical cancer.

Dr D Leela, gynaecology oncologist at HBCH&RC said cervical cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in India. The mother’s awareness about the symptoms and risk factors has a large impact on the daughter's knowledge and attitude. Mother and adolescent daughter pairs were selected as the sample as they are the target population at risk for suffering from carcinoma cervix. Mothers who are 30 and above in age are screened for breast and cervical cancer. Daughters between 10 to 14 years are given two doses of HPV vaccination at an interval of six months while above 15 years were given three doses at a zero, two and six months’ interval to protect against HPV infection, thereby preventing cervical cancer. said Dr D Leela.

In a bid to prevent cervical cancer incidence, Dr D Raghunatha Rao, director of HBCH&RC said, “We have adopted remote villages like Appapuram and Dhananipeta in Srikakulam district for complete screening of all women and vaccination of all girls against HPV virus, that causes cervical cancer. Until now, we have conducted more than 100 pairs of mother-daughter screening process. Our goal is to achieve 85% of cervical cancer screening between the age group of 35-45 and 90% vaccination among adolescent girls.”

451,['22/02/2020'],US-Taliban deal could leave Indian infra in Afghanistan vulnerable,"This story is from February 22, 2020

NEW DELHI: For the past decade, Indian policymakers and security leadership have anticipated a withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan, and what that would mean for India. The world now has a date. On Friday, the US and Taliban, in coordinated statements, announced that the two sides would sign a peace agreement on February 29.

The peace deal is expected to kick off two processes — a phased withdrawal of US troops and an ‘intra-Afghan’ dialogue. The first test will be a “significant reduction in violence” across Afghanistan. “Intra-Afghan negotiations will start soon thereafter, and will build on this fundamental step to deliver a comprehensive and permanent ceasefire and the future political roadmap for Afghanistan. The only way to achieve a sustainable peace in Afghanistan is for Afghans to come together and agree on the way forward,” US secretary of state Mike Pompeo said.

Afghanistan and its future will now be an important element in the talks the Indian leadership will have with US President Donald Trump and his cabinet next week. India will be interested in the timeline of US withdrawal as well as the details of a security/counter-terrorism presence the US may have in Afghanistan.

Tilak Devasher, formerly with RAW, said, ""India's interest is to secure the investments we have made in Afghanistan in the past two decades, and the security of our diplomats, personnel and missions. In addition, we would be wary of ungoverned spaces in that country, which could become grounds for terror groups to flourish. Of particular concern would be the prospect that Pakistan could use any such spaces to move its anti-India terror infrastructure, groups like LeT and JeM from Pakistan.”

In a sense, the peace deal could be a victory of sorts for Pakistan, which has been Taliban’s principal supporter for ever. Pakistan has been pressured by the US to bring the Taliban to the negotiating table and prima facie, it has delivered. It is significant, therefore, that despite Pakistan’s importance in getting this deal together, it could not stay off the FATF grey list, which PM Imran Khan had desperately wanted.

Former ambassador to Afghanistan Gautam Mukhopadhyaya said, “For the sake of peace that Afghans desperately want after decades of war and terrorism, any opportunity for inter-Afghan talks should be welcomed and given a chance. But Afghans will be entering such talks with the US repositioned as a facilitator rather than strategic political and military partner, and neither the Afghans nor we should be under any illusions that the decks are stacked against it. The Afghans need all the political support from the international community that they can get.”

The Afghan election results were just made public after months, giving Ashraf Ghani another victory. The results have been rejected by Abdullah Abdullah and others. Neither the US nor Pakistan have congratulated Ghani, only India and the EU have. It’s no secret that the Taliban does not consider the Kabul government to be legitimate. This not only places Ghani and his government in an uncertain position, it could allow the Taliban to pick off the different groups and oust Ghani in the foreseeable future. In an oped, Sirajuddin Haqqani, deputy leader of the Taliban and head of the dreaded Haqqani Network, emphasised a “new Afghanistan”. The contours of that will be watched warily from India.

Visakhapatnam: Students of Visakhapatnam Defence Academy (VDA) staged a protest on Friday demanding facilities such as a playground, a swimming pool, quality food and a reduction in fees. The situation turned tense when the authorities allegedly tried to lock up agitating students in a cellar.

A few students tried to meet the administrative officer of the academy but were reportedly prevented from doing so. Ch Suri Naidu, inspector, Gajuwaka police, interacted with agitating students. “We have not registered a case as the students refused to lodge a complaint. The academy management has assured to look into the complaints,” Naidu said.tnn

LUCKNOW: What should a pregnant woman eat and wear? How should she behave in daily life and keep fit with yoga? What kind of music is good for her? All this and much more will now be taught at the Institute of Women’s Studies of Lucknow University .

The new certificate and diploma courses on ‘garbha sanskar’ will be launched in the new academic session. LU will be the first state university to introduce such a course.

The move comes after governor Anandiben Patel , also the chancellor of all state universities, suggested to authorities to train girls on how to perform their prospective role as mothers. She cited the example of Abhimanyu, from the Mahabharata , who learnt warfare skills in his mother’s womb.

In her convocation address in LU last year, Patel had said in India, no formal education is imparted to girls about pregnancy, whereas in Germany , there is a dedicated institute. Though designed mainly for females, male students can also opt for the two courses.

The sound and light show is expected to increase the number of visitors to the reservoir in Vijayapura distric... Read More

ALMATTI (VIJAYAPURA): The much-awaited laser show has kicked off at the Almatti, making it perhaps the second largest such spectacle in south India, after the one at Hyderabad’s Lumbini Park . Tourists say the play of lights on the water is a sight to behold and the Alamatti is soon becoming the ‘KRS of North Karnataka’.

Named after Lal Bahadur Shastri, the reservoir stands 519.6 metres tall and is set to be raised to 524.3m. Surrounded by rock gardens, the dam site, spanning 77 acres, is one of the hottest tourist destinations in the region. The laser show began from January 26.

“The laser setup costs Rs 7 crore and the garden for the show was constructed in 2017 at Rs 4.4 crore,” said RP Kulkarni, chief engineer of the dam zone, KBJNL. “Due to lack of seating arrangement for the audience, the inauguration was deferred. The recent floods also caused severe damage to the garden.”

The government sanctioned Rs 88 lakh for repairs and Rs 2 crore to create seating. “The show is centred on patriotism. Other themes like folklore, mythology, background of the Krishna river, irrigation and history are in programming,” Kulkarni said. Spread over 20 minutes, the multimedia show throws up a water screen of 16.8 million colour patterns, set to digital sound effect from 12 speakers.

Andani Tolamatti, a shopkeeper at IB Circle in Almatti, said the laser

show is drawing tourists from as far as Mumbai, Solapur and Hyderabad. “We are also urging visitors to stop and enjoy the show. Those who have seen it say it is notches above the music fountain,” he said.

“Many visitors from south Karnataka are saying Almatti has more to offer than KRS,” said Laxman Darbar, a local musician. “Almatti has a heritage too because of the legends associated with Ramayana. The Sitimani and Almatti hills are natural marvels and provide an organic backdrop for the imposing dam. The roads leading to the dam, with their ups and downs, make for a thrilling journey.”

Shekhar Palani, a resident, credited several officials, former and serving, for bringing the laser show to Alamatti. “Retired chief engineer C Anantharamu, CE Kulkarni and other officials like Abdul Hassan, SH Manjappa, Narendra, SB Chittawadagi and Shankrayya Mathapati have worked over several years to achieve this,” he said.

455,['22/02/2020'],Activist condemns rampant misuse of sedition law,"This story is from February 22, 2020

HUBBALLI: Condemning the chanting of Pro-Pakistan slogans at rallies and events organised to protest Citizenship (Amendment) Act ( CAA ) and the National Register of Citizens ( NRC ), co-convener of the Samajwadi Samagam Sunilam, in the same vein, lambasted the misuse of provisions of the sedition law to muzzle dissent.

Calling for a detailed inquiry into the incident at Freedom Park in Bengaluru, wherein a 19-year-old girl was arrested after raising a Pro-Pakistan slogan , Sunilam said, “Filing cases against such individuals must be followed by a detailed inquiry. Off late, the sedition law is being misused indiscriminately. Cases filed against the parent of a student, and teachers of a school in Bidar, and the incident involving a writer in Koppal are regrettable. Misuse of the sedition law was not as rampant earlier.”

“In its first phase, our awareness rally ‘Bharat Jodo, Samvidhan Bachao Samajwadi Yatra’ will pass through 16 states of the country, and leaders of six of them will participate in the event. It will conclude in March in Hyderabad,” said Sunilam.

Charging the central government with rolling out CAA, NRC and the National Population Register to distract the people from the cratering economy, Sunilam said, “The number of youngsters currently unemployed in India stands at a staggering 15 crore, while the Gross Domestic Product is now hovering in the 2% to 4% range.”

Convener of Samajwadi Samagam Arun Kumar Srivastav said that the CAA and NRC were issues that concerned not just Hindus and Muslims, but all the poor people of India. Srivastav claimed that the Government of India could, only if it would, solve the plaguing problem of unemployment in a day. “Health and education are two sectors that have suffered neglect by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government. More than five crore people can be provided employment in the education sector alone given the number of vacancies for teachers. Posts of teachers are lying unfilled even in premier colleges such as IIT,” he added.

Alleging that Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) were tampered with in the Lok Sabha elections held last year, Srivastav said, “The Election Commission is not being honest about this. The officials are not allowing those who wish to demonstrate how this can be done. They are asking sceptics to prove their point from a distance, without allowing any of them to touch the device or open it. The truth will come out if the EVM is opened.”

He pointed to the use of ballot papers for elections in most developed countries. “We are planning on carrying out a nationwide rally to raise awareness about electoral malpractices,” Srivastav said.

456,['22/02/2020'],Dingaleshwar Swami reiterates claim to pontifical throne of Moorusavir Math,"This story is from February 22, 2020

Dingaleshwar Swami, sought the presence of Rajyogindra Swami at Sunday’s meeting

HUBBALLI: The dispute over succession to the pontifical throne of the Moorusavir Math was at the centre of yet another dramatic episode here on Friday with Dingaleshwar Swamiji of Balehosur Math being a principal character in the sequence of events. While he claimed that he was the rightful successor to Gurusidda Rajyogindra Swamiji, the incumbent seer of Moorusavir Mutt, legal advisor to the chief minister Mohan Limbikai lashed out at the former for needlessly raking up the issue.

Dingaleshwar Swami said that he would hold a Satya Darshana, a congregation of Moorusavir Math devotees within its premises on Sunday and explain his stance on the issue of succession. Calling on Rajyogindra Swami to clear the air surrounding the question of his successor, Dingaleshwar Swami said, “His continued silence will only further muddle the issue.”

Although Limbikai said that no meeting would be permitted on the premises of the Moorusavir Math on Sunday, Dingaleshwar Swami said that there was no question of backing down at this juncture. “We have sought permission from police to hold the meeting, to attend which devotees from various districts are coming here. There is no restriction on devotees willing to attend the meeting. It will be a peaceful meeting and police must ensure adequate security for the session,” Dingaleshwar Swami added.

On the other hand, Limbikai dismissed reports of his having signed a letter confirming Dingaleshwar Swami as the successor to Rajyogindra Swami. “That is a closed chapter and there is nothing to be gained by discussing it. Rajyogindra Swamiji is capable of overseeing the daily affairs of the math, and will continue to be its seer,” Limbikai added.

Dingaleshwar Swami, meanwhile, sought the presence of Rajyogindra Swami at Sunday’s meeting, in the course of which he claimed he would justify his claim to the Moorusavir Math’s pontifical office. Dingaleshwar Swami liked his plight to that of a groom left stranded on his wedding day owing to a ply of a few conspirators who abduct the bride-to-be.

Dingaleshwar Swamiji alleged that Rajyogindra Swami was being confined by those opposed to the former. “A few people are keeping mum over the issue by stating that the issue is sub-judice. But I want to state that the matter is not pending before the court,” he added.

Dharwad district in-charge minister Jagadish Shettar expressed dismay over the controversy that had erupted over the issue, which he pointed out was pending before the court. “I am not aware of Dingaleshwar Swami’s ‘Satya Darshana’. Members of the high-powered committee of the math have not announced the date for such a meeting, and such events must be discussed in public,” said Shettar.

458,['22/02/2020'],29 pedestrians killed near Bengaluru Metro stations in 2 years: Study,"Pedestrians wait to cross a busy road near Majestic Metro station

Times View Last month, BMRCL announced that it would allow non-Metro commuters to use the Metro’s facilities for free, in an attempt to reduce the number of pedestrian accidents near its stations. But apart from this welcome initiative, more needs to be done, especially around crowded areas like Majestic. More foot overbridges and a greater police presence would go a long way in ensuring citizen safety around Metro stations. The authorities concerned also need to make sure the proposed and recently built overbridges are well maintained and easy to use, which is often not the case.

BENGALURU: In an indication of poor pedestrian facilities, 29 pedestrians were killed in and around Metro stations during 2017 and 2018, shows a study by The Footpath Initiative .The study is based on statistics available with traffic police. According to TFI — an urban project aimed at improving walkers ’ safety in Bengaluru — these fatalities were recorded within 150 metres of the stations.The maximum pedestrian deaths (6) were reported from Majestic Interchange station, where the two currently functional corridors intersect. It could be due to heavy pedestrian movement in an area that is a transport hub with railway and bus stations, the study said. It’s one of the busiest Metro stations on the entire network.Statistics show Green Line stations accounted for more deaths than those on Purple Line. Goraguntepalya reported the second highest deaths (4), while Rajajinagar and Yeshwantpur saw three each. Similarly, Peenya Industry and Dasarahalli witnessed two deaths each. Other Green Line stations at KR Market, Chickpet, Jalahalli and Nagasandra witnessed one death each.Stations along Purple Line were comparatively safer for pedestrians. Mysuru Road, Deepanjali Nagar, Vidhana Soudha, Indiranagar and Byappanahalli stations reported one death each.Green Line (24.2km) is longer than Purple Line (18.2km) but the latter has more ridership. Stretches like Bengaluru-Tumakuru highway, along which Green Line runs, are more dangerous for Metro passengers to cross.Even as government agencies, including BBMP, BMRCL and DULT, have been promising safe at-grade pedestrian crossings, wider pavements and cycle tracks along all stations, walkers remain vulnerable to accidents.“We have compiled the report based on FIR data pertaining to pedestrian fatalities in the vicinity of Metro stations. The data indicate more deaths occur while people are crossing roads around stations. Safe at-grade crossings could be built on roads leading to Metro stations at a fraction of the overall project cost. This will save lives in the years to come,” said Anusha Chitturi, co-founder of TFI.When contacted, BMRCL managing director Ajay Seth said: “Most existing Metro stations will have a crossover or foot overbridge (FOB) for pedestrians by August. The facilities can be used by non-Metro users too.” “In Nagasandra, an FOB is being done built by BMRCL. BBMP will take up work on one at Dasarahalli. The tender for design consultant for the Yeshwantpur FOB had to be scrapped as the lowest bidder didn’t understand the scope of the work. The design is being organised through another agency,” he added.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74250767,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-389805,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengaluru-29-pedestrians-killed-near-metro-stations-in-2-years-reveals-study/articleshow/74250768.cms

BENGALURU/ CHIKKAMAGALURU/MYSURU: Amulya Leona Noronha , the 19-year-old activist who was arrested and charged with sedition for chanting ‘Pakistan Zindabad’ at an anti-CAA event in Bengaluru, was on Friday produced before a magistrate who remanded her in judicial custody for 14 days. Hearing on a bail plea filed on her behalf in the same court has been adjourned to Monday.

Amulya was arrested on Thursday when she resorted to pro-Pakistan sloganeering before starting her speech at the anti-CAA event, which was attended by AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi .

Adding a new angle to her offence, Karnataka chief minister B S Yediyurappa on Friday said preliminary investigations conducted overnight have revealed that she has an “association” with Naxals. He, however, added that Amulya was also a “victim” of certain vested groups, who are instigating youngsters.

According to sources, Amulya has told police that, in her speech, she had wanted to compare the silence that greets her reference to Pakistan with the applause that follows ‘ Hindustan zindabad ’ but her speech was cut short.

City police commissioner Bhaskar Rao on Friday said the organisers of the event will be questioned and they will also be dealt under the (sedition) law. “We will investigate who instigated Amulya to raise those slogans and action will be taken. Did they (organisers) not know what she was speaking? The drama of allowing her to talk and trying to prevent her after something damaging was said won’t work. The organisers should know who they are inviting and what they are going to speak,” Rao said.

Barely a few hours after Amulya’s pro-Pakistan slogan, her house in Shivapura in Chikkamagaluru district was attacked by a mob. Police rushed to her house and escorted her family members to an undisclosed location as a precautionary measure, even as locals held a protest in front of the house till noon.

Meanwhile, Amulya’s father Osvald Noronha apologised for his daughter’s action. “I will not extend any legal help to her. Let her stay in jail for a few days. She will understand the law of the land.”

NEW DELHI: The foundation stone for the new Army headquarters or the ‘ Thal Sena Bhawan’ (TSB), which will house 1,684 officers and 4,330 other staff personnel by bringing together the eight existing offices of the force in different parts of the Capital, was laid by defence minister Rajnath Singh at Delhi Cantonment on Friday.

The TSB, spread over 39 acres to include the 6,104 offices in a multi-storey “green” building complex with parking, will take at least five years to be completed at a cost of around Rs 750 crore. “All the departments of the Army as well as the (new) Department of Military Affairs will come under one roof here,” said defence minister Rajnath Singh.

Though most Army officers will shift to the new TSB opposite the Manekshaw Centre in Delhi Cantonment when it comes up, the brass will continue to work from the South Block on the Raisina Hill complex or where the defence ministry is shifted under the proposed Central Vista redevelopment project.

“The offices of senior functionaries in the Army, including the chief and vice-chief, will always be co-located with the Raksha Mantri’s office, wherever it may be” said Army chief General M M Naravane.

WASHINGTON: The US air force has updated its dress code to accommodate the religious sentiments of various communities, including the Sikhs, making it easier for them to join the service. Under the new guidelines, which were finalised recently, Sikhs and Muslims can seek a religious accommodation to wear turbans, beards, unshorn hair and hijabs, and expect to be approved as long as their appearance is “neat and conservative”, except under extremely limited circumstances.

The policy also clarifies that O-6 level commanders can approve an airman’s request for such an accommodation in no more than 30 days (or 60 days if the accommodation is requested outside of the US), and that an accommodation, once granted, will generally follow the airman throughout his or her career. The air force’s clarification closely resembles the US army’s 2017 policy adjustment, which similarly clarified the terms and process for soldiers requesting religious accommodations.

464,['22/02/2020'],Government to seek NPA relief for companies hit by coronavirus,"(Representative image)

NEW DELHI: The government is going to seek a relaxation in rules for classification of bank loans to a certain set of companies as a “sub-standard” asset, citing difficulties faced by them. These entities are engaged in export and import, or are those that depend on raw materials and inputs, from China where businesses have been impacted due to the coronavirus outbreak.The move follows a petition from some industry representatives to finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman to not just relax the norms but also ensure access to funds to tide over payment issues that may arise due to problems in accessing inputs and critical raw material. The proposal is part of a host of measures that have been identified by the finance ministry for action, following consultations with industry and other government departments, sources told TOI.The finance ministry is expected to take up the issue with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) over the next few days to ensure that companies that are part of special mention accounts (SMAs) continue to get access to funds despite payment problems.The change in the Income Recognition and Asset Classification (IRAC) norms is seen to be a temporary measure till the impact of the deadly virus recedes. A company is put in an SMA-0 category if the principal or loan remains unpaid for up to 30 days, while defaults of 31 to 60 days results in an SMA-2 classification. Amounts remaining overdue for up to 90 days lead to an SMA-3 categorisation.During the interaction, it had emerged that some of the industries — such as pharmaceuticals, electronics, auto parts and solar equipment — had been impacted by coronavirus, which has now claimed over 2,200 lives and infected close to 80,000 people.Following the FM’s consultations, the government has already moved in to invoke the “force majeure” clause to provide relief to suppliers who are finding it tough to execute government contracts due to the coronavirus outbreak.

465,['22/02/2020'],New deadline for completing Outer Ring Road is year end,"This story is from February 22, 2020

Nagpur: The National Highways Authority of India’s (NHAI’s) contractor MEP Infrastructure has set a deadline for completing the Outer Ring Road by year end. The work order for the 61-kilometre stretch was issued in April 2016 and it was to be completed in three years.

Project director NL Yeotkar said the work had been divided into two packages — 33km-long first package which covered the stretch from Jamtha to Fetri via Gondkhairi and the 28km-long second one from Fetri to Pawangaon on Bhandara Road (beyond Kapsi).

“The first package at the cost of Rs 531 crore is 52% complete while the second one at Rs 649 crore is 43.5% ready,” he added.

Yeotkar admitted that the contract period expired long ago and added that the contractor had been fined. “We could not terminate the contract as we had not handed over the entire land. Now, 100% land required for the project is with him. He is facing some financial problems and is holding talks with the bank. I’m unaware of the outcome,” he said.

Under this project, NHAI will construct a new 40-km cement concrete four-lane road from Gondkhairi on Amravati Road to Bhilgaon-Sirpur on the Kamptee-Jabalpur section of NH 44 via Fetri on Kalmeshwar-Katol road, Bharatwada, Panjara on Koradi-Chhindwara section of NH 47. It will also widen the 21-km stretch from Gondkhairi to Gavasi Manapur on NH 44 from the existing two-lane to four-lane and convert it to concrete road. The ORR will also have an interchange with the under-construction Mumbai-Nagpur super expressway. NHAI will construct five railway overbridges, 20 minor bridges and 15 underpasses under the project.

The project is being developed under NHAI’s hybrid annuity system. NHAI will pay 40% of total cost to the contractor during the construction period. The remaining 60% will be paid in three instalments over 15 years from the date of completion with a fixed rate of return. When the work order was issued, the project was the first in the state and second in the country to be developed under hybrid annuity system.

NHAI will levy toll to recover the project cost. Toll will be recovered by NHAI through a private agency other than the one executing the project.

466,['22/02/2020'],Sebi eyes unique ids for shares to tackle Karvy-type frauds,"This story is from February 22, 2020

(File photo)

BENGALURU: To prevent frauds like what happened at Karvy Stock Broking, markets regulator Sebi is considering a unique identity number for dematerialised shares that will establish a trail of ownership.

Before the demat era, switching shares was not possible. As a share certificate changed hands, the transactions were recorded on the certificate itself. In dematerialised shares, transfers are documented, but the absence of a unique identity made it possible for Karvy to pledge clients’ shares, held in its account, as if they were its own. Both Sebi and the NSE are currently probing this fraud.

Karvy had pledged shares with Bajaj Finance, ICICI Bank , HDFC Bank, IndusInd Bank and others to raise funds. It owes Bajaj Finance as much as Rs 300 crore.

“In the physical era, every share had three numbers — certificate numbers and a distinctive number which were unique to that company share, and the folio number, which marked the ownership.

The new owner’s folio number would be recorded on the reverse of the certificate after every transaction,” said a Sebi official, aware of the discussions.

Sources said Sebi could look at employing decentralised ledgers like blockchain or hashgraphs for maintaining historical records of the unique ids for shares.

“After demat, shares — like currency — became untraceable. If unique certificate numbers had been in existence, Karvy could have never pledged its clients’ shares as its own without the banks noticing,” said the official. Of some 95,000 affected clients, Karvy returned securities of nearly 83,000 clients. Now lenders have appealed, claiming a lien on the shares.

WELLINGTON: Debutante Kyle Jamieson and veteran Tim Southee took four wickets apiece to knock India out for a paltry 165 in little over an hour on the second day of the first Test here on Saturday.

Jamieson (4/49 in 16 overs) and Southee (4/49 in 20.1 overs) took four of the five wickets that fell on the second morning with India adding only 43 runs to their overnight score of 122 for 5.

SCORECARD

Rishabh Pant (19) started with a six but then a horrible mix-up with senior partner Ajinkya Rahane (46) resulted in a run-out and the little chances of recovery was gone for good.

Ravichandran Ashwin got a beauty from Southee, pretty similar to what Prithvi Shaw got, while Rahane inside edged one while trying to leave it alone.

It was Mohammed Shami (21), who chanced his arms a bit hitting a few blows that got India above 150-run mark.

He added 22 runs with Ishant Sharma for the ninth wicket. They were both out in quick succession as the innings folded in only 68.1 overs.

Nagpur: Anil Deshmukh, on his first visit to the Maoist-affected tribal Gadchiroli district after taking over as home minister, said at a press meet on Friday that pending development works in remote localities will pick up pace soon. He also said tackling the rebel movement would be done in a phased manner by the Mahavikas Aghadi (MVA) government.

Deshmukh, flanked by former minister Dharmaraobaba Atram, collector Deepak Singla, DIG Mahadeo Tambade and SP Shailesh Balkawade, also said issues related to the district, especially those related to development, would be addressed on priority. The government would try to find phase-wise solutions to developmental works.

During the visit, Deshmukh also reviewed security issues and different projects under the district administrations in separate meetings. He also met party workers from different parts of Gadchiroli, who raised a demand to construct a statue of former district guardian minister and ex-home minister late RR Patil.

Deshmukh, reiterating the stance of MVA alliance, and echoing the opinion of his party supremo Sharad Pawar regarding the Elgar parishad and Koregaon-Bhima case, raised question on the Central government’s decision to hand over the probe to the National Investigation Agency (NIA). He said that the Centre had taken a unilateral decision in this matter.

“Just when we were considering formation of Special Investigating Team (SIT) to probe the two cases of Elgar parishad and Koregaon-Bhima, the Centre shifted them to NIA without consulting the state,” he said. Deshmukh also said the past government bracketed anyone who raised question on them or opposed their moves as ‘urban Naxal’.

Deshmukh also said the government would now consider restarting recruitment process in police department and also in the Maharashtra State Security Corporation. “The recruitment would throw open opportunities for aspirants in Gadchiroli district too,” he said.

Stressing on increasing employment facilities, Deshmukh said projects like Surjagadh need to be supported. “Our government is trying to revive projects like Surjagadh to generate employment here,” said the home minister.

Deshmukh also said his government would ensure adequate compensation for ryots who faced losses due to overflow from the Medigadda baragge of Telangana. He said there is a coordination meeting going on between officials of the two states.

469,['22/02/2020'],Chanda cops to verify use of subsidized coal by industries,"This story is from February 22, 2020

Chandrapur: Local crime branch has intensified probe into the alleged coal scam and has dispatched four teams to industries that are suspected to be involved in sale of subsidized coal in open market at premium rates.

LCB in-charge PI Omprakash Kokate informed that cops had summoned representatives of the industries that had lifted the coal from mines for questioning. However, as none of the industries responded, a team each has been dispatched to four separate districts to investigate the records of subsidized coal taken and utilized by the beneficiary units.

Kokate claimed that seven companies under scanner are Geeta Refinery, Bhumi Cotex and Asthlaxmi Reloading Pvt Ltd from Jalna, Roshan Linework from Rajur in Yavatmal district, Ram-Ratan Casting, Nagpur, Umesh Boards and Paper Mills of Aurangabad and Shri Minerals and Chemicals, Bhandara.

“Our teams are going to visit the industries in Jalna, Bhandara, Yavatmal and Nagpur. Cops will verify the records related to lifting of subsidized coal, transportation procedure, stock and utilization,” said Kokate.

LCB team had detained 26 trucks loaded with subsidized coal at a private coal depot near Nagada village on Tuesday. The coal was allotted to seven industries by Maharashtra State Mining Corporation (MSMC) at subsidized rate for industrial use. However, the coal was taken to the private depot where the LCB team conducted the raid.

Meanwhile, the deadlock over filing of the complaint continues between the LCB and MSMC as the corporation officials are not willing to file any report without their own inquiry into the alleged malpractice.

MSMC general manager Premchand Tembhre said the utilization committee would check the record of coal lifted by the concerned company and its utilization during recent months. “Only after procedural inquiry, we will decide if there is any illegality involved in dumping of coal at private coal depot,” he said.

Though the LCB is continuing probe, it is not willing to file suo motu complaint. “The government agency responsible for ensuring that subsidized coal allocated to industrial units is not misused or sold in market should file the complaint. But MSMC has denied to take the responsibility. Hence, we are investigating on our own, while they (MSMC officials) carry out their inquiry,” said Kokate.

MSMC allocates quota of subsidized coal to hundreds of industries across the state every month. There is possibility that many of these companies are seeking excessive quota, while a bunch of them might be closed and still claiming the coal and selling it in the open market through traders.

Nagpur: Four woman labourers were killed and three others were injured after loose earth collapsed on them during excavation at the site of an under-construction weir on a nullah at Pathkedi, near Adasa village in Saoner tehsil, on Friday. The accident site is around 40km from the city.

The deceased have been identified as Varsha Madavi (26), Anusaya Tekam (45), Sunita Kailash (35) and Rampyari Kakoriya (18). Three others were injured and rushed to Nagpur for treatment, and later discharged.

It’s learnt the women labourers were engaged in construction work for the irrigation department, which had kicked off around a week ago. The labourers from Madhya Pradesh had taken no precaution against such earth collapse.

How brands and new business models create sustainable growth

A dive into how companies can make consumers active participants in value creation

Trust is the world’s biggest economic power

How companies can use it to their advantage

Innovation pays most when uncertainty peaks

How marketers can anticipate change, prepare for it and enjoy it

NEW DELHI: The second day of Star FLOW — The Change Festival, an initiative by The Times of India — opened with the session ‘The New Brand Model — Are you creating Brands or Consumers?’ by Marty Neumeier, director of CEO Branding at Liquid Agency, redefining branding for marketers.“I changed it from being a logo, or a message or a campaign or a product to being something else. A brand is a person’s gut feeling about the product, service or company,” said Neumeier.The best-selling author said a brand is not what a company thinks it is but rather what a customer thinks it is. “You have to look at it from the other way round, which is really hard. Companies have difficulty in seeing their brands from the point of view of the customer. But that’s the main trick,” said Neumeier, who wrote several books, including ‘The Brand Gap’ and ‘ZAG’.Power has shifted from companies to customers because of the internet and social media, he said, while explaining that in the new-age brand model, companies create customers first. “For instance, you co-design a product or service with a specific set of customers you want to work for. They help you create it. They keep telling people about this great product they are involved with. They build a tribe.”Neumeier told marketers that people are not focused on products as much they mean. “Customers buy products to build their identities, they hate being sold, but they love to buy, they buy in tribes to feel safe and successful. And, the company with the strongest tribe wins.”Erich Joachimsthaler, the founder and CEO of Vivaldi Group, a New York-headquartered 150-person independent strategy, brand, and innovation marketing consulting firm, opened his session by dividing branding into two parts — brand strategy and brand architecture.While strategy is what a company is or aspires to be, architecture combines all things such as products and strategy, said Joachimsthaler. Talking about evolution of branding, he said the clamour around technology started about a quarter of a century ago with ecommerce and search algorithm, followed by social media. Currently, people are talking about AI, IoT and Blockchain.“While earlier the brand architecture was confined to a world of walls characterised by production, marketing, design, and research, now it is more about the world of web characterised by producers and consumers,” said Joachimsthaler.He quoted the example of Lego and how the company aced the brand strategy. “Lego reached out to its customers and asked them to build designs with old Lego sets and put them online. If the design won more than 10,000 votes, it would be mass-produced by Lego.”He said through this process, they involved customers in value creation. This led to people talking about the brand in their circles and created powerful branding.He said while in earlier days, branding was about extracting premium, currently it is about engaging with the customers. Elaborating about how to build a strong brand, he listed three things — network effect, learning effect and viral effect. The network effect talks about how a product becomes more valuable as more and more people talk about it. The learning effect happens as the company applies human knowledge and artificial intelligence to make its brand better. And, the viral effect kicks in when consumers become advocates of a brand and encourage others to use these products and services.Philipp Kristian Deikhoner, author of the book, The Trust Economy, said marketers and brands across the world have had to cope up with shifts in generations, from baby boomers to Gen X, millennials and Gen Z and tweak their strategies. With the rise of the Zen Z, one of the most important avenues for the brands to tap is the ‘Trust Economy’.The Trust Economy deals with trust being the most impactful economic power. Deikhoner said Trust Economy is driven by Gen Z and Gen Y, enabled by data, technology and digital platforms and it values factors, such as, speed, flexibility, agility and convenience.Deikhoner said the experience inside an organisation mirrors the experience outside and hence building trust within the organisation is the first step in that direction. “Work environment in most organisations isn’t conducive to innovation, as there isn’t enough trust between the people. When organisations hire young people, they need to trust them and enable them to innovate.”Once the trust has been established within the organisation, it would further help in building trust among customers. “The brands need to weave stories and then make the customers trust their stories,” said Deikhoner, adding, it is however important that these stories are authentic and honest, especially in case of a controversial product, such as a cigarette or an alcohol brand.Talking about the ways brands can salvage trust after having had a breach, he said that it depends on number of breaches that have taken place and the history of the brand. If the brand has had a long reputable history, a couple of breaches are manageable. However, even in this case, it is important that the brands are honest. “The best strategy in case of a breach is to be upfront, accept the mistake, instead of trying to put it away and manipulate customers.” He gave the example of an oil spill by a company, saying that the involvement was very high, the customers forgot about the breach in a very short time, hence the customer’s involvement with the brand is also a very important factor in handling such breaches.While maintaining trust on their part, brands also have to be careful that they do not give customers a window of opportunity to break the trust. “For instance, if an e-commerce company is getting customers through frequent discounts, the trust they are generating is transactional in nature and hence once the discount goes away, the customer moves to break the trust,” said Deikhoner. He added that companies tend to seem too needy and desperate when they offer too many discounts or promotions.From showing images of the garage where computer maker Hewlett-Packard (HP) was founded to charting the routes of Amerigo Vespucci and Christopher Columbus on a giant map, Charles Leadbeater, author and leading authority on innovation and creativity, revealed how uncertainty can lead to new possibilities.Leadbeater urged marketers to look beyond the mainstream into the margins and ask radically different questions without assuming that one knows.“Be curious not only about your existing customers but about people who might become your customers.”Leadbeater spoke about how the mountain bike was created by modifying cruiser bicycles and why sitting in office for long hours is not a good idea because meeting similar people is not the right way to come up with an innovative idea. Quoting the example of Jaipur Foot as a pathbreaking innovation, he advised marketers and companies to seek out a community because the real unit of innovation is a creative community with a cause.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74253848,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-2055916,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/are-you-creating-brands-or-consumers/articleshow/74250851.cms

MUMBAI: Western Railway has told the BMC to get approaches to Delisle bridge ready by November 2020, as it plans to open the connector by then. It also flagged off issues of encroachments, cables and muck, the removal of which is necessary by BMC to prevent damage to bridges.

The February 20 meeting was between a WR team led by divisional railway commissioner (DRM) G V L Satyakumar and municipal commissioner Pravin Pardeshi.

A source said WR told BMC that approaches to the Lower Parel bridge should be ready by November 20 and Frere bridge before May.

Delisle bridge was shut on July 24, 2018, after joint safety audit by WR and BMC. The railway portion was dismantled and construction above it is under progress.

The IIT-B had recommended a change in the super structure of Frere ROB, whose work is in progress, ever since it was closed on January. WR plans to rebuild the bridge by May 20.

WR also told BMC to remove encroachments from Mahalaxmi ROB to undertake repairs. On Dharavi ROB, WR said there were encroachments at the south-east side. There were also discussions on reconstruction or construction of bridges over railway land, like Gokhale bridge in Andheri and two ROBs in Mahalaxmi.

NEW DELHI: With the onset of tourism in the Leh valley, the locals started getting influenced by the architecture followed in the cities and town. Soon enough, many mud houses were being converted into cement houses as a cement house was a sign of affluence. However, the houses made with cement were unfit for the weather and turned extremely cold during the winters.“After spending significant money on building cement houses, people were forced to spend more money on keeping these houses warm,” says Sonam Wangchuk , innovator, education reformist, inspiration for the film 3 Idiots and Ramon Magsaysay Award winner.Wangchuck and his students wanted to sell the idea of mud houses to the people in the valley, but they realised that the poor did not want these houses as ‘no one wants to be known as poor’.“We then started building mud houses with contemporary architecture and interiors, making them aspirational. Soon, many rich people were building the mud houses and the poor were not tearing away their mud houses for the cement ones,” said Wangchuk, while talking on a session about Simplicity Delivers Beyond-Tech Solutions. He said creating a market and impression around the product also helped them in marketing it.The idea was to brand and position the idea in a way that it sells among the people. Talking about another such simple innovation, he spoke about the concept of ‘Ice Stupas’. Ice Stupas are basically small man-made glaciers that can provide water to the farmers in a region in the, otherwise, dry periods of spring and summer. “Instead of telling people that these were cones of ice, we presented them as Ice Stupas and we even put prayer flags around them,” said Wangchuk. He and his students further got environment ambassadors to endorse the idea and innovation. The Ice Stupa soon became a movement worldwide and people started having stupa building competitions and ice stupa cafes.Going beyond the idea of branding and marketing these innovations, Wangchuk said these were just small fixes and would not help the mountains in the long-term. “We realised that we need to get people to change their behaviour and have to communicate in an innovative way that resonates with them,” he said. Here comes his latest ‘innovation’ called Live Simply movement. The movement allows people to register their steps on the website and it would tell them their contribution towards saving the environment in monetary terms.“One of the most important things about marketing is that the brands have to walk the talk. “I have stopped ironing my clothes to save electricity, I wear shoes bought in 1989 and wear clothes torn and sewn,” said Wangchuk.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74250864,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-289479,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/simplicity-delivers-solutions-beyond-tech-wangchuk/articleshow/74250865.cms

479,['22/02/2020'],A Fish Called Hilsa,"This story is from February 22, 2020

Kolkata: Have you ever wondered exactly how many bones your favourite one-kilo hilsa has? Well, it has around 46-48 vertebrae, lots more than humans, and roughly 1,500 smaller bones. This includes the deadly-looking spear-shaped “pin bone” — freely lying “floating bones” within the fish muscles.

Salt Lake-based ophthalmologist Arnab Biswas’s seven-year-old research on hilsa, arguably Bengalis’ favourite fish — had prompted him to first do a CT scan on the fish to understand its bone structure and, later, over several days, painstakingly count every bone it had. And this is just one aspect of Biswas’s hilsa research.

And to think he just wanted to write a cookbook. Starting from that, Biswas has now ended up digging up every possible detail about the hilsa, instead. For seven years, he has worked with a myriad people — fossil experts, fisheries experts, oceanographers, local fishermen, just to dig up unknown nuggets about the fish.

Biswas, whose work ‘Way of the Hilsa’, in which he collaborated with Thailand-based researcher Pratchaya Phinthong and Bangladeshi artist Md Sajedul Haque for display in the Dhaka Art Summit (DAS) in Dhaka’s Shilpakala Academy on February 8, now argues that the hilsa’s origin may be even older that what available research suggests. “It is largely believed from the fossils found in Italy, Japan, Rajasthan and Mizoram that the hilsa’s ancestors, the Clupeidae family [a family of ray-finned fishes, comprising the herrings, shads, sardines, hilsa, and menhadens], can be traced back to 40-50 million years,” Biswas argues. But symbols traced back to the Indus Valley Civilisation denote a fish closely resembling the hilsa, he says. “I have superimposed the hilsa on these symbols, and it matches perfectly,” he says.

And that is not all. “If you know about Jhulelal — a 1000 AD saint, the most revered deity of the Sindhi Hindus and revered by Muslims as Zinda Pir, you’ll know that he travels on a fish on the Indus river. This was the palla, the local name of hilsa in Sindh. Even in the Ajanta caves, in the pictorial representation of the Monkey God in Bodhisattva, there are fish visible on the river. And they, too, have the same shape,” he says. “The palla fish were all believed to come from the Saraswati basin. Also consider the spread of the fossils from Italy to Mizoram,” he says.

Biswas, who along with his wife and son, has been travelling to the coastal belts of India, Bangladesh and Myammar to dig more details, says too little is being done to save the fish. “From my understanding the Hilsa will always come back to the place where it was born. In their life span of 4-5 years, they will make three to four attempts to swim upstream in the river to breed. This is essential for many reasons,” he says. “When the Hilsa swims against the tide on the river to find a breeding place, it eats very less. It also forms polyunsaturated fatty acid. It also urinates more leaving out the toxins from the body. And due to the swimming, the muscles are softer. So, the taste is basically a culmination of all these,” he argues.

Another thing to consider is what hilsa feed on, Biswas says. “I tried to collect plankton samples from a depth of 40 feet in the Ganges. This is what the hilsa feeds on, primarily. However, due to pollution, their natural food resource is now getting sparse,” he adds. “Historically, we know that hilsa swam upstream 1,500km in the Ganges, up to Allahabad. In the Sindh river, it travelled 750km upstream till Multan. Now, that is no longer the case. Instead, we are fishing them from the seas and have set up the Farakka barrage. And by artificial production of hilsa, we are playing havoc with their in-built ‘GPS system’, which allows them to swim thousands of kilometres to breed,” he says. It’s no wonder, he says, that people often complain that hilsa these days don’t taste as good.

The changing patterns of hilsa migration — which has seen disruptions — is a large part of Biswas’s work, with Phinthong and Haque. “I had been in Rangoon and up along the Iravati river, also to several places in Bangladesh,” he says. Similarly, Phinthong and Haque have travelled to Farakka several times. “Viewed in isolation, the Farakka barrage, built in 1975, may seem to be one issue. But this is symptomatic of a larger issue of creating man-made obstacles on their migratory paths, which has large-scale implications.” The other factor, he adds, which may push hilsa to oblivion is the fishing of khoka-ilish or immature hilsa. The Bangladesh government has imposed a fortnight-long fishing ban immediately after Laxmi Puja, he informs, just to stop this.

Biswas says it is a “rarity” for a fish to be so fused with the socio-cultural ethos of Bengalis. “Recently, in Bangladesh, they tried to start a tradition on Poila Baisakh — the Bengali New Year — to have Panta-Ilish. This became so popular that the government had to step in to remind people that this wasn’t Bengali culture. But what the government was trying to do, and rightly so, was to stop fishing of khoka-ilish. In Bengal, too, we have witnessed similar efforts by the government,” he says. “Now, compare this with the much older ritual in Bangladesh’s Faridpur — of having Hilsa roe with puffed rice on Dashami, after immersion. That was the last time they would eat hilsa, starting again only from Saraswati Puja. In Bengal, jora-Ilish or a pair of hilsa is offered in the Puja. Now we understand the reason why people stopped having hilsa in this period. This was breeding time. This window allowed newborn hilsa, called jhatka, to swim back to the seas,” he says.

He signs off with an interesting question: If people could do it then, why not now?

480,['22/02/2020'],"Calcutta high court junks green legal paper, switches to white A4 sheets","This story is from February 22, 2020

: The Calcutta High Court

KOLKATA: The Calcutta High Court has dumped green to go green.

All submissions to the Calcutta HC contained in petitions, affidavits and applications will now have to be printed on white A4-size executive bond papers instead of the green or embossed papers used till now, a notification issued earlier this week has said.

Green paper, also known as “legal paper”, is thicker and more damaging to the environment, say experts. Use of such paper also pinches litigants’ pockets; a 500-sheet pack of green paper costs Rs 310 but a similar one of A4 sheets comes for Rs 200.

The initial notification for this change came on January 20. It stated that documents to be submitted in the appellate side of the court should be printed not on green paper but on legal chart paper or on chart paper “cut to legal size” (8.5 inches by 14 inches). The notification also specified the letter font and size and the spacing between letters in computer printed petitions, appeals or affidavits. This notification was to come into retrospective effect from January 1, 2020.

But HC advocate Nikunj Berlia wrote to the Chief Justice on January 24, pointing out that litigants who used green paper between January 1 and January 20 would then suffer. He also questioned the rationale of not having the same rules for the Original side of the court.

Berlia pointed out that the stipulations would leave two-thirds of the page blank, contributing to a huge wastage. He then pushed for printing on both sides, pointing out that people had no problem reading books or magazines.

Berlia filed a petition on these issues that was mentioned by advocate Phiroze Edulji on Monday for early hearing. The fresh notification came a day later, on Tuesday, addressing most of Berlia’s grievances. The new paper rule now applies to both original and appellate sides of the court and the legal chart paper provision has been removed with new margin specifications allowing for full utilisation of space.

The only issue that is yet to be resolved is the matter of printing on both sides. “Reading double-sided books and magazines do not appear problematic for us. Neither then should reading petitions. That will diminish paper consumption by nearly half. A tree produces 8,333 sheets of virgin-non-recycled-paper and it takes 10 litres (2.6 gallons) of water to create a piece of paper. This effortless fix will have a breath-taking effect on our environment,” Berlia’s petition stated.

481,['22/02/2020'],Why we pay a king’s ransom to eat the ‘king’,"This story is from February 22, 2020

Kolkata: For the hilsa , the undisputable status of ‘king’ of all fishes — if you ask a Bengali — is both a blessing and a curse. The silver slivers of heaven might be getting a lot of attention from both gourmands and chefs, but this is precisely why it is largely responsible for its fast disappearance from Bengal’s platters.

And, with supplies getting thinner and thinner, the cost of hilsa has been shooting through the roof. Experts have spelt doom for the fish, unless prevailing fishing styles, river pollution, riverbed siltation are not reversed. And this is not an easy ask.

For the average Bengali household, having hilsa for lunch or dinner has become an extreme luxury. The smaller variety is tasteless, while the bigger ones, weighing more than 1.5kg, cost a fortune, going for anything between Rs 1,500 and Rs 2,000 a kilo.

“For decades altogether, our insatiable greed has been responsible for the fast-decreasing catch of hilsa,” says Satinath Patra, secretary, West Bengal Fishermen’s Welfare Association. “We continued bottom-trawling and caught juvenile hilsa indiscriminately without paying any heed to the state fisheries department’s notification prohibiting fishing between September 15 sand October 24. We learnt little from our Bangladeshi counterparts,” he adds.

According to the notification, fishing is prohibited in the sea and adjoining estuaries in the deltaic zones from April 15 to May 31 and from September 15 to October 24 to facilitate undisturbed breeding of hilsa. Besides, fishing, hoarding and selling of juvenile hilsa smaller than 23cm in length is prohibited. But only a handful of fishermen comply with such norms, Patra concedes.

Earlier, catching mature hilsa during its upstream swim used to be the sustainable practice among fishermen. “Hilsa used to migrate all the way to Allahabad in the Ganga river system from Bangladesh. Building of a barrage in Farakka completely blocked the Hooghly-Bhagirathi migratory route. I asked one of the architects of the barrage whether he kept in mind the fish passage. He admitted that the barrage was built in a hurry, omitting many things,” said West Bengal Pollution Control Board chairman Kalyan Rudra, who is a river expert.

Though hilsa lives in saltwater, it swims to freshwater and estuarine waters to spawn. Hilsa normally has a life expectancy of four to five years, during which they spawn thrice. They start swimming upstream during the southwest monsoon, when the Hooghly swells. The juveniles go back to the sea and repeat the cycle. These juveniles are caught during their seaward migration with fine nets, says Asim Nath, a fisheries expert with the Sidho Kanhu Birsa University.

There were desperate measures on the part of the government. To ramp up the hilsa supply round the year, scientists from Kakdwip’s Institute of Aqua Culture have been trying an innovative method of cultivating the fish in tank water with induced salinity, but the measure has been met with little success.

The scientists initially failed to save the seedlings but after making changes in the salinity content of the water and bringing changes in the feed, are now optimistic. Some apprehensions were expressed about whether the unique taste of the fish would be retained as it travels through the Pacific Ocean before coming to the shores of Bengal. “We are hopeful now. As the feed consists of ‘phytoplankton’, the taste will be intact,” said a scientist.

482,['22/02/2020'],‘Egiye ashun’ posters put Sovan back in reckoning,"This story is from February 22, 2020

Kolkata: Residents of south Kolkata on Friday woke up to “Apni egiye ashun Sovanda” (come forward Sovanda) posters put up along major roads in the run-up to civic polls, sparking speculation about which side former mayor Sovan Chatterjee is on.

The posters bear no political party’s name but are embossed with a lotus symbol. These have been issued by Kolkata Nagarik Brinda, an innocuous group, but doesn’t clarify the affiliation question. The posters call for reclusive Sovan’s return to restore the old glory of Kolkata Municipal Corporation and resume the “good work” he had done as mayor and finish development projects for the city.

Bengal BJP vice-president Jayprakash Majumdar didn’t consider the posters official. “These posters were not issued by the party. But we all want Sovanda back at work. There is no denying he has the experience, and did good work for the city,” Majumdar said and added that Sovan was now with BJP.

Were the posters a teaser for Sovan’s return to active politics under the BJP banner? So it would seem from what Sovan’s friend Baisakhi Banerjee said. “Sovanda distanced himself from active politics for past several months owing to differences of opinion with some BJP leaders. But I will be happy to see him back in action. I am surprised to see that even a poster can elicit such response despite his long absence from political arena,” she said.

Baisakhi, however, didn’t name BJP. What’s more is her recent visit to Trinamool senior Partha Chatterjee’s Naktala home that has sent out mixed signals about Sovan’s political future.

“Sovan left the party himself. He has to decide what he will do now. I wish him to come back to active politics,” said Partha Chatterjee.

Political observers believe Sovan has issued the posters to ensure his mayoral candidacy in the battle for the Kolkata municipal polls.

Bengal BJP, however, is not making any promises to Sovan before he takes the civic poll plunge. “We are yet to decide candidates and faces for the municipal election,” BJP state general secretary Sayantan Basu said.

There is no commitment from Trinamool either about Sovan leading the ruling-party brigade in Kolkata civic polls.

483,['22/02/2020'],BJP awaits police nod for Amit Shah’s Kolkata rally,"This story is from February 22, 2020

<p> Union home minister Amit Shah<br></p>

KOLKATA: Bengal BJP is yet to get a go-ahead from the police for holding Union home minister Amit Shah ’s rally in Kolkata on March 1. The party has lined up a civic reception for Shah on the Shahid Minar ground for steer- ing the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in Parliament.

“We sought police permission for holding the rally on the Shahid Minar ground. But Lalbazar has neither given a go-ahead to the meeting, nor has it turned down our proposal,” Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh said on Friday.

In 2014, Bengal BJP had to move court for holding then BJP president Shah’s rally in Kolkata. Ghosh hopes that police won’t come in the way of the home minister’s programme. Police are yet to communicate their decision to the rally organisers.

Ghosh said BJP has received permission from the Army, the custodian of the Shahid Minar ground. He added that the use of loudspeakers on that date won’t go against the ban on use of microphones during board examinations. “First, the Shahid Minar ground doesn’t come under any residential area. There is no chance of disturbance to students and their parents. Second, there is no examination scheduled that day,” the Bengal BJP president said.

BJP is looking up to Shah’s rally to give the party a fillip at a time anti-CAA protesters have been regularly hitting the city streets even as BJP leaders are busy holding pro-CAA rallies in the districts.

“We wanted PM Narendra Modi to come to Kolkata. But he has pre-occupations. Amitji is coming on March 1,” Ghosh said.

Trinamool senior and state parliamentary affairs minister Partha Chatterjee has no problem over Shah’s Kolkata visit. “He had come to Kolkata earlier as BJP president. He is the Union home minister now. I believe he will hold the rally abiding by the rules and protocol for holding the programme,” Chatterjee said.

484,['22/02/2020'],"Smokers more susceptible to coronavirus attack, say experts","Representative image

KOLKATA: Smoking makes you several times more vulnerable to an attack by the novel coronavirus nCoV ) that has taken more than 2,000 lives across China and southeast Asia so far, warn experts.A cell receptor — a component in the cell to which viruses stick easily — turns more pronounced in smokers thus attracting the virus and allowing it entry into the system, the experts have pointed out. In case of an outbreak in the state, transmission of the virus could be rapid since 36% of Bengal’s population use tobacco and two-thirds of Kolkatans are exposed to smoking in public places, according to a recent study.Studies conducted in the aftermath of the SARS outbreak in 2003 revealed that the ACE2 or the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor of the human cell turns more ‘expressed’ in smokers. Both the human airway epithelia as well as lung parenchyma of smokers were found to have the more pronounced receptor and a considerable number of them were afflicted with SARS — the deadly respiratory distress triggered by a virus that resulted in more than 800 deaths. It might be happening in the case of Covid-19 as well, suspect doctors.SARS and Covid-19 are similar in the way they affect the human system. Both affect the lungs severely leading to respiratory distress and death in some cases, pointed out consultant Arindam Biswas.Biswas said, “Some initial analyses have suggested that COVID-19 might have affected smokers more than the rest. While the studies are still incomplete there is reason to believe that it’s true since both SARS and COVID affect the human system in a similar fashion.” Kolkata, he added, could be at a greater risk due to the large number of smokers in the city.Is it too late for a smoker to quit now hoping to avoid the virus? It takes at least 2-3 years for the ACE2 receptor to lose its prominence, said experts. “Quitting now may lessen your breathing distress but it won’t save you from the virus,” said Biswas.Any virus that affects the upper respiratory tract like the adeno, rhino or the nCoV is likely to affect smokers more, pointed out virologist Amitabha Nandy. “Smoking reduces the normal immunity of the lungs’ mucus membranes making them more prone to a viral attack. So, it is likely that nCov, too, will affect smokers more easily,” said Nandy.Potent viruses like SARS and nCoV usually infiltrate the lower respiratory tract, said RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) critical care head Souren Panja. “While those getting into the upper respiratory tract are relatively harmless, the ones triggering SARS and nCoV tend to affect the lungs and trigger pneumonia,” said Panja.Explaining the latest threat, experts pointed out that nCoV was a mutated strain of the coronavirus group to which humans are yet to grow a resistance.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74250788,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-106963,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/smokers-more-susceptible-to-ncov-attack-say-experts/articleshow/74250431.cms

Family members of Raj Das at their Keshab Chandra Sen Street residence

TARAKESHWAR/JALPAIGURI/KOLKATA: Three of four north Kolkata youths on their way to the Shiva temple in Tarakeshwar and five men from Alipurduar lost their lives in two accidents that occurred between late Thursday night and early Friday.

Narkelbagan’s Akash Das, a 26-year-old app-cab driver, and friends Raj Das, a 21-year-old Calcutta Medical College sweeper from Keshab Chandra Sen Street, neighbour Rajesh Das (20) and Chhotu Das (16) left home at 1.30am on Friday for Nimtolla Ghat’s Bhootnath Mandir and then set out for Tarakeshwar. In Balaigari, off Tarakeshwar, the two-wheeler that carried all four slammed into a truck.

Akash, Raj and Rajesh died almost immediately while Chhotu is battling for life, police said. Chhotu has been brought to Kolkata for treatment. The victims’ families had no knowledge of the two-wheeler. Raj’s father Shibnath said his son worked as a sweeper and had married only a month back. Akash, he added, has a son who is less than a year old. “They were well-behaved and stayed away from trouble. We never realised their wish to offer puja in Tarakeshwar (on Shivratri) would lead to their deaths. Our families have been destroyed,” Shibnath said.

Akash’s father and Rajesh’s family have left for Tarakeshwar to bring back the bodies. “The victims were on a vehicle that collided with a truck. Investigations are on,” Hooghly police superintendent Tanmoy Bose said.

Locals protesting against the accident blocked the Baidyabati-Tarakeshwar SH-2 for an hour.

In the accident at Birpara in Alipurduar at 12.30am, all five victims in their mid-30s were drunk, police claimed. Asraf Ali (driver), Barun Sarkar, Manoj Shah, Mithun Das and Sanjay Biswas died on the spot when their MUV hit a stone chip-laden dumper from behind near Demdema tea estate on Asian Highway 48. They were on their way to Jalpaiguri’s Gayerkata from Birpara.

The sixth person in their vehicle, Sibu Mondol, was grievously injured. He was rushed to Birpara state general hospital, from where he was taken to a private nursing home in Siliguri.

The collision was so massive that the dumper’s rear axel broke apart. “The driver rammed the vehicle into the dumper from behind. The manner in which the dumper’s rear axel broke, I would say it was a close shave for its driver and helper,” a police official said.

‘Receiving ‘Man of the Match’ award for my 10-wicket haul against West Indies was special’

‘I look forward to spending time with my five month-old son, Yohaan’

In November 2009, Pragyan Ojha , a 23-year-old off-spinner from Odisha , made his way into the Indian test team. On a Kanpur wicket that had a bit of grass on it, Ojha kept things tight and got four wickets in the match (two in each innings), including the prize wicket of Mahela Jayawardene. While Pragyan’s bowling figures from that test match aren’t exactly spectacular, what made the occasion special for the youngster was to receive his test cap from the legendary Sachin Tendulkar .“I can never forget the moment when I received my test cap from Sachin Tendulkar sir. I was extremely nervous but he made me feel so comfortable. Playing for India is a huge honour in itself but to be welcomed into the fold by Sachin sir himself was truly a special feeling,” shares Ojha, who announced his retirement from international and first-class cricket on Friday.The Hyderabad-based cricketer played 24 tests and 18 ODIs for India and despite not featuring in a single international fixture since 2013, Ojha continued to play domestic cricket till 2019. The off-spinner tells us that the decision to retire was not an easy one but he knew it was the right decision. “Having played professional cricket for 16 years, it’s hard to just give it all up. When I wrote an official letter to Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and Hyderabad Cricket Association (HCA) announcing my retirement, it was one of the hardest things I’ve done. But I thought the time has come for me to move on, because I didn’t want to reach a point where I’d get stagnant as a cricketer and my career would be headed nowhere,” says the 33-year-old, adding, “Cricket is something that I love and I didn’t want to get to a stage where I start hating something that I have loved so deeply for so many years. So I know that this is was the right time to announce my retirement.Pragyan, who also played in the Indian Premier League (for Team Hyderabad and Mumbai respectively) looks back fondly on his journey as a cricketer. Although, it has been six years since he’s played international cricket, Pragyan says he’s cherished every single moment he’s been on the cricket pitch — be it first class cricket orinternational cricket. “Some of my best performances have come in domestic cricket and I’ve made many memories that will last me for a lifetime. I feel proud to be part of the Indian cricket team and at the same time, I’m happy for whatever chances I’ve got to prove myself in all formats of the game. I’ve always given my 100 per cent in every match I played,” says Pragyan, his voice shaking with emotion. “One of my most memorable moments on the cricket pitch was when I won the ‘Man of the Match’ award for taking 10 wickets in a match against West Indies in 2013. It was coincidentally Sachin Tendulkar’s last (200th) test match too. I’m going to miss all the fun and banter that we had in the dressing room. We used to have great fun, especially while travelling. I’m going to miss all of that,” he adds.Pragyan reserves special praise for his mentors Venkatapathy Raju and VVS Laxman, who’ve had a huge influence on him as a cricketer. “Both Venkatapathy Raju and VVS Laxman have a special place in my life. I got inspired to play cricket by Venkatapathy Raju, he was my role model. Laxman, on the other hand, has been like an elder brother to me and was always there when I needed him. Their contribution to my game and career has been immense,” he says.While he’s called time on his career as a cricketer, Pragyan looks forward to his second innings, especially spending time with his five month-old son, Yohaan.“I want to spend as much time as I can with Yohaan and watch him grow up. I’ve already entered commentary as well and will continue doing that. Apart from that, I don’t know what the future holds for me, but I can’t wait to find out,” he says, signing off.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/i-have-many-special-memories-but-receiving-my-test-cap-from-sachin-sir-tops-the-list-pragyan/articleshow/74245419.cms
487,['22/02/2020'],Pragyan Ojha: I have many special memories but receiving my test cap from Sachin sir tops the list: Pragyan,"In November 2009, Pragyan Ojha , a 23-year-old off-spinner from Odisha , made his way into the Indian test team. On a Kanpur wicket that had a bit of grass on it, Ojha kept things tight and got four wickets in the match (two in each innings), including the prize wicket of Mahela Jayawardene. While Pragyan’s bowling figures from that test match aren’t exactly spectacular, what made the occasion special for the youngster was to receive his test cap from the legendary Sachin Tendulkar . “I can never forget the moment when I received my test cap from Sachin Tendulkar sir. I was extremely nervous but he made me feel so comfortable. Playing for India is a huge honour in itself but to be welcomed into the fold by Sachin sir himself was truly a special feeling,” shares Ojha, who announced his retirement from international and first-class cricket on Friday.The Hyderabad-based cricketer played 24 tests and 18 ODIs for India and despite not featuring in a single international fixture since 2013, Ojha continued to play domestic cricket till 2019.
