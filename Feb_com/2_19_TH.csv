0,2020/02/19,Asian wrestling | India claims three more bronze,"Aditya, Ashu and Hardeep among the medal winners

Having won his first two bouts comfortably, Aditya Kundu was favourite to become India’s second Greco-Roman finalist at the senior Asian wrestling championship here on Wednesday. That did not happen but a semifinal setback was not enough to keep him away from the podium, adding to the host’s medal tally with a bronze in the 72kg.

The 23-year old civil inspector from Chandigarh finished off his Japanese opponent Nao Kusaka in double-quick time, wrapping up an 8-0 win by technical superiority in under two minutes.

“Winning a medal in this manner in my first Asian Championship feels great. It adds to the confidence level,” Kundu told The Hindu.

Shift in style

Like most Indian wrestlers, Kundu is a late convert to Greco-Roman but unlike others who make the shift due to their inability to break through in Freestyle, Kundu’s was more out of compulsion.

“I have golds and bronze at the University Games in Freestyle but a knee injury around a few years back meant I was unable to put too much strength in my legs and decided to shift to Greco-Roman. A gold at the Commonwealth Championship in 2017 convinced me I could do well and today’s win proves it was the right move,” he added.

“My plan was to tire out my opponent and then attack him with my technique. I kept moving and holding him away and then went for the points, my plan worked perfectly,” he said.

Trained by his father Ranbir Singh at Gulzar Akhada in Zirakpur, Kundu is now hoping to drop down to 67kg and get a chance at the Olympic qualifiers — 72kg is not an Olympic category. For that, however, he would have to contend with another youngster who won a 67kg bronze here — Ashu.

Confidence pays off

At 19 and in his first senior tournament, Ashu bettered Syrian Abdwlkarim Mohammad Alhasan 8-1. The native of Panchi Jatan village in Sonipat was confident of winning, having learnt from his semifinal defeat.

“I was in too much hurry in the previous bout. This time I knew I had to defend myself well. Wrestlers at the senior level are more intelligent and you have to plan accordingly. It’s been a learning experience,” he added.

Hardeep completed the host’s medal tally for the second day with bronze in the 97kg as India finished the Greco-Roman competition with four bronze and one gold to be placed fifth on the table. Iran topped with five gold, one silver and three bronze.

The results (Greco-Roman): 60kg: 1. Kenichiro Fumita (Jpn), 2. Zholaman Sharshenbekov (Kgz), 3. Islomjon Bakhramov (Uzb) & Mehdi Seifollah Mohsen Nejad (Iri).

67kg: 1. Hansu Ryu (Kor), 2. Makhmud Bakhshilloev (Uzb), 3. Ashu (Ind) & Hosseini Nasrollah Assadi Kolmati (Iri).

4,2020/02/19,"Hope to do well in All England Open, says P.V. Sindhu","The badminton star says she is working on her mistakes

Since the epic World badminton championship victory last August, P.V. Sindhu hasn’t done anything of note to be optimistic of a gold at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.

But the 24-year-old isn’t worried one bit about the perceptible downslide.

“I have had some ups and downs [since the Worlds]. It’s fine. I am working on my mistakes and preparing for the All England Open [to be held in Birmingham from March 11 to 15] and hope to do well there,” said Sindhu, after laying the foundation stone for the P.V. Sindhu Badminton Academy and a training centre, to be set up by Heartfulness at Lalaji Memorial Omega International School at Kolapakkam here on Wednesday.

The 2016 Rio Olympics silver medalist said there was no major flaw in her game except that she is committing unforced errors at crucial junctures of a contest.

Focus on defence

She also highlighted that she was focussing on her defence.

“The day matters. I might have made a few mistakes I should not have done. Those made the difference in close matches. I am working on my defence. I have learnt to be a bit more patient during rallies. I am working on all that,” she said.

On the mental aspect, Sindhu said practicing meditation technique [Heartfulness] for the last 11 months has made her calm and took away the pressure of expectations during matches and helped her concentrate on the game.

“Not that it will get you success. Generally, when you play, you face pressure. Sometimes the pressure gets to you. In matches it is important to be calm. For me, in matches you get impatient and tend to get angry and lose points. That’s when heartfulness comes into play.”

No clear favourite

There is no clear favourite in the women’s section at Olympics, according to Sindhu. “I think every player is doing well. Players in the top-15 are of same standars. You have to wait and see. Everybody is working hard for Tokyo.”

When asked whether numerous off-court commitments has been a distraction, Sindhu replied that if one is clear about his/her priorities, it is not a problem.

“It is not like that. It needs to be equally done. I never felt that I have given too much time to off-court activities.”",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/f07fr3/article30863521.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH20SINDHU,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/hope-to-do-well-in-all-england-open-sindhu/article30861560.ece

7,2020/02/19,Union Cabinet gives nod for empowered technology group to fix tech woes,"It will take a call on dual-use technology

The Union Cabinet has approved the setting up of an empowered technology group to help address issues such as “sub-optimal industrial development”.

Among the key issues the 12-member panel headed by the Principal Scientific Adviser (PSA) will address is “dual-use technologies not being optimally commercialised”, the government said in a note. Dual-use technologies have civilian and military applications.

The group, whose members names have not been disclosed, is expected to develop in-house expertise in aspects of policy and use of emerging technologies, and ensure sustainability of technology being developed at public sector organisations.

The government said the group would also work to ensure that India had an updated map of technology and technology products available and being developed; develop an “indigenisation road map” for selected key technologies; encourage Union Ministries and departments and State governments to develop in-house expertise in policy; and use aspects of emerging technologies.

The group will also facilitate cross-sector collaborations and research alliances with universities and private companies and formulate “standards and a common vocabulary” to screen proposals for research and development.

Union Minister Prakash Javadekar said at a press briefing that the decision to set up such a group was based on recommendations of a committee led by the Principal Scientific Adviser.

“Today, all the Ministries procure their own technology, but they don’t know if it’s the latest,” Mr. Javadekar said. “This group will give advice to all ministries, agencies and PSUs,” he added

Ashutosh Sharma, Secretary, Department of Science and Technology, who confirmed that he is in the group, said the move would be useful to coordinate research. “Say I have a technology and would like to find what other organisations could benefit from it... this mechanism is welcome,” he said.

8,2020/02/19,Intel showcases first cryogenic quantum computing chip,"The Horse Ridge chip addresses fundamental challenges in building a quantum system powerful enough to demonstrate quantum practicality: scalability, flexibility and fidelity, Intel said in a statement

Intel Labs, in collaboration with QuTech, which is an advanced research centre for quantum computing and quantum internet, has unveiled details about its first cryogenic quantum control chip called ‘Horse Ridge.’

The Horse Ridge chip addresses fundamental challenges in building a quantum system powerful enough to demonstrate quantum practicality: scalability, flexibility and fidelity, Intel said in a statement on Wednesday.

Today, quantum researchers work with just a small number of qubits, using smaller, custom-designed systems surrounded by complex control and interconnect mechanisms.

“Intel’s Horse Ridge greatly minimises this complexity. By systematically working to scale to thousands of qubits required for quantum practicality, we’re continuing to make steady progress toward making commercially viable quantum computing a reality in our future,” said Jim Clarke, director of quantum hardware, Intel Labs.

The details were outlined in a research paper released at the 2020 International Solid-State Circuits Conference (ISSCC) in San Francisco.

The current bits in computers store information as either 1 or 0, thus limiting the potential to make sense when faced with gigantic volumes of data.

The computers of the future will not use classical bits but “qubits” that are not limited to binary and can have properties of 0 and 1 simultaneously, thus trying every possible number and sequence simultaneously to unlock vast amounts of data.

A quantum computer can solve complex problems that would otherwise take billions of years for today’s computers to solve. This has massive implications for research in health care, energy, environmental systems, smart materials and more.

Intel’s ‘Horse Ridge’ greatly simplifies today’s complex control electronics required to operate such a quantum system by using a highly integrated system-on-chip (SoC) for faster set-up time, improved qubit performance and efficient scaling to larger qubit counts required for quantum computing to solve practical, real-world applications.

The integrated SoC design integrates four radio frequency (RF) channels into a single device.

Each channel is able to control up to 32 qubits, leveraging “frequency multiplexing”.

Leveraging these four channels, Horse Ridge can potentially control up to 128 qubits with a single device, substantially reducing the number of cables and rack instrumentations previously required.

Increases in qubit count trigger other issues like decline in qubit fidelity and performance.

In developing ‘Horse Ridge’, Intel has optimised the multiplexing technology that enables the system to scale and reduce errors.

Horse Ridge can cover a wide frequency range, enabling control of both superconducting qubits (known as transmons) and spin qubits, said the company.

QuTech is a partnership between TU Delft and TNO (Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research).",technology,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/mfye2o/article30860213.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19NETINTEL,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/intel-showcases-first-cryogenic-quantum-computing-chip/article30860214.ece

12,2020/02/19,"Russia, Turkey spar over Syria operation","Erdogan threatens to attack advancing Syrian troops; Kremlin warns against the ‘worst scenario’

Turkey and Russia exchanged warnings on Wednesday after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan threatened an “imminent” operation in Syria to end the regime’s brutal assault on the last rebel enclave.

Syrian aid workers called urgently for a ceasefire and international help for nearly a million people fleeing the regime onslaught in the country’s northwestern Idlib province — the biggest wave of displaced civilians in the nine-year conflict.

Turkey, supporter of some rebel groups in Idlib, has been pushing for a renewed ceasefire in talks with Russia, which backs the Syrian regime. Ankara is eager to prevent another flood of refugees into its territory adding to the 3.7 million Syrians it already hosts.

The Syrian NGO Alliance said displaced people are “escaping in search of safety only to die from extreme weather conditions and lack of available resources”.

“We have hundreds and thousands of people who are fleeing... not just from bombardments but from lack of insulation, from the weather, a lack of heating. It feels like doomsday,” Razan Saffour, of the Syrian Expatriate Medical Association, said. The group said a total of $336 million was needed for basic food, water and shelter.

‘No desired result’

Mr. Erdogan said talks with Moscow over the past fortnight had so far failed to achieve “the desired result” and warned that Turkey would launch an offensive into Syria unless Damascus pulled its forces back by the end of the month.

“An operation in Idlib is imminent... We are counting down, we are making our final warnings,” Mr. Erdogan said in a televised speech.

He called for Syrian forces to retreat behind Turkey’s military posts in Idlib, which were set up under a 2018 deal with Russia designed to hold off a regime advance.

The Kremlin quickly responded to Erdogan’s threat, warning that any operation against Syrian forces would be “the worst scenario”.

With Turkey moving large numbers of reinforcements into Idlib in recent weeks, Defence Minister Hulusi Akar emphasised that it was “out of the question for us to withdraw from our observation posts”.

“If there is any sort of attack against them, we will retaliate in kind,” he told reporters in Ankara.

Earlier this week the UN said the displaced were mainly women and children and warned that babies were dying of cold because aid camps are full.

The Syrian NGOs called for the warring parties to allow safe access for humanitarian groups and for a “complete ceasefire and end to human rights violations”.

Violence continues

The regime offensive has killed more than 400 civilians since it began in December, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

“The violence in northwest Syria is indiscriminate. Health facilities, schools, residential areas, mosques and markets have been hit,” the UN head of humanitarian affairs and emergency relief, Mark Lowcock, said earlier this week.

Moscow has repeatedly vetoed Security Council resolutions. The head of the World Health Organization said Tuesday that out of nearly 550 health facilities in northwest Syria, only about half were operational.

14,2020/02/19,Iran defends decisionto disqualify candidates,"It had barred thousands of moderates

Iran’s electoral watchdog on Wednesday defended its decision to disqualify thousands of candidates for a crucial parliamentary election in two days, as a lacklustre campaign neared its end.

Conservatives are expected to make an overwhelming resurgence in Friday’s election, which comes after months of steeply escalating tensions between Iran and its decades-old arch foe, the U.S.

Their gains would be made at the expense of those who back President Hassan Rouhani, a moderate conservative who was re-elected in 2017 promising people more freedoms and the benefits of engagement with the West.

Campaigning came to an end on Wednesday.

Thousands of hopefuls, most of them moderates and reformists, were barred from standing by the Guardian Council, the powerful body that vets election candidates in Iran.

But the Council said it was “neutral” in its dealings with all political camps and acted in accordance with the law. “The Guardian Council follows the laws and regulations parliament has passed at different times,” said its spokesman Abbas Ali Kadkhodaee.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/iran-defends-decisionto-disqualify-candidates/article30863787.ece
15,2020/02/19,"World failing to provide children a healthy life, climate fit for future: report","According to the report, which includes an index of 180 countries, the poorest nations need to do more to support their children’s ability to live healthier lives

No single country is adequately protecting their children’s health, environment or future, according to a report released by a Commission of over 40 child and adolescent health experts from around the world, convened by the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF and The Lancet journal.

According to the report, the health and future of every child and adolescent worldwide is under immediate threat from ecological degradation, climate change and exploitative marketing practices that push heavily processed fast food, sugary drinks, alcohol, and tobacco at children.

“Despite improvements in child and adolescent health over the past 20 years, progress has stalled and is set to reverse,” said Helen Clark, former Prime Minister of New Zealand and a Co-Chair of the Commission.

“It has been estimated that around 250 million children under the age of five in low and middle income countries are at risk of not reaching their developmental potential, based on proxy measures of stunting and poverty,” Ms. Clark said.

She said an even greater concern is that every child worldwide currently faces existential threats from climate change and commercial pressures.

According to the report, which includes an index of 180 countries, the poorest nations need to do more to support their children’s ability to live healthier lives.

It also said excessive carbon emissions — disproportionately emitted from wealthier countries — threaten the future of all children.

If global warming exceeds 4 degree Celsius by the year 2100 (in line with current projections), it would lead to devastating health consequences for children due to rising ocean levels, heatwaves, proliferation of diseases like malaria and dengue, and malnutrition, the Commission said.

According to the Commission, children in Norway, the Republic of Korea, and the Netherlands have the best chance at survival and well-being, while those in Central African Republic, Chad, Somalia, Niger and Mali face the worst odds.

When the authors took per capita carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions into account, top countries including Norway (ranked at 156), the Republic of Korea (166) and the Netherlands (160), trailed behind.

Each of the three countries emit 210% more CO2 per capita than their 2030 target, it said, adding that the United States, Australia and Saudi Arabia were among the ten worst emitters.

Exposure to advertisements

The report also noted that children in certain countries saw as many as 30,000 advertisements on television in a single year. Moreover, exposure of young adults to vaping advertisements increased by more than 250% in the U.S. over two years.

Commercial marketing of junk food and sugary beverages, it added, is associated with the purchase of unhealthy foods and a higher risk of obesity in children.

The Commission called for a stop on CO2 emissions with utmost urgency, to ensure children have a future on this planet.

It said children and adolescents must be placed at the centre of countries’ efforts to achieve sustainable development, with the implementation of new policies and investment in all sectors to work towards child health and rights.

The report advised world leaders to tighten national regulation of harmful commercial marketing, supported by a new Optional Protocol to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/ex7nfc/article30631420.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CLIMATE-CHANGESTRIKE-THAILAND,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/world-failing-to-provide-children-a-healthy-life-climate-fit-for-future-report/article30861949.ece
16,2020/02/19,U.K. launches points-based visa system,"The new system will come into force from January 1, 2021 at the end of the transition period after the U.K.’s exit from the European Union

U.K. Home Secretary Priti Patel on Wednesday unveiled a new points-based visa system to attract the “brightest and the best” from the world, including from India, and to reduce the number of cheap and low-skilled workers coming to the country.

The new system will come into force from January 1, 2021 at the end of the transition period after the U.K.’s exit from the European Union (EU) on January 31, which will formally end free movement of people within the economic bloc for the U.K. as a non-member.

The new post-Brexit system, which will apply equally to the EU and non-EU countries like India, is based on assigning points for specific skills, qualifications, salaries and professions, with visas only awarded to those who gain enough points.

“Today is a historic moment for the whole country. We’re ending free movement, taking back control of our borders and delivering on the people’s priorities by introducing a new U.K. points-based immigration system, which will bring overall migration numbers down,” said Patel, the senior-most Indian-origin Cabinet minister.

We will attract the brightest and the best from around the globe, boosting the economy and our communities, and unleash this country’s full potential, Patel, in charge of the U.K.’s visa and immigration system, said.

Under the scheme, foreign workers who wanted to come to the U.K. would have to speak English and have the offer of a skilled job with an “approved sponsor”.

They would be awarded 50 points if they fulfil these criteria.

In total, immigrants would have to reach 70 points to be able to work in the U.K., with points also being awarded for qualifications, the salary on offer and working in a sector with shortages.

The U.K. Home Office said the new system is a direct response to the 2016 referendum in favour of Brexit, which was seen as a vote to end the country’s reliance on cheap migrant labour and reduce overall levels of migration with tighter security.

“The new single global system will treat the EU and non-EU citizens equally. It will give top priority to those with the highest skills and the greatest talents, including scientists, engineers and academics, the Home Office said.

The Global Talent Scheme, a fast-track visa to be in operation from Friday, will also apply to the EU citizens from next year to allow highly-skilled scientists and researchers to come to the U.K. without a job offer.

Changes to the system would be implemented through an immigration Bill needing approval from MPs and peers to come into force, the BBC reported.

Opposition Labour Party said the “hostile environment” will make it hard to attract workers.

Liberal Democrat home affairs spokeswoman Christine Jardine said the proposals were based on “xenophobia”.

Professor Alice Gast, President of Imperial College London, said: British science is global. The new post-study work and Global Talent visas will help us to attract the world’s brightest students and researchers, wherever they come from.

From the race to develop a coronavirus vaccine to clean energy, British science’s international collaborations drive innovation and excellence.

The government said the points threshold for the new system will be carefully set to attract the talent the U.K. needs. Skilled workers will need to meet a number of relevant criteria, including specific skills and the ability to speak English, to be able to work in the U.K.

All applicants will be required to have a job offer and, in line with the Migration Advisory Committee’s (MAC) recommendations, the minimum salary threshold will be set at £25,600 — lower than the previous £30,000 level for Tier 2 work visas.

The new points-based system will also expand the skills threshold for skilled workers.

Those looking to live and work in the U.K. will need to be qualified up to A-level or equivalent, rather than degree-level under the current system. This will provide greater flexibility and ensure U.K. business has access to a wide pool of skilled workers, the Home Office said.

In line with the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s manifesto commitment in the December 2019 General Election, there will be no specific route for low-skilled workers.

It is estimated 70% of the existing EU workforce would not meet the requirements of the skilled worker route, which will help to bring overall numbers down in future, the Home Office said.

Student visa routes will also be points-based and be opened up to EU citizens from next year.

Those wishing to study in the U.K. will need to demonstrate that they have an offer from an approved educational institution, that they can support themselves financially and that they speak English.

To address the specific labour concerns of the agricultural sector reliant on seasonal workers from the EU, the Seasonal Workers Pilot will be expanded in time for the 2020 harvest from 2,500 to 10,000 places.

EU citizens and other non-visa nationals will not require a visa to enter the U.K. when visiting the U.K. for up to six months.

However, the use of national identity cards will be phased out for travel to the U.K. and the Home Office highlighted that as part of its post-Brexit offer, those EU citizens resident in the U.K. by December 31, 2020 can still apply to settle in the UK through the EU Settlement Scheme until June 2021.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/1yji/article30861448.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/UKVISA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/uk-launches-points-based-visa-system/article30861449.ece
17,2020/02/19,Sri Lanka to withdraw from co-sponsoring UN Human Rights Council resolution on war crimes,"Sri Lankan Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa’s statement came days after the U.S. imposed travel restrictions on Army chief Lt. Gen. Shavendra Silva and his immediate family members.

Sri Lankan Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa on Wednesday said that his government will withdraw from co-sponsoring a UN Human Rights Council resolution on accountability for war crimes.

His statement came days after the U.S. imposed travel restrictions on Army chief Lt. Gen. Shavendra Silva and his immediate family members over alleged gross violations of human rights during the final phase of the island nation’s Civil War in 2009.

“Our government has decided to withdraw from the process of co sponsorship in relation to resolution 30/1,” Mr. Rajapaksa said in a statement.

The resolution 30/1 on promotion on reconciliation in Sri Lanka was co-sponsored in 2015 by the then Lankan government.

Mr. Rajapaksa accused his predecessor of betraying the island’s security forces by co-sponsoring the resolution.

“It is because of the historic betrayal that other countries are able to name members of our armed forces as violators of human rights,” said Mr. Rajapaksa, who was President and commander-in-chief when Sri Lanka launched the offensive to crush the LTTE in 2009.

The 2015 resolution was based on the UNHRC report which had accused the Lankan troops of violating human rights, Mr. Rajapaksa’s statement said.

Sri Lanka’s ruling and Opposition parties have strongly opposed the U.S. move to impose the travel ban on Lt.Gen. Silva, saying America’s decision was based on independently unverified information.

Foreign Minister Dinesh Gunawardena last week said that Lt.Gen. Silva was only conducting a war against a designated terrorist group which was the LTTE.

Lt.Gen. Silva was appointed as the Sri Lankan Army Commander last year and previously headed the Army’s 58th Division in the final battle against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels of the civil war in 2009.

The UN rights body resolution had blamed Mr. Silva’s brigade of committing rights abuses during the final phase of the battle which ended in May 2009. Both government troops and the LTTE were accused of rights violations. The Sri Lanka Army has denied the alleged rights abuses.

The resolution 30/1 called for an independent investigation with foreign judges and prosecutors to probe war crimes allegation.

According to a United Nations report, some 45,000 Tamil civilians were killed in the last months of the war alone.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/on2iz1/article30551986.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RAJAPAKSA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/sri-lanka-to-withdraw-from-co-sponsorship-of-un-rights-body-resolution-on-war-crimes/article30860788.ece
18,2020/02/19,Germany to require social media sites to report hate speech,"Jurists estimate the number of online hate speech cases in Germany each year to be in the six figures

The German Cabinet has approved a Bill that will require social media sites such as Facebook and YouTube to report certain hate speech to the police.

According to the Bill passed by Ministers on Wednesday, internet companies will have to flag far-right propaganda, graphic portrayals of violence, murder or rape threats, posts indicating that someone is preparing a terrorist attack or distributing child sexual abuse images.

Social media sites are already required to delete such posts.

The measures, which still need to be approved by Parliament, will also see the definition of criminal hate speech extended to include threats of rape or property damage and expressions of approval for serious crimes.

Crimes motivated by anti-Semitism will also result in increased sentences.

In a further measure, authorities will make it easier for politicians, volunteers and journalists to prevent others from obtaining their home addresses from public registers.

19,2020/02/19,China revokes three Wall Street Journal reporters’ credentials over opinion piece on coronavirus,"China’s Foreign Ministry says the expulsions came after the paper refused to apologise for the column which “smeared the efforts of the Chinese government and people on fighting the epidemic”

China on Wednesday said it has revoked the press credentials of three reporters for the U.S. newspaper Wall Street Journal over a headline for an opinion column deemed by the government to be racist and slanderous.

The headline referred to the current virus outbreak in China and called the country the “Real Sick Man of Asia.”

In a statement on Wednesday, China’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the February 3 op-ed by Bard College Professor Walter Russel Mead “smears the efforts of the Chinese government and people on fighting (the virus) epidemic.”

“The editors used such a racially discriminatory title, triggering indignation and condemnation among the Chinese people and the international community,” he said.

The statement said the expulsions came after the Journal refused demands to “make an official apology and hold the persons involved accountable.”

Like most foreign media, the Wall Street Journal is unavailable within China and its website and stories are blocked by online censors.

It did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment.

The Foreign Correspondents’ Club of China issued a statement expressing “deep concern and strong condemnation” of the Chinese move. It pointed out that none of the three reporters had any involvement with the opinion piece or its headline.

“The action taken against The Journal correspondents is an extreme and obvious attempt by the Chinese authorities to intimidate foreign news organisations by taking retribution against their China-based correspondents,” the statement said. It said the expulsions are the latest case of growing “harassment, surveillance and intimidation from authorities.”

China has in recent years refused to issue or renew credentials for foreign journalists, but this is the first time in decades that it has actually revoked their documents, effectively expelling them from the country.

That reflects a new hard line in foreign affairs in which China has sought to exact economic and diplomatic costs from companies and countries that don’t follow its policies over Taiwan, Hong Kong, Tibet, human rights and other sensitive issues.

President and Communist Party leader Xi Jinping has repeatedly stated that China will make no concessions when it comes to national territory, sovereignty or dignity.

In one recent case, China cut commercial ties with the U.S. National Basketball Association after an official with the Houston Rockets team tweeted support for Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters whom China has derided as separatists.

The Journal identified the three journalists as Deputy Bureau Chief Josh Chin, reporter Chao Deng — both U.S. citizens — and reporter Philip Wen, an Australian. They have been given five days to leave the country, according to Jonathan Cheng, the Journal’s China bureau chief.

Last fall, Chinese authorities declined to renew the press credentials of Beijing-based Journal reporter Chun Han Wong, a Singaporean, one month after he and another Journal reporter wrote a story detailing an Australian investigation into the alleged links of Xi’s cousin to high-stakes gambling, money laundering and suspected organised crime.

“We resolutely oppose certain foreign journalists’ evil intention to smear and attack China,” China’s foreign ministry said in a response to questions about Wong’s status at that time.

Following the publication of Mead’s opinion column this month, a foreign ministry spokeswoman lashed out at him, saying he should be “ashamed of your words, your arrogance, your prejudice and your ignorance.”

The expulsions also come after the Trump administration on Tuesday designated five state-run Chinese news outlets that operate in the United States as “foreign missions,” requiring them to register their properties and employees in the U.S.

Washington has determined that the outlets are directly controlled by the Chinese government and Chinese Communist Party, according to two State Department officials.

The five are China’s official Xinhua News Agency, China Global Television Network, China Radio International, the China Daily Distribution Corporation, which distributes the newspaper of the same name, and Hai Tian Development USA, which distributes the People’s Daily newspaper, the officials said.

Xinhua and China Global Television were directed two years ago by the Justice Department to register as foreign agents in the United States, although it is not clear if either ever did. Several Russian news outlets, including the Russia Today television network, face similar directions from the Justice Department.

China’s foreign ministry responded to the move by demanding the U.S. “immediately cease its wrongful actions” and said it reserves the right to “make a further response.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/qc7aub/article30860078.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/GENGSHUANG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/china-revokes-three-wall-street-journal-reporters-credentials-over-opinion-piece-on-coronavirus/article30860079.ece

21,2020/02/19,Pakistan court sentences three terrorists to death for involvement in 2014 Wagah border bombing,"Over 60 people were killed in the horrific suicide attack on November 2, 2014 at the Wagah border on the Pakistani side

A Pakistani Anti-terrorism Court on Wednesday handed down death sentence and 300 years imprisonment to three terrorists of the banned Jamaat-ul-Ahrar for their involvement in the 2014 Wagah border bombing that killed over 60 people.

Wagah is a village located in Lahore, Pakistan’s Punjab province and Attari in India’s Punjab State along the Indo-Pak border.

Over 60 people, including women and children, were killed in the horrific suicide attack on November 2, 2014 at the Wagah border on the Pakistani side.

The responsibility for the attack was claimed separately by the outlawed Jundullah and Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan’s splinter group Jamaat-ul-Ahrar.

“The Anti-terrorism Court in Lahore on Wednesday announced the verdict in the Wagah border bombings. It handed down death sentence to three suspects —Haseebullah, Saeed Jan Ghana and Hussainullah — on five counts and also gave them a 300-year jail term and imposed a fine of Pakistani ₹1 million on each of them,” a court official told PTI.

The court acquitted three other suspects giving them the benefit of doubt.

More than 100 prosecution witnesses testified against the accused during the trial that lasted more than five years.

The suspects were brought to the court amidst tight security.

The Jamaat-ul-Ahrar spokesman Ehsanullah Ehsan had told Dawn on telephone from Afghanistan after the Wagah blast that it was carried out by one of their men.

Later, Ehsan was arrested by Pakistani security agencies but recently he managed to escape from their custody drawing criticism from the opposition parties.

At least 15 to 20 kg of explosives were used in the blast with some of the explosives in the attacker’s suicide jacket and the remaining being carried by him.

The blast at the Wagah crossing was a high-profile target, with large crowds gathering every day to watch an elaborate flag-lowering ceremony as the border with India closes.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/2qwaxv/article30859358.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/WAGAHBORDER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pakistan-court-sentences-three-terrorists-to-death-for-involvement-in-2014-wagah-border-bombing/article30859359.ece
22,2020/02/19,Prince Charles opens new Tata JLR innovation centre in U.K.,"The collaboration between Tata Motors, JLR and the Warwick Manufacturing Group is aimed at creating sustainable future mobility projects, including electrified and autonomous vehicles

Prince Charles has formally launched a new £150-million Tata Motors’ Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) innovation centre, Europe’s largest automotive research and development facility of its kind, at the University of Warwick in central England to create sustainable future mobility projects.

The National Automotive Innovation Centre (NAIC) will house up to 1,000 academics, researchers, engineers and designers from across the U.K. and India to work on cars and vehicles of the future.

The centre, which was launched on Tuesday, is dedicated to advanced automotive research, design and development.

The collaboration between Tata Motors, JLR and the Warwick Manufacturing Group (WMG) is aimed at creating sustainable future mobility projects, including electrified and autonomous vehicles.

“This centre in the heart of the United Kingdom brings together from industry and academia some of the brightest minds to tackle some of our society’s toughest problems,” said Prince Charles, who admitted pressing for action on environmental issues for nearly 50 years.

“In all the years what has always struck me is the need for a cooperative, joint up approach between all those who are pursuing the same goal by whatever means. This centre is now pulling together many of the most talented people tackling society’s greatest mobility challenges and is helping to shape the future of the automotive industry,” he said at the launch attended by Tata Group Chairman Ratan Tata.

The 33,000 square metre centre is designed as an innovative, collaborative workspace and includes cutting-edge workshops, laboratories, virtual engineering suites and advanced power-train facilities.

“At Jaguar and Land Rover, we believe in creating a better tomorrow for mobility. A future of zero emissions, zero congestion and zero accidents,” said JLR CEO Ralf Speth.

“We call it ‘Destination Zero’ and the National Automotive Innovation Centre will make sure we get there,” he said.

Speth explained that at the NAIC, academics, manufacturers and suppliers will work towards developing a smart, safe transport infrastructure that integrates autonomous vehicles and public transport, design zero-emission vehicles powered by smart-chargers and renewable energy, and discover material and digital manufacturing innovations that will eliminate waste.

As part of the NAIC’s integrated approach, engineers from Tata Motors’ Pune design base will come to the U.K. on a temporary basis and colleagues from Britain will also work in India.

Guenter Butschek, CEO and MD of Tata Motors, said, “The National Automotive Innovation Centre brings together our U.K.-based engineering and design experts to one setting, providing greater synergy on ground-breaking design and technologies with a focus on connected, electric, shared and safe, that will help shape future mobility solutions in India.

“The centre has been carefully designed to support the future of automotive advancements. Its virtual engineering suite, powertrain facilities, laboratories and cutting-edge design workshop provide an inspiring, productive and collaborative environment for the future“.

The concept for the £150 million ($195 million) NAIC was initiated by the late Professor Lord Kumar Bhattacharyya, the Indian-origin founder of the Warwick Manufacturing Group (WMG), and the building it is located in is named after him.

“The late Professor Lord Bhattacharyya’s vision was for future generations of designers, researchers and engineers to be inspired to innovate through collaborative research projects with manufacturers, suppliers and academia at the National Automotive Innovation Centre,” said Professor David Mullins, Interim Head of the WMG.

The WMG said that students and apprentices work alongside experts and leaders in their fields at the new centre, which will also transform university curricula over time to supports emerging technologies and mobility solutions.

“Its location underscores Coventry, Warwickshire and the West Midlands’ leading roles in U.K. and international automotive innovation and research,” said Professor Stuart Croft, the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Warwick.

The launch event also marked the unveiling of JLR’s new concept vehicle created at the NAIC, Project Vector, as part of the company’s Destination Zero vision of an autonomous, electric, connected future for urban mobility.

The U.K.’s largest automotive manufacturer JLR said that Project Vector showcases an advanced, flexible, multi-use electric vehicle that is “autonomy-ready“.

“It has been developed at the National Automotive Innovation Centre to gain the advantages of working with agility and close collaboration with academic and external partners,” JLR added.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/9dufab/article30858355.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PRINCECHARLES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/prince-charles-opens-new-tata-jlr-innovation-centre-in-uk/article30858356.ece

24,2020/02/19,COVID-19 | Quarantined cruise ship passengers start disembarking in Japan,"The United States evacuated more than 300 nationals on Monday on two chartered flights

Passengers on the virus-hit cruise ship moored near Tokyo began disembarking on February 19, public broadcaster NHK said, after a controversial two-week quarantine that saw more than 500 people infected with the new coronavirus originating in China.

The Diamond Princess, operated by Carnival Corp, has been quarantined in the port of Yokohama since February 3 after a man, who disembarked in Hong Kong before it travelled to Japan, was diagnosed with the virus.

More than 540 people have been infected with the virus on the liner, which originally carried some 3,700 passengers and crew. Many of those infected have already been transfered to hospitals. About half the passengers are Japanese.

Japan, which ranks second in the world after China in number of confirmed virus cases, has come under fire for its handling of the cruise ship quarantine, although top government officials have defended the quarantine and onboard testing operation.

Around 500 people were expected to disembark starting Wednesday, a health ministry official said, with the entire process completed by Friday. With some passengers planning to stay on the ship it was unclear when the quarantine would end.

The United States evacuated more than 300 nationals on Monday on two chartered flights and six South Koreans and one Japanese spouse flew to South Korea on Wednesday morning on a chartered flight.

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Tuesday there were 220 Australians on board. A total of 169 Australians would be evacuated, 36 have the coronavirus and will remain on the ship, and another 15 have elected to stay onboard. Those evacuated will be flown to Darwin, where they will be quarantined for 14 days.

An Australian passenger said Australians had been told they would be pre-screened starting on Wednesday morning and taken to Tokyo's Haneda airport in the evening for an expected departure early Thursday.

“They told us to pack warm weather clothes for the two weeks in Darwin but who will have that after a cruise in the Japanese winter,” passenger Vicki Presland told Reuters.

A captain's announcement on the liner said that Hong Kong passengers would also be evacuated over the next 24 hours and that according to information received, a Canadian charter flight would arrive on Friday morning.

Italy and Taiwan were also preparing to evacuate their nationals.

Besides those on the cruise liner and returnees brought home from China's Wuhan city, the epicentre of the epidemic, about 60 cases of domestic infections have been confirmed in Japan, including 22 in Tokyo, according to NHK public broadcaster. Amid worries about a contracting economy, the spread of the virus has prompted Tokyo to curb the size of public gatherings and some companies are telling employees to work from home.

The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped past 2,000 on February 19 after 136 more people died, with the number of new cases falling for a second straight day, according to the National Health Commission. This brings the total number of confirmed cases in mainland China to 74,185.

The death toll rose to 2,004, with most of the deaths in central Hubei province, where the virus first emerged in December before spiralling into a nationwide epidemic.

In its daily update, the National Health Commission reported 1,749 new cases of people infected with the virus nationwide, the lowest number of new cases this month.

The new infections were overwhelmingly in Hubei.

Outside the epicentre, there were only 56 new cases reported, falling for the 15th day in a row.

A study released by Chinese officials said most patients have mild cases of the illness, and health officials have described the slowing numbers as an indication that the outbreak is under control.

President Xi Jinping, in a phone call with the British prime minister, said China's measures were achieving ""visible progress"", according to state media Tuesday.

26,2020/02/19,"Vladimir Putin sacks prominent Kremlin ideologue, Ukraine hardliner Vladislav Surkov","The decree was issued a week after the Kremlin said a senior Ukrainian-born Russian official, Dmitry Kozak, was now in charge of managing Moscow's relations with Ukraine, effectively sidelining Mr. Surkov.

Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday dismissed a veteran, once a close adviser who until recently managed Moscow's relations with war-torn Ukraine.

Mr. Putin fired Vladislav Surkov, seen as a hardliner by many in Kiev, in a terse two-line statement on the Kremlin website. His sacking, which coincided with a flare-up in fighting in eastern Ukraine, had been rumoured for weeks.

The decree was issued a week after the Kremlin said a senior Ukrainian-born Russian official, Dmitry Kozak, was now in charge of managing Moscow's relations with Ukraine, effectively sidelining Mr. Surkov.

Relations between Moscow and Kiev unravelled after Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea region in 2014 and Moscow-backed separatists launched an uprising in Donbass, eastern Ukraine, that has killed more than 13,000 people.

Russia denies any role in the conflict.

Moscow and Kiev are wrangling over how to implement a peace deal on Donbass, but major disagreements remain and full normalisation is far off.

Alexei Chesnakov, a political analyst who used to work for Mr. Surkov in Russia's presidential administration, announced last month that Mr. Surkov had resigned “because of a change in policy regarding Ukraine”.

“The decision was made by Surkov and will not change. I know it from Surkov himself,” he said.

Another source close to Mr. Surkov told Reuters that Mr. Surkov had reacted sharply to Kozak's appointment.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/hb4uyq/article30855431.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SURKOV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/vladimir-putin-sacks-prominent-kremlin-ideologue-ukraine-hardliner-vladislav-surkov/article30855432.ece
27,2020/02/19,Trump adviser Roger Stone loses bid to delay sentencing hearing,"Stone is due to be sentenced on Thursday after he was found guilty in November of seven counts of lying to Congress, obstruction and witness tampering

Roger Stone, a longtime friend of President Donald Trump, lost his bid to delay his sentencing, a federal judge said on Tuesday.

Stone is due to be sentenced on Thursday after he was found guilty in November of seven counts of lying to Congress, obstruction and witness tampering.

A lawyer for Stone on Tuesday argued that Thursday's sentencing hearing should be postponed until after U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson rules on a request he made for a new trial.

Ms. Jackson rejected the proposed delay during a short conference call with lawyers on Tuesday, saying Stone's proposal would not be prudent and is not required by law.

The judge said the longtime Republican operative would not need to begin serving his sentence until she rules on his request for a new trial.

Stone's sentencing on Thursday is expected to draw widespread interest, after senior officials at the Justice Department last week pulled back on an earlier sentencing recommendation by career prosecutors to keep Stone's prison term within the U.S. sentencing guidelines of seven to nine years.

The intervention by Attorney General William Barr prompted all four career prosecutors who tried the case to withdraw, with one of them resigning from the department entirely.

In the new sentencing memo, the department said it viewed a sentence of between seven and nine years as excessive, but left it to the judge's discretion what prison term would be appropriate.

Since then, Mr. Trump has used Twitter to attack the four prosecutors, as well as Ms. Jackson, who previously oversaw cases involving Trump's other political allies including former campaign chairman Paul Manafort.

Ms. Jackson did not comment during Tuesday's 15-minute conference call on the prosecutor withdrawals or the political furor over Stone's case.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/rs87k5/article30855249.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TRUMPRUSSIASTONEKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trump-adviser-roger-stone-loses-bid-to-delay-sentencing-hearing/article30855250.ece
28,2020/02/19,"Hyper-local, personalised avatar HikeMoji rolled out in India","It was initially launched in beta in November 2019, and as many as 1 million HikeMojis were created in beta version

Heating up the competition in the personal emoji space, cross-platform instant messaging app Hike on Wednesday introduced HikeMoji for all users, which is being touted as the country’s first hyper-local and personalised avatar.

According to the company, the machine learning (ML) on the platform has also scaled from combing 100 trillion combinations in beta to 100 quintillion combinations in V1 that has been rolled out on Wednesday.

This gives way to creation of a HikeMoji in under three seconds that’s more life-like.

“The traction is incredible with over 1 million plus HikeMojis created in beta alone. We’re excited to officially roll this out in V1 with a lot more detail. You can now also take your HikeMoji with you to other messaging platforms,” Kavin Bharti Mittal, Founder and CEO, Hike, said in a statement.

It was launched in beta in November 2019 and as many as 1 million HikeMojis were created in beta version.

Since it is inspired by the diversity of India, this makes HikeMoji the largest platform for hyper local avatar creation as well.

It is pertinent to note that HikeMoji users can now play around with over 1,200 components, including hairstyles, skin shades, accessories, facial features, and expressions, thus, giving them a chance to enjoy an avatar that not only reflects their personality but also their mood.

The transition from beta to V1 also gives users a variety of features, including dimples, freckles, cheek-lines and more.",internet,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/wo84ss/article30859180.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19netHike,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/hyper-local-personalised-avatar-hikemoji-rolled-out-in-india/article30859181.ece
29,2020/02/19,Microsoft tests software to ensure votes are not altered,"‘ElectionGuard’ enables end-to-end verification of elections, open results to third-party organisations for secure validation and allow individual voters to confirm their votes were correctly counted

Microsoft has begun testing its free open-source software called ‘ElectionGuard’ in a small Wisconsin town in the U.S. that aims to make voting more secure, verifiable and efficient.

ElectionGuard will enable end-to-end verification of elections, open results to third-party organisations for secure validation and allow individual voters to confirm their votes were correctly counted.

It enables government entities, news outlets, human rights organisations or anyone else to build additional verifiers that independently can certify election results have been accurately counted and have not been altered, according to the company.

The software would create a paper trail and assure voters their votes were properly tallied.

“On Tuesday, Fulton residents are using the technology while choosing who will join the local school board and hold a seat on Wisconsin’s state Supreme Court,” reports CNBC.

With the test, the company aims to see if voters like the experience and make sure everything works fine.

In May last year, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella announced ElectionGuard.

According to Tom Burt, Corporate Vice President, Customer Security and Trust, voting system manufacturers will be free to build ElectionGuard into their systems in a variety of ways.

“These are exciting steps that enable individual voters to confirm their vote was properly counted, and assures those voters using an ElectionGuard system of the most secure and trustworthy vote in the history of the U.S.,” Burt said in a recent blog post.

ElectionGuard is not intended to replace paper ballots but rather to supplement and improve systems that rely on them, and it is not designed to support internet voting.

The software provides each voter a tracker with a unique code that can be used to follow an encrypted version of the vote through the entire election process via a web portal provided by election authorities.

During the process of vote-casting, voters have an optional step that allows them to confirm that their trackers and encrypted votes accurately reflect their selections.

But once a vote is cast, neither the tracker nor any data provided through the web portal can be used to reveal the contents of the vote.

After the election is complete, the tracker codes can be used by voters to confirm that their votes were not altered or tampered with and that they were properly counted, said Microsoft.

On the security front, ElectionGuard uses something called homomorphic encryption, which enables mathematical procedures “like counting to be done with fully encrypted data.”",internet,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/q1jw3d/article30857891.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19NETMICROSOFT,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/microsoft-tests-software-to-ensure-votes-are-not-altered/article30857893.ece
30,2020/02/19,Email extortion scheme threatens users on Google AdSense,"According to a report in Krebs on Security, the email-based extortion scheme targets website owners serving banner ads through Google’s AdSense programme

A new email scheme is threatening publishers to unleash bots on their platforms on Google AdSense unless they pay $5,000 in bitcoin.

According to a report in Krebs on Security, the email-based extortion scheme targets website owners serving banner ads through Google’s AdSense programme.

“In this scam, the fraudsters demand bitcoin in exchange for a promise not to flood the publisher’s ads with so much bot and junk traffic that Google’s automated anti-fraud systems suspend the user’s AdSense account for suspicious traffic,” the report added.

AdSense is a free, simple way to earn money by placing ads on your website.

KrebsOnSecurity heard from a reader who maintains several sites on AdSense that receive a fair amount of traffic.

“Very soon, the warning notice from above will appear at the dashboard of your AdSense account undoubtedly! This will happen due to the fact that we’re about to flood your site with huge amount of direct bot generated web traffic with 100% bounce ratio and thousands of IP’s in rotation — a nightmare for every AdSense publisher,” read the message

“Also, we’ll adjust our sophisticated bots to open, in endless cycle with different time duration, every AdSense banner which runs on your site,” it added.

The message demands $5,000 worth of bitcoin to stop the attack.

In a statement, Google said the message appears to be a classic threat of sabotage.

“We hear a lot about the potential for sabotage, it’s extremely rare in practice, and we have built some safeguards in place to prevent sabotage from succeeding,” said the statement.

Twitter has acquired California-based Chroma Labs that develops tools for short-form video and photo creation and was founded by seven Facebook and Instagram workers in 2018.

The Chroma Stories app let users fill in stylish layout templates and frames for posting collages and more to Instagram Stories, Snapchat and more.

“Thrilled to welcome the amazing @Chroma_Labs teama They’ll join our product, design, and eng teams working to give people more creative ways to express themselves on Twitter,” posted Kayvon Beykpour on Tuesday who is product lead at the micro-blogging platform.

Twitter, however, did not disclose the amount it paid for the acquisition.

During the past year, Chroma Labs has enabled creators and businesses around the world to create millions of stories with the Chroma Stories app.

“As part of this (acquisition), we’re shutting down our business, effective immediately. You’ll still be able to use the Chroma Stories app to craft amazing stories as long as the app remains installed on your phone, and until there is some breaking change in a future iOS update,” the company said in a statement.

According to Sensor Tower, nearly 6,15,000 people have installed Chroma Stories app.

Chroma Labs’ co-founders include Instagram ‘Boomerang’ inventor John Barnett, CTO Alex Li, who was an engineering manager on Facebook Photos and Instagram Stories, and Joshua Harris who was a product design manager on Facebook’s augmented reality team.

32,2020/02/19,"Messenger Signal ready to go mainstream, take on WhatsApp","This comes at a time when Facebook-owned WhatsApp users are looking for alternatives as the messaging platform has been hit by spyware and other privacy-related controversies

Privacy-centric messaging app Signal is gearing up to take on Facebook-owned WhatsApp as it is mulling to go mainstream and put the $50 million infusion from WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton to good use.

Moxie Marlinspike, who launched Signal, has always talked about making encrypted communications easy enough for anyone to use.

The difference, today, is that Signal is finally reaching that mass audience it was always been intended for — not just the privacy diehards, activists and cybersecurity nerds who formed its core user base for years, thanks in part to a concerted effort to make the app more accessible and appealing to the mainstream, the Wired recently reported.

This comes at a time when Facebook-owned WhatsApp users are looking for alternatives as the messaging platform has been hit by spyware and other privacy-related controversies.

“The major transition Signal has undergone is from a three-person small effort to something that is now a serious project with the capacity to do what is required to build software in the world today,” Marlinspike was quoted as saying by the Wired.

The investment by WhatsApp co-founder Acton has enabled the team to add features that also attract regular folks looking for an alternative to WhatsApp and Telegram.

Since Signal is fundamentally end-to-end encrypted and doesn’t store conversation metadata on its servers, like when who texted whom, the developers were faced with additional obstacles on that path.

The foundation had to make stickers compatible with encryption so users can send them securely and anonymously.

Enabling group administration was also a hard feat, as Signal has to give administrators the ability to add and remove members without its servers knowing who’s part of the conversation, according to Android Police.",internet,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/7is03d/article30857748.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19netsignal-messenger-logo,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/messenger-signal-ready-to-go-mainstream-take-on-whatsapp/article30857750.ece

Location-based dating service giant Tinder on Tuesday announced it was bringing its Swipe Night interactive video series in India in March. It is an in-app, interactive apocalyptic adventure, according to the company.

34,2020/02/19,Display from Smithsonian Institution in Chennai’s Water Matters exhibition for students,"Water Matters, an ongoing exhibition in the city, in cooperation with the Smithsonian Institution, shines light on sustainable water management

“24, 25, 26…” chants the group of children gathered around a table at Periyar Science and Technology Centre in Kotturpuram. Their eyes trained at the dropper in the presenter’s hand, they count the number of water droplets as it drips on to a ₹2 coin, coalescing into a bigger drop. At number 27, there is a loud squeal — the droplet finally burst, spilling water on to the table.

Testing water’s properties, this was one of the experiments being held at the ongoing Water Matters exhibition. The US Consulate-General, along with Chennai NGO Care Earth Trust, have collaborated with the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service to engage young people in particular, on the timely issue of water pollution and its sustainable management.

The exhibition, constructed like a tunnel, has 53 panels — some borrowed from Smithsonian’s H2O Today exhibition, others by Care Earth Trust, setting the knowledge into local context using evocative pictures from city photographers.

It is a dive into the different aspects of water — the ancient calendars the water cycle gave birth to, physical properties of ice that has given way to life as we know it, the pumps and wells used to extract it. You can even try your hand at playing the musical instrument of jal tarang. Parts of the exhibition are aesthetically pleasing: a collection of traditional brass and copper vessels, used to collect water are displayed while on speaker, ‘Raindrops’ by Max ZT, from the House of Waters band, plays.

Others are evocative. Selvaraj R’s short film, Locker, is being screened. In three minutes, with just a single actor on screen and no words, the film manages to convey the desperation with which water needs to be conserved. Yet other sections are plain bizarre: a non-functional bathroom, complete with a commode, shower head and bucket juts out of a wall, to display one of the uses of water.

Drawing parallels

But the main thread running through the exhibition, is the need to focus on sustainable water management. The panels from Smithsonian and Care Earth draw parallels between the US and South India.

“We brought senior geographer Doug Herman, a PhD scholar, to create this exhibition,” says Lauren Lovelace, Consul for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs at the US Consulate-General. Herman, who was at the time with the Smithsonian, travelled to South India in 2019 to lead the Water Matters curatorial process, working with local environmentalists, historians, and other stakeholders.

“He is now in Hawaii, where he does his research. He was able to bring to us the insight of how indigenous people from United States were able to bring sustainability to the use of water. He was also incredibly interested in the use of the eri system, and in the way temple tanks have been used to manage water needs,” she says.

A similar exhibition recently held in Bengaluru, titled Submerge, is also built upon the Smithsonian’s H2O Today. “Both Chennai and Bengaluru face water challenges, but we didn’t want to do the same exhibition in both places because the local environment is very different. For example, the use of temple tanks is not as relevant to Bengaluru as it is in Chennai. There we focussed on lake systems,” she says.

In the line-up Discussion: Pasumai Ilakiyam: Oru Paarvai on February 20 at 4.30 pm in Environmental Pavilion, PSTC

Discussion: Shaping Societies on February 22 at 10.30 am in Madras Literary Society

Quiz: Water, Water! on February 22 at 2.30 pm in Environmental Pavilion, PSTC

The exhibitions in Chennai and Bengaluru are the result of an on-going exchange of knowledge between water management experts in the US and India. Municipal water expert Mehboob Patel, who heads an indirect potable reuse plant in Orange County, California, and Sudhir Murthy, head of innovation at DC Water (both hold doctorates) who have been doing a lot of work on water treatment and reuse, came to Tamil Nadu for discussions with policy makers here. “On one hand, they brought their insights here, on the other, they benefited from speaking with policy makers. They are looking to Tamil Nadu for ideas and future partnerships,” she says.

Alongside the exhibition, there will also be a host of performances, discussions and quizzes in the city.

As per Pranav Sinha, VFS Global, India, regional head, applicant’s personal data is collected at the visa application centre and directly transmitted to the receiving client mission, without retaining any data.

“Once transmitted, the data is purged from the sending system. No copies of applicant’s data are made either digitally or physically. We comply with the EU-mandated GDPR in our countries of operation. These include multi-level safeguards not just in physical infrastructure, but also in our virtual systems as well,’’ Mr. Sinha said.

In some cases, scamsters pose as fake employers or immigration agents offering jobs or immigration, falsely claiming to be from VFS Global. Using a fake ‘email ID’, they impersonate heads or key departments of the company and send fabricated job offer letters and official-looking documentation via email. Often such emails are sent from an ID very similar to VFS Global’s official websites and emails addresses.

The idea to help start-ups, as a new activity, emerged at one of the town hall meetings Ms. Chunduru had with the officials of Allahabad Bank and Indian Bank in the last few months. Allahabad Bank is set to merge with Indian Bank on March 31.

“The merger gives birth to a new legal entity. With the new identity comes new ideas from new team members and we would like to test the waters. Going forward, we would like to use digital as a platform,” said Ms. Chunduru.

Though the bank plans to set aside ₹100 crore to ₹200 crore for this purpose, it wants to run this scheme on a pilot basis at least for six months. It is also planning to forge tie-ups with venture capitalists or private equity firms to understand the industry better.

“We are not taking part in the equity portion. It would be fully debt. It is based on the working model of Silicon Valley Bank and we will be the first bank in the country to help a start-up,” she said.

Gopal Srinivasan, chairman and managing director of TVS Capital Funds, welcomed the idea and said that there were three types of start-ups — emerging, emerged and speculative.

“Some of the start-ups might go for debt route from the second round itself and others might stretch it by diluting their equity. Lending, based on track record, might not be a good option, since most of these firms keep raising funds at regular intervals,” he said.

“If the scheme is successful, then we will place it under a different vertical,” Ms. Chunduru said.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/ng58vz/article30863757.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20THBUINDIANBANK,https://www.thehindu.com/business/indian-bank-eyes-lending-to-start-ups/article30863758.ece
41,2020/02/19,CK Motors to set upEV plant in Tamil Nadu,"Company to invest ₹10 crore in unit

CK Motors Pvt. Ltd. is putting up a new plant in Coimbatore to make electric vehicles (EVs) for commercial use, said a top official.

CK Motors, which has a manufacturing tie-up with Pure EV, a start-up incubated in IIT Hyderabad, is planning to commence operations at Coimbatore in the next two months.

Pure EV has a manufacturing facility in Hyderabad to make 1,500 EVs per month and this would be doubled in the next two months.

Unveiling e-bicycles, an e-moped and two variants of e-scooters in Chennai on Wednesday, CK Motors business head, C. Guna Sekaran said that plans were afoot to fully indigenise the EVs (that currently have an import content of 27%) in two months.

“Pure EV will make two-wheelers, while we will make three- and four-wheeler commercial vehicles, the manufacture of e-bicycles would be shifted to Coimbatore. We will also make three-wheeler scooters with multiple functions. We are investing ₹10 crore and the new plant will have a capacity to make 4,000 vehicles per month,” he said.

On the e-scooter, he said it would run for 115 km on a single charge of two hours. Power consumption, in this case, was ‘minimal’ and it could be charged anywhere using regular plug points.

The sale of electric two-wheelers and patented lithium batteries will commence in Chennai and Hyderabad and will be expanded to other States. In the phase-1, the company plans to have 50 dealers in all district headquarters.

“The epluto 7G scooters are priced at ₹89,999 on-road and they were the cheapest in the industry,” he said.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/hya1lx/article30863736.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20THBUEV,https://www.thehindu.com/business/ck-motors-to-set-upev-plant-in-tamil-nadu/article30863738.ece
42,2020/02/19,SEBI redefines ‘pledge’ to protect client securities,"Tweaks rules to include ‘re-pledge’

A minor tweak in the manner ‘pledge’ is defined in the regulatory laws is expected to go a long way in minimising instances where stock brokers misuse client securities by pledging such shares for their own benefit in terms of meeting their margin requirements.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has amended the SEBI (Depositories and Participants) Regulations by including an additional explanation that states that ‘pledge’ would also refer to ‘re-pledge of securities for margin or settlement obligations.’

The decision was approved by the board of the capital markets regulator on Monday.

“Onus of bonafide pledge created from margin account of a stock broker will now lie with the depository following the SEBI amendment,” Makarand Joshi, partner, MMJC and Associates, a corporate compliance firm, said.

“In the past, pledge from the margin account was directly routed by the stock broker using the power of attorney route, without the active consent or approval of the beneficiary holder of shares. Now consent of beneficial owner will be necessary,” he added.

This assumes significance as the recent past has seen few instances of brokers pledging client securities to raise funds from banks and non-banking finance companies (NBFCs). More importantly, this was done without the clients being aware that their securities were being misused in such a manner.

The most high-profile matter in the recent past was of Karvy Stock Broking in which the Hyderabad-based firm raised funds from entities such as Bajaj Finance, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and IndusInd Bank by pledging client securities.

Further, according to the lenders — as stated in an order by the Securities Appellate Tribunal — Karvy Stock Broking had even given an undertaking that the securities that were being pledged were its own and that they did not belong to clients.

‘Misuse will come down’

“Instances where a client’s funds/securities were diverted or misutilised by brokers toward margin or settlement obligations of itself, or for some third party, or for raising loans against shares on its own account, will be minimised,” said Sumit Agrawal, founder, RegStreet Law Advisors, and a former SEBI official.

“With the insertion of this explanation, depository participants of both the pledger and the pledgee will have to inform the pledger and the pledgee respectively of the entry of creation of the re-pledge,” he added.

The latest SEBI move comes close on the heels of the regulator developing an in-house system to track the movement of client securities that are collected as collateral by the brokers.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/mip1mv/article30863722.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20THBUSEBI,https://www.thehindu.com/business/sebi-redefines-pledge-to-protect-client-securities/article30863723.ece
43,2020/02/19,DoT notice an event risk for 3 firms: Fitch,"Ratings firm not taking immediate rating action though

Any payment that the three India-based firms — GAIL (India) Limited, Oil India Limited and Power Grid Corporation of India — may have to make under a demand notice from the Department of Telecom (DoT) poses as an event risk for the companies’ ratings, according to Fitch Ratings.

Fitch is not taking immediate rating action on the companies as the Supreme Court of India allowed the companies to withdraw their clarification applications on February 14 and resolve their dispute with the DoT outside the court.

This is in stark contrast with to the court’s decision to demand immediate payments from the telecom companies that are also involved in the dispute.

“We expect the three companies to eventually resolve the dispute., although resolution timing is uncertain. A speedy solution is important to prevent disrupting the companies’ investment plans and damaging their performance. The three companies are considering an appeal against the demand notices. We understand that they have the option to resolve the matter through alternate dispute-resolution mechanisms available to State-owned enterprises. This is in addition to the legal options available to telecom licence holders in general,” said Fitch in a statement.

DoT has issued demand notices to GAIL, OIL and Power Grid for ₹1,83,100 crore, ₹48,000 crore and ₹22,000 crore respectively.

The notices include licence fees on non-telecom revenue and additional interest and penalties on the licence fees.

However, the three companies’ telecom-related revenue is insignificant, at around ₹50 crore, ₹1 crore and ₹2,300 crore respectively, for the same time period as the demand notices.

The three companies have created telecom infrastructure for internal use and have obtained national long distance and internet service provider licences to rent out spare capacity.

They maintain that their licences differ from the unified access licences held by telecom companies, hence, the court’s decision on adjusted gross revenue for telecom companies does not apply to them.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/dot-notice-an-event-risk-for-3-firms-fitch/article30863715.ece

Indian benchmarks snapped a four-day losing streak on Wednesday as a decline in new COVID-19 cases in China along with expectations of action by the Indian government to limit the impact of the outbreak revived investor interest in equities.

The 30-share Sensex gained 428.62 points, or 1.05%, to close at 41,323. It closed just a tad lower than the day’s high of 41,357.16.

The rally was visible in many side counters as well with more than 1,500 stocks gaining ground as against around 1,000 stocks that ended in the red.

Within the Sensex pack, 22 stocks gained ground with Reliance Industries, HDFC, HDFC Bank, HUL, Bajaj Finance and ICICI Bank contributing the maximum to the day’s gains.

Meanwhile, the broader Nifty settled the day at 12,125.90, gaining 133.40 points, or 1.11%.

Policy stimulus

“A decline in the number of new COVID-19 cases in China and mounting expectations for more policy stimulus boosted global stock markets on Wednesday,” said Deepak Jasani, head, retail research, HDFC Securities.

“Positive sentiment (in India) were also created after the Finance Minister said the government would unveil measures to limit the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak,” he added.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had met industry representatives and assured that the government would take steps to manage the impact of COVID-19 on the domestic industry.

Elsewhere in Asia, the benchmark equity indices of Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, Japan and Indonesia, among others, all gained ground on Wednesday.

46,2020/02/19,U.S. DOJ drops all charges against Droom CEO,"Automobile marketplace Droom on Wednesday said that the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) has dropped all charges against its founder and CEO Sandeep Aggarwal in an insider-trading case from 2013. In addition, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has also reached a civil settlement with Mr. Aggarwal relating to the same case.

“Both the matters have been resolved. The charges by DOJ have been dropped and dismissed. A civil penalty of $32,500 was levied by the SEC, which I have paid. The bar on being associated with any investment advisor, broker and securities analysis — which I quit long ago — continues,” Mr. Aggarwal said.

He was charged by the DOJ and sued by the SEC in July 2013, relating to events that took place in July 2009, when Mr. Aggarwal was a Wall Street analyst.

Mr. Aggarwal added he was confident of Droom turning profitable by November this year and was aiming to list the company on Nasdaq by mid-2021, when the company achieves $3 billion GMV. While the company had set its eyes on a Nasdaq listing, Mr. Aggarwal said they could also look at Singapore stock exchange or the Hong Kong stock exchange for listing.

Additionally, the company is looking at raising about $150 million in a pre-IPO round.

India will switch to the world’s cleanest petrol and diesel from April 1 as it leapfrogs straight to Euro-VI emission compliant fuels from Euro-IV grades now — a feat achieved in just three years and not seen in any of the large economies around the globe.

India will join the select league of nations using petrol and diesel containing just 10 parts per million of sulphur as it looks to cut vehicular emissions that are said to be one of the reasons for the choking pollution in major cities.

Also read | Supreme Court bans sale of BS-IV vehicles from 2020

Sanjiv Singh, Chairman of Indian Oil Corp (IOC), the firm that controls roughly half of the country’s fuel market, said almost all refineries began producing ultra-low sulphur BS-VI (equivalent to Euro-VI grade) petrol and diesel by the end of 2019 and oil companies have now undertaken the tedious task of replacing every drop of fuel in the country with the new one.

“We are absolutely on track for supplying BS-VI fuel from April 1. Almost all refineries have begun supplying BS-VI fuel and the same has reached storage depots across the country,” he said.

From storage depots, the fuel has started travelling to petrol pumps and in the next few weeks all of them will only have BS-VI grade petrol and diesel, he said. “We are 100 per cent confident that fuel that will flow from nozzles at all the petrol pumps in the country on April 1 will be BS-VI emission compliant fuel.”

Also read | Steering away from diesel: What is the trend against this heavy polluter fuel in India?

India adopted Euro-III equivalent (or Bharat Stage-III) fuel with a sulphur content of 350 ppm in 2010 and then took seven years to move to BS-IV that had a sulphur content of 50 ppm. From BS-IV to BS-VI it took just three years.

“It was a conscious decision to leapfrog to BS-VI as first upgrading to BS-V and then shifting to BS-VI would have prolonged the journey to 4 to 6 years. Besides, oil refineries, as well as automobile manufacturers, would have had to make investments twice — first to producing BS-V grade fuel and engines and then BS-VI ones,” he said.

State-owned oil refineries spent about ₹35,000 crore to upgrade plants that could produce ultra-low sulphur fuel. This investment is on top of ₹60,000 crore they spent on refinery upgrades in the previous switch-overs.

BS-VI has a sulphur content of just 10 ppm and emission standards are as good as CNG.

Originally, Delhi and its adjoining towns were to have BS-VI fuel supplies by April 2019 and the rest of the country was to get same supplies from April 2020.

Also read | What will the move to Bharat Stage VI standards entail?

But oil marketing companies switched over to supply of BS-VI grade fuels in the national capital territory of Delhi on April 1, 2018.

The supply of BS-VI fuels was further extended to four contiguous districts of Rajasthan and eight of Uttar Pradesh in the National Capital Region (NCR) on April 1, 2019, together with the city of Agra.

BS-VI grade fuels were made available in seven districts of Haryana from October 1, 2019.

Singh said the new fuel will result in a reduction in NOx in BS-VI compliant vehicles by 25% in petrol cars and by 70% in diesel cars.

The switch-over, he said, is a tedious task as every drop of old, higher-sulphur content fuel has to be flushed out in depots, pipelines and tanks before being replaced by BS-VI.

“We are confident of disruption-free switch-over to BS-VI supplies across the country,” he said. “What we will be supplying is the best quality available anywhere in the world. You don’t have any better fuel that is supplied in any part of the world. Perhaps our BS-VI fuel will be better than equivalent fuel in some parts of the U.S. and Europe.”

India adopted a fuel upgradation programme in the early 1990s. Low lead gasoline (petrol) was introduced in 1994 in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai. On February 1, 2000, unleaded gasoline was mandated nationwide.

Similarly, BS-2000 (Euro-I equivalent, BS-1) vehicle emission norms were introduced for new vehicles from April 2000. BS-II (Euro-II equivalent) emission norms for new cars were introduced in Delhi from 2000 and extended to the other metro cities in 2001.

Benzene limits have been reduced progressively from 5% in 2000 to 1% nationwide. Lead content in gasoline was removed in phases and only unleaded gasoline is being produced and sold from February 1, 2000.

The octane number of gasoline signifies the improved performance of the engine. Loss in octane number due to phasing out of lead was made up by installing new facilities in the refinery and changes in refinery operation. RON (Research Octane Number) of gasoline for BS-2000 spec was increased to 88. This has over time been increased to 91.

Singh said sulphur reduction will reduce Particulate Matter (PM) emissions even in the in-use older generation diesel vehicles.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/41syqw/article30859091.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PETROLFILE,https://www.thehindu.com/business/india-to-switch-to-worlds-cleanest-petrol-diesel-from-april-1/article30859092.ece
49,2020/02/19,Oil rises amid hope for short economic hit from coronavirus outbreak,"Brent has risen nearly 10% since last week falling to its lowest this year so far, most recently supported by a U.S. decision on Tuesday to blacklist a trading subsidiary of Russia's Rosneft that President Donald Trump's administration said provides a financial lifeline to Venezuela's government.

Oil prices rose on Wednesday, with Brent gaining a seventh straight day, amid broad optimism as new coronavirus cases fell for a second day in China and concerns rose over supply after a U.S. move to cut more Venezuelan crude from the market.

Brent crude was up by 38 cents, or 0.7%, at $58.13 a barrel by 0647 GMT, while U.S. oil was up 40 cents, or 0.8%, at $52.45 a barrel.

China is still struggling to get manufacturing going again in the world's second-largest economy, after imposing stringent city lockdowns and travel restrictions to contain the virus that has now killed more than 2,000 people, but investors remain optimistic that the economic fallout may be short-lived.

S&P Global Ratings said it expected that coronavirus will deliver a “short-term blow” to economic growth in China in the first quarter.

Official data showed that new cases in China fell for a second straight day, although the World Health Organization has cautioned there is not enough data to know if the epidemic was being contained.

Brent has risen nearly 10% since last week falling to its lowest this year so far, most recently supported by a U.S. decision on Tuesday to blacklist a trading subsidiary of Russia's Rosneft that President Donald Trump's administration said provides a financial lifeline to Venezuela's government.

The United States slapped sanctions on Rosneft Trading SA, the Geneva-based unit.

The Swiss subsidiary “has been Venezuela's primary conduit for brokering cargos, which find their way predominantly to refineries in India and China,” said Stephen Innes, chief market strategist at AxiCorp.

“Throttling this Asian supply channel will provide some support for oil prices,” he said.

Prices have also been supported by hopes that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies will deepen supply cuts.

The grouping, known as OPEC+, has been withholding supply to support prices and meets next month to decide a response to the downturn in demand resulting from the coronavirus epidemic.

OPEC+ wants to “prevent the emergence of a large supply overhang caused by slumping demand amid the health crisis centred in China, the world's biggest importer of crude oil,” Eurasia Group said in a note.

Vietnam will more than double its power generation capacity over the next decade to support a fast-growing economy, new guidelines for a national energy development strategy show.

The Southeast Asian nation aims to boost capacity to 125-130 gigawatts (GW) by 2030, from about 54 GW now, the Communist Party's powerful decision-making politburo said in a document this month.

The strategy is “aimed at ensuring national energy security, and sufficiently supplying power for fast and sustainable socio-economic development,” it added.

Vietnam, one of Asia's fastest-growing economies, will have to battle severe power shortages from 2021 as demand outstrips construction of new power plants.

It will raise the proportion of renewable energy to 15% to 20% by 2030, while trying to cut reliance on coal for electricity production, the strategy document showed. Coal now accounts for about 38% of capacity.

The strategy calls for oil refineries to meet at least 70% of domestic demand for refined petroleum products. Vietnam will also develop infrastructure to be able to import 8 billion cubic metres of liquefied natural gas annually by 2030.

Vietnam will seek foreign and domestic private investment to help develop new power plants, and speed the privatisation of state-owned power companies.

On Friday, the government said Vietnam would generate more electricity from coal and oil this year to bridge an expected gap in hydropower output, hit by lack of rain.

The Chinese government threatened to retaliate against leading Czech companies if a senior Czech official made good on a planned visit to Taiwan, according to a diplomatic message reviewed by Reuters.

The Jan. 10 letter, sent by China's embassy in Prague to the Czech president's office, suggested that automaker Skoda, lender Home Credit Group, and musical instrument maker Petrof Pianos would suffer if late Czech lawmaker Jaroslav Kubera visited the self-ruled island as planned.

Chinese officials in Beijing did not immediately return a message seeking comment. Taiwan's foreign ministry said it would issue a statement later in the day.

The chairman of the Czech Republic's upper house of parliament, Kubera was the second-most senior official in the country after President Milos Zeman. His planned visit to Taiwan - which Beijing considers a breakaway province - had already raised concerns that China would retaliate against the Central European country's business community.

The debate was made moot when Kubera died unexpectedly on Jan. 20, ahead of the planned trip, but the letter reveals how explicit Beijing had been about who would suffer if the visit went forward.

The message - written in Czech - noted that Kubera's trip would be seen as a “serious breach” of the so-called one China policy, under which Beijing insists it is the sole representative of China.

The letter said that “China is the largest foreign market for many Czech companies like Skoda Auto, Home Credit Group, Klaviry Petrof and others.”

“Czech companies whose representatives visit Taiwan with Chairman Kubera will not be welcome in China or with the Chinese people,” the letter continued. “Czech companies who have economic interests in China will have to pay for the visit to Taiwan by Chairman Kubera.”

Boeing said Tuesday that it found debris contaminating the fuel tanks of some 737 Max jets that it built in the past year but was unable to deliver to airline customers.

A Boeing official said the debris was discovered in “several” planes but did not give a precise number. Boeing built about 400 undelivered Max jets before it temporarily halted production last month.

The fuel tank debris was discovered during maintenance on parked planes, and Boeing said it immediately made corrections in its production system to prevent a recurrence. Those steps include more inspections before fuel tanks are sealed.

A Boeing spokesman said that the issue would not change the company’s belief that the Federal Aviation Administration will certify the plane to fly again this summer.

An FAA spokesman said the agency knows that Boeing is conducting a voluntary inspection of undelivered Max planes.

The FAA “increased its surveillance based on initial inspection reports and will take further action based on the findings,” said spokesman Lynn Lunsford.

Metal shavings, tools and other objects left in planes during assembly can raise the risk of electrical short-circuiting and fires.

Mark Jenks, Boeing’s general manager of the 737 program, said in a memo to employees who work on the 737, “During these challenging times, our customers and the flying public are counting on us to do our best work each and every day.”

Jenks called the debris “absolutely unacceptable. One escape is one too many.”

The debris issue was first reported by aviation news site Leehamnews.com.

Max jets were grounded around the world last March after two crashes killed 346 people. Boeing is conducting test flights to assess updates to a flight-control system that activated before the crashes on faulty signals from sensors outside the plane, pushing the noses of the aircraft down and triggering spirals that pilots were unable to stop.

While investigators examining the Max accidents have not pointed to production problems at the assembly plant near Seattle, Boeing has faced concerns about debris left in other finished planes including the 787 Dreamliner, which is built in South Carolina.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/e6150c/article29655353.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/USA-BOEINGAIRPLANES,https://www.thehindu.com/business/boeing-finds-a-new-issue-with-max-debris-in-fuel-tanks/article30857763.ece

54,2020/02/19,Facebook says 'deeply concerned' about Singapore's order to block page,"The government had ordered Facebook this week to block the States Times Review's page in Singapore, saying the blog had repeatedly conveyed falsehoods. The States Times Review, run by Australia-based Singaporean political activist Alex Tan, is known for its outspoken, anti-establishment articles.

Facebook Inc said it was “deeply concerned” about a Singapore government order to block access to a blog page on its social media website under a controversial fake news law.

The government had ordered Facebook this week to block the States Times Review's page in Singapore, saying the blog had repeatedly conveyed falsehoods and had not complied with any of the directions that it had been served with under the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA).

Facebook said in an e-mailed statement it was legally compelled to restrict access to the page.

“We believe orders like this are disproportionate and contradict the government's claim that POFMA would not be used as a censorship tool.

“We've repeatedly highlighted this law's potential for overreach and we're deeply concerned about the precedent this sets for the stifling of freedom of expression in Singapore,” it added.

The government did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The States Times Review, run by Australia-based Singaporean political activist Alex Tan, is known for its outspoken, anti-establishment articles.

It has been censured under the fake news law three times, most recently for articles criticising Singapore's handling of the coronavirus outbreak, which the government said contained “entirely false” information.

The fake news law, seen as one of the most far-reaching of its kind, came into effect in October amid concern among rights groups and opposition politicians it could be used to silence criticism of the government.

The government has denied such suggestions saying the law only tackles falsehoods and that legitimate criticism and free speech would not be affected.

While most of the initial uses of the law involved political opposition figures, the government has been invoking it against misinformation about the coronavirus over the last few weeks.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-in-school/article16915461.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21DECISBS_Faceb+GL3114ED0.3.jpg.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/facebook-says-deeply-concerned-about-singapores-order-to-block-page/article30857604.ece
55,2020/02/19,Assisted Reproductive Technology Regulation Bill proposes national registry of clinics,"Board will formulate minimum standards for labs and lay down code of conduct for personnel.

The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved the Assisted Reproductive Technology Regulation Bill, 2020 to monitor medical procedures used to assist people to achieve pregnancy.

The Bill provides for a national Board which will lay down a code of conduct to be observed by those operating clinics.

It will also formulate minimum standards for laboratory and diagnostic equipment and practices to be followed by human resources employed by clinics and banks. The States and Union Territories will also have to form State Boards and State authorities within three months of the notification of the proposed legislation.

Under the proposed law, a national registry and registration authority will maintain a database to assist the national Board to perform its functions, according to a statement issued by the Health and Family Welfare Ministry.

Strict punishment

The Bill also proposes stringent punishment for those who practise sex selection, indulge in sale of human embryos or gametes and those who operate rackets.

“India has one of the highest growths in the number ART centres and ART cycles performed every year. India has become one of the major centres of this global fertility industry, with reproductive medical tourism becoming a significant activity. This has also introduced a plethora of legal, ethical and social issues; yet, there is no standardisation of protocols and reporting is still very inadequate,” the Ministry added.

The Union Cabinet on Wednesday gave its approval to set up the 22nd Law Commission.

The Law Commission advises the government on complex legal issues. The term of the previous law panel ended last August.

The Law Ministry will now notify the new panel, which will have a three-year term.

Apart from having a full-time chairperson, the commission will have four full-time members, including a member-secretary.

Law and Legislative Secretaries in the Law Ministry will be the ex-officio members of the commission.

“It will also have not more than five part-time members,” an official statement said.

A retired Supreme Court judge or Chief Justice of a High Court will head the Commission.

“The Law Commission shall, on a reference made to it by the Central Government or suo motu, undertake research in law and review of existing laws in India for making reforms and enacting new legislation. It shall also undertake studies and research for bringing reforms in the justice delivery systems for elimination of delay in procedures, speedy disposal of cases, reduction in cost of litigation, etc.,” the statement said.

Originally formed in 1955, the commission is reconstituted every three years and so far, 277 reports have been submitted to the government.

Working papers

The last Law Commission, under Justice B.S. Chauhan (retd.), had submitted reports and working papers on key issues such as simultaneous elections to the Lok Sabha and the Assemblies and a uniform civil code.

While it supported simultaneous polls, the Commission had said the time for a common code was not yet ripe. In 2015, a proposal was mooted to make the law panel into a permanent body either through an Act of Parliament or an executive order (resolution of the Union Cabinet).

The move was, however, shelved after the Prime Minister’s Office preferred the existing system to continue.

57,2020/02/19,Narendra Modi government in denial of slowdown: Manmohan Singh,"A $5-trillion economy by 2024-25 is wishful thinking, the former Prime Minister says.

Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on February 19 said the Narendra Modi government was in denial of the economic slowdown and its target of making India a $5 trillion economy by 2024-25 was “wishful thinking”.

He was speaking at the release of Backstage: The Story behind India’s High Growth Years, authored by former Planning Commission Deputy Chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia.

Dr. Singh also spoke about the challenges to the opening up of the economy during the 1991 crisis, and acknowledged the crucial role played by Mr. Ahluwalia and P. Chidamabaram, who was then Commerce Minister.

“We have today a government that does not acknowledge that there is such a word as slowdown. I think this is not good for our country because if you don’t recognise the problems that you face, you are not likely to find credible answers to take corrective action,” he said.

“Montek has pointed out that contrary to what the ruling group may say today, a $5 trillion economy by 2024-25 is wishful thinking,” he said.

Dr. Singh recalled the challenges he had faced during the 1991 economic crisis as the Finance Minister in the Cabinet of Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao. Not only was the dominant opinion against reforms but the business community formed the “Bombay Club” to resist liberalisation.

He faced stiff opposition from several quarters to his decision to devalue the rupee. Among them was former President R. Venkataraman.

“When I went to see the President, he said, ‘Why are you taking such a reckless path and you represent a government that has not sought a vote of confidence? And how can you take such an important decision without a vote of confidence?’ I had to tell President Venkataraman that ‘Mr. President, if we wait for the vote of confidence, I will have nothing to sell’,” Dr. Singh said.

“If Montek and P. Chidamabaram were not there at the crucial time in 1991 in the Ministry of Commerce, the story of reforms would have been less favourable,” he said.

The book launch was followed by a panel discussion, which was moderated by Rajdeep Sardesai. Mr. Chidamabaram, Mr. Ahluwalia, Bibek Debroy, who heads the Prime Minister’s Economic Advisory Council, and former RBI Governor Y.V. Reddy took part in it.

Commenting on the economy at a panel discussion, Mr. Chidamabaram said the economy was like a patient that was being wheeled into an ICU but stopped just outside and handled by incompetent doctorsAsked about bad loans during the rule of the United Progressive Alliance, Mr. Chidamabaram said he listed how many loans given during the UPA rule had gone back and how many loans turned non-performing assets in 24 months of the NDA government.

On why some of the finest Indian economists no longer want to stay on and work for the government, former RBI Governor Y.V. Reddy said it depended on how they were invited, treated and made to feel.

Bibek Debroy, who heads the Prime Minister’s Economic Advisory Council, spoke.

Mr. Debroy, however, didn’t want to comment on the economic situation and insisted that the discussion was on the book and not on the state of the economy.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bj4256/article30863909.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH20MANMOHANSINGH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/narendra-modi-government-in-denial-of-slowdown-manmohan-singh/article30863910.ece
58,2020/02/19,Cabinet Committee on Security clears Navy helicopter deal ahead of Donald Trump visit,"24 MH-60R machines will be procured for $2.4 billion.

Days before U.S. President Donald Trump’s visit to India, the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS), headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, met on Wednesday and cleared the procurement of 24 MH-60R multi-role helicopters for the Navy at a cost of $2.4 billion.

While other defence deals are expected to be announced as well, they are in various stages of procurement, and not near conclusion yet.

“The MH-60R helicopter deal has been approved by the CCS,” a defence source said. It is expected to be announced during Mr. Trump’s visit, and will help to ease partially the Navy’s shortage of helicopters on front-line warships.

MH-60R was earlier selected through a competitive process for procurement of 16 helicopters, with an optional clause for eight more. But the deal fell through owing to pricing issues and other developments. Subsequently, the tender was cancelled. A fresh tender was floated for 24 MH-60R helicopters and processed through the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) route of the U.S. government.

“MH60 takes India from an aging fleet to having the world’s best multi mission naval helicopter. The unmatched sub-hunting capability only grows when combined with India’s P8s and possibly Sea Guardian drones. There is strategic value to India of course, but also to the US for its major defense partner to have these tools in the Indo-Pacific,” Vikram Singh, former U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary for Defense and adviser to the U.S. India Strategic Partnership Forum , told The Hindu.

Another deal close to conclusion is of six additional AH-64E Apache attack helicopters for the Army. They will cost around $930 million.

The Apaches from Boeing are being sourced through the direct commercial sale and the Foreign Military Sales route.

Also under discussion is the sale of Large Aircraft Infrared Counter Measure , a missile defence system for large aircraft (such as those used by VIPs). The value of this deal is about $ 189 million, The Hindu has learned.

A missile defence system — the Integrated Air Defence Weapon System ( IADWS ), which was approved last week by the U.S. State Department and is currently with the U.S. Congress for its consideration for up to 30 days — is also in the works. That potential sale, which could be valued up to $ 1.867 billion, is likely to be taken up during U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper’s visit to India, which will likely happen in March.

Also in process is the Communications Security Account and Equipment, a package that builds on COMCASA (an agreement between India and the U.S. permitting the secure transfer of data and communication systems), valued at $5 million, a relatively small deal but considered key to advancing communication and enhancing inter-operability.

It is understood that Mr. Trump will push for U.S. solutions to fighter jet competitions of the Indian Army and Navy during his trip to India.

59,2020/02/19,Centre cuts its share in crop insurance scheme by half,"It makes enrolment optional for all farmers

The Centre has almost halved its contribution to its own flagship crop insurance schemes, slashing its share of the premium subsidy from the current 50% to just 25% in irrigated areas and 30% for unirrigated areas from the kharif season of 2020.

The Union Cabinet approved the revamp of the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana and the Restructured Weather Based Crop Insurance Scheme at its meeting on Wednesday.

In another significant step, in the two schemes has also been made voluntary for all farmers, including those with existing crop loans. When the PMFBY was launched in 2016, it was made mandatory for all farmers with crop loans to enrol for insurance cover under the scheme.

Announcing the decision after the Cabinet meeting, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said 58% of farmers enrolled in the schemes are loanees who will no longer have to compulsorily take insurance cover. “The numbers [of enrolled farmers] may go down in the first year, but will pick up again after that,” he said, adding that the Centre would launch an awareness campaign to encourage farmers to voluntarily sign up for crop insurance policies. Coverage under the scheme is now 30% of cropped area in the country, according to the government data.

The PMFBY has come in for flak from a wide variety of stakeholders. Farmers groups and Opposition politicians have claimed that private insurance companies have made windfall gains on the scheme. Several major insurers, including ICICI Lombard and Tata AIG, have opted out of the scheme in 2019-20, reportedly due to losses because of high claims ratios. Several States, including Punjab and West Bengal, have refused to participate as well.

The Centre has made changes to the scheme based on consultations with States and inputs from all stakeholders, said Mr. Tomar.

Farmers pay a fixed share of the premium: 2% of the sum insured for kharif crops, 1.5% for rabi crops and 5% for cash crops. Currently, the Centre and States split the balance of the premium equally among themselves.

However, the revamp now reduces the burden on the Centre and increases the share of States, as they will be left to take on 70-75% of the premium subsidy.

In the northeastern States, however, the balance will swing the other way, with the Centre agreeing to take on 90% of the premium subsidy.

So far, the schemes provide a comprehensive insurance package, covering crops from pre-sowing till post-harvest and a wide range of non-preventable natural risks. The restructuring now allows greater flexibility to States. They will now have the “option to select any or many of additional risk covers/features like prevented sowing, localised calamity, mid-season adversity, and post-harvest losses. Further, States/UTs can offer specific single peril risk/insurance covers, like hailstorm etc, under PMFBY even with or without opting for base cover,” said an official statement. States can also choose how to calculate the sum insured for any crop in any district, opting either for the scale of finance or a value based on notional average yield multiplied by minimum support prices.

Also, a separate scheme is being developed to “provide financial support and effective risk mitigation tools through crop insurance especially to 151 districts which are highly water stressed including 29 which are doubly stressed because of low income of farmers and drought,” it added.

The allocation of business to insurance companies will be done for a three-year period, unlike the current system which allows for one year periods.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/centre-cuts-its-share-in-crop-insurance-scheme-by-half/article30863710.ece
60,2020/02/19,"Trade deal with U.S. delayed, not stuck, says government","Points to grand scale of Trump-Modi Motera rally as the key deliverable of the visit.

An India-U.S. trade deal has been delayed, but is not “stuck”, said the government on February 19, hours after President Donald Trump confirmed that negotiations will not be completed in time for his visit next week. However, government sources said expectations on trade must not overshadow the larger context of the visit, which will be a massive roadshow for Mr. Trump and his wife Melania Trump along the way from the Ahmedabad airport to the Motera Stadium as well as a joint rally with Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the stadium (billed as the world’s biggest cricket stadium), which is the “key deliverable” of the visit.

“From the moment of their arrival at the airport, [Mr. and Mrs. Trump] will be treated to a display of famed Indian hospitality and India’s Unity in Diversity,” Foreign Secretary Harsh Shringla told media persons.

‘Big deal later’

Speaking in Washington DC, Mr. Trump spoke in a similar vein. “We can have a trade deal with India but I am saving the big deal for later on. We’re doing a very big trade deal with India…we’ll have it. I don’t know if it’ll be done before the elections but we’ll have a very big deal with India,” he told reporters on Tuesday afternoon at the Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, before he flew to California.

The comments come days after U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer cancelled a trip to India — as reported in The Hindu — to finalise a mini-trade deal that the two countries were hoping to finalise during the visit.

“We’re not treated very well by India but I happen to like Prime Minister Modi a lot. And he told me we’ll have seven million people between the airport and the event. And the stadium, I understand, is sort of semi under-construction but it’s going to be the largest stadium in the world. So it’s going to be very exciting,” Mr. Trump said.

Performing arts

“The route of their travel to the stadium is expected to have tens of thousands of ordinary citizens as well as artistes showcasing the performing arts from different States and Union Territories,” he said, adding that Mr. Trump’s motorcade would pass through an “India roadshow” along the way, with 28 stages representing various parts of the country put on display.

The figures represent a considerable contrast to the U.S. President’s repeated reference to crowds of “7 million” (70 lakh) that he expects will come out to greet him, but the government feels that rather than the figure being taken literally, the “spirit” of the grandness of the event is important.

On trade, the government conceded that talks between U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal had not been able to conclude even a “mini-deal” yet, but held out the hope that Mr. Lightizer, who cancelled his visit last week might still travel as a part of Mr. Trump’s delegation., and also held out the possibility that talks on a free trade agreement (FTA) will soon begin. Among other senior officials who may travel are Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, and advisor and son-in-law to the President Jared Kushner.

Mr. Trump will be the eighth American President to visit India since Independence, and the fifth to visit in the last two decades, when the bilateral ties were reset. This will be the first-ever “standalone” visit by a U.S. President, as Mr. Trump is expected to travel directly to Delhi on February 23 from Washington, with a stopover at the U.S. Ramstein Base in Germany, and fly back the same route on February 25 night.

The 36-hour visit to India will begin on February 24 when Air Force One touches down in Ahmedabad and the Presidential couple will then fly to Agra to see the Taj at sunset, before flying into Delhi. On February 25, Mr. Trump will hold talks with Mr. Modi and have lunch with him before releasing a comprehensive joint statement. Both are expected to address business delegations in the afternoon and the Trumps will attend a banquet at Rashtrapati Bhavan before flying out on February 25 night.

“This will be President Trump’s 5th meeting with Prime Minister Modi in 8 months [after Osaka, Biarritz, Houston, New York] — reflecting the renewed intensity of high-level bilateral engagement since the NDA Government returned to power,” Mr. Shringla who, as former Ambassador to the U.S., was responsible for organising those meetings, said. He called the relationship with the U.S. as one of India’s “most consequential relationships” today. “It is a strategic partnership based on shared values and geared towards the 21st century. Whether in countering terrorism or in ensuring a peaceful and prosperous Indo-Pacific, India and the U.S. have unprecedented convergence of interests,” he noted.

61,2020/02/19,Second phase of Swachh Bharat Mission gets nod,"Key focus is to end open defecation

The Centre will begin implementing the second phase of its Swachh Bharat mission in rural areas from April, focusing on solid and liquid waste management and the sustainability of the abolition of open defecation.

On Wednesday, the Union Cabinet approved an allocation of ₹52,497 crore for the scheme from the budget of the Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation over the next four years, according to an official statement. The remaining outlay of ₹88,384 crore until 2024-25 will come via a convergence model, depending on funds released under the 15th Finance Commission and money allocated to the rural jobs guarantee scheme, as well as a revenue generation model being developed for solid and liquid waste management.

The Union Budget for 2020-21 had allocated ₹9,994 crore for the first year of the mission’s Phase-II.

The scheme will be implemented by the States, with a fund sharing pattern of 60:40 between the Centre and the States.

In the northeastern and Himalayan states, the Central share will be 90%.

The first phase of the scheme, carried out between 2014 and 2019, focussed on the goal of abolishing open defecation by ensuring that all households had access to a toilet and used it.

According to government data, more than 10 crore toilets were constructed under the scheme and rural areas in all States had declared themselves open defecation free (ODF) by October 2019.

Phase II would continue the provision of a ₹12,000 per household incentive for households which still do not have toilets. “Funding norms for Solid and Liquid Waste Management have been rationalised and changed to per capita basis in place of number of households,” the Centre said in the statement, adding that financial assistance to gram panchayats for construction of community managed sanitary complexes had been increased to ₹3 lakh per complex, from ₹2 lakh.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/vw804z/article30865277.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Swachh-Bharat-mission-in-rural-areas,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/second-phase-of-swachh-bharat-mission-gets-nod/article30863553.ece

The Supreme Court on Wednesday held that subordinate judicial officers cannot apply or compete for direct appointment as District Judge even if they have a previous experience of seven years as an advocate.

The only opportunity available for them to be District Judges is through promotion in accordance with the Rules framed under Article 234 and proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution, a three-judge Bench led by Justice Arun Mishra declared in an 83-page judgment.

Justice Mishra, who co-authored the main judgment with Justice Vineet Saran, was interpreting Article 233 of the Constitution. Direct appointment under Article 233 is only available to advocates or pleaders with seven years of legal practice. The Article expressly bars candidates in service of either the Union or the State.

“Members of judicial service having seven years experience of practice before they have joined the service or having combined experience of seven years as both a lawyer and judicial officer are not eligible to apply for direct recruitment as a District Judge,” Justice Mishra held.

The court held that prohibition on judicial officers staking a claim to District Judgeship through direct recruitment under Article 233(2) is not ultra vires nor a violation of their fundamental rights to equality and equal opportunities in public employment.

The judgment noted that judicial officers directly appointed under Article 233 cannot continue as District Judges. They would be reverted to their original posts and the respective High Courts would consider their promotion in accordance with the prevailing Rules in case they were superseded by their juniors.

The main judgment was concurred by the third member of the Bench, Justice S. Ravindra Bhat, in a separate opinion. “The Constitution makers consciously wished that members of the Bar should be considered for appointment at all three levels, i.e. as District judges, High Courts and the Supreme Court. This was because counsel practising in the law courts have a direct link with the people who need their services; their views about the functioning of the courts, is a constant dynamic… they inject the judicial branch with fresh perspectives,” Justice Bhat explained.

The court held that an advocate, to be eligible under Article 233, has to be continuing in practice for seven years as on the cut-off date and at the time of appointment as District Judge.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/district-judge-postings-only-via-promotion/article30863489.ece

Mr. Guterres said he was personally concerned about the future of the religious minorities in India after the enactment of the new citizenship law, which seeks to give citizenship to persecuted minorities from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan.

While enacting new citizenship laws, measures should be taken to ensure that they did not create stateless citizens, he said.

Of every 10 calls made to the emergency helpline 1098 to report abuse against children, one was from a survivor desperately seeking help, according to data compiled by the CHILDLINE India Foundation (CIF).

The data is for 2018-2019 from the CIF, the nodal agency appointed by the Ministry of Women and Child Development to manage CHILDLINE helpline 1098 — a free, emergency phone service for children in need of help. It is also the largest network of agencies involved in protection of children.

3 lakh cases

Last year, the helpline received a total of 62 lakh calls, which were converted into three lakh cases. The largest number of phone calls were made to seek intervention for abuse cases, which were at 53,696 or 17% of the total cases. This category of complaints was followed by those pertaining to child labour (13%), education (12%), runaways (11%) and missing children (11%), according to the details exclusively provided to The Hindu.

From the total 53,696 calls made regarding abuse against children, 6,278 calls were made by survivors seeking urgent intervention.

An analyses of the nature of abuse children suffered shows that 37% of the complaints were about child marriage, 27% about physical abuse and 13% regarding sexual abuse. The remaining 23% constituted emotional, corporal, domestic and cyber abuse.

Neighbours the culprits

CHILDLINE has also collated data to examine the profile of abusers. The analyses show that 35% of the total 8,000 cases of sexual abuse were committed by neighbours, 25% by strangers and 11% by family members. The remaining 29% of perpetrators were friends, relatives, teachers, institutional staff, hospital staff, police and step parents.

Eighty six per cent of survivors of sexual abuse were girls.

Children who dialled the helpline also sought intervention for emotional and mental health, physical health, addiction, family related issues, among others.

“After a child or an adult contacts our helpline we reach out to our local partner who contacts the child in need of protection. Our target is to reach the child within 60 minutes of receiving a call. The child is then rescued and immediately taken to an open shelter and placed before the Child Welfare Committee (CWC) within 24 hours. We then take action according to the directions of the CWC such as either filing an FIR or sending the child to a hospital or a childcare institution. Our ultimate aim is to reunite the child with his or her family, otherwise we ensure long-term rehabilitation,” CHILDLINE India Foundation’s Executive Director Anjaiah Pandiri told The Hindu.

A large majority of cases (33%) involved providing the child support in his or her existing set up or referring the case to CWC (12%). Only 13% of the cases required police intervention.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/rl9caf/article30863287.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thvli-1098-childline-call-centre-children,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/one-in-10-calls-on-abuse-to-helpline-made-by-children-study/article30863277.ece
65,2020/02/19,Coal scam: SC directs CBI to file fresh status report on probe against ex-CBI chief Ranjit Sinha,"A Bench granted time to the agency after it sought an extension

The Supreme court on Wednesday directed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to file a fresh status report within four weeks on the probe into the charges of “abuse of official position” by former agency chief Ranjit Sinha and the progress made in over 50 coal scam cases.

A Bench of Chief Justice S.A. Bobde and Deepak Gupta granted time to the agency after it sought an extension.

Mr. Sinha is accused of trying to impede the CBI’s investigation into the cases, which emerged in 2012 after a report of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) was leaked to the media.

The court dismissed the plea field by lawyer M.L. Sharma seeking a direction to the CBI to take coercive steps against Naveen Jindal, alleged to be the main beneficiary of the coal scam cases.

The Bench also took note of a statement from advocate Amit Anand Tiwari, appearing for the CBI, that the probe agency had followed procedure and did not arrest the accused as it was not deemed necessary.

He further said that as many as 55 regular cases have been registered by the CBI in the coal scam cases and it had taken steps like impounding passports of certain persons, if there were apprehensions of them absconding.

He said that no arrest had been made as the offences were registered under the Prevention of Corruption Act.

The Supreme Court had earlier asked senior advocate R.S. Cheema to continue as the Special Public Prosecutor (SPP) to conduct trials for the Enforcement Directorate, as well in the money laundering cases related to the coal block scam.

The court had been undertaking the exercise to find a replacement for Mr. Cheema as SPP for the ED cases, after he had urged that he be relieved as the prosecutor in the money laundering cases.

Mr. Cheema, who was appointed the SPP in coal block scam cases in 2014, had however said that he would continue as the SPP for prosecuting the coal scam cases filed by the CBI.

The CAG had found discrepancies in the coal block allocations made by the previous Manmohan Singh-led government, which had allegedly cost the national exchequer ₹1.86 lakh crore in losses. The CBI had filed a charge sheet in the case in April 2015.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coal-scam-sc-directs-cbi-to-file-fresh-status-report-on-probe-against-ex-cbi-chief-ranjit-sinha/article30863264.ece
66,2020/02/19,Ram temple trust elects Nritya Gopal Das as president,"Nripendra Misra, former Principal Secretary to Prime Minister, elected head of the temple construction committee.

The Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra Trust, set up to oversee the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya, held its first meeting in New Delhi on Wednesday, and elected Ramjanmabhoomi Nyas’s Mahant Nritya Gopal Das as chairman and Champat Rai, described as a social activist and also associated with the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, as general secretary.

The meeting also decided that Nripendra Mishra, former Principal Secretary to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, will head a committee to take decisions regarding the actual construction of the temple.

A State Bank of India account (while not explicitly stating that funds for the temple be via public donations or subscriptions) will be opened at the Ayodhya branch of the bank in the trust’s name. Swami Govind Dev Giriji Maharaj will be the treasurer of the trust. Signatures of Swami Govind Dev Giriji Maharaj, Mr. Rai or Dr. Anil Mishra (two of three) will suffice to operate the account.

While no date has been announced for temple construction to begin, sources told The Hindu that a date in April is being favoured. According to a press statement issued by the trust, the meeting began with a vote of thanks “to all Sants and Ram Bhakts from 1528 onwards” who strove for the temple. The resolution also expressed thanks to the Narendra Modi government as well as the Uttar Pradesh government for its “constructive role” over the issue and reposed full faith in the constitutional institutions and law courts of the country.

While the initial announcement of the trust did not include its current chairperson and general secretary, they were added later with the trust being empowered to do so.

67,2020/02/19,APW moves SC for 100% reverification of NRC process in Assam,"The NGO, whose petition had led to the exercise in Assam, alleged that the NRC left out the names of indigenous persons but included many illegal foreigners

The Assam Public Works (APW), an NGO whose petition had led to the National Register of Citizens (NRC) exercise in Assam, has moved the Supreme Court for a 100% reverification of the entire process and a probe by a judicial committee to detect the discrepancies involved in updating the citizens’ register.

In a fresh affidavit filed in the apex court on Monday, the APW alleged that the NRC, which was published on August 31, 2019, left out the names of indigenous persons but included many illegal foreigners.

The final NRC list had the names of four Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh “jihadis”, who were arrested from Barpeta district, the affidavit said.

The arrested “jihadis”, whose names figured in the NRC, were Azharuddin, Ranjit Ali, Luit Jamiul Jamal and Muqaddir Islam, it added.

Earlier, a petition filed by the NGO in the Supreme Court had led to the NRC being updated in the northeastern State.

In the fresh affidavit, the APW also urged that agencies such as the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) be allowed to probe the alleged misappropriation of funds and irregularities in updating the citizens’ register by former NRC State Coordinator Prateek Hajela.

It also alleged that Mr. Hajela and the software companies engaged in updating the NRC indulged in corruption and malpractices, which made it a “useless document for the people of Assam”.

The APW had filed a complaint against Mr. Hajela with the State police on February 12 for allegedly tampering with the final NRC list, disobeying the orders and directions of the Supreme Court, making a false document, causing forgery of the public register and committing offences under cyber laws by altering or changing public records, misusing his powers and positions.

The NGO had also filed a complaint against Mr. Hajela with the anti-corruption branch of the CBI on November 28 last year, alleging misappropriation of funds during the NRC process.

The Supreme Court had ordered Mr. Hajela’s transfer from Assam to his home State Madhya Pradesh and he was released from the charge of the NRC State Coordinator on November 11 last year.

“In the latest affidavit, we have requested that the validity of the NRC should not be considered till the final settlement of the two cases pending before a Constitution bench of the Supreme Court. The NRC exercise should be halted for the time being and a 100% re-verification of the entire process should be done,” APW president Aabhijeet Sarma said.

The two cases filed in the apex court challenge the constitutional validity of Section 6A, inserted by the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 1985 to reflect the special provisions granting citizenship to those covered by the Assam Accord.

Mr. Sarma claimed that the APW had a lot of information regarding the malpractices and was eager to submit those to various probe agencies as and when it was required. “We want the matter to be investigated by high-level agencies under the supervision of the Union Home Ministry,” he said.

According to APW estimations, around 80 lakh illegal foreigners were included in the final NRC list, he said. Moreover, the names of more than 19 lakh people have been left out of the document.

Mr. Sarma said vast areas of agricultural land in the State were being transformed overnight into populated villages, especially in the Barkhetri Assembly constituency in Nalbari district.

The situation was worsening as the district authority was not in a position to take the required steps to control the sudden rush of people, he added.

The situation was similar at Sipajhar in Darrang district, where 182 bighas of agricultural land were converted into newly-constructed villages, he said.

The APW would continue to raise the issue till all discrepancies regarding the NRC were settled and all those who made money through corrupt practices were punished, Mr. Sarma added.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/y5nwv6/article30862324.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19THPTINRCASSAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/apw-moves-sc-for-100-reverification-of-nrc-process-in-assam/article30862326.ece

69,2020/02/19,"Scrap Sanjay Kothari appointment as CVC as process is vitiated, says Congress","What does government want to hide that the CVC has to be their person, Congress asks.

The Congress on Wednesday demanded the appointment of Sanjay Kothari as the new Chief Vigilance Commissioner (CVC) be scrapped, saying the entire process was vitiated, and asked for a fresh selection process.

At a press conference at the party headquarters, senior leader Manish Tewari called the process displayed that both “procedure and propriety was completely thrown away at the level of the Prime Minister and the Home Minister”.

As reported by The Hindu on Tuesday, Mr. Tewari pointed out that Finance Secretary Rajeev Kumar was a member of the Search Committee to select potential candidates for the post as well as a shortlisted candidate himself.

“How can an applicant be a member of the Search Committee? It is bizarre that you are a judge in your own case,” said Mr. Tewari.

At Monday’s meeting of the High Powered Committee presided by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, when Congress leader in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury had raised this issue, Mr. Modi is learnt to have instructed officials to follow norms.

Referring to such news reports, Mr. Tewari said, “What does the Prime Minister do? He pulls out a paper from his pocket and chooses someone who was not even an applicant.”

Mr. Tewari said the process now had not only been vitiated but described it as “illegal and unconstitutional. Even a peon in the government is not selected this way,” he claimed.

“What does the government want to hide that the CVC has to be their person?” he asked.

“We, therefore, demand that the process of appointment be scrapped in its entirety and a fresh process is undertaken.” Asked if the Congress is going to legally challenge the appointment, Mr. Tewari said the matter is serious and sensitive and “all options are open”.

Mr. Tewari also referred to a purported statement made by U.S. President Donald Trump ahead of his India visit.

“I saw a video clip where President Trump was saying India has not treated them [U.S.] well. I think it’s an insult to our country and hope that the Ministry of External Affairs will respond,” he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/h2zoj3/article30862058.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KOTHARI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/scrap-sanjay-kothari-appointment-as-cvc-as-process-is-vitiated-says-congress/article30862075.ece
70,2020/02/19,"Collegium recommends transfer of Delhi High Court’s Justice Muralidhar, two other judges","Bar ‘shocked’ by Collegium decision.

The Supreme Court Collegium has recommended the transfer of Justice S. Muralidhar, who is third in the order of seniority in the Delhi High Court, along with two other transfer recommendations of judges.

The Collegium led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde has recommended to the government that Justice Muralidhar be shifted to the Punjab and Haryana High Court. The Collegium’s resolution, dated February 12, was uploaded on the Supreme Court website on Wednesday.

Two other high court judges have also been recommended for transfer in the same resolution. Bombay High Court judge, Justice Ranjit V. More, has been approved for transfer to the Meghalaya High Court, while the Collegium has recommended that Justice Ravi Vijaykumar Malimath of the Karnataka High Court be moved to the Uttarakhand High Court.

The Delhi High Court Bar Association expressed its “shock” at the recommendation to transfer Justice Muralidhar, who would become the second most senior judge of the Delhi High Court following the retirement of Justice G.S. Sistani in March 2020.

Eventually, had Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court D.N. Patel been elevated or retired by 2022, Justice Muralidhar, who is set to retire only in 2023, would have likely functioned for at least some time as the Acting Chief Justice of the high court.

Justice Muralidhar, who was elevated as a judge of the Delhi High Court in May 2006, has delivered many significant decisions. The judge, who had convicted politician Sajjan Kumar in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots case, had also revoked the transit remand of activist Gautam Navlakha in the Bhima Koregaon case.

In 2009, Justice Muralidhar was part of the Delhi High Court Bench which had decriminalised homosexuality. He refuses to be addressed as ‘Your Lordship’ by lawyers and gives them prior notice not to do so in the causelist itself.

In an emergency meeting held in the afternoon, the Delhi High Court Bar Association resolved to request its members to abstain from work on February 20 as a “token of protest as the transfer is a rarest of rare cases, the majesty of our revered institution is at stake”.

In January, the Supreme Court had, stayed a decision by a Bombay High Court Bench led by Justice More to allow the shifting of HDIL promoters Rakesh Wadhawan and Sarang Wadhawan — accused in the multi-crore Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) Bank scam case — from Arthur Road Jail to their Bandra East residence.

Judges recommended for transfer can request the Collegium to reconsider its decision. Justice V.K. Tahilramani had resigned as Madras High Court Chief Justice in September 2019 after her request to reconsider her transfer to Meghalaya was turned down by the Collegium.

On February 15, Justice S.C. Dharmadhikari, the second in the order of seniority in the Bombay High Court, resigned citing personal problems.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/w2uo0/article30854010.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH18SC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/collegium-recommends-transfer-of-delhi-hcs-justice-muralidhar-2-other-hc-judges/article30861713.ece
71,2020/02/19,COVID-19 outbreak to hit global growth but will have limited impact on India: RBI Governor,"Only a few sectors in India are likely to see disruptions and alternatives are being explored to overcome those issues, he said

The COVID-19 outbreak will have a limited impact on India, but global GDP and trade will definitely be affected due to the large size of the Chinese economy, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das has said.

Only a few sectors in India are likely to see disruptions and alternatives are being explored to overcome those issues, he said.

The deadly virus has brought a large part of China, the world’s second-largest economy, to a standstill and its impact has been felt across industries. India’s pharmaceutical and electronics manufacturing sectors are dependent on China for inputs and they may be impacted, Mr. Das told PTI in an interview here.

“It is definitely an issue which needs to be closely monitored by policymakers, whether in India or any other country. Every policymaker and monetary authority must keep a close watch,” he said.

A similar problem, perhaps on a lower scale, occurred last time during the outbreak of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, he said, adding that the Chinese economy had slowed down by about 1% during that time.

At the time of the SARS outbreak, China was the sixth-largest economy and accounted for only 4.2% of the world’s GDP. The Asian giant is now the world’s second-largest economy, accounting for 16.3% of the global GDP. Therefore, any slowdown in the Chinese economy would impact the global economy, he said.

The RBI Governor said the COVID-19 outbreak appears to be larger than the SARS outbreak. Moreover, this time China’s share in the world GDP and world trade is much higher. “Hence, the virus outbreak will definitely have an impact on global GDP and global trade,” he said, adding that every major economy today will have to be very careful.

China is an important trading partner for India and policymakers, both in the government and various monetary authorities, are keeping an eye on the developments that are taking place, he said.

“If the Chinese authorities are able to contain the problem, the impact on the global economy and on India will be minimised,” Mr. Das said.

On the impact on India, he said the pharmaceutical sector sources raw materials from China. “Most of the larger pharmaceutical companies, according to information that we have, always keep stock for three to four months. They should be able to manage. Also, those provinces from where these pharmaceutical intermediates are sourced have not been impacted by the virus outbreak. Therefore, there is an expectation that the supply of pharmaceutical raw materials will be maintained,” he said.

The electronics manufacturing sector in the country is also dependent on China for products including mobile handsets and TV sets. “There, again, it is important that our manufacturers are able to develop alternative places to source these raw materials”.

“I think there is evidence that our manufacturers are already discussing with other countries in the Asian region. If they are able to quickly access raw materials from these countries, then the problem for our manufacturers will also be contained,” he said.

He said the critical issue to be monitored now is how quickly Chinese authorities are able to contain the problem. For India, he said, the important point to be watched is how quickly manufacturers are able to access alternative sources.

India exports iron ore to China and this could be impacted, he said. “But in economics, something negative in one place always results in something positive elsewhere. So, if your iron ore exports are impacted, then perhaps the raw material supply to our local domestic steel manufacturers will be at reduced costs. Hence, their cost of production may go down.”

Mr. Das said the COVID-19 outbreak is an enormous human tragedy and the focus has to be on containing the virus.

China’s GDP has risen dramatically since the SARS outbreak in 2003. In 2002, China contributed 23% to the world GDP growth, while in 2019 China contributed an estimated 38% to world growth.

Meanwhile, the death toll from the COVID-19 epidemic in China has crossed the 2,000-mark as of Wednesday with the death of 136 more people, while the overall confirmed cases climbed to 74,185, authorities said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/n3oile/article30373412.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Shaktikanta-Das,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/covid-19-outbreak-to-hit-global-growth-but-will-have-limited-impact-on-india-rbi-governor/article30861516.ece

A Delhi court Wednesday granted bail to former NITI Aayog CEO Sindhushree Khullar and others in the INX Media corruption case which also involves former Finance minister P. Chidambaram and his son Karti as accused.

The Chidambarams are already on bail in the case.

Special Judge Ajay Kumar Kuhar also granted bail to former Officer on Special Duty (OSD) to Finance Minister, Pradeep Kumar Bagga and former FIPB director Prabodh Saxena.

Former section officer of the FIPB unit in the Finance Ministry, Ajeet Kumar Dungdung; the then under secretary in the FIPB unit, Rabindra Prasad and former joint secretary (Foreign Trade) DEA Anup K Pujari were also granted the relief by the court.

The judge, who granted them bail on a surety of ₹2 lakh each, directed that the accused would not leave the country without its permission.

It further directed them not to tamper with the evidence or hamper the probe.

The CBI had opposed their applications, saying they may tamper with evidence and flee from justice if granted the relief.

While seeking bail for the accused persons, senior advocate Siddharth Luthra and advocate Vikash Kumar Pathak, had said that the CBI did not arrest the accused persons while probing the matter.

“Now while the probe is already complete and the final report filed, there is no ground to take them in custody since there is no ground to suggest that they tried to hamper the probe,” they said.

On Tuesday, the court directed the CBI to hand over to Chidambarams certain documents filed along with the charge sheet in the case.

The judge issued the direction to the CBI during the hearing in the corruption case after the father-son duo told the court that they had not received various documents filed along with the charge sheet.

P. Chidambaram was taken into custody on August 21 last year when he was arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in INX Media corruption case.

On October 16, the ED arrested him in the separate money-laundering case.

Six days later, on October 22, the apex court had granted him bail in the case lodged by the CBI.

On December 4, after 105 days of custody, Chidambaram was granted bail by the Supreme Court in the money laundering case lodged by the ED.

CBI had registered its case on May 15, 2017, alleging irregularities in a Foreign Investment Promotion Board clearance granted to INX Media group for receiving overseas funds of ₹305 crore in 2007 during Chidambaram’s tenure as Finance Minister.

Srinagar, Feb 19 (PTI) The Jammu and Kashmir Police on Wednesday said that it will act against the misuse of social media networks, which were allegedly being used to stoke violence in the valley.

“We have evidence whereby social media was used through VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) to tell militants to carry out attacks at certain places. On priority, we are targeting such misuse of social media,” Director General of Police Dilbagh Singh told reporters here.

He said the Jammu and Kashmir administration had issued an order on January 14 banning the use of social media but the police was only going after those who were misusing it.

“We are sharing information (through WhatsApp) with you which means we know that you are using it. We are keeping a vigil on the use of social media and will act against those who misuse it,” Singh said.

The DGP was responding to a question about the police spokesperson using WhatsApp to share press releases and send invitations for events including his press conference on Wednesday in spite of the ban on the use of social media.

“There have been several instances of misuse. For example, the driver of the truck which was carrying militants at Nagrota sent a photograph to his handlers in Pakistan the moment his vehicle was intercepted at the naka,” he said.

“We have to differentiate between use and misuse... when someone misuses the social media, there will be no room for leniency. You should be thankful that you are able to use it,” he added.

Inspector General of Police Kashmir Zone Vijay Kumar dismissed reports in some sections of media that 200 persons have been booked for using VPN.

“We have registered a general FIR. The report that 200 persons have been booked is absolutely wrong,” Kumar said. PTI MIJ

At least 23 people died in the violence during the protests, most of them of bullet injuries.

“Agar koi marne ke liye aa hi raha hai toh woh zinda kahan se ho jaega [If somebody is hell bent on coming to die, how will he stay alive],” Mr. Adityanath said. “Upadravi upadraviyo ki goliyon se hi mare hai [the rioters died from the bullets fired by other rioters],” he claimed.

The police and the State administration “should be praised” for the work done by them during the protests as there was no riot reported in the aftermath, he said.

Mr. Adityanath accused the Congress and the Samajwadi Party (SP) of supporting and sympathising with the outfits that participated in the protests in which arson and vandalism were reported. These outfits “do not believe” in the Constitution and and they received “terror funding”, he alleged.

The Chief Minister singled out the Popular Front of India and accused it of terror funding. The outfit, on several occasions, had dismissed the government charge.

Mr. Adityanath claimed he would support any protest if it was done in a democratic manner and he would even provide it security and freedom. However, if in the garb of democracy, anyone “tears the Constitution to shreds”, attacked innocent persons, dishonoured women or participated in arson, “then we will explain it to them in the language they understand”.

Mr. Adityanath evoked the 1990 firing on Ram Janmabhoomi activists or kar sevaks to target the Opposition, especially the SP, which was in power then, for questioning his government on the action taken against alleged vandals during the CAA protests.

“Those who ordered firing on Ram bhakts in Ayodhya and tried to pollute the esteem of Ayodhya are today seeking answers from us on the action against the rioters”, he said.

The Supreme Court, which in November last ruled in favour of building a Ram mandir at the disputed site in Ayodhya, had put a stamp of approval on the claim of “Ram bhakts”. “The Ram bhakts who were demanding a Ram manidr in Ayodhya were right. And those who fired at them were wrong”, he said.

Mocking former Chief Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav for his famous comments that even a parinda (bird) would be able to breach the security in Ayodhya in 1990, Mr. Adityanath said: “There was not a parinda but lakhs of Ram bhakts in Ayodhya. But U.P. proved on November 9, 2019 that even a parinda (bird) cannot move its wings under law and order”.

While Mr. Adityanath claimed not a single death occurred due to firing by police, the district police in Bijnor in December 2019 admitted that a youth, Suleiman, died after a constable fired at him in self-defence.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/604oo6/article30506874.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/YOGIADITYANATHSG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/not-a-single-person-died-of-police-bullet-during-anti-caa-protests-adityanath/article30860925.ece

79,2020/02/19,"‘We’re here to find a solution’, interlocutors tell Shaheen Bagh protesters","Several women, including college students, homemakers and dadis put forth their reservations before the interlocutors.

Supreme Court-appointed interlocutors Sanjay Hegde and Sadhana Ramachandran on Wednesday made their first direct contact with women protesters of Shaheen Bagh, who have been on a sit-in against the the CAA-NRC-NPR regime since December 16.

“This was our first interaction with the women and dadis of Shaheen Bagh apart from other citizens. We heard their grievances and concerns. They want us to come again as we could not speak to all of them. They have expressed their pain and sorrow”, Ms. Ramachandran told reporters along with Mr. Hegde after a nearly two-hour interaction with the protesters.

The apex court on Monday upheld the fundamental rights of women, children and others protesting at Shaheen Bagh, but expressed concern over blocking public areas like roads while voicing their dissent.

“Democracy works on different views...you want to protest, no problem...our limited concern is whether you could protest without blocking roads and entering public areas...with every right there comes a responsibility too,” the court said while appointing the interlocutors to convey its apprehension over the road blockage and a suggestion to shift the protest site.

Initiating a conversation with the protesters, Mr. Hegde said, “We are here to listen to all and speak to you all.”

Ms. Ramachandran, while explaining the court order to the protesters, said: “It is your right to protest but like us, there are other citizens also who use the roads, like shopkeepers, doctors and others. Do we want to take away the rights of others? So the Supreme Court has sent us. We want to find a solution along with you all.”

Several women, including college students, homemakers and the Shaheen Bagh dadis, put forth their reservations before the interlocutors. Some stated that the current site would be vacated “within 30 minutes of the law being revoked”, while others asked what the “guarantee was that the government will initiate a discussion” if the protesters moved to an alternate site.

Zainab (19 told the interlocutors, “We are not celebrating anything here that we will keep shifting sites. Look at the kind of language that has been used by ministers. Why are we being vilified like this? Initiation of a dialogue should come from the government’s side. Is this a game that the Home Minister is playing with us? First he says he is ready to meet all and then we get stopped. We are going through a mental trauma.”

In response, Ms. Ramachandran said, “A country that has daughters like you can never face any threat.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/84xmh8/article30859455.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH19Shaheen-Bagh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/supreme-court-appointed-interlocutors-visit-shaheen-bagh/article30859456.ece
80,2020/02/19,"Supreme Court keen on listening to Nitin Gadkari on vehicles running on electricity, hydrogen","CJI, later settles for an affidavit.

Chief Justice of India (CJI) Sharad A. Bobde on Wednesday orally expressed the Supreme Court's keenness to have Union Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari attend a hearing and explain his plans to induct vehicles running on electricity, and usage of clean fuels such as hydrogen.

However, Additional Solicitor General A.N.S. Nadkarni said a Minister's presence in the court would give rise to political speculations.

The exchange happened during the hearing of a petition filed by NGO Centre for Public Interest Litigation, represented by advocate Prashant Bhushan, for timely implementation of the Electric Vehicle Policy (EVP) and Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid & Electric Vehicles (FAME) India scheme.

Chief Justice Bobde clarified that the court's invitation to the Minister to come and explain in person should not be misinterpreted as a summons, an order or an indictment. It was merely because the court wanted to have a wholistic picture about the policy to shift to electric powered vehicles, and the minister would be the best person to give it.

“Your Minister has been making many statements about the introduction of CNG (compressed natural gas), electric vehicles, etc. Officers may be responsible but they may not have the whole picture though...”, Chief Justice Bobde explained to Mr. Nadkarni.

The court assuaged the government side, saying “in case you are worried about the political angle, we are not doing this at the behest of the petitioner or Mr. Bhushan. He is not going to argue with the minister. We want to make it very clear that we are not summoning him”.

Comprehensive affidavit

Mr. Nadkarni said the government would first like to file a comprehensive affidavit in the court on its projects for clean fuels.

Later in the hearing, the CJI indicated that if the minister cannot add anything useful, then he could instruct whoever is responsible to assist the court in the issue. The court asked the government to file its affidavit in four weeks.

Chief Justice Bobde said there were many cases pending in the Supreme Court concerning air pollution. “There are cases concerning the bursting of firecrackers during Diwali, which comes only once a year. But vehicular pollution is an every day phenomenon. It is a persistent problem and source of pollution. Nobody is talking of this most polluting thing”..

If vehicular pollution was resolved, it would substantially reduce the impact of other forms of toxicity in the air, the CJI noted.

The problem of vehicular pollution largely pertained to the fuel used in vehicles impacted not only Delhi but also the entire country and even globally, the court said.

“We find that the issue of use of electric vehicles is connected to several other issues which are pending before the court. All of these issues which pertain to the source of power of vehicles, public and private, eventually have a great impact on the environment. Not only the NCR [National Capital Regiob] but whole country... We consider it appropriate that all the issues be considered simultaneously and with the assistance of an authority empowered to take decisions”, the court said posted the case after a month.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/f0ctl1/article30859060.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH19EV-GADKARI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-keen-on-gadkari-explaining-plans-for-vehicles-running-on-electricity-hydrogen/article30859061.ece
81,2020/02/19,Court pulls up CBI for not conducting lie detector test on Asthana,"The next date of hearing has been fixed for February 28.

A special court on February 19 pulled up the Central Bureau of Investigation for not conducting a lie detector or psychological test on its former Special Director Rakesh Asthana in an alleged bribery case.

The court, which had earlier in the day asked the agency to submit the case diary for examination, also enquired about the previous investigating officer, Ajay Kumar Bassi.

The CBI submitted that Mr. Bassi had been transferred to Port Blair, but he was currently in Delhi. He was taken off the case after the then agency chief, Alok Kumar Verma, was shunted out.

Mr. Verma was stripped off his powers days after the case was registered, amid allegations and counter allegations between him and Mr. Asthana.

Also Read Court pulls up CBI for not conducting lie detector test on Asthana

The court also asked if Mr. Asthana was confronted with the other accused; whether his mobile phones and laptops were examined; and if there was any evidence to disprove the complainant’s statement recorded under Section 164 of the Criminal Procedure Code.

Also read | Who is Rakesh Asthana?

The agency submitted that the lie detector test on some accused and witnesses had indicated that they were deceptive.

The next date of hearing has been fixed for February 28, and Mr. Bassi has also been asked to be present to assist in the scrutiny of case diary.

The court also observed that advocate Sunil Mittal, a co-accused in the case, “seems like a fictional character emerging from 'Mission Impossible' and 'James Bond' moviess. Why showing so much indulgence to him?""

On Mr. Mittal's son-in-law Somesh Prasad, who is another accused, the court asked, “why are you showing so much indulgence to someone who isn't cooperating and didn't even share his phone?”

The court is yet to take cognisance of the charge sheet filed by the CBI, giving a clean chit to Mr. Asthana and Deputy Superintendent of Police Devender Kumar who was earlier arrested in the case.

The charge sheet names Manoj Prasad as the accused. He was also arrested by the agency. During the last hearing, the court had reprimanded the agency, wondering why an accused, Mr. Prasad’s brother Somesh Prasad, having a bigger role was roaming free, but it arrested its own official.

The case was registered in October 2018, on a complaint from Hyderabad-based businessman Sana Sathish Babu, against Mr. Asthana, Mr. Kumar, and the Prasad brothers.

Mr. Babu had alleged that he paid over Rs.3 crore to get relief in another case against meat exporter Moin Qureshi and others. In July 2019, the ED arrested Mr. Babu in a money laundering case linked to Mr. Qureshi and filed a charge sheet against him last week.

83,2020/02/19,"Trump ambiguous on trade pact with India now, saving big deal for later","We’re not treated very well by India but I happen to like Prime Minister Modi a lot, says the U.S. President

U.S. President Donald Trump was ambiguous about whether a trade deal with India was imminent and larger trade deal was in the works for later, potentially after the U.S. elections in November. Mr. Trump’s comments come days after U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Robert Lighthizer cancelled a trip to India – as reported in The Hindu – to finalise a mini trade deal which the two countries were hoping to finalise when Mr. Trump visits India on February 24 and 25.

“We can have a trade deal with India but I am saving the big deal for later on. We’re doing a very big trade deal with India…we’ll have it. I don’t know if it’ll be done before the elections but we’ll have a very big deal with India,” Mr. Trump told reporters on Tuesday afternoon at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, before he flew to California.

Watch: Highlights of PM Modi's visit to the U.S.

“We’re not treated very well by India but I happen to like Prime Minister Modi a lot. And he told me we’ll have seven million people between the airport and the event. And the stadium, I understand, is sort of semi under-construction but it’s going to be the largest stadium in the world. So it’s going to be very exciting.” Mr. Trump said, repeating the part about Mr. Modi having told him that seven million people would greet him between the airport and the stadium. Mr. Trump then proceeded to ask several reporters if they were going to India as well.

The U.S. President is due to attend an event, ‘Namaste Trump’, at Motera cricket stadium in Ahmedabad on Monday with around 1,25,000 people attending. Given that the entire population of Ahmedabad was 5.7 million in 2011 as per the census that year, there had been speculation on social media that there was some confusion around the lakhs to millions conversion when Mr. Modi and Mr. Trump spoke recently about the President’s visit. The White House did not respond to a clarification sought by The Hindu last week on the numbers cited by Mr. Trump who had said last week that five to seven million people would line the route from the airport to the stadium.

Downslide in third quarter: USISPF

Meanwhile, the US-India Strategic and Partnership Forum (USISPF) in a report said the latest quarterly data depict continuation of overall positive bilateral trade trends. The third quarter data reflects some downslide in growth rates.

“It may be due to several reasons, including the unexpected economic slowdown in India’s economic growth, impact of US-China trade war, GSP withdrawal from the US side and retaliatory tariffs on specific U.S. goods from the Indian side,” USISPF said.

According to the report, the data available for the first three quarters of 2019 (January-September) pulled the overall growth rate in cumulative bilateral trade down to 4.5 percent from 8.4 percent registered for the first two quarters.

84,2020/02/19,Three Hizbul militants killed in J&K’s Tral,"Police chief says ‘commander’ of the terror group was among those shot dead.

Three militants of the Hizbul Mujahideen were killed in a gunfight at Sherabad in Tral, Pulwama on Wednesday.

Director-General of Police, Jammu and Kashmir, Dilbagh Singh said here that the police, the CRPF and the Army had conducted a joint operation. One of the slain militants had replaced Hammad Khan, who was killed in January, the “commander’ of the terror group here. He identified the militants as Jahangir Ahmad Wani, alias Umer Mukhtar, Raja Umer Maqbool and Sadat Ahmad Thokar.

The police said Wani was behind the arson in a mosque, threats to civilians and attacks on the Army and the police.

A shutdown was observed in Tral and Bijberaha during their funeral processions.

Mr. Singh said 23 militants had been killed this year. Nearly 40 overground workers (those who offer support to the militants) were arrested.

Mr. Singh said security agencies would continue enhanced vigil in the run-up to U.S. President Donald Trump’s visit to India. “Life was normal and shops opened during the two trips of Ambassadors to Jammu and Kashmir. We are hopeful the visit [of Mr. Trump] will be peaceful. On our part, we will continue enhanced security at every place. There are always apprehensions because of the presence of a good number of militants here,” he said.

He said Pakistan was continuing its attempts to misguide the youth. “Pakistan continue to use VPNs [virtual private networks], and even terrorists killed in the Nagrota operation used a VPN to send across pictures from the encounter site. I appeal to the youth to stop falling prey to their machinations,” he said.

He warned the local people against any misuse of VPNs and social media. “We are aware of the loopholes being exploited. We are keeping a watch on VPN use to ensure that it is within tolerable limits. In case of any misuse, the government will be forced to take a decision...”

Mr. Singh said a Pakistan drone flew for 11 to 12 minutes over Border Security Force (BSF) pickets along the International Border in Jammu on Tuesday. “It was fired at and returned,” he said.

Terrorists were waiting in large numbers in the launch pads to cross over, he said. “Launch pads, which used to be empty during winters, remained active this time. They are waiting for opportunities to get in,” he said.

86,2020/02/19,ABVP jumps into fray in Jadavpur varsity students’ union polls,"A new dimension as it puts up candidates for nine out of 12 office-bearers

The Jadavpur University, a hot bed of student politics, is all set for an interesting contest for the students’ union elections as the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (AVBP) — the student wing of the RSS — has fielded candidates for the first time in its history.

Elections to humanities, science and engineering faculties will be held after three years on Wednesday. The AVBP has put up candidates for nine out of 12 office-bearers of the union. So far the contest had been between the SFI and other Left leaning students’ unions but the presence of the AVBP has added new dimensions to the polls.

Sampriti Modak, a third year student of the International Relations is the only woman student supported by the AVBP who is contesting the polls for the post of general secretary of the arts faculty .

“We are contesting because we want the students should have an option to choose,” she said, alleging that the Left union had not even allowed them to campaign. All posters have been torn apart and thrown in the university pond, Ms. Modak said.

The humanities section has the highest number of students — over 4,000 followed by over 2.000 science students and 700 in the engineering faculty. Apart from the office-bearers of the three faculties, the students will elect over 600 class representatives.

Subhayan Achrya Majumdar of the SFI, contesting for the general secretary post of the arts faculty, said the issue this elections is not what is happening on the campus but the overall attack on the educational institutions by fascist forces. Mr. Majumdar said the RSS and other Hindutva outfits had been trying very hard to make a dent in the university politics with outside support.

The SFI has high hopes from the polls as recently the students’ wing of the CPI(M) won the polls at the Presidency University.

Other than the students’ unions like the All India Democratic Socialist Organisation (AIDSO) and the All India Students Association ( AISA), the students’ wing of the ruling Trinamool Congress Chhatra Parishad ( TMCP) is also in the fray.

Riwaz Pradhan, contesting for assistant general secretary with its supported, said it is the Trinamool Congress that can defeat the RSS and the BJP and not the Left parties. Despite the differences among the Left parties, there is also a whisper campaign among the unions that they should not let the AVBP or the TMCP gain from their differences.

Two days before the polls, Vice-Chancellor Suranjan Das issued a statement expressing hope that the tradition of cooperative and constructive harmony would prevail again this year. Professor Das expressed the hope of looking forward to “peaceful and democratic exercise of their franchise by students”.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/abvp-jumps-into-fray-in-jadavpur-varsity-students-union-polls/article30853337.ece

With just 242.25 acres of land under industry in Jammu and Kashmir, the Union Territory administration is wooing investors by opening up a 6,000-acre land bank for setting up multiplexes, processing units, food parks, film production centres, schools, Information Technology parks and medical complexes.

For the first time since 1947, the administration has started a major exercise to convince investors across the country to buy land and invest in the Union Territory.

Interested investors are expected to participate in the ‘J&K Global Investors Summit-2020’, to be held in the capital cities of Srinagar and Jammu in March.

“The summit will prove a determining factor in ushering Jammu and Kashmir into an industrial hub,” Chief Secretary B.V.R. Subrahmanyam said. “It will not only help to present business-friendly policies but also harmonise Jammu and Kashmir’s intrinsic strengths and aspirations of development and employment opportunities,” he added.

To speed up the process for investors during the road shows, scheduled to be held between February 17 and March 9 in Bengaluru, Kolkata, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Chennai and Ahmedabad, he said, “Signing of Memorandum of Understanding with interested investors will also form a part of the road shows and the main summit.”

According to the Department of Industries and Commerce, there were only 439 industrial units in Kashmir valley spread over 115.5 acres and 415 units over 126.75 acres of land in Jammu. “About 1,250 acres of land is being acquired under 18 land acquisition cases to develop industrial estates across J&K,” according to the official document.

In an online campaign, the J&K administration claimed there were 30 cinema screens in the UT and sought to make a case for investment opportunities in multiplexes. The campaign comes even as all 14 cinema halls in the Valley remain shut for more than three decades now.

“Mesmerising scenic locations, J&K is a perfect destination for film tourism, production houses, studios and film city. Invest in the paradise of the earth,” reads the campaign, identifying the famous shrines and mosques like Jamia Masjid and Hazratbal Shrine as being open for shooting.

The J&K administration has centred its campaign to woo investment around six key sectors, including healthcare, tourism, IT, food processing, education and skill development and industries. “More than 40 projects and 14 focus sectors have been identified, which are investor-friendly,” said an official, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Days after Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy sought the Centre's approval to the long-pending demand of Special Category Status to Andhra Pradesh, Government Advisor (Public Affairs) Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy said the Chief Minister wanted to keep the demand alive. The Centre would accord the SCS in the next four to five years as it might need the YSRCP’s support, he said.

The Andhra Pradesh Working Journalists Federation (APWJF) organised a meet the media with Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy here on Wednesday.

Mr. Ramakrsihna Reddy, who is also YSRCP general secretary, said there was no change in the line of thinking of the Central government on the SCS. The 15th Finance Commission (15 FC), in its report, made it clear that SCS was entirely in the domain of the Central government. Also, the sanctity of the promises made in Parliament remained doubtful due to the stance taken by the Centre. Notwithstanding, the State government had been consistently pursuing the issue with the Centre with a hope that it pays heed to the demand.

‘YSRCP will not let down Muslims’

He said the YSRCP had supported the Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB), in Parliament as national security issues were involved in it. The problems relating to the north eastern States and States which have borders with Islamic countries were taken into consideration before extending the support to the CAB, which eventually became a Citizenship Amendment Act. But, later a series of developments took place. The NCR and NPR followed the CAA. The YSRCP would never compromise on the interests of Muslims.

As long as Mr. Jagan was at the helm of affairs, the government would not implement the NCR or NPR. There was no need for the party or the government to proclaim at the top of voice, he said, adding, if required, the Assembly would adopt a resolution opposing the NCR and the NPR.

90,2020/02/19,CM to review progress of Veligonda project,"Drilling of Tunnel-1 has to be expedited to provide water to farmers by kharif

Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy will pay a visit to the Pula Subbaiah Veligonda project in Prakasam district on Thursday with a view to speeding up its execution.

One of the fast-track projects taken up by former Chief Minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy under the Jalayagnam programme in the combined State, the ₹6,491-crore project, designed to bring Krishna water from the Srisailam reservoir through the twin giant tunnels to Prakasam district, has suffered time and cost overruns in view of the enormity of the tunnel drilling work being done underground so as not to disturb the big cats in the Nagarjunasagar Srisailam Tiger Reserve (NSTR).

After an aerial survey of the Nallamala Sagar, the Chief Minister will review the progress of work with the officials and contractors concerned.

The government aims at speeding up the drilling of Tunnel-I as only one-km of the total 18.82-km is left, to ensure water to the farmers during the ensuing kharif season.

At present, the drilling work is progressing at the rate of 4 to 9 metres per day, depending on the rock condition, and the same has to be stepped up to 12 metres per day to meet the deadline of June 2020 set by the government for its completion, official sources have said.

The head regulator works have also suffered delay as the water level continues to be high at the Srisailam reservoir in view of the floods in several spells.

The level has to come down to less than 840 ft at the reservoir for resumption of the head regulator works. Irrigation canal works up to a distance of 750 metres have also to be completed.

Over ₹5,100 crore was spent till end of October 2019.

91,2020/02/19,‘Energy efficiency will boost sustainable development’,"Industrial development can be put on fast track, says BEE director

Director of the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) Sunil Khandare on Wednesday stressed the importance of harnessing technology not only to improve energy performance but also to reduce wasteful consumption in industries and ensure sustainable development.

At the Southern States workshop, organised by the BEE with the support of A.P. State Energy Conservation Mission (APSECM), on ‘Implementation of ISO 50001: 2018 standards in industries’ here on Wednesday, Mr. Khandare said that implementation of ISO 50001:2018 standards in energy-intensive industries would help Andhra Pradesh achieve its energy goals besides putting industrial development and industrial promotion on fast-track mode and reducing depleting energy resources.

The improved energy efficiency could deliver multiple benefits across the industry value chain leading to reduced specific energy consumption, operational and maintenance, enhanced competitiveness and costs of environmental compliance.

As the industrial sector of Andhra Pradesh is a major energy-consuming area with electricity consumption of around 20,026 MU of the total electricity consumption of 59,162 MU in the State as per APERC reports, the implementation of efficient management systems would benefit the industrial sector and the State as well, Mr. Khandare said.

A.P. State Energy Conservation Mission CEO A. Chandrasekhar Reddy, reading out the message of Energy Secretary Srikant Nagulapalli, said that the government was giving top priority to providing cost-effective, 24x7 quality power which is vital for industrial development.

Major savings

“The power utilities have already saved ₹500 crore in power purchases and around ₹180 crore in coal supply tenders. The State has achieved around 0.20 Million ton of oil equivalent (Mtoe) energy savings, worth around ₹150 crore in cost savings, under the Perform, Achieve and Trade (PAT) scheme.

Mr. Reddy appealed to the BEE to support the State in implementation of energy efficiency as the State had identified a potential to save around 14,494 MU (1,656 MW) by implementing energy efficiency measures.

92,2020/02/19,‘Naidu bus yatra a diversionary tactic’,"Jagan putting State back on track, says Lakshmi Parvathi

Telugu Academy Chairperson N. Lakshmi Parvathi on Wednesday alleged that Telugu Desam Party (TDP) president N. Chandrababu Naidu’s ‘bus yatra’ was to divert people’s attention from cases booked against him. She termed the yatra ‘a damp squib.’

At a press conference, Ms. Lakshmi Parvathi said while Mr. Naidu, along with his son Lokesh indulged in irregularities, Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy was doing all he could for the welfare of people through various schemes.

The Naidu government that had left the State in debts. In contrast, Mr. Jagan had created 4 lakh jobs by setting up village and ward secretariats.

‘Farmers are happy’

She said the TDP had not given unemployment dole for even one complete year and said there was no truth in Mr. Naidu’s claims that 340 farmers had committed suicide since the YSR Congress Party came to power. In fact, farmers, especially in Rayalaseema, were happy today as they had adequate water to irrigate their fields and received support price for their crops.

Ms. Lakshmi Parvathi lashed out at the Opposition leaders for ignoring the development happening in all sectors.

She said radical changes were ushered in the education and health sectors and to provide nutritious food to children, schemes such as ‘Goru Mudda’ were launched.

94,2020/02/19,Police arrest accomplice of fake certificate kingpin,"Glenn Bricks divulges key information regarding some senior police officers close to him

The Anantapur police on Wednesday arrested yet another accomplice of fake certificate racket kingpin Glenn Bricks and recovered seven fake certificates.

Pamidi Town police inspector Srinivasulu told The Hindu that 35-year-old Nettam Dhanunjaya Naidu, a real estate agent and agriculturist from Vidapanakal in Anantapur district, was arrested while trying to hand over the fake certificates to a man named Gautam.

On interrogation, it was revealed that Gautam had paid ₹50,000 to Dhananunjaya after being approached by Glenn Bricks (51) and an accomplice, who is absconding, for providing him engineering degree certificates. Dhanunjaya, Bricks and the other associate had allegedly planned to share the money after giving Gautam the fake certificates.

Meanwhile, an investigation into the activities of the fake certificate gang by Anantapur police has thrown up several startling revelations, with key accused Bricks, hailing from Guntakal, revealing the names of several senior police officers who have benefited from his racket and have even allegedly managed to get desired postings and transfers.

Police are still in the process of ascertaining the repercussions of the fake certificates supplied by Bricks, and the extent of his dealings in the State.

Sources said that Bricks, who was arrested on February 1 and remanded to judicial custody, has divulged key information regarding some Assistant Sub-Inspectors (ASIs) and Sub-Inspectors (SIs) who have taken fake certificates from him and even some DSP-rank officers who are reportedly close to him.

Sources said that it would be difficult to trace all those who have procured fake certificates from Bricks, who has allegedly been running the racket for over two decades. An internal inquiry has reportedly been launched to verify if any police officials have been in cahoots with Bricks, who along with his driver Panchanam Madan (26) is wanted in several cases in both Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.

Telugu Desam Party president and Leader of the Opposition N. Chandrababu Naidu has been provided security with 183 police personnel in both Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, said Home Minister Mekathoti Sucharitha.

“The government is providing Z-Plus category security to Mr. Naidu and there is no change in it,” Ms. Sucharitha told mediapersons on Wednesday.

Security has been provided to the Leader of the Opposition as per the recommendations of the Security Review Committee (SRC) and changes, if any, would be made as per the committee’s decision.

In all, 135 police personnel including Central, State Intelligence and the Law and Order police of the rank of Additional Superintendent of Police (ASP), Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), Circle Inspector (CI), SI and other officers were giving round-the-clock protection to Mr. Naidu in Andhra Pradesh.

Forty-eight police officers were deputed for providing security to the TDP president in Hyderabad, the Home Minister said.

96,2020/02/19,"People repenting for giving one chance to YSRCP, says Naidu","‘Govt.’s anti-people policies have hit development hard’

TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu has exhorted people to rally behind the party and agitate against the “anti-people” government being headed by the YSRCP as the State’s future is at stake.

“People now repent for giving one chance to Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy (to don the mantle) as it has proved to be detrimental to the State,” Mr. Naidu said while addressing a series of meetings in the Assembly constituencies of Parchur, Addanki, S.N. Padu and Ongole on Wednesday during the Praja Chaitanya Yatra.

Likening the YSRCP rule to the one led by Muhammad bin Tughlaq, who had changed the capital from Delhi to Daulatabad and back, Mr. Naidu said development had come to a standstill due to the “wrong policies” of the YSRCP government.

“The government is putting several restrictions to deny the poor the benefits of welfare schemes such as ration cards, pension and house sites. It has also scrapped the schemes launched by the TDP government without rhyme or reason,” Mr. Naidu alleged.

‘YSR example’

Mr. Naidu wanted Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy to take a cue from his father and former Chief Minister of the combined State Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy, who, after succeeding him, had continued the TDP’s programmes for the development of Hyderabad.

Exhorting the people to back the agitation being staged by the farmers against the YSRCP government’s move to “kill the Amaravati project,” Mr. Naidu said all the political parties, including the YSRCP, had backed his government’s decision to locate capital in Amaravati.

He accused the government of “misusing the police to foist cases on the TDP cadre under various legal provisions such as the SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act.

Referring to the downsizing of security to him, Mr. Naidu dared the government to withdraw security cover to him.

“My political career is an open book. I have not amassed any ill-gotten wealth for my family members,” he asserted, adding that the probes launched against him failed to prove any of the charges levelled against him.

Quota for youth

The big-ticket projects such as the sea port at Ramayapatnam and paper mill initiated during the TDP term had not made any progress, Mr. Naidu said, adding 75% reservation for the local people in industrial units served no purpose as the captains of industry shied away from the State. The quota rule also proved detrimental to the unemployed youth, who had been migrating to other States for jobs, he observed.

Gearing up the party workers for the ensuing local body elections, he wanted them to capture on their mobile phones incidents, if any, of inducements offered by candidates of other parties.

The former Chief Minister, who was accompanied by, among others, former Minister Sidda Raghava Rao and TDP MLAs Y. Sambasiva Rao, Karanam Balarama Krishnamurthy and G. Ravikumar, received a rousing reception from the cadre as he launched the State-wide tour from Bopudi in Prakasam district after offering prayers at the famous Hanuman temple in the village.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/wwq8gf/article30864075.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20VJPG4-NAIDU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/people-repenting-for-giving-one-chance-to-ysrcp-says-naidu/article30864076.ece

The DSPs were told to identify the areas where people were in need of help and development was not up to the mark, for adoption by the police as part of social responsibility.

Belt shops

The SP directed the officials to keep an eye on belt shops and illegal transportation of sand from riverbeds round the clock.

The Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (APSRTC) has launched ‘Chalo travel cards’ and ‘Chalo free mobile App’ for passengers in Vijayawada city. The App and the mobile ticket facility have been launched on a pilot basis in about 450 city buses.

APSRTC Vice-Chairman and Managing Director (VC&MD) Madireddy Pratap and Mumbai-based Zophop Technologies Private Limited Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Vinayak Bhavnani launched the App here on Wednesday.

“The free mobile App launched on the brand name ‘Chalo’ will benefit about 2.5 lakh passengers and enable the commuters to track the live GPS position of their bus, provides one-day bus pass on mobile phone, travel safely with emergency SOS and plan their trip,” Mr. Pratap said.

Agreement

Mr. Vinayak said the start-up company entered into a tie-up with the APSRTC for launching ‘Chalo travel card’, a pre-paid smart card to buy tickets. Cards can be procured from the conductors and recharged in any city bus. Smart cards are offered free with a first recharge of ₹100 (with equal travel expense), and subsequent recharges can be done from ₹10 to ₹3,000. Cards can also be used for ‘Travel as you like’ bus pass for a day, the CTO said.

The mere mention of Srikalahasti brings to one’s mind the imposing shrine of Lord Srikalahastheeswara located on the banks of River Swarnamukhi. There is indeed another ancient, historically-significant and mythologically-revered temple that is away from limelight and hence out of public gaze.

The little-known temple of Sri Ardhanareeswara Swamy, located 5 km from the main temple on the outskirts of Srikalahasti town, is one of the 21 temples affiliated to Srikalahastheeswara Swamy Devasthanam. The ‘Linga’ at the sanctum sanctorum is believed to be ‘swayambhu’ (self-manifested).

“The philosophy of Ardhanareeswara is reflective of today’s gender equality, where the Lord and Goddess share the same body and soul. This Linga is represented by Shiva on the front side and the Goddess on its backside, which is made visible to the devotees through a mirror placed on the rear portion of the sanctum sanctorum,” says M. Deenadayal, working as an academic consultant in the History department of Sri Venkateswara University.

His article on the temple was prominently carried in the proceedings of the 42nd session of Andhra Pradesh History Congress held at Narsapur in 2018. “According to Puranas, the temple dates back to the period of Markandeya, but the shrine, as per history, could be around 1000 years old,” Dr. Deenadayal told The Hindu.

There is a slit in the temple’s wall, from which the sun’s rays fall on the goddess (rear portion of Linga) during sunrise and the rays fall on Shiva through the main entrance of the west-facing shrine during sunset.

“This is believed to be a form of the Sun God paying obeisance to the divine couple”, explains the lone priest Kanipaka Lokeswara Swamy. Of the 21 ‘Theerthas’ in Srikalahasti, this shrine is known as ‘Viroopaksha Theertham’ since ages.

For reasons not known, the temple has not grabbed the attention and fame it deserves. Situated a little away from the bridge on Srikalahasti-Naidupet highway, the area situated in the midst of a shrub jungle appears desolate. The priest leaves the snakes-infested place around 5.30 pm everyday and returns only by morning.

Aparna, a 19-year-old died at the Government General Hospital (GGH) here on Tuesday night hours after delivering a baby. Her family members are sitting on a dharna in front of the hospital alleging doctors’ negligence.

Doctor denies allegations

A resident of Nayanapalli in Narpala mandal of Anantapur district, Aparna got admitted to the GGH at 4.30 p.m. after getting checked regularly at a private hospital during her first pregnancy. She was immediately taken to the labour room where she delivered a baby. But the amniotic fluid reportedly did not get expelled. The Resident Medical Officer (RMO) Lalitha told The Hindu that the allegations that doctors did not attend to the patient or other amenities were not available, were totally false.

“The placenta was expelled by taking her to the operating table as per normal procedure and she was doing fine with all vitals normal till 7.10 p.m. when she developed Pulmonary embolism, a blockage in one of the pulmonary arteries in the lungs,” Dr. Lalitha explained.

“In some rare cases this happens, though the mother did not have heavy bleeding. She even took the baby kit given by the government, and was looking forward to have a look at her newborn baby,” the RMO added.

The baby was shifted to the Special Care Unit as it was weighing just 1.8 kg.

Ms. No. 13 shifting the offices of the Commissionerate of Vigilance and Enforcement and the Chairman of Commissionerates of Enquiries from the Government Interim Complex at Velagapudi to Kurnool.

The land owners filed a petition on February 3, challenging the G.O. and urging the court to quash the orders.

Ms. Justice Maheswari heard the arguments put forth by the petitioners represented by advocate Karumanchi Anil and Advocate General S. Subramaniyam.

While the petitioners argued that the G.O. was issued with mala fide intentions and without following proper administrative procedure, the Advocate General said that shifting of offices was necessitated due to shortage of space in the Government Interim Complex.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/hc-reserves-interim-orders-on-move-to-shift-offices/article30857099.ece

Speaking to newsmen on Tuesday, Mr. Ravindra said: “The population of the Backward Classes in the State is above 50%. The State needs to observe the quota being provided to BCs in the local bodies in other States.”

107,2020/02/19,Siva linga discovered atop hillock at A.P. temple,"It was believed to have been formed during Neolithic age

An 18-foot Siva linga has been discovered by a freelance archaeologist at the Bhairaveswara Swamy Temple atop the Mopuru hillock, in Vemula mandal of A.P.’s YSR Kadapa district.

The linga was believed to have been naturally formed (‘swayambhu’) during the Neolithic age dated back to 3,000 - 2,800 B.C.

The sighting of the Siva linga on the banks of the Mogameru rivulet, close on the heels of the discovery of stone implements such as axes and other tools used by the Megalithic civilisation by the Archaeology Department, has created further interest.

“The discovery of the Siva linga has thrown light on the religious practices of Neolithic civilisations during which people used to worship idols of Gods and Goddesses in standing posture. Earlier, Megalithic burial sites have also been found on the river bank,” says freelance archaeologist Kadiyala Venkateswara Rao.

Mr. Rao, who retired as deputy director in the Sports Authority of Andhra Pradesh (SAAP), has discovered rock menhirs at Karempudi village in Guntur district which revealed the religious practices of megalithic civilisation.

114,2020/02/19,Former chairman of cooperative bank arrested for gold loan fraud,"Accused cheated the bank of ₹1.20 crore using fake jewellery as mortgage, police said

The Chittoor Urban police on Tuesday arrested P. Shanmugam (54), the former chairman of Chittoor Cooperative Town Bank, on charges of cheating the bank to the tune of ₹1.2 crore by availing gold loans and using artificial jewellery as mortgage.

The accused is a senior leader of the opposition Telugu Desam Party, representing the Backward Classes wing, who worked in the nominated post of the bank till the party lost power in the Assembly elections last year.

Addressing a press meet here, Deputy SP (Chittoor) Eeshwar Reddy said that on February 13, bank officials approached the I-Town police with a complaint that Shanmugam had resorted to fraud during his tenure with the help of gold appraiser Dharani Sagar. The duo had allegedly committed the fraud with 43 accounts of 15 persons, who are either their relatives or friends.

Mr. Reddy said that the cheating was detected while the manager was handing over charge to his successor, followed by verification and reappraisal of properties mortgaged for gold loan accounts.

When the bank authorities had contacted Shanmugam, he had reportedly turned hostile at them. The deputy SP said that acting on a complaint lodged by the bank officials, a special team was formed to search for Shanmugam. On Tuesday, he was arrested at Reddigunta checkpost on outskirts of Chittoor.

During interrogation, it was revealed that Shanmugam had used the loan money to purchase a car for his first wife, and land for his second wife and her daughter, besides giving a share to the appraiser.

The police officer said that a search is on for Dharani Sagar, who is absconding. The fake gold used by the duo was seized.

It was further ascertained in the course of the investigation that as many as 14 cases were booked against Shanmugam between 2011 and 2020 at various police stations in Chittoor district, including those under Section 420 and for cheque bounce, police said.

The police officer added that Shanmugam was also reportedly involved in collecting huge amounts from unemployed youth on the pretext of getting them jobs. The accused was later produced before Chittoor court and was remanded.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/former-chairman-of-cooperative-bank-arrested-for-gold-loan-fraud/article30855064.ece
115,2020/02/19,Two women with COVID-19 symptoms admitted to KGH,"Both of them recently returned from China, doctors said

Two suspected cases of COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease-2019) were isolated at the Government Hospital for Chest and Communicable Diseases (GHCCD) here in the last two days.

Both are young women who have recently returned from China, said doctors. One of them is a medical student studying in the Chinese city of Kunming while the second woman works in China as a house surgeon.

“Both were healthy when they arrived in the city. They developed symptoms like cough and fever subsequently and reported at the hospital as a precaution. Their symptoms subsided with drugs but we did not want to take any chances and sent their blood samples to the Virology Lab in Hyderabad for confirmation,” Dr. K. Rambabu, State Nodal Officer for COVID-19, told The Hindu on Tuesday.

“The first girl, who is 18 years old, is studying MBBS 1st year at Kunming city, 1,560 km away from Wuhan. She travelled from Kunming to Bangkok and from there flew to Kolkata, and came by train to Visakhapatnam on February 13. She exhibited no symptoms at the time of arriving in the city. She subsequently developed diarrhoea and later fever and dry cough and came to the hospital. Her X-ray report was normal and other symptoms subsided with the administration of drugs,” Dr. Rambabu said.

“In the second case, a 22-year-old house surgeon from Nanjing, about 535 km from Wuhan city, arrived in Visakhapatnam on February 8. She flew from Nanjing to Visakhapatnam via Bangkok and Malaysia. She showed no symptoms upon arriving in Visakhapatnam. Later, she developed a fever and reported at GHCCD today. Her X-ray report too is normal and she has no other symptoms. Her blood samples were sent to Hyderabad for testing,” Dr. Rambabu said.

Doctors expect a negative report in both cases and say there is no room for panic. The lab reports are expected in a day or two.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/two-women-with-covid-19-symptoms-admitted-to-kgh/article30855040.ece

117,2020/02/19,Upset IIPE students stage protest as campus placements fail to come by,"Only five chemical engineering students recruited by HPCL and one by Infosys; the remaining 86 students stare at uncertain future

Students at the prestigious Indian Institute of Petroleum and Energy (IIPE) are a worried lot after only two recruiters turned up for campus selections, and hiring only six students out of a batch of 92 students.

The first batch of B.Tech students at IIPE will graduate from the institute in May this year, and the students are up in arms against the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas and are planning to stage a silent protest on the campus as placements have been far from satisfactory.

IIPE, nominated as an Institute of National Importance and ranked on par with IITs and IIMs, was started with much fanfare on the Andhra University campus in 2016.

Promises not kept

Students say that the institute, which is promoted by the Ministry, and has major oil and natural gas PSUs as its stakeholders, has fallen short of its promise made to students during its inception.

The institute was launched by Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, who had promised 100% placements to students and had even gone to the extent of stating that students would be given offer letters along with their degree certificates.

Mr. Pradhan had made this statement in the presence of Vice-President M. Venkaiah Naidu and former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu, students said.

So far, HPCL has recruited only five students from the chemical engineering stream, while Infosys, from the non-core sector, has recruited one student.

In 2016, IIPE was started with two main streams of B.Tech (Petroleum) and B.Tech (Chemical), and 46 students were admitted into each stream, based on IIT/JEE (Advance) ranks.

“Almost all IITs and other major petroleum institutes such as Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Petroleum Technology in Jais, Uttar Pradesh, and Indian Institute of Technology (Indian School of Mines), Dhanbad, have completed their recruitment formalities by December 2019, and the companies are yet to come to our institute,” the students lamented.

‘Institute not to be blamed’

The 92 students of the first batch were joined by 300 students from the first, second and third year in the silent protest. The students said that the director of the institute and his team have done their best to invite top companies from the oil sector, but the companies did not turn up.

They blame the Ministry for not taking the initiative. “If the Ministry desires, it can ask PSUs and private sector companies to visit our campus and fulfil its promise. We will continue our protest till we get an assurance from the Ministry,” they said.

According to Prof. V.S.R.K. Prasad, Director of IIPE, the institute is trying its best to bring companies to the campus. Public sector majors like Gas Authority of India Limited (GAIL) and Oil India Limited (OIL), are likely to come. “But we need more companies to come for campus placements and have asked the students to be patient, as the Ministry has promised to do something. We have also prepared an action plan to address the issue on a war-footing,” Prof. Prasad said.

Budget allocations

IIPE was initiated by the MoPNG in 2016 and began functioning from a temporary campus at Andhra University College of Engineering. The Ministry had provided a capital budget of ₹650 crore, with the major oil PSUs chipping in with another ₹200 crore as an endowment fund, which is matched by the Ministry with another ₹200 crore, taking the total allotment to about ₹1,050 crore.

The Central Government has so far allotted ₹94 crore in the last three budgets, including ₹32 crore in the latest budget.

In April 2017, it was accorded the status of Institute of National Importance on par with IITs and IIMs.

The State government had allotted 200 acres of land for a permanent campus at Vangali village in Sabbavaram in Visakhapatnam, the construction of which is yet to begin.

The campus has been designed by ace architect Hafeez Contractor and the conceptual plan is yet to be finalised by the CPWD. “We expect the plans to be approved shortly and the construction is set to begin in July or August this year,” said Prof. Prasad.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/b3tln/article30854972.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19-VJ-STUDENTSPROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/upset-iipe-students-stage-protest-as-campus-placements-fail-to-come-by/article30854973.ece

120,2020/02/19,Downsizing of Naidu’s security decried,"Restore it to its original level, demands Telugu Desam

The TDP has decried the State government’s decision to scale down the security cover to party national president and former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu.

The TDP has demanded that the government restore the security cover to its original level.

TDP State president Kimidi Kala Venkata Rao, in a statement on Tuesday, said that Mr. Naidu faced severe threat from “extremists, terrorists, fundamentalists, red sander smugglers, anti-social elements and political opponents.”

“In view of the threat, Mr. Naidu is being provided ‘Z plus’ category security with NSG mobile cover till date. The government, however, has unilaterally and arbitrarily decided to reduce the security cover to him. The strength of the security personnel has been drastically brought down by about 50%, from 146 to 67,” Mr. Venkata Rao said.

He further said that the security of Lokesh, former Minister and son of Mr. Naidu, too was downgraded to ‘X’ from ‘Z’ scale though he too faced threat from extremists.

“The reduction of security is purely politically motivated and does not have any merit,” he said.

“The TDP strongly condemns the politically motivated decision of the Security Review Committee (SRC) and demands restoration of security to its original level,” Mr. Venkata Rao said.

“The YSRCP government will be held responsible should anything happen to the above leaders due to reduction in security cover for them,” he added.

The State government had earlier made a similar attempt. Initially, security to Mr. Naidu’s family members had been withdrawn. In June last year, Mr. Naidu’s security was downsized. Later, the High Court ordered the government to provide full security cover while disposing of a petition filed by Mr. Naidu.

Mr. Naidu had escaped an attempt on his life by the Maoists in Tirupati in 2003 when he was the Chief Minister of undivided Andhra Pradesh.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/downsizing-of-naidus-security-decried/article30854729.ece
121,2020/02/19,‘Vexatious land disputes will soon be a thing of the past’,"Revenue Minister sets the ball rolling for comprehensive survey in State

Deputy Chief Minister and Minister for Revenue Pilli Subhash Chandra Bose on Tuesday inaugurated the Continuously Operating Reference Stations (CORS) Network System sub-station at the tahsildar’s office in Jaggaiahpeta in Krishna district established as part of the pilot project for the State-wide comprehensive land survey aimed at streamlining land records.

Mr. Bose along with Minister for Transport, I&PR Perni Venkataramaiah and others launched the pilot project under which the land in 25 mandals of Jaggaiahpeta would be resurveyed using CORS sub-station in a span of 90 days.

Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Bose said the first land survey took place between 1860 and 1930 and due to lack of streamlining, land disputes had become a major cause for concern and the same is reflected in the huge number of pending cases with courts and grievances submitted at the Spandana programme.

The comprehensive resurvey of land would put an end to all disputes and it would take about two years for completion of resurvey of the 3.31 crore acres of land, excluding roads, forest area and water bodies out of total 3.69 crore acres of land in the State, he said.

Mr. Bose said farmers who got entangled in land disputes for years would be relieved of the mental stress once the resurvey is completed and it would be completed in time with the help of advanced technology.

Mr. Venkataramaiah said the resurvey would help farmers in all aspects related to land ownership as proper land records would be established after the survey.

Government Whip and Jaggaiahpeta MLA Samineni Udayabhanu said that the survey of 66,761 acres of land in 25 villages of the Jaggaiahpeta mandal would be completed in three months and 22 surveyors were appointed to carry out the job. He said the new survey method gives no scope for tampering of any record.

CORS technology

Survey and Land Records director S. Prabhakar Reddy said that the CORS technology helped in conducting the survey in a short span of time and also the mistakes of the surveyors could be identified.

He said the resurvey was being carried out for the first time in 120 years in the State.

122,2020/02/19,‘JC’s cement company mined limestone in violation of rules’,"Pedda Reddy seeks action against Mining Department officials too

Trishul Cements Industries India Limited, which is owned by J.C. Pavan Reddy, son of former MP Diwakar Reddy, has mined 11.20 lakh tonnes of limestone from 1,600 acres at Konuppalapadu of Yadiki mandal in the district allegedly without permission or paying royalty fee, according to Tadipatri MLA Kethireddy Pedda Reddy.

Addressing the media here on Tuesday, Mr. Pedda Reddy said, “The company was set up by the family members of Mr. Diwakar Reddy allegedly by acquiring mining lease through benami names. The company did not have the permit to mine limestone for supply to other cement factories. It was supposed to set up a unit on the leased land and use mined mineral for production of cement.”

‘Survey findings’

“The company mined 1.38 lakh tonnes by paying royalty and taking permission from the Mining Department. It, however, illegally mined 11.20 lakh tonnes, which came to light after a resident of Tadipatri, V. Murali Prasad Reddy, commissioned a survey of the area through a private agency and got the Google Earth Maps of the area before and after the mining took place,” said Mr. Pedda Reddy.

“A case is pending in the court seeking that a criminal case be filed against the family members of Mr. Diwakar Reddy for taking over the company through benami names,” he said, and added that Mr. Murali Prasad Reddy, who was also present, would submit the survey records and maps to the court to justify his claim that illegal mining had been done in the area.

The State government had cancelled the mining lease last month, but the entire issue needed to be probed minutely, said Mr. Pedda Reddy, and sought action against the officials of the Mining Department who had given permission for mining when it was not allowed as per the MoU signed at the time of leasing out the land, the MLA said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/t9unup/article30857549.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19-VJ-ANANTAPURMLA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/jcs-cement-company-mined-limestone-in-violation-of-rules/article30854676.ece
123,2020/02/19,Centre’s thrust on rural development tops BJP agenda for local body polls,"Both YSRCP and TDP have lost people’s confidence, says Purandeswari

Ruling out any alliance with the the YSRCP or the TDP in the State, BJP women’s wing national in-charge D. Purandeswari on Tuesday said her party would fight the ensuing local body elections in alliance with Pawan Kalyan’s JSP.

Addressing the media here, Ms. Purandeswari said the BJP, along with the JSP, would fight the Zilla Parishad elections by highlighting the rural development agenda of the Union government.

The YSRCP and the TDP had lost the people’s faith, she opined.

The BJP would focus on strengthening the party at the grass-roots level to emerge as an alternative to the YSRCP and the TDP, said Ms. Purandeswari, who was here as part of a tour of five Lok Sabha constituencies of Ongole, Nellore, Tirupati, Chittoor and Rajampeta to identify the seats the party could contest in the local body elections and shortlist the candidates.

‘Politics of revenge’

Development had come to a standstill under the YSRCP rule as it adopted “politics of revenge.”

The YSRCP was preoccupied on the reversing the policy decisions of the previous government, ignoring the overall interests of the State, she observed.

Maintaining that the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) was not “discriminatory” against the minorities, Ms. Purandeswari said she was perplexed how the YSRCP, which had supported the relevant Bill in Parliament, could oppose it now.

Referring to the three capitals, she said the government’s decision hit hard the realty sector. This apart, industrialists too were moving out of the State.

“Where is the need to abolish the Legislative council?” she asked, adding that the ruling YSRCP had not sought the people’s mandate in this regard.

“The YSRCP has miserably failed to perform in the last eight months. It has pushed the State into a debt trap, and is clueless on mobilising funds for the large number of welfare schemes,” she said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/vfjs72/article30854653.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19VJPG4-BJP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/centres-thrust-on-rural-development-tops-bjp-agenda-for-local-body-polls/article30854654.ece
124,2020/02/19,Another SSLC preparatory exam question paper leaked,"With the question paper of the preparatory examination for Class 10 students being leaked the second day in a row on Wednesday, parents, students and principals have expressed concern about the final board examination scheduled to be held from March 27.

The question paper of the second language English paper was allegedly made available on social messaging platforms early Wednesday morning, two hours before the examination was to begin. On Tuesday, the mathematics paper was shared on social media just as the examination began.

However, the Karnataka Secondary Education Examination Board (KSEEB) said that there is no connection between the preparatory examination and the final board examination. While the board had provided question papers for 12,536 schools for the preparatory examination, the Headmasters’ Association had set question papers for 2,153 schools.

V. Sumangala, director, KSEEB said the preparatory examination had no connection with the main one. “The modalities of how the examination is conducted are different. The question papers are not sent to so many schools. For the board examination, we have stringent security measures in place,” she said. The preparatory examinations began on Monday and students have to appear for three more.

D. Shashi Kumar, General Secretary, Associated Management of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka, said this was a matter of concern as the students were relying on question papers as preparations for the exam. “Many coaching classes are in fact promising students that they will get question papers of the final examination as well. The morale of students who have prepared well is low. The board should take serious precautionary measures and ensure that none of the board examination papers are leaked,” he said.

The board is however collecting details of where these question papers were leaked so that a vigil can be kept in these places for the final examination. On Tuesday, the KSEEB had lodged a complaint at the jurisdictional police station about the leak.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/nfqiql/article30867239.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19Bg-Examcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/another-sslc-preparatory-exam-question-paper-leaked/article30864370.ece
125,2020/02/19,Mangaluru anti-CAA protest: Bommai sees ‘larger conspiracy’,"‘Threats calls for Chief Minister had come on my phone’

Terming the violence in Mangaluru during an anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) protest, which resulted in the death of two persons in police firing, a “larger conspiracy”, Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai on Wednesday said support to organisations behind the violence had “international ramifications” and that threat calls for Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa had come to the Home Minister’s phone.

‘Finance from outside’

“It is not restricted to one State. It is felt in Uttar Pradesh and Kerala, among others. Kerala Chief Minister has aired his concern already. If we support them, everyone has to pay the price tomorrow,” Mr. Bommai told the Legislative Assembly.

“They are getting finances from outside and we have information on this,” he said, without referring to any specific organisation. “Action will be taken against organisations that are supporting rioters.” Earlier, Opposition leaders urged the government to take legal action against organisations such as PFI and SDPI if they were found to be violating laws.

“I have received threat calls from abroad. Threats were made to the Chief Minister on my phone. Our legislators and members of Parliament have also received threat calls after the incident. Calls have been traced to Saudi Arabia and Dubai. The qazi of Kasaragod, who successfully prevented a protest by convincing a organisation, also received threatening calls,” Mr. Bommai said.

Mr. Bommai was replying to a discussion on post-CAA developments in the State, including Mangaluru violence and a series of sedition cases, moved by the Opposition.

“I have concern and I have shared some information that we have received with [the former Minister] U.T. Khader. I have advised him to be careful,” he said, while pointing at the attack on Congress legislator from Narasimharaja constituency Tanveer Sait recently.

‘Motivated crowd’

He termed those who indulged in violence in Mangaluru on December 19 as “motivated crowd”, and added that they were prepared to do “whatever possible” on that day. “Only those motivated to create trouble were in the protest. We have information about a PFI office-bearer who had not only incited the crowd but had also urged people from West Bengal and Bihar to come and participate in the protest rally,” Mr. Bommai said.

Defending the police move to impose prohibitory orders on the eve of December 19, 2019, he said we have to leave certain discretion to officers on the ground.

“Firing was resorted to after all other options of convincing people to disperse — lathi-charge, bursting tear gas, firing rubber bullets, and firing in the air — were exhausted. Motivated crowd swelled by afternoon and started attacking police stations. Police firing became a necessity to prevent arms and ammunitions falling into their hands,” he justified, and added that the government was also unhappy about the firing incident.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/snn4xj/article30864244.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19BGBOMMAI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mangaluru-anti-caa-protest-bommai-sees-larger-conspiracy/article30864245.ece

When the discussion on anti-CAA protest deviated after former Minister U.T. Khader made a remark on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Pakistan, Mr. Ravi said: “We will cut... we will cut the tails of those who support anti-national moves.” Taking exception to this, former Minister H.K. Patil suggested that these words would lower the dignity of the House. “If someone needs to be punished, there is a law. As a Minister, he should not instil fear. Please ask him to take it back,” he said.

Meanwhile, a remark by Mr. Khader on Mr. Modi’s visit to Pakistan led to a slugfest between the ruling and Opposition members, forcing Mr. Khader to tender an apology. Senior Congress members, including former Speaker K.R. Ramesh Kumar, R.V. Deshpande and H.K. Patil, acknowledged that such remarks on the Prime Minister lowers the dignity of the House and should be avoided. Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, who maintained silence during the heated discussion on CAA protests, rose to seek apology from Mr. Khader. “We have no issue in members raising Mr. Modi’s visit to Pakistan.

130,2020/02/19,Mangaluru violence: Karnataka to appeal against bail for accused,"Home Minister has tough time convincing Opposition about existence of evidence

The State government said on Wednesday that it would appeal against the High Court order granting bail to 21 people accused of inciting violence in Mangaluru during an anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) protest on December 19.

Amid suspicion raised by the Opposition in the Legislative Assembly about the existence of evidence against the accused, Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai had a tough time convincing them that the evidence to prove the participation of these people in the riots would be provided during the trial stage. “The government is ready for the legal battle. It is a matter of right to go to appellate court and we will exercise the right,” he said.

“We will provide evidence during the trial and we will put all efforts to convince the judge,” Mr. Bommai replied when Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah sought to know if all the evidences against the accused were given. “So far, you have no evidence to prove that these people were at the spot,” the former Chief Minister said. He also accused the police of excesses by implicating innocent people to cover up their failure.

Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah speaking in the Assembly in Bengaluru on Wednesday.

When Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister J.C. Madhuswamy cited earlier Supreme Court directions on bail orders and said: “It is not final”, the former Chief Minister asked why it was not brought to the notice of the High Court here.

Mr. Bommai said: “That [bail] does not take away the fact that there is a person hitting the CCTV camera with stick. Can you deny stone pelting or road being blocked? We will produce evidence during the trial.”

No judicial probe

Refusing to yield to the demand of the Opposition to institute a judicial inquiry headed by a High Court judge, Mr. Bommai said the government had followed procedures laid down by the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) in cases of death in police action. He said the inquiry by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) and the magistrate were in accordance with the procedure laid down by the NHRC.

Earlier in the day, the Legislative Assembly saw heated exchange of words between the ruling and the Opposition members as the House plunged into pandemonium nearly half a dozen times during a debate on the law and order situation.

Mr. Siddaramaiah referred to the High Court’s observation that the process adopted for imposing prohibitory orders in Bengaluru during the anti-CAA protests was not proper. He also quoted the High Court’s observation while granting bail to the 21 accused in Mangaluru violence that the State government had not provided any evidence to prove that the protesters had come fully armed to disrupt peace.

Quoting the court’s observation, Mr. Siddaramaiah described the Mangaluru violence as well as police firing as a “government-sponsored action which was pre-planned by the police.”

This irked Mr. Madhuswamy and Mr. Bommai who argued that it was not proper to quote partially from the court’s preliminary observation as the final verdict was yet to be pronounced by the court.

Mr. Madhuswamy even argued that it would be sub judice to debate the issue. Taking exception to this, Mr. Siddaramaiah wondered if the Opposition should keep quiet when the government was “foisting false cases against innocent persons”.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/9658z/article30864008.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19BGMADHUSWAMY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mangaluru-violence-state-to-appeal-against-bail-for-accused/article30864012.ece
131,2020/02/19,NSL Sugars fails to renew agreement for water use,"Factory owes ₹ 1.11 crore for drawing water from Amarja for three years

The Water Resources Department has written to Additional Chief Electrical Inspector urging him to cut power supply to NSL Sugars at Bhusnoor village in Aland taluk in Kalaburagi for drawing water from Amarja reservoir illegally.

The Water Resource Department had given approval to the factory to draw 4,000 KLPD (51.55 mcft) water from Amarja reservoir for five years (September 17, 2012 to September 16, 2017). Now, though the contract has expired, the plant was drawing water without renewing its contract agreement. Karnataka Neeravari Nigam Limited has urged the factory to renew the agreement from September 17, 2017 to September 16, 2022 for utilising the Amarja water.

A farmer, Jagadish Patil, said that the factory was drawing water from the Amarja irrigation canals and was also buying water from farmers. Besides this, the factory had drilled borewells within its premises without permission, he added. According to Mr. Patil, the plant did not have rainwater harvesting facility, and it was extracting more than 4,000 kilolitres of water per day. A huge amount of water from the Amarja reservoir and groundwater were being extracted without any regulations, he added.

Despite the conditions that the factory should stop drawing water from the reservoir in summer — between February and June, NSL Sugars had overexploited groundwater resources by drawing water even during the restricted period.

On January 13, 2020, Executive Engineer of Karnataka Neeravari Nigam Limited, Kalaburagi, asked the Additional Chief Electrical Inspector, Bengaluru, to cut power supply to the factory until the dues were cleared.

132,2020/02/19,Breeding tigers to support mini-zoos,"Small zoos need new collection of animals, and Mysuru zoo is helping them out

In what is seen as hand-holding of small and mini-zoos which are seeing a remarkable development over the last two years, drawing more footfalls, the Mysuru zoo has drawn up a plan to improve their animal and bird collection.

One of the major demands from the small zoos has been to house tigers since they have to sustain themselves generating revenue from the gate collections. If the animal collections at the zoos improve, the footfalls are also expected to improve, doubling their revenue.

A tiger and lion safari has come up at Hampi near Hosapete. The Mysuru zoo recently spared a pair of tigers from its collections to the safari.

So far, eight tigers rescued from the wild, including the one captured from Chowdahalli-Hundipura area bordering Bandipur forest, have been housed at the Mysuru zo rescue centre.

Four zoo tigers, including Madhukeshwara, Okkanna and Shivu, had been shifted to the rescue centre sometime ago. There are also two elephants housed at the centre. Madhukeshwar was taken off from the display area as it developed spinal problem while Okkanna lost sight in one eye and Shivu had other health issues.

“We have taken up captive breeding of wild cats at the rescue centre to support the small and mini-zoos. The Mysuru zoo has adequate number of tigers but the breeding had been taken up to boost the collection of carnivores, especially tigers, at the mini-zoos,” said zoo Executive Director Ajit Kulkarni.

He told The Hindu that the male tiger rescued from Bandipur in October last year and a female tiger captured from Bandipur in September last year have been identified as “potential pair” for captive breeding.

“Both are wild cats and they need to become compatible. For this purpose, we house them in holding rooms next to each other so that they get familiar and develop compatibility. This may take some time and the zoo is hopeful of achieving success in its endeavour since the zoo had captive bred many tigers in the past,” he said.

Mr. Kulkarni said the wild tigers captured and housed at the rescue centre are unlikely to be displayed at the zoo. “The law does not permit display of wild tigers at the zoo. They don’t adjust to the conditions and are by and large confined to one corner if put on public display. The rescue centre will keep them for their lifetime with proper care.”

Unlike the female tiger that was captured and brought to the rescue centre in September last year which was very aggressive and growling if anyone went near its cage, the Bandipur male tiger was not very restless. Perhaps, the pair had been chosen for captive breeding programme considering their “characteristics” besides the fact that they are young.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/nngjbc/article30863785.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19MYSURUZOO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/breeding-tigers-to-support-mini-zoos/article30863786.ece

134,2020/02/19,Pratap Simha bats for ‘Greater Mysuru’,"He wants gram panchayats on city’s outskirts included in Mysuru City Corporation limits

Mysuru MP Pratap Simha has made out a case for expanding the jurisdiction of Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) to include the developed areas falling under the gram panchayats on the outskirts of the city.

Mr. Simha called on Minister in charge of Mysuru district V. Somanna recently and urged him to do so so that better amenities can be provided to these areas.

With the city growing at a fast pace, the gram panchayats such as Alanahalli, Hanchya, Kadakola, Ramanahalli, Hosakundi, Devalapura, Srirampura, Jayapura, Bogadi, Hinkal, Koorgalli, Ilawala and Siddalingapura have become developed areas.

Mr Simha pointed out that the areas falling under these gram panchayat limits have residential areas as well as industries and had witnessed a rapid rise in population. The revenue coming to the gram panchayats too had gone up substantially in the last few years.

Contending that there was provision to upgrade the areas under the Karnataka Municipalities Act, Mr. Simha said it had become imperative for the authorities to include these areas in the limits of MCC so that better civic amenities could be provided in the areas.

He made out a case for creating a “Bruhat Mysuru” or “Greater Mysuru” and requested Mr. Somanna to take steps in the regard.

Presently, MCC’s jurisdiction is restricted to the 128.4 sq km area falling within the Outer Ring Road (ORR). Several new residential layouts approved by the Mysuru Urban Development Authority (MUDA) fall outside the MCC’s jurisdiction.

Apart from facing a drinking water scarcity, poor roads and lack of street lights, most of these localities do not have a garbage collection and disposal system.

A recent meeting of officials under the chairmanship of Mr. Somanna discussed with concern the menace of garbage being dumped indiscriminately in the areas outside the ORR. Piles of rotting garbage that was found strewn along the roads in areas outside the ORR had become a source of concern for the MCC authorities during the Swacch Survekshan earlier this year.

Deputy Commissioner Abhiram Sankar had even suggested that the MCC increase its capacity to treat waste at its Vidyaranyapuram plant so that the waste generated from the areas on the outskirts of the city can also be collected and treated by charging a fee to the respective gram panchayats.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/17w47c/article30863702.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19MYSMYSURUCITYCORPORATION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/pratap-simha-bats-for-greater-mysuru/article30863703.ece

The principal said that there were a total of seven Kashmiri students in the college out of which two had gone to their native place before the arrests were made. Two other students had gone to their relatives’ place after informing the hostel warden.

Considering the situation those who had gone to their native place had extended their stay by another week, the principal added.

Meanwhile, the Vidyanagar police have filed suo motu cases against 10-15 unknown persons who had tried to attack the three Kashmiri students who were accused of raising pro-Pakistan slogans at the court complex here on February 17.

139,2020/02/19,"Bail granted to poet, editor","Poet Siraj Bisaralli and editor Rajabaxi H.V., who were booked and taken into custody in connection with the recitation of a poem that criticised the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC), were granted bail by the Principal Civil (Junior Division) and JMFC Court at Gangavathi in Koppal district on Wednesday.

The day also saw Janata Dal (Secular) leader and former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy reciting Mr. Bisaralli’s poem titled Ninna Daakhale Yaavaaga Needuti? (When will you give your documents?) in the Assembly to argue that nothing in it warranted the arrest of the poet. He cited several other poets in the past who have written critically of the State.

At the JMFC Court in Gangavathi, Maulasab Nadaf, the judge, granted the bail to the poet and the editor after they executed a personal bond for ₹50,000 with a surety for a like sum.

Mr. Bisaralli, a Koppal-based poet and journalist, was booked for reciting the poem at the State-sponsored Anegundi Utsav on January 9 and Mr. Rajabaxi, editor of news portal kannadanet.com, for sharing the recitation on a social media platform. The two were absconding since January 24 when the case under Section 505(2) of Indian Penal Code was booked against them following a complaint by BJP Yuva Morcha general secretary Shivakumar Arikeri. They surrendered before the court on Tuesday and moved an interim bail.

As many as 30 advocates appeared for the accused in a show of solidarity on Tuesday. The court rejected their bail plea and sent them to police custody for a day. They were produced before the court on Wednesday and they secured bail.

Mr. Bisaralli told The Hindu that the State’s attempt to suppress his freedom of speech had only strengthened him further. “I am overwhelmed by the way the civil society has responded to the issue.

140,2020/02/19,"Why slap sedition cases, asks KPCC chief","Criticising the BJP government led by Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa for filing sedition cases against students and poets for merely opposing the policies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, KPCC spokesperson S.M. Patil Ganihar has said that neither Mr. Modi nor BJP is India.

“We have reached a dangerous situation in the country where even talking against the Prime Minister on any policy is treated as treason today. People are being arrested and put behind bars for raising objections to any government policy”, he alleged.

Addressing presspersons here on Wednesday, he wondered why cases of sedition are being slapped against people for talking against the government when the courts have made it clear that talking against the government is not equal to talking against the country.

Expressing shock over the arrest of the mother of the child of Shaheen School of Bidar for performing in a play which is said to be critical of Mr. Modi, he said that he never heard of any case where the mother of a school going child is arrested for the alleged crime of the child.

Referring to the school incident owned by RSS ideologue Kalladka Prabhakar where a play was presented on the demolition of Babri Masjid, Mr. Ganihar wondered why no case was booked and why none was sent to jail in that case.

About the reports of Gujarat government constructing a wall in Ahmedabad to hide a slum as the convoy of U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to pass by it, Mr. Ganihar said “ BJP was first saying ‘Garibi Hatao’ (remove poverty) but now it is saying ‘Garibi Chupao (hide poverty).

He said that instead of constructing a huge statue of Sadar Patel in Gujarat by spending thousands of crores, the money could have been spent to provide houses to slums dwellers in Gujarat.

Accusing the BJP government at the Centre of raising communally sensitive issues only to hide its failures in meeting the promises made in its manifesto, he said decisions such as demonetisation and GST have completely failed.

“Today, Mr. Modi never mentions the failure of demonetisation in any of his addresses through radio in his ‘Mann ki Baat’ programme. Because he is aware of the fact that his decision has miserably failed”, he said.

Stating that the CAA has been brought in only to divert public attention from the real issues, he said that the decision is not in the interest of the country.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/why-slap-sedition-cases-asks-kpcc-chief/article30860894.ece

Mr. Hiremath told presspersons here on Wednesday that it is not in the larger interests of democracy to allocate the portfolio to a person who is an accused in several cases of illegal mining in violation the Karnataka Forest Act.

Mr. Hiremath said he would bring to the attention of the Chief Minister the Karnataka High Court’s decision to reject bail to Mr. Singh in the criminal petition No, 2850/2014 which lists serious offences by him. Mr. Singh was found to be a partner with BJP leader Gali Janardhan Reddy in illegal mining at Vyasanakere village and cases have been filed against him. A CEC report dated 05/09/2012 pointed out at his involvement in illegal mining and transportation of iron ore.

143,2020/02/19,Tobacco control programme to be more stringent,"Target set for PDOs, MCC health officers to book cases under COTPA

The implementation of the National Tobacco Control Programme (NTCP) is expected to become more stringent in Mysuru in the coming days with the authorities fixing a target for Panchayat Development Officers (PDO) and Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) health inspectors to book cases under the Cigarette and Other Tobacco Products Act (COTPA).

A district-level meeting of NTCP presided over by Additional Deputy Commissioner B.R. Poornima on Tuesday directed each of the 266 PDOs in Mysuru district to book a minimum 20 cases a month and each of the 45 health inspectors of MCC to book 10 cases a month.

This will be in addition to the cases to be booked by other authorised officials including the police department.

A total of 1,162 cases of COTPA violation had been booked in the district from April 2019 to December 2019 with ₹2,19,790 collected as penalty.

Out of this, a maximum of 1,013 cases had been booked under Section 4 of COTPA, which prohibits smoking in public places. Upto ₹200 can be levied as penalty for persons found violating this Section of COTPA.

Last week, FIRs were lodged against three tea shop owners in the vicinity of the suburban bus stand in Mysuru for allegedly selling loose cigarettes in violation of Section 7 of the COTPA Act.

Shivakumar, Mysuru district consultant for NTCP, told The Hindu that the State government had issued a notification outlawing sale of loose cigarettes.

Section 7 of COTPA prohibits sale of cigarettes without the specified pictorial warning on the package. Sale of loose cigarettes violates the provision, Mr. Shivakumar said.

‘Tobacco-free’ areas

The review meeting, which was also attended by Mysuru District Health Officer Venkatesh, sought information on steps taken by officials of various departments to declare government offices in the district “tobacco free”. The Education Department officials were also urged to ensure that all educational institutions are made “tobacco free” and action be taken to ensure that cigarettes and other tobacco products are not available within a radius of 100 metres from educational institutions as per the provisions of Section 6 of the COTPA. The provisions of Section 6 also prohibit sale of cigarettes and other tobacco products to persons below the age of 18.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/tobacco-control-programme-to-be-more-stringent/article30857487.ece
144,2020/02/19,Role of media in disaster management highlighted,"Mr. Sivanandan said that though various advanced communication means are available for early warnings, evacuation plans and help in post-disaster activities, the success of all efforts depends largely on the understanding the officials have with the media.

Mass media in recent years has helped sensitise people most effectively through forewarning and coverage of natural disasters, journalist T.V. Sivanandan said.

Addressing officials of various departments and mediapersons at a session on the ‘Role of media in disaster management’ organised by the Centre for Disaster Management Administrative Training Institute, Mysuru, here on Tuesday, Mr. Sivanandan said that though various advanced communication means are available for early warnings, evacuation plans and help in post-disaster activities, the success of all efforts depends largely on the understanding the officials have with the media.

Advanced technologies and accurate weather prediction have helped avert major disasters during the Odisha and Andhra Pradesh cyclones. The media plays a vital role in the management of disasters by educating people about consequences, hazard warnings, gathering and transmitting information about affected areas, and also alerting the government for rescue and relief.

Lack of communication and coordination among government officials and mediapersons during pre and post-disaster activities lead to publishing of unverified and speculative reports. When officials avoid sharing information about a situation, reporters tend to rely on local informers.

Meanwhile, the media should be more responsible in disseminating information, he said. Besides providing the correct information at the right time, it should also create an environment of solidarity and faith to help in augmenting the collective responsibility to tackle challenges posed by any disaster, Mr. Sivanandan said.

Sharing his experience in reporting from the scene during the Killari earthquake, in which 52 villages of Latur district in Maharashtra were demolished in the in 1993, he said that over 10,000 lives were lost.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/role-of-media-in-disaster-management-highlighted/article30857466.ece

JD(S) leader Basavaraj Horatti said that although the three students were arrested on Saturday on charges of sedition and attempt to disrupt communal harmony, after a video in which they allegedly raised “pro-Pakistan” slogans went viral, they were later released. “This has created confusion in the minds of people. The police displayed a soft stand against anti-nationals. Action should be initiated against the Police Commissioner at the earliest,” he said.

Opposition leader in the Council S.R. Patil said the incident has disrupted harmony and affected the unity of the nation. “They have raised pro-Pakistan slogans, which is nothing but anti-nationalism. There must be some pressure on the police to go soft on them,” he alleged.

Another Congress leader, Ivan D’Souza, said the flip-flopping by the Police Commissioner regarding the sedition charges had also created confusion among senior police officers and legal experts.

Ruling party leader Kota Srinivas Poojary said the Chief Minister would reply to the issue. Not satisfied with the reply, the Opposition members indulged in a heated debate.

148,2020/02/19,Karnataka MLAs’ late-night meeting triggers speculation of rebellion in BJP,"This comes days after an anonymous letter was released seeking replacement of Mr. Yediyurappa citing alleged age-related health issues.

Close on the heels of the Cabinet expansion, some senior disgruntled MLAs of the BJP appear to have raised the banner of revolt against Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa.

Some of the party’s old-timers met at the residence of senior leader and Industries Minister Jagadish Shettar in Bengaluru on Monday night to express their displeasure with the “functioning style” of Mr. Yediyurappa.

This comes days after an anonymous letter was released seeking replacement of Mr. Yediyurappa citing alleged age-related health issues. But the disgruntled leaders are learnt to have decided against precipitating the matter till March-end as they do not want the budget session to be affected.

On his part, Mr. Shettar on Tuesday denied that a meeting had taken place at his house. He said it was just an “informal gathering of MLAs” to discuss various development issues.

Concerned by this, the Chief Minister is learnt to have summoned Mr. Shettar to his house on Tuesday morning to know what exactly transpired at the meeting. According to sources, Mr. Shettar made it clear that he would not go against Mr. Yediyurappa’s leadership and that he was not part of any disgruntled group.

However, it is learnt that a senior party leader conveyed to the CM the feelings of the “disgruntled leaders” who held the meeting. The leader is believed to have told Mr. Yediyurappa that the party old-timers, especially senior MLAs, have complained of alleged interference in administration of his son B.Y.

Raising concern about Karnataka’s financial situation in the Legislative Council, he suggested that Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa should come out with a White Paper at the earliest. “Let us know how much money the State exchequer has. Based on that, you should lead an all-party delegation to the Centre seeking more funds for the State,” he said.

“The State has been deprived of funds even though it is the third-highest taxpaying State. The Centre has been slashing grants and funds for most schemes, including MNREGA and GST revenue,” he said.

On flood relief, Mr. Ibrahim said that while the government had claimed in the Governor’s address to the joint session that the relief amount was adequately disbursed to all affected families, many people were still waiting for grants to build houses. “If the government’s claims are true, is it ready to set up an all-party Cabinet sub-committee to study the issue?” he asked.

Mangaluru firing

Meanwhile, alleging that the violence in Mangaluru during the anti-CAA protest in December was sparked off by police high-handedness, Opposition leader in the Council S.R. Patil said the police had not followed any rules or protocol before opening fire. “It was a small crowd that could have been easily managed by a large police force. It is unfortunate that they did not follow rules before opening fire.”

150,2020/02/19,Six Bills tabled in Karnataka Legislative Assembly,"The Karnataka Innovation Authority Bill, which aims to help innovators overcome curbs of the established regulatory regimes, and the National Law School of India (Amendment) Bill, 2020, which looks to provide 25% reservation to students of Karnataka, were among the six Bills tabled in the Legislative Assembly on Tuesday.

The proposed authority is expected to enable the setting up of “regulatory sandboxes” wherein innovators will be allowed a small window of exemption for a prescribed period to carry out innovation. The State also gets to observe such innovations and have time to respond with further legislation and amendments, if required.

According to the explanation, Karnataka witnesses development of innovative products and services using technologies, which usually do not fall under the parameters of established regulatory regimes. These innovators are subject to legal hardship, and this curbs innovation. While amendments to the law to address regulatory challenges thrown up by these new products and services takes time, a legal framework to enable innovation needs to be established in the interim, it said.

Reservation

The National Law School of India (Amendment) Bill, 2020 seeks to provide 25% reservation to students of Karnataka (who have studied in any one of the recognised educational institutions for at least 10 years). It cites similar reservation given to local students in eight other law schools in the country, and also a Supreme Court judgment.

The other Bills tabled on Tuesday included the Karnataka Official Language (Amendment) Bill, 2020, the Karnataka Lokayukta (Amendment) Bill, 2020, which aims to enable the Lokayukta to function more effectively, and the Karnataka Transparency in Public Procurements (Amendment) Bill, 2020, to increase the limit on value of procurement of goods and services from ₹1 lakh to ₹5 lakh.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/six-bills-tabled-in-karnataka-legislative-assembly/article30854667.ece

The major contributors to the profit were Karnataka Power Transmission Corporation Ltd. (₹212.14 crore) and Bangalore Electricity Supply Company Ltd. (₹84.77 crore). Among those that incurred heavy losses were Raichur Power Corporation Ltd. (₹1,562.76 crore), Gulbarga Electricity Supply Company (₹312.84 crore), and Hubli Electricity Supply Company (₹140.28 crore).

The power sector PSUs showed net aggregate profits of ₹372.60 crore, ₹422.87 crore, and ₹19.25 crore during 2014-15, 2015-16 and 2016-17, respectively. They incurred net aggregate loss of ₹533.59 crore and ₹1,605.58 crore during 2013-14 and 2017-18, respectively.

Madhuswamy on Tuesday expressed the government’s inability to announce a support price. He, however, assured the Assembly that the government would write to the Centre on scientific upward revision of support price.

The Minister’s response came after members cutting across party lines from Hassan and Tumakuru raised the issue of falling copra prices on the floor of the Legislative Assembly and sought government intervention. JD(S) legislator from Arsikere K.M. Shivalinge Gowda pointed to the price crash from about ₹18,000 to about ₹10,000 a quintal. Urging the State government to help farmers, BJP legislator from Tiptur B.C. Nagesh said the support price has to be revised as input costs have gone up.

Saying the State government was unable to intervene as the price was above the ₹9,920 a quintal fixed by the Centre, Mr. Madhuswamy said, “Even I am a coconut farmer. I know that the price has come down from ₹16,000 to about ₹10,300 a quintal. We will discuss and write to the Centre to increase the support price.”

The Minister also said that in 2019-20, the State had 6.05 lakh hectares under coconut cultivation and produced 11.52 lakh quintals of copra. “In the last five years, the State has not seen any major change, either in cultivation area or production,” he added.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/government-will-not-interfere-in-copra-price-mechanism-minister/article30854623.ece
153,2020/02/19,Mango farmers fear heavy crop loss,"Widespread attack by thrips at Muthalamada

Mango production at Muthalamada in the current season is set to suffer heavily following a widespread attack by a kind of thrip locally known as Elappen. Agricultural officials said tests were being done to identify the thrips. Most pesticides being heavily experimented to manage the thrips are found to be ineffective.

The thrips are found to be sucking the flowers and drying them in large portions of the 4,000-hectare mango orchards at Muthalamada. Farmers said it was the third year that they were facing thrip attack.

“But this year is the worst. The thrips attack is widespread like never before,” said M. Sachindran, mango farmer at Muthalamada. Some farmers admitted that pesticides were applied in several phases, yet the thrips could not be controlled. They said they approached different government authorities with their woes, and none could suggest a proper remedy.

Flowering pattern

Sujith S.S., Agricultural Officer at Muthalamada, said the thrips had spread over 80% of the farms in the area causing angst among the farmers. He said the disruption in flowering pattern owing to climate change was suspected to be a reason for the sudden increase in thrip attack. Muthalamada mangoes used to stand apart from other mangoes in the country because of its early arrival. When mangoes from other parts of the country hit the north Indian markets by March-April, Muthalamada mangoes would be ready by December-January.

“Flowering usually takes place by November in Muthalamada and mangoes reach the market by January. But this time, the flowering pattern has been upset. Even in February, some orchards are still flowering. And we find the thrips thriving when it is hot,” Mr. Sujith said.

Mr. Sachindran, who has 10 acres of mango orchards at Muthalamada, said most farmers were worried about a heavy crop loss.

Most of the 400-odd farmers and mango traders are anxious. Many of them have accepted advance amounts from trade agents in Delhi markets.

“I don’t know whether we will be able to deliver the mangoes for the money we received,” said a farmer who refused to identify himself. Most of the popular varieties such as Alphonsa, Sindhoor, Banganapalli, Neelam, Natsela, Rumani, Kalapadi, and Sotaperi are produced at Muthalamada. Farmers say Muthalamada mangoes have better quality than others because of the land and the climate.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/x0w5rx/article30864277.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20TVPD-MANGO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/mango-farmers-fear-heavy-crop-loss/article30864278.ece

Mass death of ducks in Pavukkaram, near Mannar, has sparked panic among farmers in the region. Around 7,000 ducks of a farmer in the region died in recent days.

Animal Husbandry Department officials said samples had been examined at the Avian Disease Diagnostic Laboratory at Thiruvalla.

Bacterial infection

“The cause of death is a bacterial infection. The ducks were infected with Riemerella anatipestifer. All ducks infected so far have been reared by a single farmer,” said Mary James, Alappuzha District Animal Husbandry Officer. Officials said the situation was under control. “It is an antibiotic-resistant bacteria. But, we have taken precautionary measures,” said an official.

Meanwhile, the All Kerala Poultry Federation has urged the authorities to prevent the spread of the disease to other farms. In September 2018, a large number of ducks succumbed to bacterial infection in Upper Kuttanad. Then the duck deaths had been reported from the flood-hit areas. The dead ducks were infected since they were reared in contaminated waters.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/7000-odd-ducks-perish-in-alappuzha/article30864271.ece

156,2020/02/19,Kannur Mayor in hospital after ‘assault’,"Opposition councillors gheraoed and manhandled her, alleges ruling front

Kannur Mayor Suma Balakrishnan was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit of the district government hospital after she was allegedly assaulted by the Opposition councillors at the Kannur Corporation office on Wednesday. The ruling councillors alleged that the Mayor was locked in the office and manhandled.

The governing body had called an emergency council meeting on Wednesday. Just ahead of the meeting, Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] councillors gheraoed the Mayor at her office and closed the door to the council hall, said Standing Committee Chairman T.O. Mohan.

They were demanding that the issues raised by the pro-LDF employees, who are on a protest outside the Corporation for some days, be discussed first. The employees are protesting against the governing body’s stance that organisational work will not be allowed in the office compound.

The Opposition councillors got agitated when the Mayor refused to accept their demands, saying that the matter would be taken up after the council meeting. Soon the UDF councillors came in support of the Mayor and got into an argument with the LDF councillors.

Mr. Mohan said the Mayor was beaten, pushed down and kicked while she tried to enter the council hall. The protesters also broke the mike on the Mayor’s table, he alleged. The meeting, which was called at 11 a.m., could not be started even in the afternoon. However, the council quickly passed 71 agendas, even as the Opposition continued its protest.

Hartal call

Condemning the attack on the Mayor the UDF district committee called for a hartal in the Corporation limits from 6 a.m. to noon on Thursday.

157,2020/02/19,Luxury hotel forsakes Loka Kerala Sabha food bill,"Owner says he will not charge his ‘family members’

The political controversy over the government’s recent acknowledgement that it had afforded ₹2,000-a-plate lunches to the delegates of the Loka Kerala Sabha (LKS) held here in January took a new turn on Wednesday with the caterer forsaking the ₹60-lakh bill owed by the organisers.

Piqued by news reports that the 5-star luxury hotel Raviz Kovalam had charged extortionate rates for meals served to delegates, its owner Ravi Pillai said the management had never insisted that the government pay for the service.

‘Avoidable’

Terming the controversy surrounding the issue “avoidable and unfortunate,” he said the hotel had not asked the organisers to pay up so far.

He said the non-resident Keralites (NoRKs) who attended the conference in January were his brothers and sisters.

Mr. Pillai said he did not charge family members for the food they ate when they came home visiting.

Opposition charge

The Congress-led Opposition had highlighted the public money spent on organising the NoRKs meet as a classic example of the LDF government’s profligacy.

A question posed by the Opposition in the Assembly had revealed that the government had spent more than ₹1 crore for food and accommodation.

The hotel had charged five-star rates for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

Meet boycotted

The Opposition had boycotted the LKS 2020 on the ground that the flagship programme of the government to harness the wealth and expertise of NoRKs for the State’s development was a futile spectacle.

It had alleged that the LKS was a white elephant. The cash-strapped government had already splurged crores to refurbish the Sankara Narayanan Thampi Hall in the Assembly Complex to host the second meeting of the nominated body, the Opposition said.

The LKS participants were mostly wealthy persons and had no ordinary NoRK as an invitee, the Congress had alleged.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/luxury-hotel-forsakes-loka-kerala-sabha-food-bill/article30864231.ece
158,2020/02/19,Stipend parity elusive for medical interns,"Medical Council of India yet to issue gazette notification

More than a year after issuing a public notice that proposed uniform stipend for medical interns in private and government medical colleges, the Medical Council of India (MCI) is yet to issue a gazette notification for the purpose.

Private medical colleges are being accused of paying meagre amounts to house surgeons and there has been a long-pending demand for uniform stipend for them across medical colleges.

Huge disparity

House surgeons in government medical colleges in Kerala are being given a monthly stipend of ₹25,000. It has been alleged, however, that those in private medical colleges are given stipends in the ₹4,000-₹12,000 range. The stipend for interns in medical institutions run by the Union government is ₹23,500.

K.V. Babu, Kannur-based public health activist, said numerous reminders had been sent to know the current status of the notice issued by Sanjay Srivastava, MCI secretary general, on January 29, 2019. It had said that the board of governors was planning to amend the Regulations on Graduate Medical Education (GME), 1997, to include the following provision: “All the candidates pursuing compulsory rotating internship at the institution from which MBBS course was completed shall be paid stipend on par with the stipend being paid to the interns of the State government medical institution or Central government medical institution in the State or Union Territory where the institution is located.” The board also urged stakeholders to “give their comments or suggestions within 15 days” to bring the above amendment in regulations.

Dr. Babu pointed out that the Travancore-Cochin Medical Council had earlier claimed that the issue was not under its purview. It was transferred to the MCI. On September 26, 2017, the MCI executive too pointed out that GME regulations “did not provide for payment of stipend to interns and the issue is beyond our purview”.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/stipend-parity-elusivefor-medical-interns/article30864196.ece
159,2020/02/19,"Graft in Sabarimala sanitation work payments, says Collector","Says delay in paying wages due to mistakes detected in bill

District Collector P.B. Noohu on Wednesday said the delay in disbursing wages to Sabarimala Sanitation Society workers was due to certain serious mistakes detected in the bill submitted by the member secretary.

Talking to The Hindu, Mr. Noohu said he suspected huge corruption taking place in the name of sanitation work at Sabarimala.

The Collector said he had released the pending wages to all those eligible workers, as per the attendance registered through biometric punching, on Wednesday.

Mr. Noohu said the administration had introduced biometric punching for the SSS workers deployed at Sabarimala as a pilot project in 2018-19.

The system was enforced during the annual pilgrim season that came to a close on January 21 in an effort to check corruption, if any, in the name of the innocent Tamil workers at Sabarimala, he said.

A manual attendance register too was maintained as a secondary source.

Mr. Noohu said he was convinced of largescale corruption taking place in the name of cleaning drive at Sabarimala and had decided to order an official inquiry into the matter soon.

160,2020/02/19,Cement terminal project to be opposed,"Was shelved earlier after protests

A move to reconsider the proposal for a cement terminal at Pallithottam, a project abandoned by the government, has given rise to anxiety and resentment among the residents, most of them members of the fishing community.

The proposal was met with stiff opposition and Finance Minister T. M. Thomas Isaac on an earlier occasion had clarified that the government has no plans to go forward with the project.

Meeting called

“But the district administration has decided to convene a meeting to discuss the project at the instruction of Ports Secretary. The meeting is scheduled for February 25 and we want that meeting called off,” said Kollam district Matsya Thozhilali Union (CITU) president H.Basil Lal.

According to the residents, the project is not suited for Pallithottam, which is a heavily populated area.

“Along with environmental issues it will also affect our livelihood. Though there are cement terminals in Kochi, they are not located at residential areas,” said a resident.

In early 2019 the news of the proposed cement factory had suddenly popped up based on a RTI document. But later government representatives explained that the proposal was considered in 2013 and then abandoned.

Mr.Basil Lal added that the meeting is part of efforts to generate confusion among the fishers.

Members of Teeradesha Avakasha Samrakshana Samiti, who took out a march on Wednesday to mark their protest against the latest development, say the terminal will affect the daily life of persons residing in 15 km radius.

“Those living in the coastal areas from Chinnakkada to Cheriyazheekkal will have to face the consequences. Despite Fisheries Minister J.Mercykutty Amma taking a position against the project, the officials are initiating the procedures for implementation and we find it really strange,” said Samson Johny, secretary.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cement-terminal-project-to-be-opposed/article30864088.ece
161,2020/02/19,KIIFB-funded project hits a road block,"PWD yet to complete land acquisition along the Kizhakan Muthoor and Muthoor stretch

Work on the Kuttoor-Manackachira-Kizhakkan Muthoor-Muthoor Link Road development project, funded by the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB), has hit a road block allegedly due to lack of coordination and cooperation among various stakeholder departments and the funding agency.

The Public Works Department has launched the project, aimed at developing it as a major diversion route between the MC Road and the Thiruvalla-Kumbazha State Highway, 15 months ago, with a gestation period of 18 months that ends in May.

The Changanacherry-based Palathra Constructions that has undertaken the ₹26.8 crore project has already completed almost 70% of the road work on the 8-km Kuttoor-Kizhakkan Muthoor stretch. However, the PWD is yet to complete the land acquisition process along the remaining 4-km stretch between Kizhakan Muthoor and Muthoor, says Shaji Mathew, company director.

Mr Mathew says, the local people have voluntarily surrendered the land required for widening the road to 10 metres along the Kuttoor-Kizhakkan Muthoor stretch.

Meanwhile, the road work along this stretch has been abruptly stopped owing to the delay on the part of the Kerala State Electricity Board in shifting the electric posts.

The KSEB has demanded ₹91,686 for shifting two electric posts alone, which, the PWD and the KIIFB have found exorbitant. The estimate given by KSEB for shifting electric posts on the 2-km stretch of the road was ₹1.14 crore.

The KSEB Assistant Engineer at Kallisserry says the board has to install only ‘A’ type poles, as per the rules and regulations, and each pole costs ₹20,000.

Similarly, the Kerala Water Authority has submitted a project estimated at ₹1.34 crore for laying new waterlines.

Though the work on a new culvert across the irrigation canal connecting river Manimala and the Madhurampuzha streamhas begun, the Irrigation wing of the Water Resources Department is yet to take necessary steps for installing steel shutters on its riverside portion to regulate flood waters during the monsoon.

Worried lot

Local residents are a worried lot as the existing situation has made the region highly vulnerable to more aggressive floods, if the authorities failed to complete the road work and install the shutters before the onset of monsoon.

Meanwhile, Mathew T.Thomas, MLA, said he has taken note of the issue seriously and necessary steps would be initiated to complete the project as per the schedule itself.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/3yv9hi/article30864074.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/tv20ptculverts,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kiifb-funded-project-hits-a-road-block/article30864067.ece
162,2020/02/19,Virtual courts in State from April 1,"It will be operational in Thiruvananthapuram, Kochi and Kozhikode

The Kerala High Court has approved the establishment of three virtual courts in the State on the lines of those in New Delhi. Besides reducing the burden on regular courts, the virtual court will facilitate adjudication of cases online and do away with the need for litigants to be present in the court.

The proposed system will be operationalised in Thiruvananthapuram, Kochi and Kozhikode on April 1. The courts would deal with cases pertaining to traffic violations, railway, labour law and municipal cases.

While the Internet-based process is expected to address the increasing backlog of summons and notices, the High Court will depute a ‘virtual judge’ who can view cases along with the automatic computation of fines on an application, according to a press release.

The details of vehicles owned by those who violate traffic rules will be registered through the e-challan system being used by the police and Motor Vehicles Department. The court will initiate legal process against them after identifying the violators.

After the summon is generated, the accused will be able to examine the charges that have been invoked, prior to paying the fine in order to dispose the case. Furthermore, the system will enable the classification of cases by recording the location of the crime using a GPS system. The ‘Vahan’ and ‘Sarathi’ applications of the Motor Vehicles Department will be utilised to record the vehicle’s registration number and its owner’s contact number.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/virtual-courts-in-state-from-april-1/article30863069.ece
163,2020/02/19,Move to enforce UGC norms in Principal posting upsets teachers,"Higher Education Department issues circular in this regard

The Higher Education Department’s decision to enforce the University Grants Commission (UGC) norms in Principals’ selection in government arts and science colleges has ruffled a section of the teaching community.

Fearing that the hasty implementation of the rules could lead to a chaotic situation in several colleges, they demanded that move be deferred.

A circular issued by the department recently that stated that all Principal selections would hereafter be undertaken by adhering to the 2018 UGC regulations, which mandated the constitution of selection committees. The decision to enforce the guidelines has come at a time when nearly 24 out of the 67 government arts and science colleges did not have full-time Principals. Besides, the Principals in around 30 colleges are set to retire by May.

In addition to the existing eligibility requirements of Ph.D and associate professorship, the UGC guidelines stipulates at least 10 published peer-reviewed journals and a minimum API (academic performance indicators) score of 120. Besides, while a minimum teaching experience of 15 years in government colleges was another criterion, the UGC rules will enable professors and associate professors with a total service of 15 years of “teaching, research or administration in universities, colleges and other institutions of higher education” to be considered for the position.

While the department has maintained that the State was legally bound to implement the norms of the apex body failing which it could be denied grants, the teaching community claimed that its implementation could adversely affect several institutions. The move also threatened to scuttle seniority system that has been viewed as the basis for promotions under the Kerala Service Rules.

“Barely 10 of those who were being considered for promotion to the Pprincipals’ posts would satisfy the criteria. Strangely, the order has come when the department promotion committee was set to meet later this month. The panel would be rendered useless with the UGC mandating the creation of 16-member selection committees in its place,” a source said.

According to general secretary of the Association of Kerala Government College Teachers N. Manoj, many of the provisions were unrealistic, considering the limitations that existed in the higher education sector of the State.

While not many professors in the State could claim to have published 10 peer-reviewed journals, the requirement of an API score of 120 was also unreasonable. “Under the existing norms, only one teacher from a college would be permitted to attend seminars or conferences, which could earn them two points, at a time,” he said.

He said that while teachers were all for enhancing quality, such steps should be adopted only after ensuring adequate facilities. “The opportunities for refresher courses are limited in the State. The Academic Staff College at Karyavattom could accommodate only 40 teachers per course, despite receiving around 1,600 applications,” Mr. Manoj said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/move-to-enforce-ugc-norms-in-principal-posting-upsets-teachers/article30862398.ece
164,2020/02/19,Check on establishments to identify waste disposal mode,"Fine imposed on units that lack proper system

The city Corporation has initiated checks in commercial establishments and other institutions to ensure that they have made adequate arrangements for waste management. On Wednesday, inspections were carried out in around 30 commercial establishments.

A fine of ₹5,510 was imposed on the owners of a two-wheeler showroom at Paruthippara, after the premises and the plot adjacent to it was found to be strewn with unsegregated waste.

“Our team of health inspectors found that waste materials, including plastic, waste clothes and tubes, were all mixed together and spread out in different parts of the premises. They had no proper waste management system or arrangement with any waste-collecting agency. We spoke to the owner, who agreed to conduct an awareness class for the staff. The Corporation’s aim is not to penalise, but to spread awareness regarding proper waste management,” said health inspector S.S. Minu.

Fine was also imposed on a juice shop near Nanthancode for not having any waste management arrangements.

Verifying claims

The city Corporation had in January served a directive and a questionnaire on waste management to government and private institutions, asking them to specify the mode of disposal of waste they have opted for. While many of the establishments claimed to have made arrangements with various agencies, some claimed that they were disposing of the waste on their own. The Health wing has now launched inspections in all the establishments to check whether the claims are true.

“This drive is being carried out around the time when the D & O trade licence is to be renewed. The Corporation is using the opportunity to ensure that all the commercial establishments are strictly following the waste disposal methods that they claim in the licence applications,” said Mr. Minu.

The Health wing also imposed smaller fines of ₹510 each on five migrant workers living in Muttada ward, for dumping waste into the nearby compound and burning waste.

Home visits

The Corporation plans to rope in residents’ association office-bearers, Kudumbashree workers and other voluntary organisations to form squads that will conduct home visits to ensure that proper waste disposal methods are followed in all homes.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/check-on-establishments-to-identify-waste-disposal-mode/article30862049.ece
165,2020/02/19,SCTIMST develops stent graft for aortic aneurysm,"Units are affordable, better suited for Asian population

The Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences & Technology (SCTIMST), in collaboration with the National Aerospace Laboratories, Bengaluru (CSIR-NAL), has indigenously developed an affordable stent graft and its delivery system for repairing thoracic aortic aneurysm.

Thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) have an estimated incidence of at least 5-10 per lakh population.

An aortic aneurysm is a ballooning or enlargement of the aorta. A disease affecting about 5% of the population in their late sixties, it does not present any symptoms but can be fatal in case of rupture.

Endovascular Aortic Repair or EVAR is a minimally invasive technique which involves the insertion of stent grafts in the diseased vessel by a delivery catheter, which is inserted into the central circulatory system through the femoral artery.

Surgeons currently use imported stents which cost over ₹3.5 lakh. However, the imported stent graft and its delivery system are not exactly designed for the Asian population. The catheter diameter is often large, making it difficult to insert and pass through the femoral artery and this often results in injuries.

The stent graft developed by the SCTIMST is made up of polyester fabric sewed in tubular form and are scaffolded by NiTi (Nickel Titanium Alloy) rings. It has incorporated a new asymmetric design for the NiTi rings (stents), which can be adjusted to a lower diameter and inserted in a catheter sheath of lower diameter.

This asymmetric design helps the stent graft to affix itself to the inner aortic wall and resists displacement due to blood flow.

Once the stent graft is put in place, blood flow occurs only through the conduit, thus excluding the aneurysm and preventing its rupture.

Endoleak (Type-1) is a defect which occurs after the deployment of the stent graft in the aneurysm area. The device developed by the SCTIMST does away with this defect.

The delivery system incorporates a new feature for the fast release of the stent graft and accurate deployment of the device during the EVAR procedure.

Six patent applications and five design registrations were filed for the features.

The project team included Sujesh Sreedharan, Engineer-F, Division of Artificial Internal Organs, Biomedical Technology Wing; Jayadevan E.R., Additional Professor, Imaging Sciences and Interventional Radiology; Santhosh Kumar K., Additional Professor, Imaging Sciences and Interventional Radiology, SCTIMST; and Unnikrishnan M., former Professor, Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/sctimst-develops-stent-graft-for-aortic-aneurysm/article30862040.ece
166,2020/02/19,"Fatalities down, but accidents up","Enforcement of rules results in the dip

Fatalities in the road corridors of the State came down by 15.7% in January this year, but road accidents went up by 2.8% when compared to the corresponding period in 2019.

The number of fatalities in January 2019 was 459, but this came down to 387 in January 2020. The number of road accidents in January 2019 was 3,886 and this went up to 3,995 in January 2020 as per the road accident statistics released by the Kerala Road Safety Authority.

Penalty effect

Increasing the penalty for offences, enforcing headgear for motorcyclists and pillion riders and stern enforcement measures by the police and Motor Vehicles Department have contributed to the dip in fatalities. “Compliance level by motorists has also gone up and this is reflected in the figures,” Road Safety Commissioner, KRSA, N. Shanker Reddy told The Hindu.

The dip is the highest in Pathanamthitta district with deaths coming down from 22 in January 2019 to 9 in January 2020 (-59.1%), followed by Alappuzha (-41.3%) where the deaths came down from 46 to 27. Idukki registered a decline by -34.2% with deaths coming down from 38 in January 2019 to 25 in January 2020. In Thiruvananthapuram, the fatalities came down from 66 to 49, registering a decline of -25.8%.

However, the concern for the law enforcers and road safety experts is the fatalities going up by 12.5% each in Kottayam (36 deaths) and Wayanad (9 deaths) and by 7.7% in Kannur (28 deaths) last month.

The highest number of accidents in January this year occurred in Thiruvananthapuram. Still, the capital district registered a fall in accidents, from 509 to 494.

Ernakulam also registered a decline by 2.8% with the accidents coming down from 319 to 310. Alappuzha registered a decline by 13.1%, from 374 to 325.

Surprisingly, the road accidents in Kannur went up by 24.9%, from 197 to 246. Kottayam also registered an increase by 13.4% with the number going up from 261 to 296.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/83fd8i/article30891600.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23tv-accidentcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/fatalities-come-down-but-accidents-go-up/article30861826.ece
167,2020/02/19,BJP’s loss in Delhi polls part of a political churn: Sitaram Yechury,"CPI(M) general secretary credits newly elect Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal with adopting a clever strategy

CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury has said the drubbing that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) suffered in the Delhi Assembly polls is part of a political churn that the country has been witnessing in the recent times.

The party’s failure to secure absolute majorities in six Assembly elections in a row was reflective of the changing narrative from communal and nationalist jingoism to livelihood issues that affected large sections in the country, he added.

Delivering the golden jubilee memorial lecture on the theme ‘Challenges of Indian Democracy – a contemporary perspective’, organised by the Loyola College of Social Sciences, here on Tuesday, Mr. Yechury said the public had realised the need to raise issues that concerned sustenance and livelihood, rather than fall for the trap of communal polarisation that the BJP sought for its success.

While there was virtually no opposition for the BJP in Maharashtra and Haryana, the public took up the role to dampen their prospects.

Lauding Kejriwal

Crediting Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for adopting a clever strategy, Mr. Yechury said the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader refused to be drawn into the controversy surrounding the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC).

Caste factors

While there had been undercurrents of caste factors, the victory was a vote that the people of Delhi gave for the work that was done during the last five years.

The CPI(M) leader added that the ongoing agitations against the CAA including the one in Shaheen Bagh was not led by political parties, but by the common populace, particularly the student community.

He also reiterated that the implementation of the NRC would lead to complete chaos in the country.

College manager Sunny Kunnappallil presided over the programme.

Principal Saji P. Jacob and Vice Principal Sabu P. Thomas also spoke.

Trump’s visit

Lashing out at the Gujarat government for constructing walls to conceal slums ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump’s visit, Mr. Yechury said it was reflective of the Centre’s philosophy of “eliminating the poor and not poverty”. He cautioned the Narendra Modi-led government that it would be making a fool out of itself by creating a charade of prosperity in the country. “The walls will display its most inhumane face to the world,” he said. He added that the U.S. President’s visit was in reality a reciprocation to the Modi government’s efforts to open the doors for foreign investment in the country.

168,2020/02/19,Veteran journalist M.S. Mani is dead,"Long-time Editor of Malayalam daily Kerala Kaumudi and Kala Kaumudi

M.S.Mani, long-time Editor of Malayalam daily Kerala Kaumudi and political-literary magazine Kala Kaumudi, passed away here on Tuesday morning.

He was 79. He had been serving as Chief Editor of the Kala Kaumudi daily.

Hailing from a family of journalists owning an influential newspaper, he was able to cut his teeth in the profession at the young age of 20. Kerala Kaumudi, which his grandfather C.V. Kunhiraman founded in 1911 and of which his father K. Sukumaran was the Chief Editor, became his learning ground.

In later years, having gained more than a foothold in the profession, he would steer it to further heights, leaving his own mark on the newspaper.

Within one year of joining the newspaper in 1961, he shifted to Delhi, where he covered Parliament proceedings and major happenings during a tumultuous period in Indian politics.

In 1975, when the country was under Emergency, he launched the Kala Kaumudi magazine, which with its mix of incisive political commentary and literary content achieved a strong readership in a short time.

With a view to nurturing quality literature, the magazine opened the doors for many young writers and poets. Writer Sethu remembers Mr. Mani as someone who paid the princely sum of ₹100 for a story at a time when hardly anyone paid money for stories.

In 1990, he launched the Kala Kaumudi daily from Mumbai, one of the first Malayalam newspapers to be printed and published from outside Kerala.

Clouds of fire over Sivagiri, one of his books, unravelled the internal conflicts and power struggle in the Sivagiri Madhom, which led to a much-criticised police action and violence at the madhom in 1995.

As an editor, Mr. Mani was someone who did not believe in hierarchy, being at equal ease with cub reporters as well as veterans.

He received the State government’s Swadeshabhimani Kesari award in 2018 for his journalistic work.

He was a committee member in the Indian Newspaper Society and a member of the India Newspaper Editor’s Conference.

Tributes pour in

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, in his condolence message, said that Mr. Mani contributed immensely to society as a reporter and as an editor. He had taken a strong stand on several issues that had arisen in the state’s socio-political sphere.

Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said that Mr. Mani gave voice to the oppressed and made a mark with his investigative journalism in Malayalam.

Governor Arif Mohammed Khan said that Mr. Mani enriched Malayalam journalism with a touch of courage and genuine concern for the welfare of the downtrodden.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/5srcal/article30854877.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19tv-mani,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/veteran-journalist-ms-mani-is-dead/article30854878.ece

The Kerala High Court on Tuesday made it clear that it proposed to impose a penalty of ₹10,000 on those who refuse to remove advertisement hoardings, banners, and flags from public places.

Justice Devan Ramachandran made the oral observation when a case relating to the erection of illegal flex, hoardings and flag posts came up for hearing.

The court orally observed that despite granting 15 days’ time in January, boards and hoardings still remained in public places.

Across State

The judge added that he saw them when he happened to travel across the State.

The court said it proposed to fix the penalty at ₹10,000 in addition to the charges prescribed by the the Kerala Municipality (erection of arches and setting up of advertisement boards in public streets and public places) Rules for erecting illegal hoardings and advertisements boards in public places.

The court said that unless a penalty was imposed, these boards will continue to dominate public places and there would be multiplicity of such hoardings.

Flays State govt.

The court also orally criticised the State government, saying that it had done nothing to get its orders implemented.

Not a single hoarding or banner or flag posts had been removed. They still ruled the roost on roads, footpaths and medians, posing a potential dangers to motorists and pedestrians.

The court noted that even the police had not taken any steps to remove those illegal hoardings despite the issue of a circular to all station house offices by the State Police Chief.

The circular had directed station house officers to stop the public nuisance and menace of illegal hoardings, flags and billboards in order to reduce road accidents and fatalities.

Dangerous manner

The judge noted that when he travelled to Vadakkanchery, he saw Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) flags fluttering along the the bypass from the Chanthakavala to Vadakkanchery.

These flags were erected in a dangerous manner on the carriageways.

The court asked the State government to respond to the court's proposal to impose penalty.

The court posted the case to February 20 for passing orders on penalty.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/lpz77t/article30854816.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19TVPLBILLBOARDS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/fine-of-10000-for-not-taking-off-billboards/article30854817.ece

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Tuesday arrested five policemen and a home guard in connection with the alleged custodial death of 49-year-old Rajkumar, a remand prisoner, on June 21 last.

The agency had arrested K.A. Sabu, former sub-inspector of the Nedumkandam police station and prime accused in the case, on Monday. The five policemen arrested on Tuesday were Rejimon, Roy P. Varghese, Jithin K. George, Sajeev Antony, and Niyas. James K.M. is the home guard arrested along with the five police officers.

Further probe

The accused were granted interim bail by the Chief Judicial Magistrate Court here. It had granted six-day custody of Sabu on Monday. The CBI had pointed out that further interrogation was required to ascertain whether senior officers had any role in the custodial torture.

Rajkumar, a private financier from Kolahalamedu, was taken into custody on charges of financial fraud on June 12 and was produced in court only on June 16. He had allegedly accepted deposits from self-help groups on the promise of providing them loans. However, complaints were filed at the Nedumkandam police station that he had failed to keep his word.

Rajkumar was allegedly subjected to severe torture at the Nedumkandam police station from June 12 to June 15, leading to his death on June 21.

Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala on Tuesday hinted that he was privy to evidence to suspect that Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had a part in the tales of corruption popping out of the Police Headquarters in rapid succession.

He alleged that at the behest of State Police Chief Loknath Behera, Keltron had fronted for a company with minimal expertise, Mediatronics, to implement an automated traffic enforcement system in Kerala.

The company would keep 90% of the revenue generated from fines.

As a profit-making entity, the company had an incentive for maximising penalties at the expense of two-wheeler riders and car owners.

The human rights of taxpayers were at stake, he said.

Mr. Chennithala also alleged that Mediatronics was an appendage of Galaxion, the ‘paper company’ that had come under a cloud after being contracted by the police to implement the controversial Central Intrusion Monitoring System (CIMS).

Police deny it

The police have denied Mr. Chennithala’s allegation in an official release here. They said it had invited e-tenders to implement its proposed Integrated Digital Traffic Enforcement Scheme. Two firms had responded to the bid. A high-level committee was evaluating their technical expertise.

173,2020/02/19,‘The film will make a difference’: Neena Gupta on 'Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan',"The actor describes the experience of working on the film as a 'laugh riot', the importance of resisting stereotypes, and her spate of fresh roles

Neena Gupta believes that Indian cinema has been experiencing a golden period for a while now. Content-based films with small and medium budgets like Article 15 are doing well commercially. Since producers are not losing money, writers and directors are being encouraged and enabled to make more such films. Gupta says, it was the success of Badhaai Ho (2018) and the appreciation that followed her turn as a middle-aged woman who suddenly discovers she is pregnant, that allowed her to participate in this period of change and growth. The film signalled a revival for her career, bringing in a flurry of new offers. She considers it among the most significant highlights of her career. “There was Saans at one time,” says the actor, referring to her critically acclaimed television serial from the late 90s, “And there is Badhaai Ho now.”

One of the roles that the film’s success generated was that of Sunaina Tripathi in Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan, the second instalment in the Shubh Mangal series, and a film where she pairs up once again opposite her Badhaai Ho co-star Gajraj Rao. The actor describes her character in the new film as a middle-class housewife who will do largely what her husband asks her to do. But she is also “slightly Mother India-like,” Gupta chuckles. When a crisis arises, she is also the one who tries to save the situation and balance everything out. “I am a little like her,” she declares, when asked how she related emotionally to the character. Gupta explains that she too is orthodox in some ways and yet very fair as well as modern when it comes to accepting things in another. “I have both in me and this character Sunaina also has both in her,” she points out.

The actor describes the experience of working on the film as a “laugh riot” and speaks fondly of the 40 days of shoot in Varanasi during which the cast became like a family.

She also commends writer-director Hitesh Kewalya, who wrote Shubh Mangal Saavdhan as well, for his clarity of thought and direction and especially for his writing skills, adding that the film has just enough punchlines for it to be entertaining without seeming too excessive for its content. “Hitesh was very clear about what he wanted. He has written the script so well. It’s a little farcical also,” she says.

Gupta admits that the issues around homophobia that the film brings up are deep-rooted and not easy for our society to get rid of but she is also confident that the film will make a difference in how people and especially parents look upon homosexuality. “This is a very happy and positive film,” she states, admiring the way its two leads, Ayushmann Khurrana and Jitendra Kumar, have played their characters, sensitively and free of the stereotypes seen so often in mainstream Hindi cinema. “You fall in love with these two guys,” Gupta asserts.

With films like Vikas Khanna’s The Last Color, Gwalior and Nikkhil Advani’s as yet untitled project and web series like Panchayat and Masaba Masaba about daughter Masaba Gupta slated for release, Gupta has a busy year ahead. Reflecting on the big lessons learnt through the career highs and lows, Gupta says that she realises how important reaching out for work is. “I am trying to do it as much as I can,” she notes, while emphasising on the necessity of keeping fit, “So that when work comes [your way], you are able to do it.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/7o9y9r/article30862540.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/OV18075pp,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/the-film-will-make-a-difference-neena-gupta-on-shubh-mangal-zyada-saavdhan/article30862541.ece
174,2020/02/19,This is what SJ Suryah is dreaming about in ‘Bommai’,"We interact with the cast and crew of SJ Suryah and Priya Bhavani Shankar-starrer, which is directed by Radha Mohan

This is not exactly Being John Malkovich but we find ourselves inside the head of actor-director SJ Suryah on a bright and sunny afternoon.

He is dreaming, and he has a dream girl for company. The portal that leads us into this castle in the air Suryah has built is the Thaamara Studioz in Vadapalani.

Dressed in a solid deep green shirt and black trousers, the actor, sporting hazel loafers and wearing a relaxed smile on his face, greets us. Known for his preference for dabbling in films that explore the human psyche, Suryah explains the reason he decided to produce and star in director Radha Mohan’s Bommai, whose cast includes Priya Bhavani Shankar, his co-star from the film Monster.

“The reason is the script and director. Radha Mohan is a fantastic filmmaker, and he has a great reputation among the family and class audience. With this film, he will reach the B and C centre audience as well,” he says.

Pursuit of perfection

It is on this film’s set we engage the actor in a brief conversation, after watching his many attempts to achieve ‘the perfect shot’ for a song sequence.

“Anybody who loves their job... they must seek perfection. Look, perfection has no end but we must seek it to the extent we can, and to the extent our knowledge of perfection extends. We must seek perfection to our satisfaction,” he says.

This drive for perfection is what that has bowled over Radha Mohan. Says the filmmaker, who is dressed casually in a yellow tee, of Suryah, “His sincerity and the way he surrendered himself to the script... it is one quality that I liked in him. He is very hard working.”

Suryah’s eccentricity is the stuff of legend in film circles. Priya Bhavani Shankar agrees... after all she had a ringside view of it in their previous film, Monster.

Today was no exception, as she watches the filmmaker encourage himself, yelling out to the jimmy jib operator — “Dai Jimmy... vaada, one more take.. come on, come on,” says Suryah — and profusely apologises to her, as he requests one more take for the nth time while trying to replicate what dance choreographer Raju Sundaram asks of him for a song that goes ‘Mutham... muthal mutham’ (sung by Yuvan Shankar Raja).

“I’m not surprised by how it went. That is how it generally is...” says Priya, who is dressed in a yellow sari paired with a sequined blouse and who looks every bit like the woman Mysskin from the 2000s would dream about, when we ask her of the number of takes.

It seems difficult to redo it over and again, especially when it is a bit nuanced.

Raju Sundaram tells her to gently nudge Suryah with the elbow as she approaches her for an intimate moment. Priya must then move closer to the actor who is on the floor, and as he approaches her for another intimate moment, she must push him away... and then the dance choreographer would say, “Cut”, provided they film it right.

“I think he (Suryah) was just getting some practice,” Priya says, laughing, and adds: “They (crew) would always want something better, and you get more tuned [to their expectations] when you go for more number of takes.”

Suryah offers a more nuanced take. “You can look at it two ways. If I go for more number of takes, it could be because I’m a perfectionist or because of my inefficiency. I like to think it is the latter in my case,” he likes.

Creating an illusion

While this is happening on one side, cinematographer Richard M Nathan is busy at work. It is not exactly clear as we walk in to the studio as to why the actors are on a makeshift stage with bundles of hay stack and sand for company.

Cinematographer Richard M Nathan gestures at members of the film’s technical crew | Photo Credit: B Velankanni Raj

As we peep into watch the frames set by the cinematographer, it is even more confusing. He has gone for wide angles and overhead shots, which captures the blue walls and the floor around the stage.

“Oh, this sequence will be altered using Computer-Generated Imagery (CGI),” Richard clarifies. “We are only going to use the contact points of the artistes. The rest of it will look like they are standing on top of a mountain. It will be a night sequence. It may look bright now but we will bring it down in post production. They will be on top of a mountain with the moon and stars as background,” he adds.

As Raju Sundaram moves to his next shot — a long shot of Suryah dancing in the background on the makeshift stage, and as the camera moves away from him, Priya emerges on the left; she is standing on a tiny wooden box a few feet away from Suryah — we ask Radha Mohan, a little about what to expect in the film.

Does the name Bommai mean, Priya is a mannequin who comes to life in the mind of this disturbed individual’s character played by Suryah? “Something like that,” the director says, “This film is like a mind game. It is intense but has its lighter moments.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/xux8eb/article30862207.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MPBOMMAI,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/this-is-what-sj-suryah-is-dreaming-about-in-bommai/article30862216.ece
175,2020/02/19,Ana de Armas on playing Marilyn Monroe in Netflix’s ‘Blonde’: ‘It’s a groundbreaking moment’,"The ‘Knives Out’ star is ecstatic about the first time that a Cuban actor is playing the Hollywood icon

Knives Out star Ana de Armas says essaying the role of Marilyn Monroe in upcoming movie Blonde is a groundbreaking moment for her as it is for the first time that a Cuban actor is playing the Hollywood icon.

The Andrew Dominik film, about the 1950s star, is based on the novel of the same name by Joyce Carol Oates.

In a cover interview with Vanity Fair, de Armas said though the director was convinced after the first audition, she had to do more auditions for the “money people.”

“I only had to audition for Marilyn once and Andrew said ‘It’s you,’ but I had to audition for everyone else. The producers. The money people. I always have people I needed to convince,” the actor said, adding that she was convinced about pulling off the role.

“Playing Marilyn was groundbreaking. A Cuban playing Marilyn Monroe. I wanted it so badly. You see that famous photo of her and she is smiling in the moment, but that’s just a slice of what she was really going through at the time,” de Armas added.

The actor said her partnership with Dominik for the film was much more collaborative than most of her previous stints with directors such as Rian Johnson, Denis Villeneuve and Cary Joji Fukunaga.

“I have never worked more closely with a director than I worked with Andrew. Yes, I have had collaborative relationships, but to get phone calls at midnight because he has an idea and he can’t sleep and all of a sudden you can’t sleep for the same reason...” de Armas said.

Her Knives Out co-star Jamie Lee Curtis, whose father had famously featured with Monroe in Billy Wilder’s 1959 romantic comedy Some Like It Hot, told the outlet that she was amazed with de Armas as she disappeared into the role after watching her screen test footage.

“I remember when she showed me a video of her screen tests for Blonde, I dropped to the floor. I couldn’t believe it. Ana was completely gone. She was Marilyn,” Curtis said.

Blonde, which hails from Netflix stable, is produced by Brad Pitt’s Plan B Entertainment banner. The film is expected to release later this year.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/wbb3uj/article30861535.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/77THANNUALGOLDENGLOBEAWARDS-ARRIVALS,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/ana-de-armas-on-playing-marilyn-monroe-in-netflixs-blonde-its-a-groundbreaking-moment/article30861536.ece
176,2020/02/19,"‘Killers of the Flower Moon’ first western of his career, says Martin Scorsese","The movie, starring Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio, is set in 1920s Oklahoma and centres around the Osage Nation murders

Veteran filmmaker Martin Scorsese has described his next directorial Killers of the Flower Moon, featuring his favourite leading men Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio, as the first “western” of his career.

The film, based on David Grann’s historical book of the same name, is set in 1920s Oklahoma and centres around the Osage Nation murders, in which members of the Native American tribe were murdered one by one after the group became rich off the oil found underneath their land.

The Irishman director shared the details of the much-awaited project during his interview with French outlet Premiere.

“We think it’s a Western. It happened in 1921-1922 in Oklahoma. There are certainly cowboys, but they have cars and also horses. The film is mainly about the Osage, an Indian tribe that was given horrible territory, which they loved because they said to themselves that Whites would never be interested in it. Then we discovered oil there and, for about ten years, the Osage became the richest people in the world, per capita.Then, as with the Yukon and the Colorado mining regions, the vultures disembark, the White man, the European arrives, and all was lost. There, the underworld had such control over everything that you were more likely to go to jail for killing a dog than for killing an Indian,” Scorsese said.

The 77-year-old filmmaker said besides DiCaprio and De Niro, the film will predominantly have Native American actors featuring in it.

“Leonardo DiCaprio will play the main role, Bob (De Niro) will return to play William Hale, the “king of the Osage hills”, the man responsible for most of the murders. For the rest, they will be Native American actors,” he said.

Scorsese said he is more interested in exploring the mentality that leads people into committing a genocide.

“The history of civilization goes back to Mesopotamia. The Hittites are invaded by another people, they disappear and later, it is said that they have been assimilated, or rather, absorbed...It is fascinating to see this mentality which is reproduced in other cultures, through two world wars. And which is therefore timeless, I think. Finally, this is the film that we are going to try to make,” the director added.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/7u8dbi/article30861477.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FILMGROWNUPMOVIES,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/killers-of-the-flower-moon-first-western-of-his-career-says-martin-scorsese/article30861478.ece
177,2020/02/19,"I was devastated when Mysskin called me a ‘sidekick’: Prasanna on playing 'second-hero' roles, and his upcoming 'Mafia'","In a personal and in-depth conversation, Prasanna talks about his next release, the hardships he faced and about being relegated to second-fiddle characters in Tamil cinema

They say that the greatest form of resilience is the ability to accept your reality. Prasanna has displayed this quality throughout his career. He, in fact, is more resilient as a person than an actor.

He was despondent when the movies he bet on fizzled out without a trace. Decisions were taken — for the sake of survival and sometimes, for visibility. But none of this deters from the fact that he is a good performer. Prasanna could have become a marquee star had the right scripts come his way.

“There have been a few slips in my career. But I don’t regret taking those decisions,” says the actor, settling down for an interview. Excerpts:

You have spoken extensively about how you wanted to pursue acting since you were in school. Was there a particular moment that gave you conviction?

I wasn’t a noticeable student in school and was mediocre at studies. I think I was in Class VI when I played Pisiranthaiyar in a skit. That was the first time people appreciated me. That gave me confidence to follow my passion of becoming an actor.

Do you remember the moment when you first saw your name appear in the credits when ‘Five Star’ released?

Yes, it was magical to say the least. I knew nothing about cinema. I was like a puppet ready to give my strings to the director. I remember watching the first show at Sathyam Cinemas and again in Maris Theatre in my hometown [Trichy]. People recognised me when I walked out and that was a moral boost for me.

You had no connections in the industry. How were your initial years as a budding actor?

It was quite tough because I had to learn everything about the industry myself, which took sometime until Azhagiya Theeye happened. Up till that point, I had done a few movies just for the sake of bread and butter. So, in that sense, Azhagiya Theeye was a path-breaker for me. Prakash Raj sir and Radha Mohan sir nurtured me and helped me identify the kind of movies I wanted to be part of. Then again, I was left to survive on my own and learned from my mistakes.

The failure of ‘Azhagiya Theeye’ took a toll on you. Did you worry about where your career was headed?

Not at all. At that point, I was thoroughly enjoying the experience. Even before I could fathom the market standards, Prakash Raj sir promised me another movie, which was Kanda Naal Mudhal.

Wasn’t it successful?

Kanda Naal Mudhal was my first 100-day movie. But that 100-day mark was still not enough for the industry people to notice that the movie was a superhit. Numbers mattered then and now. I still don’t know its budget and how much it collected.

At script level, were you convinced that ‘Kanda Naal Mudhal’ could be your big break?

No, I think I was too naive to judge what a movie would do to me. At that point, I was fortunate to have signed a movie that had a large canvas with big names [Priya, PC Sreeram, Yuvan Shankar Raja and Sreekar Prasad] involved. I’m so happy that Kanda Naal Mudhal has got a long shelf life.

When I met actor Pasupathy, he said that the industry read him differently because he was doing character-driven roles and at the same time, he was doing commercial movies. Do you have similar thoughts?

To a certain extent, yes. The industry is hero-driven. If you are not a hero, then it is always seen as one step down, however great your performance. That’s a reality one needs to accept.

Do you mean to say that there is space for someone like Ayushmann Khurrana, which you did not have?

Definitely. I’m saying this since you mentioned his name. He did Kalyana Samayal Saadham (KSS) in Hindi [as Shubh Mangal Saavdhan]. It turned things for him and interesting scripts came his way. But that’s not the case with me. KSS wasn’t very successful. However great the content might be, if it doesn’t get those numbers, it goes unnoticed.

You couldn’t break into a section of the audience since you mostly played urban characters.

But I won’t take the blame for that (laughs). I have never been offered a rural subject and people typecast me [chocolate boy] roles. I finally did a movie called Kaala Koothu. I was neither happy with the script nor the title. But I said okay because it had a Madurai background. I didn’t want to wait longer and jumped at the opportunity to show people that I’m capable of doing a village-centric movie.

A rural character will guarantee you the B and Cs. Is that the benchmark for actors?

At least that’s how industry insiders look at it. Only very few appreciate the quality to show different shades to a character, in terms of casting.

An actor’s diary Prasanna feels that the character played in Power Paandi was a rare instance when a role was written for him. “I was hesitant when Dhanush sir called me because I was making a comeback, in which he wasn’t the hero,” he says, adding, “But he called me and said, ‘I thought about you while writing it. I don’t have a second option.’ When someone like Dhanush says such sweet things, you don’t think twice.”

Prasanna has a slew of projects lined up for release. He will be seen in Thupparivaalan 2, also starring Vishal. The actor has also signed a bilingual with Game Over director Ashwin Saravanan.

But you broke the perception people had on you with ‘Anjathey’, wherein you played a morally-flawed character. Did you have any second thoughts?

Not really. I’m proud about having done Daya. Though he was morally corrupt and sexually assaulted women in the movie, none of it was displayed on screen. Cinema is a visual medium, but the character was able to give you the chills without making you feel uneasy. That’s where Anjathey stood out.

Are you talking about the scene where he leers at a woman using a mirror?

Yes. It was left for the audience’s imagination and wasn’t visually imposed on them. They knew he was looking at her, in the least provocative way.

Do you expect your characters to be politically-correct? What if you were to play someone who assaults women?

Let’s not even go to that extent because I have never been part of a movie that encouraged stalking. I don’t know whether it’s my upbringing or association, those scripts never excited me.

Actor Raja once told me that he did not make an effort to seek out to filmmakers during the prime of his career. Did you try putting a word to filmmakers?

Both me and Raja sir are the same on some level (laughs). Somehow I never really liked the idea of introducing oneself to a filmmaker, hoping that someday he would give a call. But I did try and meet filmmakers when I took that sabbatical. Some of them were gentle and kind. The rest were condescending and looked down upon me. Having worked almost two decades in the industry, I didn’t want to compromise myself for work.

Could it also be because of your wild choices? Like playing a father in ‘Achchamundu Achchamundu’ or an impotent person in ‘KSS’?

No. More than the hero I wanted to become, the artiste in me was more excited about these projects. I remember a lot of people asking me about playing an impotent person in KSS. Not even for a second was I worried about it because I loved the script and character. I had other issues, though.

Which were?

The upper caste backdrop it had. I didn’t want that to be a negative point for the movie, which, I believe, still is. Had it had a different backdrop, it might have had the chance to reach a wider audience.

Do you think a movie like ‘KSS’ is possible today, given the caste tag associated with it?

KSS is potent as a concept even today, though it’s about impotence (laughs). But yeah, the upper caste setting could have been avoided.

What was running through your mind when you took that break post ‘KSS’?

I was out of work for two-and-a-half years. Sneha [his actress-wife] supported me through my rough patch. Also, I needed that time to unwind and rejuvenate myself.

When you made a comeback, you fell into The Curse of the Second Fiddle characters, be it ‘Nibunan’, ‘Thupparivaalan’ or ‘Power Paandi’…

I don’t regret taking up dual hero subjects. I was trying to figure out an alternate route to find people’s love and acceptance. But I’m sure I am going to bounce back as a hero. I’m just waiting for that one movie.

How frustrating is it when people say you’re under-utilised?

Honestly, nothing frustrates me any more (laughs). I look at the positive side when they say I’m under-utilised. It suggests that I’m a good actor and have potential. But one thing frustrated me recently.

Which was?

We were shooting for Thupparivaalan 2 in London. I had asked Mysskin to write a stronger role this time, which he did. There was some discussion related to costumes with a London-based designer. Mysskin was giving inputs and I began to play the middleman’s role because I understand him better. I ended up picking clothes for Vishal and the costume designer asked who I was. Even before I could answer, Mysskin jumped in and said that I’m also an actor who plays a ‘sidekick’. That destroyed me. Of all people, I didn’t want Mysskin to use that word, having known me for years.

In ‘Mafia’, Karthick Naren reportedly wrote this particular character keeping you in mind.

Thanks to directors like him who believe in the actor in me and are willing to offer that space for me to prove myself.

Do you think we have come to a point where filmmakers are writing characters for actors and not for heroes?

I wouldn’t completely agree. Given the odds, Karthick Naren would still want to make a movie where I play the protagonist. But you need a producer to green light such a project.

Was Raymond Reddington from ‘The Blacklist’ the inspiration for your character?

I believe it was a calling when Karthick narrated the script. Very few movies extract the best out of you. For example, I was just myself in Kanda Naal Mudhal and didn’t have to do anything different. But there are certain characters that require efforts to understand the nuances. Raymond Reddington kept coming back to me when I was offered Mafia. I was heavily influenced by The Blacklist, although I haven’t aped Reddington here.

‘Mafia’ is a dual-hero subject, but it has been marketed as an Arun Vijay film. Did that bother you?

I have understood the fact that this is a hero-driven industry. Plus, I can’t think of the last movie that had the antagonist’s name in the promotional material.

There was ‘Yennai Arindhaal’...

Oh, yes. But that was one of the rare instances. It’s just an industry practice. On top of that, Arun Vijay hasn’t come to this position so easily. He went through a personal struggle himself. What I have learned from him is to be prepared — both physically and mentally — when the right opportunity arises.

Arun Vijay got an ‘Yennai Arindhaal’, which opened doors for him. Do you think ‘Valimai’ could have been that movie for you?

Definitely. A star vehicle has its own charm. Who was Arun Vijay before Yennai Arindhaal? He has always been a consistent performer. But it had the mass factor in the form of Ajith sir and Gautham Menon sir. So naturally, you get more visibility. I’m doing movies like Mafia and Thupparivaalan 2 for that push to happen.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/ta0hix/article30860969.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG8757jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/prasanna-talks-about-mafia/article30860970.ece
178,2020/02/19,‘Jagame Thanthiram’: Dhanush-Karthik Subbaraj film’s first look channels the ‘Last Supper’,"The action-thriller set in London has release of May 1, 2020

The title of Dhanush’s 40th film, ‘D40’, as it had been referred to until now, has been revealed to be Jagame Thanthiram.

Directed by Karthik Subbaraj and produced by YNOT Studios, the film is billed to be an action-thriller set in London, and the first looks and motion poster of the film released today, raises expectations sky-high.

After taking us through a couple of the central characters, the footage focuses on Dhanush armed with an array of guns, and finally ends with the cast of the film (in character) sitting at a table with food and booze, in a Last Supper-inspired setting.

The Last Supper is a 15th-century painting by Italian artist Leonardo Da Vinci that can be found at the refectory of of the Convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan, Italy.

Dhanush had posted earlier that Jagame Thanthiram was one of the quickest films he had done. “It was a pleasure to work with such a quirky, sensible and visionary film maker like @karthiksubbaraj this one is going to be special.” The pair have been mutually appreciative of each other’s knowledge of the craft in public since starting to work together. “Thanks a lot @dhanushkraja sir for the kind words... It was a great experience for me and the team to work with an awesome actor like you....,” Subbaraj posted in reply to Dhanush’s Twitter post.

Produced by YNOT Studios, the film also stars Aishwarya Lekshmi, Game of Thrones actor James Cosmo, Joju George and Kalaiyarasan among others. It has music by Santhosh Narayanan and cinematography by Shreyaas Krishna, and is set for release on May 1, 2020.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/jgpy6q/article30861000.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/d40,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/jagame-thanthiram-dhanush-karthik-subbaraj-films-first-look-channels-the-last-supper/article30860968.ece

A special motion poster for Rajinikanth’s television debut on Discovery Channel with Into The Wild with Bear Grylls has been released, that shows with Superstar posing with the TV host and survival skills expert.

With the duo standing next to a jeep, the poster sets the tone for the much-awaited episode, that will see Rajinikanth on a TV shows, 43 years since his debut.

The star had said earlier that the show “is a perfect platform to take the message of conserving water to every home across the country.” This special program of Man vs. Wild is expected to be themed around water conservation, and Rajinikanth added that every Indian will need to come forward and contribute as “this war has to be led at all levels including government, community as well as on the individual front.”

According to sources, much of the sequences was shot at Moolehole, Maddur, and G.S. Betta Range and permission was given to film between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. only. Last year, a similar special episode on Discovery starred PM Modi, and was shot in Jim Corbett National Park in Uttarakhand, themed on wildlife conservation.

Grylls was also quoted as saying that his team was “very excited to work closely with” the Superstar. “Much more than a cine star, Rajinikanth is a phenomenon who has captivated audiences across the world with his on-screen and off-screen work,” said Grylls, adding, “He has always shown such energy and flair in all he does and he will need that courage and determination again on our journey into the beautiful wilds of India.”

181,2020/02/19,When Mark Ruffalo reached out to compliment Irrfan Khan,"The incident that took place perhaps around 2010 is one of the many anecdotes mentioned in Aseem Chhabra's 'Irrfan Khan: The Man, The Dreamer, The Star', a biographical work on the 53-year-old actor.

Soon after the success of the Oscar-winning Slumdog Millionaire, actor Irrfan Khan once happened to be sitting in the same restaurant as Mark Ruffalo in New York, hoping to interact with the Hollywood star but to no avail.

As the Avengers: Endgame star was about to leave, a disappointed Irrfan was met with surprise when Ruffalo himself recognised the Indian actor, reached out to him and complimented him on his work.

The incident that took place perhaps around 2010 is one of the many anecdotes mentioned in Aseem Chhabra's Irrfan Khan: The Man, The Dreamer, The Star, a biographical work on the 53-year-old actor.

According to the book, Irrfan and Indian director-screenwriter Aditya Bhattacharya were once having a brunch at a well-known restaurant in New York City with producer Leslie Holleran (The Cider House Rules, 1999 and Chocolat, 2000). This was the year after the huge success of Danny Boyle's Slumdog Millionaire.

“Suddenly Irrfan elbowed Aditya. He had noticed that actor Mark Ruffalo was sitting on the next table. But he was there with a large group of people, perhaps his family. Irrfan told Aditya that he was a big fan of Mark and somehow wanted an introduction.”

“'I asked Leslie if she knew him, and she said she did, but she didn't feel like walking up to Mark,' Aditya says. 'She said it didn't look right. But I could also see Irrfan thinking, 'Hello toh bolte hain' (Let's at least say hello),"" the book states.

“When we were leaving, Irrfan looked disappointed, but then something incredible happened,' Aditya adds. 'Mark saw him, put his hand forward and said, 'Hey man, I love your work'. And Irrfan probably saw sparkling lights all over',” Aditya is quoted as saying in the book.

Brought out by Rupa Publications, the book is a third biography of an Indian cinestar by Chhabra, who has previously come out with works on the late Shashi Kapoor in 2016 and Priyanka Chopra in 2018.

The book draws largely from personal interviews of people and artistes associated with the actor throughout his journey from a small household in Rajasthan's Tonk to drama school in Delhi to Mumbai and then becoming a globally recognised artiste with his billboards now in Hollywood.

Launched in January, it also attempts at deconstructing several of Irrfan's performances on screen, both in Hindi and English.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/b5hm15/article30859724.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/irrfan-and-mark,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/when-mark-ruffalo-reached-out-to-compliment-irrfan-khan/article30859725.ece
182,2020/02/19,Vishwak Sen is on his mark for a 'HIT',"The Telugu actor opens up on his new thriller produced by Nani and Prashanti, in which he plays a tough cop

A few days ago, actor Vishwak Sen posted a photograph on Instagram, showing him lounging in a bathtub and stated that it’s an image of him from the future, relaxing with a ‘HIT’ after February 28. HIT is the title of his new film and stands for ‘Homicide Intervention Team’. The action thriller written and directed by debutant Sailesh Kolanu has Vishwak as a cop named Vikram Rudraraju, on the trail of a missing woman.

Vishwak Sen in a still from the film

Vishwak sounds confident about the film produced by actor Nani and stylist Prashanti Tipirneni through their production house Wall Poster Cinema.

“I’ve always wanted to be a part of good stories,” says Vishwak, who starred in and directed Falaknuma Das, the Telugu adaptation of the Malayalam film Angamaly Diaries, last year. He was approached for HIT after the project was green-lit by Nani and Prashanti. It took Vishwak one narration of the story to get on board, “Usually I take two to three days to confirm a new project, but in this case, I said yes immediately,” he says.

His appreciation for the script and Sailesh’s vision of translating it to the large screen comes through when Vishwak says, “It’s a cop thriller presented from a new perspective and Sailesh was absolutely clear how he wanted to make the film. He had a ready-to-shoot script.” Vishwak had signed a couple of other projects but decided to shoot for HIT first, and went ahead with the permission of producers of the other projects.

Vishwak debuted with Vellipomakey, a small film that was applauded but didn’t make noise at the box office. Tharun Bhascker’s buddy comedy Ee Nagaraniki Emaindi where he played an aspiring filmmaker got him noticed. And Falaknuma Das had the street gangster vibe. Playing a cop is a first for Vishwak and the actor says, “I play a sophisticated IPS officer, but the role isn’t simple. There’s something mysterious about him and an incident from the past has affected him. I think this film has managed to bring out the best in me as an actor, among the films I’ve done so far.”

The trailer shows glimpses of him as a cop with a past. Vishwak reveals that he plays a 30-year-old cop and the director wanted him to look slightly unfit and raw, to keep it real. And Vishwak had to understand the character’s backstory to portray him effectively: “Sailesh had met senior police officers and had minutely observed their behaviour, all of which reflects in my character. For each film, I do a workshop so that once we begin to shoot, there’s no confusion on set.”

HIT was filmed over three months and Vishwak shot his portions for 50 days. He had decided to work on one film at a time to give his unwavering attention to a project: “A considerable portion of the film unfolds in rains and we shot in the jungles. I was drenched to the bone. While filming, there would be a 15 to 20-minute break when they change the position of the lights and camera for a shot. Just so that I don’t look dry when the camera rolls again, they would drench me in water all over again,” says Vishwak.

Did all that filming in water take a toll on him? “No, luckily I don’t fall sick easily. But on the last day of shoot I lost my voice. I had to do quite a few screaming scenes and that affected me. We took a break and resumed shooting after I regained my voice,” he says.

The film with background score by Vivek Sagar and cinematography by Manikandan, keeps the narrative as realistic as possible, and has its share of action sequences. Vishwak assures that the fights, too, seem realistic with “due respect to medicine and physics”.

HIT is a film Vishwak enjoyed being just an actor, after Falaknuma Das where he was both directing and acting. “When I am an actor, I don’t interfere with direction. Every film needs to breathe, and if too many people meddle with it, it will be evident on screen,” he adds.

As a child, Vishwak remembers being a fan of thrillers and later warmed up to other genres. Of late he’s been drawn to dramas. “Drama is a tough genre. Imagine creating a tense atmosphere with just two people in a room,” he says. Like Vikram Vedha (the Tamil film starring R Madhavan and Vijay Sethupathi)? “Yes, each genre has its own complexities,” says Vishwak.

The actor-writer has two concepts that he intends to flesh out into stories and scripts but admits that at the moment, he’s not in the zone of writing. He’s acting in the entertainer titled Paagal and another new project.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/h47v1d/article30859505.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Vishwak-Sen-new,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/vishwak-sen-talks-about-his-role-in-the-action-thriller-hit-homicide-intervention-team/article30859509.ece

184,2020/02/19,Sales of Spanish potato chip company boom after appearance in ‘Parasite’,"87-year-old Cesar Bonilla, who owns the company Bonilla a La Vista, is grateful to ‘Parasite’ director Bong Joon-ho

Cesar Bonilla is still baffled by a surge in demand for the canned potato chips made by his company in northwestern Spain after they appeared in award-winning Korean film Parasite.

The movie this month became the first non-English language film to win an Oscar in the Best Picture category and the 87-year-old Bonilla is grateful to its director Bong Joon-ho.

“I’d say to him a thousand thanks and I have tears in my eyes when I think about it,” Bonilla told Reuters while watching a clip from the dark comedy in which the scheming Kim family feasts on food and drink at the house of their rich employers.

“It was a mystery how this movie showed this can of Bonilla a La Vista, made with so much affection and hope, and then the movie got so distinguished. My hope has been fulfilled,” Bonilla added.

Parasite also snapped up awards for the Best Director, Best Original Screenplay and Best International Feature after last year becoming the first South Korean film to win the Palme d’Or in Cannes.

Cesar Bonilla, 87, poses for a portrait next to his motorcycle, which he used to distribute potatoes around the city of Coruna, inside Bonilla a la Vista factory in Arteixo, near Coruna, Spain | Photo Credit: NACHO DOCE

Bonilla’s family-run company’s online sales in Spain surged 150% and distributors have been increasing orders at home and abroad. Four more staff have been hired, adding to around 100 employees.

“Now that we are selling a lot with all this impact, we hired people because otherwise we can’t cope,” Bonilla said.

The company makes 540 tonnes of crisps per year, exporting 60 tonnes to 20 countries. South Korea, where the crisps were popular with high-end consumers long before the movie’s release, accounts for the bulk of exports, around 40 tonnes.

Cesar’s father Salvador started the company in 1932 selling from a market stand. A former navy sailor, he modelled the company’s name on his standard reply to a duty officer: “Bonilla here!”

Cesar started delivering the product, fried and canned by his mother, on a motorbike in 1950 and later decided to open a proper factory, sticking to tins as his main trademark packaging because they preserved the flavour so well.

Clients and friends alerted the company after seeing the distinctive can on the big screen.

“We never thought we could get this far with a can of crisps. It moves me a lot as it should move anyone knowing that you are making something that gets so much acceptance. Makes me proud,” Bonilla said.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/7ur2e4/article30859413.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/patatasss,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/sales-of-spanish-potato-chip-company-boom-after-appearance-in-parasite/article30859414.ece
185,2020/02/19,Interview with Oscar-winner Marshall Curry: ‘The Neighbor’s Window’ is an allegory about social media,"The filmmaker speaks to us about the emotional rollercoaster of making the live-action short film, which won at the 92nd Academy Awards

The success of a short film is far more conditional than that of a feature-length project; it has to excel in its structure, it has to build empathy, reveal a quest, resolve said quest, feature a call to action and have elements of unpredictability — all in a very short time span.

The 2020 Academy Award-winner for Best Live Action Short Film is New York-based Marshall Curry’s The Neighbor’s Window, and it certainly meets all expectations of this checklist and then some. Marshall has made documentary films over the course of many years; in fact three of his documentaries — Street Fight (2005), If A Tree Falls: A Story of the Earth Liberation Front (2011) and A Night At The Garden (2017) — have been nominated for Academy Awards.

In an email interview with MetroPlus, Marshall recalls the storytelling process behind The Neighbor’s Window. He starts, “It was interesting to learn how similar the grammar of fiction filmmaking is to that of non-fiction filmmaking. In both cases, we are using wide shots and closeups and edited dialogue to build a movie with emotion that rises and falls and changes. The big challenge for me with directing fiction was shooting out of order, which makes it much more difficult to keep track of how emotions build and fall in the course of a scene. For example we shot the second half of an argument on one day and the first half the next day – that’s pretty tricky to remember exactly how much energy was in a performance at any given edit point.”

Filmmaking freedoms

Marshall believes mainstream filmmakers who have not dipped into shorts are missing out. “I think making short films is a great challenge – trying to tell a story that can have emotional turns and a sense of completeness in a short burst. They are usually much cheaper to make than features, so there is a freedom of pure artistry that is really nice. You don’t have to worry about whether an idea will perform in the box office – you simply have the freedom to tell a story that touches you, to make it the way that you want and to share it with the world.”

The Neighbor’s Window presented a lot of new challenges for Marshall, such as working with actors, pre-blocking every action and camera set-up. “When I made documentaries, everything is improvised – we just chase life and do the best we can. But in fiction films there is so much more control and exercising that control was all new for me.”

A still from ‘The Neighbor’s Window’ with Maria Dizzia as Alli. Directed by Marshall Curry.

Themes of voyeurism and nostalgia are very much a part of The Neighbor’s Window’s fabric. “Those themes were built into the very initial concept for the film. My film is inspired by a story that I heard on a podcast called Love and Radio, about a woman whose life is shaken up when a young couple moves in across the street from her. When I heard that story I was really moved and it inspired me to write the script.”

Over the past few years, there has been a shift in consciousness towards short films. Marshall imagines that the ability to stream short films on the Internet has made a big differnence in the size of audiences, adding, “It’s now possible to share short films with millions of people who would have had no way to see them just a few years ago.” Platforms such as Shorts TV (available via Tata Sky, Dish TV, d2H and Airtel Digital TV in India) have aggrandised the visibility of shorts filmmakers. Plus, ShortsTV will soon be launching their OTT app for the Indian audience.

Remarkably, the film has no presence of digital or social media, just a set of windows and a pair of binoculars. “[This] was just a natural result of the story,” he agrees, “In a way, however, the film is an allegory about social media – the way that we look into each other’s lives online and get these glimpses that feel so intimate but rarely tell the whole story.”

‘A strong emotional turn’

Marshall points out that the film covers “a very long period of time – 18 months or so – and it was hard to compress that into 20 minutes. It also has a strong emotional turn about half-way through, and it was tricky to make that feel natural. Fortunately I worked with amazing actors, including Maria Dizzia, who has such a subtlety to her performance and can convey so much in the smallest expressions.” But The Neighbor’s Window takes audiences on an unusual emotional rollercoaster.

Without spilling any spoilers, Marshall says his intention was to begin the film “with a sense of light humor to draw the audience in, but in the second and third scene, I tried to make the emotions deepen – and darken a bit – until the end. A lot of that was worked out in the script and a lot of it just came out from the actors in their performance. I think that life often has turns like this that happen suddenly, so we were all working to try to trace those contours in a way that felt natural.”

The political climates in the United States and in India have been turbulent with dissent and revolution, but The Neighbor’s Window, in its simplicity, does not entirely ignore this; the film invites thought about empathy for one’s neighbour, whoever they may be. Marshall affirms this, explaining, “It is a difficult time in America and in the world right now. People have been whipped up by demagogues who want us to demonise each other, to discriminate against strangers who might have different religions or skin color or lifestyles than we do. So I hoped that in a small way, the film would remind people to be gentle with each other and realise that everyone is struggling with something.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/62tsh1/article30859384.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy19-theneighborswindow2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/oscar-winning-live-action-short-the-neighbors-window-interview-with-marshall-curry-an-allegory-os-social-media/article30859388.ece
186,2020/02/19,Ben Affleck left ‘The Batman’ fearing that he’d ‘drink himself to death’,"Actor finally reveals why he decided to step away from the superhero character, paving the way for Robert Pattinson to become the new caped crusader of Gotham

Hollywood star Ben Affleck has finally broken his silence about his decision to move away from starring in the titular role as The Batman, which he was also attached to direct.

The actor, who played the Dark Knight in three films in the DC Entertainment Universe, revealed that alcoholism, his divorce from actor Jennifer Garner, and a “troubled shoot” on Justice League prompted him to abandon the role.

“I showed somebody The Batman script. They said, ‘I think the script is good. I also think you’ll drink yourself to death if you go through what you just went through again’,” Affleck told the New York Times.

The Oscar winner made the revelation more than a year after he announced his departure from the film.

Director Matt Reeves, best known for sci-fi series Dawn of the Planet of the Apes and War for the Planet of the Apes, stepped in for Affleck and Robert Pattinson took on the lead role. Reeves had co-written the script with the actor but later opted to pen his own version.

Affleck first donned the cowl in 2016’s Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and went on to reprise the role in an uncredited turn as Batman in Suicide Squad the same year. Justice League was his last appearance as the Caped Crusader.

The 47-year-old actor has not be very vocal about his alcohol issues since he completed a third stint in a rehabilitation facility in 2018. He had then checked into a rehab at the insistence of Garner. He did his first two stints in 2001 and 2017.

“Relapse is embarrassing, obviously. I wish it didn’t happen. I really wish it wasn’t on the Internet for my kids to see. Jen and I did our best to address it and be honest... I drank relatively normally for a long time. What happened was that I started drinking more and more when my marriage was falling apart. This was 2015, 2016. My drinking, of course, created more marital problems,” he recalled.

Affleck said his divorce from Garner is the “biggest regret” of his life.

The former couple married in 2005 and have daughters Violet, 14; Seraphina, 11, and son Samuel, 7 together. They parted ways in 2018 after a long separation.

He said he still felt guilt but had moved past shame.

“The biggest regret of my life is this divorce. Shame is really toxic. There is no positive byproduct of shame. It’s just stewing in a toxic, hideous feeling of low self-worth and self-loathing.”

The actor described the now sober and fellow stars Bradley Cooper and Robert Downey Jr as “guys who have been very supportive and to whom I feel a great sense of gratitude.”

“One of the things about recovery that I think people sometimes overlook is the fact that it inculcates certain values. Be honest. Be accountable. Help other people. Apologise when you’re wrong,” he added.

187,2020/02/19,"Deepika Padukone reveals first look as Romi Dev, Kapil Dev’s wife, in ‘83’","The movie, directed by Kabir Khan, will chronicle India’s win under Kapil Dev’s captainship in the 1983 Cricket World Cup

Actor Deepika Padukone on Wednesday shared her first look as Romi Dev, wife of legendary cricketer Kapil Dev, from the upcoming film 83.

In the photo, which Deepika shared on social media, she is seen sporting a bob haircut and flaunting a black polo-neck top with cream bottom.

Also in the picture is actor Ranveer Singh, who plays Kapil Dev in the sports drama, in the official Team India blazer.

Deepika said, for her, 83 is an ode to every woman who prioritises her husband’s dreams over hers.

“To be able to play a small part in a film that captures one of the most iconic moments in sporting history has been an absolute honour. I’ve seen very closely the role a wife plays in the success of her husband’s professional and personal aspirations in my mother and 83 for me in many ways is an ode to every woman who puts her husband’s dream before her own,” the actor wrote on Instagram.

Ranveer too shared the same photograph on Instagram and wrote, “The wind beneath my wings. The heart of the hurricane.”

83, directed by Kabir Khan, will chronicle India’s win under Kapil Dev’s captainship, when the Men in Blue defeated West Indies in the final to clinch their first-ever World Cup trophy in 1983.

It is produced by Madhu Mantena, Vishnu Induri and Kabir Khan, and presented by Reliance Entertainment.

188,2020/02/19,Director of Oscar-winning ‘Parasite’ says he did not want to sugarcoat inequality,"“I wanted to be as candid as possible about this age of inequality. Even if it may look publicly dangerous, that was the only path this film could take,” says Bong Joon-ho

The stark inequality between two South Korean families portrayed in the Oscar-winning film Parasite might make viewers uncomfortable but it was the “only path” to revealing cold reality, the film’s director, Bong Joon-ho, said on Wednesday.

The tale of the wealthy Parks and the poor Kims became the first non-English language movie to win this year’s Oscar for best picture, and three more, sparking debate over a growing social divide in Asia’s fourth-largest economy.

“You might feel uncomfortable and dislike those scenes but I did not want to sugarcoat them,” Bong told a news conference with the film’s cast and crew in the South Korean capital of Seoul.

“I wanted to be as candid as possible about this age of inequality. Even if it may look publicly dangerous, that was the only path this film could take.”

Bong, who had paid homage to Martin Scorsese in a speech at the Oscars, said the Hollywood veteran offered congratulations and expressed expectations for his next film in a letter.

“He told me to take rest, but just a little bit of it and get back to work, as he is awaiting my next movie,” Bong said.

Accepting the best director award, Bong had cited a remark by Scorsese, also a nominee for mob drama The Irishman, to the effect that “the most personal is the most creative.”

Bong has said he was working on two projects, one of which he described as being based on a “fearful” incident in Seoul, while also producer for an HBO limited series on Parasite.

But he dismissed recent U.S. media reports that Tilda Swinton and Mark Ruffalo would star in the television adaptation, saying it was at a “very early stage.”

Bong added, “Regardless of whether I won the awards, it was meaningful and pure joy that the global audience responded to my work. Why they did it should be a long-term task (for viewers) but my job is to prepare for the next film, as Scorsese told me not to rest for a long time.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/4dnj8e/article30858948.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19NETBONGPARASITE,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/director-of-oscar-winning-parasite-says-he-did-not-want-to-sugarcoat-inequality/article30858949.ece
189,2020/02/19,"Ajith suffers bike injury during shooting of ‘Valimai’, next schedule to resume in Hyderabad","The actor is expected to make a quick recovery and resume shooting of the film directed by ‘Nerkonda Paarvai’ director H Vinoth

Actor Ajith has been involved in a minor bike accident during the shooting of his next film Valimai in which he plays a cop. The film is produced by Boney Kapoor and directed by H Vinoth, who worked with the star earlier in Nerkonda Paarvai.

After two hits with Viswasam and NKP, Ajith began shooting for Valimai earlier this year. With fans eager to see him channel his real-life passion for superbikes on screen as well, the actor (like he’s done in previous films) agreed to a fast-paced routine on his bike, which unfortunately, went awry, resulting in a fall and injuries.

However, as per reports, the actor was quick to calm everyone on set, and after a short break, resumed the shooting to finish the schedule.

Ajith was taken to see the doctor from the sets and he is expected to take a breather from shooting for a few days, before joining the Valimai team in Hyderabad for the next schedule.

Fans on Twitter started trending the hashtag #GetWellsoonThala on Twitter, wishing him a speedy recovery.

Valimai also stars Huma Qureshi who was last seen in Rajinikanth’s Kaala. The rest of the cast is expected to be announced soon, with the film aiming for Diwali 2020 release.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/tqxgn5/article30858856.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ajith,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/ajith-suffers-bike-injury-during-shooting-of-valimai-next-schedule-to-resume-in-hyderabad/article30858857.ece
190,2020/02/19,"Theatre personality Mohammad Ali Baig on acting in Vikram's 'Cobra', Netflix's 'Baauhubali' series and Telugu film 'Kalinga'","The theatre artist-turned-actor made his Kollywood debut with 'Aruvi' in 2017

As a child, Mohammad Ali Baig used to be terrified of watching his father (theatre veteran Qadir Ali Baig) on stage. “One week he’d play a Mughal emperor, and the next week he’d be a saint. The week after, he’d be a wife-beating drunkard. In a month, he’d play a war veteran on crutches,” recalls Mohammad, “I’d be so scared to venture near the green room.”

Mohammad hero-worships his father so much so that he carries a portrait of him on his person wherever he travels, a custom he follows to this day. A reluctant entrant to the theatre scene, he has since then gone on to win several accolades across the world, and is now considered as the highest-paid theatre actor in the country. He has a Kollywood link as well: after debuting in 2017’s Tamil hit Aruvi, he’s now sharing screen space with actor Vikram in his upcoming film Cobra. Excerpts from a free-wheeling chat with the actor who is in Chennai currently:

What made you join the team of Cobra?

I think it was because of my performance in Aruvi that the makers of Cobra approached me. It’s an interesting role — one that I cannot talk much about at the moment. The director (Ajay Gnanamuthu) and I worked a lot on the character’s look and behaviour. What’s most important to me is to internalise a character. I believe actors are performers, and not mimics.

Did Aruvi open the doors of Tamil cinema to you?

What I loved about Shakeel Waqaab, the IPS character I play in the film, was that he couldn’t be defined as a protagonist or antagonist. After the acclaim I got for the role, I did get a lot of offers from some of the biggest production houses in Tamil cinema. Most of them wanted me to be a cop or play the Commissioner. But that was not what I really wanted to be doing. So, I gave them all a pass till Cobra came along.

That an actor-star like Vikram plays the lead might have made your decision easier?

All my shots are with him (Vikram). He’s an extreme sweetheart and a very charming co-star. He’s blessed with not just talent but also abundant energy. That is extremely inspiring and contagious. At 4 am, he would be a bundle of energy. While most of us would be looking forward to pack up, he would be discussing his next shot.

The director is two films old, but you’re an experienced theatre personality. How did the meeting of minds happen?

An actor should always submit to the director; it’s like fluid in a bottle. You cannot come with a set mind to approach a role in a certain way and not be open to ideas. Cinema is a director’s medium.

You’re the youngest Padma Shri in theatre in India. Do filmmakers think about that while casting you?

Sometimes, it does put off people. Filmmakers are unsure about how to handle me. For them, it’s like having a boil on the palm... so they keep away. But people who know me and my work approach me.

Like the makers of upcoming Telugu film, Kalinga, in which you play the lead role?

Ah, yes. In Kalinga, I play a celebrated anthropologist in Kerala who has a tragedy, then takes to alcohol, and shifts base to Hyderabad. There, he loses his daughter, and the film is about the journey of finding her. They had spoken to a few stars earlier, but when they spoke to me, I explained what I thought about the character.

On the first day of shoot, I did what the director asked of me, and afterwards, I requested him to approach the same thing in a different way. The director was floored by that, and we have modelled the entire film based on that characterisation.

With such a rich theatre background, how did you get into films in the first place?

Shyam Benegal brought me into screen acting. He was close to my father — my dad’s first film, Ankur, was directed by him — and I’ve grown up respecting him. One day, he called me and said that he wanted me to play Jinnah in an upcoming project. He wanted an actor who is equally proficient in Hindi, English and Urdu, and who can carry tuxedos and sherwanis with equal ease. We got a whole wardrobe done, but as we were going through the script, he realised that Jinnah, in his project, was already elderly and ailing, and that I was too young to play it.

So, it didn’t happen. But I thought that it was encouraging that the first call I got from the cinema industry was from an ace filmmaker like him, and not from a casting director.

Do you take inspiration from something particular for your varied characters? Some actors say that they observe a real person to play a role...

I differ a bit there. When some actors say that I watched a real-life person to play a character, I think that’s imitating. Personally, I don’t think that’s performing. The only exception to that is when you’re playing a character in people’s memory like Mahatma Gandhi or MGR or Jayalalithaa.

Apart from your theatre productions, you are also doing a web series (Baahubali for Netflix) in which you play a warrior...

He’s not just a warrior, but also a womaniser. I had my doubts about the intimate scenes; there was some discomfort that I had with that. I think that actors have to draw their line of ethics and comfort zone when they choose a role, and be careful about what is, in his mind, a legitimate performing zone.

Of course, it can differ from one actor to another. Fortunately, the makers of Baahubali worked it out to a level of comfort that I was agreeable with.

How smooth has the transition from theatre to other mediums like cinema and OTT platforms been?

Adapting is the key. As an actor, it’s a challenge to adapt to various dynamics. With theatre, there’s strict discipline and regimen. With cinema, it’s more liberal.

For me, it’s a two-fold challenge: not only is the format different, but I’m also getting out of my comfort zone, which is my own production and direction. But I’m having fun, and that’s most important.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/stxk81/article30858532.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/2-PadmasriMohammadAliBaigJPG,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/theatre-personality-mohammad-ali-baig-on-acting-in-vikrams-cobra-netflixs-baauhubali-series-and-telugu-film-kalinga/article30858536.ece
191,2020/02/19,"Chris Hemsworth’s ‘Dhaka’ renamed ‘Extraction’, to premiere on April 24","The principal photography of the film took place in the Indian cities of Ahmedabad and Mumbai, and Bangkok and Phuket in Thailand.

“Extraction”, starring Hollywood star Chris Hemsworth, is set to start streaming from April 24, Netflix has announced.

Previously titled “Dhaka”, the film marks the directorial debut of Sam Hargrave, known for serving as second unit director on movies such as “Atomic Blonde” and “The Accountant“.

Joe Russo of the directing duo Russo Brothers, who previously collaborated with Hemsworth on Marvel films “Avengers: Infinity War” and “Avengers: Endgame”, has penned the story.

Billed as an action-packed, edge-of-your-seat thriller, “Extraction” follows Tyler Rake (Hemsworth), a fearless black market mercenary, who embarks on the most deadly extraction of his career when he’s enlisted to rescue the kidnapped son of an imprisoned international crime lord.

“But in the murky underworld of weapons dealers and drug traffickers, an already deadly mission approaches the impossible, forever altering the lives of Rake and the boy,” according to a statement from the streamer.

The principal photography of the film took place in the Indian cities of Ahmedabad and Mumbai, and Bangkok and Phuket in Thailand.

The film also features actor Randeep Hooda in a pivotal role.

The cast also includes “Stranger Things” star David Harbour, actors Golshifteh Farahani, Priyanshu Painyuli, and newcomer Rudhraksh Jaiswal.

192,2020/02/19,News Analysis | Chennai school breakfast scheme kicks up nutrition row,"Akshaya Patra Foundation’s no-garlic, no-onion ‘satvik’ food could be a precursor to privatising the “Puratchi Thalaivar MGR Nutritious Meal Programme”, fear Opposition leaders.

Tamil Nadu is no stranger to the politics of food. This time, a political controversy has broken out over the “Kaalai Unnavu Thittam” — a free breakfast scheme for the children of the Greater Chennai Corporation-run schools.

The Opposition has not only objected to the implementation of the scheme through a pact between the local body and the Akshaya Patra Foundation but has also questioned the provision of only ‘satvik’ food — sans garlic and onion — to the children. Their apprehension is that the government has overlooked the nutrition factor and that the scheme is a precursor to privatising the “Puratchi Thalaivar MGR Nutritious Meal Programme”. Presently, breakfast is provided to 5,785 children of 24 schools.

MDMK leader Vaiko has even questioned Governor Banwarilal Purohit’s decision to donate ₹5 crore from his discretionary fund for the scheme and the move to allot land on the Greams Road and the Perambur Barracks Road for establishing central kitchens for the project. “Does a Governor have the authority to gift government money to a private body,” he asked while criticising the ‘satvik’ menu. [The response from the Governor’s office is awaited.]

DMK MP Kanimozhi has charged that the government now wants to “make students who eat onion and garlic to eat what they [rulers] want”. She too felt that involving a voluntary agency would lead to privatisation of the successful nutritious meal scheme, which every government despite ideological differences had focused on expanding.

It is not as if the State had not involved philanthropic institutions in the past. In fact, senior Congress functionary A. Gopanna concedes this point in the context of the Kamaraj regime’s mid-day meal scheme in late 1950s. But “the implementation was with the government. It should remain so,” he said.

Then, why the hue and cry now? Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi MP D. Ravikumar argues that back then a resource crunch had prompted the government to seek outside help. “But, now, this is no longer the case. It is a matter of the government’s will to carry out the breakfast scheme out of its resources. Alternatively, it can tap funds from the private sector through Corporate Social Responsibility.” He also questioned why the Akshaya Patra Foundation should be chosen considering the controversy surrounding it in Karnataka.

Indeed, the ‘satvik food’ controversy echoed in the Lok Sabha last July. But Union Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ had countered it citing the stand taken by the Karnataka government that there was no change to the food, after taking the opinion from the Central Food Technological Research Institute, Mysuru, and the National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad.

As for fears of the nutritious meal scheme being ‘privatised’, a senior official categorically says, “We are not allowing anyone into the noon meal scheme.”

“It [the breakfast scheme] is an additional benefit to the kids,” argues G. Prakash, Corporation Commissioner, indicating that the State having a “very strong” department with a long history of managing such a scheme is the proof [for ensuring the continuance of the scheme].

There are however calls to closely monitor both the schemes to avoid complications. Former State Social Welfare Secretary P.M. Basheer Ahamed says the government should retain “strict control” at the points of production, distribution and consumption.

The row may acquire more intensity when the government extends the scheme to the other parts of the State, given its keenness. But it would do well to lay down guidelines for the selection of the participating firms and monitoring their performance.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/bhdurd/article30862956.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AKSHYAPATRA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/news-analysis-akshaya-patra-foundations-no-garlic-no-onion-satvik-food-in-chennai-school-breakfast-scheme-overlooks-nutrition-factor-says-opposition/article30862957.ece
193,2020/02/19,Anti-CAA protests rock Tamil Nadu,"In Chennai, the protesters’ long march to the Secretariat was curtailed by the police; the protesters were stopped on Wallajah Road; other districts too, saw thousands gather to agitate

On Wednesday morning thousands of anti-CAA protesters gathered in Chennai for a long march to the Secretariat, defying the the Madras High Court’s order and deciding to lay siege to the Secretariat. However, the protest stopped on Wallajah Road near the Chepauk stadium, and a small make-shift stage was erected for speakers.

Other parts of the State too witnessed protests, with the protesters demanding the Tamil Nadu Assembly pass a resolution stating that the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Population Register (NPR) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) will not be implemented.

In Chennai, police estimate over 30,000 protesters -- including members of the Federation of Tamil Nadu Islamic and Political Organisations -- took part in the agitation. Hundreds of police personnel were deployed, and AnnaSalai was choked with traffic from around 10.30 a.m. up until 1.15 p.m. when the protesters began dispersing. A total of 5 drones and 20 additional CCTV cameras were used to monitor the protest.

T. Velmurugan, founder, Tamizhaga Vazhvurimai Katchi, addressed the protesters as they passed through Triplicane. He appreciated the Muslim organisations for conducting the protest and said that Muslims had played an important role in India’s independence struggle. It is wrong to check their antecedents, he said.

M. H. Jawahirullah of the Tamil Nadu Muslim Munnetra Kazagham, responding to the Chief Minister's statement in the Assembly that the CAA would not affect anyone, said that if the CAA had been brought in some decades ago, even M.G.Ramachandran, whose birthplace was Kandy in Sri Lanka, would not have been here and been the Chief Minister.

“We are protesting on behalf of all people of Tamil Nadu, including you and AIADMK members,” he said.

Tiruchi

Members affiliated with various Islamic organisations took part in a protest led byJamaat Ul Ulama in front of the Tiruchi Collectorate. Over 3,000 members took part in the protest. Raising slogans, the protesters said that they would not cooperate and would refuse to show documents proving their citizenship.

Abdul Rahim, District Secretary, Jamaat Ul Ulama condemned the “inaction” of the Tamil Nadu government and said that the AIADMK is using late Chief Minister Jayalalithaa's name but is not following any of her ideologies. “Until she was alive, the BJP could not step foot into our State,” he said. The fight is not only for Muslims, it is also for the SriLankan Tamils, the poor and downtrodden, he stressed.

Coimbatore

Around 7,000 people took part in the march organised by various Muslim organisations inCoimbatore. They assembled on State Bank Road which the police had to close in view of the protest. Traffic movement toCoimbatore railway station was obstructed as protesters occupied the road.

The protesters, including women and children, held the national flag and placards saying ""No to CAA, NPR and NRC"".

Police were seen using drones for surveillance as hundreds of protesters marched towards thecollectorate.

Apart from the police strength of nearly 2,000 persons, members of the Rapid Action Force were also deployed to take care of the law and order situation. The police also kept ready water cannons to deal with the protesters if required.

Tirunelveli

Led by the Tamil Nadu Thowheed Jamath, protesters staged a dharna near the Tirunelveli District Collector’s office. This is the second protest in three days. On Sunday scores of protesters including children aged between three and 15, took part in a procession from V.S.T. junction and walked for around t3 km to reach theJinnah Thidal in Melapalayam.

Krishnagiri

Various Muslims organisations under the flapping tricolour thronged the protest venue at the Anna statue here giving a clarion call against the CAA inKrishnagiri.

Holding placards calling for a halt to the polarisation and divisiveness, protesters held out placards stating they were “Indians by citizenship and Muslims by religion”.

Placards shunning hatred and calling for unity dotted the protests landscape. Women and men came out in solidarity holding banners that stated “NafratChodo, Bharat Jodo, Samvidhan Bachao”.

Over 1,500 protests, braving the scorching heat, demanded the State assembly pass a resolution against the CAA.

Madurai

Hundreds of Muslims and other leaders from various political parties, who attempted to lay siege to the office of theCollectorate in Madurai, Dindigul, Virudhunagar and Theni districts, as a mark of protest against the CAA, were stopped by the police on Wednesday

Salem

Members of various Muslim organisations protested in front of districtCollectorate on Wednesday and staged a road roko condemning the Central government. Close to 1,000 persons gathered in the area and raised slogans against the State and Central governments.

Leaders of Opposition parities like Indian National Congress,Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, Communist Party of India and many others took part in the protests. National flags and placards condemning Centre and State governments were held by protesters.

Member of Parliament from Salem S.R.Parthibhan, addressed the protesters and charged that the Bill wouldn’t have been passed in the Parliament if AIADMK MPs and PMK ParliamentarianAnbumani Ramadoss had voted against it. He added that the BJP believes that it could do anything in the country since it has majority inLok Sabha. Mr. Parthibhan said that the protests would continue until the Act is withdrawn.

Resolutions were passed in the protests demanding the Centre to withdraw CAA, NRC and NPR.

The protesters later staged a road roko in front of the district Collectorate and traffic movement was affected for over half an hour at the Collectorate junction.

The protest came to an end around 12.30p.m. with the singing of the national anthem in Chennai. Protesters slowly began to disperse from the sites.

Police sources said Abi, 18, a resident of Bengaluru, came to visit his relative Mukesh in Yelagiri.

While they were riding a two-wheeler near Jolarpet on Sunday, two motorists Dayalan and Kumar waylaid them. They picked a fight with them over Abi’s rash driving.

In a fit of anger, Dayalan pulled out a knife and attacked Abi and Mukesh.

They were injured in the altercation and were admitted to the Government Hospital in Tirupattur.

Abi succumbed to his injuries soon after while Mukesh was still undergoing treatment.

Special teams were formed to nab Dayalan, Kumar and their friends, who were involved in the crime.

While the police nabbed Kumar and Dayalan on Monday, another person who accompanied the duo, Rahul was taken into custody by the police later on the same day.

199,2020/02/19,Documents provided to U.K. to retrieve stolen idol,"Idol Wing CID seeks restitution of 16th century bronze

The Idol Wing CID police has furnished documents through the Indian High Commission, London, to the Ashmolean Museum, in Oxford, U.K., requesting the restitution of a 16th century bronze idol of Thirumangai Azhwar. The idol reportedly went missing from a temple near Kumbakonam half a century ago.

In November 2019, an independent scholar brought new research to attention, relating to the provenance of an Indian 16th century bronze of Saint Tirumangai Azhwar, which was acquired by the Ashmolean Museum from Sotheby’s in 1967. Research in the photo archives of the IFP-EFEO (Institut Français de Pondicherry and the Ecole Française d’Extrême-Orient) appears to show the same idol in the Soundarrajaperumal temple near Kumbakonam in Tamil Nadu in 1957.

“Although there is currently no claim against the object, the museum officially brought the matter to the attention of the Indian High Commission in December last year requesting any further information (including possible police records) that would aid us in establishing the work’s provenance and noting that we were open to holding further discussions around the possible repatriation of the sculpture,” said a statement from the museum.

The museum acquired the statue in good faith in 1967, it said.

According to the Sotheby’s catalogue, the bronze was sold from the collection of collector Dr. J.R. Belmont (1886-1981).

Additional Commissioner of Police, Idol Wing, CID, Abhay Kumar Singh told The Hindu: “The Ashmolean Museum had taken a proactive step on its own and contacted the High Commission in London seeking more details of this case. The investigation report has now been sent to the High Commission.”

Rahul Nangare, First Secretary, High Commission of India, London, told The Hindu: “We thank the University of Oxford and Ashmolean for taking proactive step in this matter and hope that other museums and galleries would follow your example and take a similar proactive approach in dealing with suspected stolen idols.”",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/656n27/article30856761.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH18KRASTATUE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/documents-provided-to-uk-to-retrieve-stolen-idol/article30856762.ece

201,2020/02/19,Protest against Citizenship Amendment Act continues in Vellore,"Police action on protesters condemned

Scores of volunteers from several Muslim organisations in Vellore staged a demonstration near the Anna Kalai Arangam on Tuesday.

The protest was in continuance of their agitation over the attack by the Chennai City police on demonstrators in Washermenpet on Saturday.

They raised slogans against the ruling AIADMK in the State and the BJP government in the Centre for alienating minorities over this issue. They carried national flags and placards with slogans against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, the National Register of Citizens and the National Population Register. The protesters dispersed after 5.30 p.m., police said.

Addressing the gathering, Vellore MP D.M. Kathir Anand said the BJP government was keen on side-lining minorities.

202,2020/02/19,DMK misleading people on CAA: Edappadi Palaniswami,"Tamil Nadu Chief Minister asks which minority has been affected by the Act.

Launching a tirade against the DMK, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Monday accused the principal Opposition party of misleading the people over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

When DMK legislator T. Mano Thangaraj raised the issue in the Assembly, an aggressive Mr. Palaniswami asked, “Point out which minority (community) living in Tamil Nadu and born in Tamil land is affected [by the Citizenship Amendment Act]. We will respond to that.”

He charged that the DMK was cheating the people, enacting a drama and spreading libellous information, thereby trying to disturb peace in the State. “Who has been affected? Tell us. I will explain,” the Chief Minister added.

When Mr. Thangaraj insisted that the CAA was affecting the minorities and hence there were protests, Mr. Palaniswami said it was not the State government, but the Centre that had powers to decide on the legislation.

To the DMK member’s criticism that the AIADMK had a cordial relationship with the Centre, but it was unable to object to certain issues, Mr. Palaniswami reiterated that the DMK was a constituent of the erstwhile National Democratic Alliance and United Progressive Alliance governments at the Centre. It was only during that time several policies affecting the State were rolled out by the Centre, he charged.

To another issue raised by DMK whip R. Sakkarapani, which involved the Centre, the Chief Minister said: “Your MPs are sitting there [Lok Sabha]. They could raise the issue. They have been elected for that.”

In a related development, Revenue Minister R B Udhayakumar said the State had the right and responsibility to protect every citizen and it is the responsibility of the government to provide security to women, children and others who were protesting against the CAA at Washermenpet in Chennai since Friday last.

Mr. Udhayakumar intervened when IUML legislator KAM Muhammed Abubacker raised the issue of CAA, saying it was unjust and against the Constitution. The Minister said the matter was in court and no rules [for the Act] had been framed yet and people were protesting only out of fear.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/k95zxj/article30855514.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19THCMEDAPPADI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/dmk-misleading-people-on-caa-edappadi-palaniswami/article30855515.ece

Today, we have 350 residents, including children and the elderly. We also run six schools with around 4,000 students. My father, with my mother Lakshmi Rajaram, has worked all these years tirelessly for the welfare of others,” he said.

In the 1980s, he adopted 50 Sri Lankan refugee children from the Mandapam camp and took care of them.

205,2020/02/19,‘Institutions like IIT-Madras can offer solutions to global problems’,"German envoy says cross-border collaborations are need of the hour

Institutions like IIT-Madras have the expertise to come up with solutions to address global problems like environmental degradation, global warming, overpopulation and lack of resources, Walter J. Lindner, German Ambassador to India, said here on Tuesday.

Addressing an event held to celebrate the decades-long partnership between IIT-Madras and RWTH Aachen University in Germany, he said cross-border collaborations, such as the one between these two institutions, were the need of the hour.

Bhaskar Ramamurthi, Director, IIT-Madras, said many important projects related to sustainability, land use, and waste management were being done at the Indo-German Centre for Sustainability, an important centre of collaboration between IIT-Madras and RWTH Aachen University. “The new focus on coastal management now is due to climate change,” he added.

He was conferred with the RWTH Honorary Fellow Award by Ulrich Rüdiger, Rector, RWTH Aachen University, at the event.

Mr. Rüdiger said his university was also working with industry on a model similar to that of IIT-Madras Research Park.

“Our joint history dates back to 1959 when RWTH Aachen University supported the foundation of IIT-Madras. In 1966, the two institutions formed the first German-Indian University partnership. In 2016, the strategic partnership of ‘Sister Universities’ was initiated between the two universities,” he said.

206,2020/02/19,Departmental proceedings ordered against trial court judge,"He awarded disproportionate compensation in accident cases.

The Madras High Court on Tuesday directed its Registrar General C. Kumarappan to initiate departmental proceedings against the presiding officer of a Special Sub Court, for dealing with motor accident claims cases, in Coimbatore for repeatedly awarding disproportionate compensation to the claimants.

A Division Bench of Justices M.M. Sundresh and Krishnan Ramasamy issued the direction while disposing of an appeal preferred by National Insurance Company challenging an award of ₹1.93 crore to the family members of an engineer who died in a road accident after a bus dashed hit his car on July 6, 2012.

Incongruous evidence

The judges pointed out that though the claimants themselves had stated that the income of the deceased was only ₹1 lakh a month, the presiding officer had ended up determining the income to be ₹1.25 lakh per month despite no acceptable evidence having been produced to substantiate the income during his lifetime.

They agreed with the insurance firm’s claim that such astronomical quantum of compensation was unknown to the parlance of law on compensation.

On scrutiny of the award passed by the presiding officer on June 25 last year, the judges found that he had mentioned just ₹35,000 as the award for ‘loss of love and affection’ in the text of his judgment but went on to add ₹35 lakh towards that conventional head while computing the total award in the operative portion of his verdict. The judges said, it did not appear to be a mistake that could have occurred due to inadvertence or oversight.

Pointing out that they had come across a series of such orders passed by that particular presiding officer, the Bench said, it had even directed the High Court Registry to place one of those orders in the officer’s Annual Confidential Report.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/departmental-proceedings-ordered-against-trial-court-judge/article30855392.ece
207,2020/02/19,Challenges and sorrow marked last 3 years: Alagiri,"TNCC chief slams Palaniswami regime

Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president K.S. Alagiri on Tuesday said the last three years of Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami’s rule were marked not by achievements but by challenges and sorrow for the people.

In a statement, Mr. Alagiri said the people of the State were waiting for the Assembly election to vote the current government out of office. “This is also due to the fact that the AIADMK is acting like a servant of the BJP and a government going against the interests of the State,” he alleged. While the government was making big claims about Mr. Palaniswami’s achievements, the reality was different, he said.

“The same people who said they won’t allow NEET in Tamil Nadu have accepted its implementation by the BJP [government at the Centre], thereby putting a question mark over the future of eight lakh students studying under the State Board,” he added.

According to the Congress leader, not even 50% of the investments promised during the two Global Investors’ Summits organised by the AIADMK government had fructified. He questioned the government’s record on employment generation, citing the number of applications from engineers and graduates for even the posts of conservancy workers in the State. “Is this the so-called stamp of the successful three years of this government?” he asked.

Mr. Alagiri further referred to issues such as the one nation-one ration card scheme being forced on the State, the UDAY scheme, new education policy, supporting the Triple Talaq bill in Parliament, farmers not getting the right price for their produce, supporting the CAA, among others and said the interests of the State were being given away.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/aze4k6/article30855375.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH19KSALAGIRITNCCPRESIDENT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/challenges-and-sorrow-marked-last-3-years-alagiri/article30855376.ece
208,2020/02/19,Private tankers working for Aavin withdraw strike,"Operators hope tenders called in Oct. will be finalised soon

Private tanker operators carrying milk to and from dairies of Aavin have withdrawn their strike hoping that the milk major will soon finalise the tenders called in October last.

They had announced an indefinite strike demanding finalisation of the tender so that they would get better rates.

The operators had been transporting milk for the Tamil Nadu Cooperative Milk Producers Federation, whose popular brand is Aavin, based on rates fixed in 2015.

Aavin Contract Lorry Owners’ Association president R. Subramani said they were spending ₹16/km on diesel, ₹5/km for the driver and ₹4/on toll and apart from these ₹7,000 on insurance every month and additional amounts on maintenance.

“We were being paid ₹24/km including toll charges, which were hardly enough to cover the cost. We were not making profits. We only want Aavin to consider our request for a better rate. There are many families that solely depend on this income for survival,” he said. There are about 315 trucks under the association.

Supply ensured

Aavin managed to tide over the strike and ensure supply to the city without any issues. “We had engaged other transporters for nominal rates since we cannot allow a section of contractors to hold Aavin, the government and the consumers to ransom. We relaxed the conditions. But these are temporary arrangements and the Board Level tender committee will take a call on the tender. It will consider rates and contract conditions,” said a senior official.

Aavin supplies around 11 lakh litres of milk a day to the Chennai city.

209,2020/02/19,School breakfast scheme: T.N. open to tie-ups with voluntary sector,"Chennai, Erode, Avadi already have such programmes

The State government is receptive to the idea of working with voluntary organisations to implement breakfast schemes in government schools in various parts of the State, according to a senior official.

Referring to the scheme being implemented in Chennai, the official said there were similar programmes in Erode and Avadi with the involvement of charitable institutions. “We welcome any other institution to join us for a similar breakfast programme,” the official added.

Coverage goal

In Chennai, the breakfast scheme is jointly implemented by the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) and the Akshaya Patra Foundation. Launched a year ago, the scheme currently benefits 5,785 children from 24 schools falling under the purview of the local body. The plan is to make it pan-city, “covering all our Chennai Corporation schools, which means almost 1,00,000 kids would be fed every day”, said G. Prakash, Commissioner of the GCC, adding that the scheme should be seen as “a strong investment of a system that is ensuring healthy and stronger children”.

As for the apprehension being expressed in certain quarters that this could eventually lead to the privatisation of the scheme, both the government official and the Commissioner asserted that the new scheme will not replace the existing noon meal scheme, which is officially called the Puratchi Thalaivar MGR Nutritious Meal Programme.

Contrary to the perception being created by certain quarters, “it [the new scheme] is an additional benefit to the kids”, Mr. Prakash said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/school-breakfast-scheme-tn-open-to-tie-ups-with-voluntary-sector/article30855251.ece

After a litigant in the Melavalavu massacre case failed to appear before the court for a hearing, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Tuesday took a serious view of the issue and recalled its interim order that directed the 13 life convicts in the case to stay in Vellore.

The court, in November last year, directed the 13 convicted for hacking to death six members of the Scheduled Caste community in 1997 to stay in Vellore after their release on the basis of good conduct was challenged in the court.

When the case listed before a Division Bench of Justices R. Subramanian and N. Sathish Kumar came up for hearing, party-in-person advocate P. Rathinam did not appear for the hearing. The court said it was therefore inclined to recall the order.

211,2020/02/19,Defiant agitators say they will press ahead,"We are not party to the plea in High Court, says federation

The anti-CAA protesters at Old Washermenpet in Chennai, who continued their sit-in for the fifth consecutive day on Tuesday, said they will defy the Madras High Court’s order and go ahead with their plan to lay siege to Fort St. George — which houses the Assembly — on February 19.

Many men, women and children continued to lend their support to the stir on Tuesday. “Though support is understandably thin in the morning, it begins to swell as the day progresses, peaking in the evening and at night,” an organiser said.

The organisers have been providing tea, biscuits, fruits and other food items to keep the visitors to Lala Gunda hunger-free.

The head of the Federation of Tamil Nadu Islamic and Political Organisations, Moulvi PA Kajamoideen Bakavi, said Wednesday’s protest will go ahead as planned, as the federation was not a party to the public interest litigation filed by R. Varaaki in the Madras High Court. “The Speaker said that such a resolution cannot be passed in the Assembly on February 17. The Federation of Tamil Nadu Islamic and Political Organisations are not a party to the case and, therefore, the Madras High Court orders will not apply to it. The protests spearheaded by the Federation of Tamil Nadu Islamic and Political Organisations will go ahead as planned on February 19,” he said.

He said former and current MLAs and MPs will participate in the stir. “Apart from this, protests have been planned in front of the Collector’s Office in other districts (except Chennai, Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur). The protests will be peaceful and democratic,” he added. On Tuesday, MLAs including Karunaas and Manithaneya Jananayaga Katchi leader Thameemun Ansari, Tamizhaga Vazhvurimai Katchi leader T. Velmurugan, MDMK leader Mallai Sathya, SDPI leader Tehlan Bakavi and others lent their support to the protests. While most of the speakers played to the crowd by criticising PM Modi, the BJP and the RSS, CPI(M) leader Kanagaraj warned that comments critical of Hinduism in general should be avoided in these protests so that the “normal, regular Hindus are not won over by the BJP”.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/6jn22t/article30855244.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19THCAAPROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/defiant-agitators-say-they-will-press-ahead/article30855245.ece
212,2020/02/19,HC restrains anti-CAA protesters from laying siege to Secretariat,"Court grants interim injunction against federation of Islamic and political bodies

The Madras High Court on Tuesday restrained the Federation of Tamil Nadu Islamic and Political Organisations from laying siege to the Secretariat to demand that the Assembly pass a resolution against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, the National Register of Citizens and the National Population Register.

Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and R. Hemalatha granted the interim injunction till March 11 on a public interest litigation petition filed by one R. Varaaki, seeking to restrain the federation and allied organisations, including the Tamil Nadu Muslim Munnetra Kazhagam, the Popular Front of India and the India Thowheed Jamaath, from laying siege to the Secretariat.

The court passed the orders after taking up the case on a priority basis after senior counsel N.L. Rajah, representing the petitioner, informed the court that the federation had distributed pamphlets and issued an invite to the media, stating that its members had decided to lay siege to the Secretariat as well as the Collectorates in all the districts on Wednesday.

On their part, Additional Advocate General S.R. Rajagopal, State Government Pleader V. Jayaprakash Narayan and Additional Government Pleader R. Vijay Kumar told the court that the police will not allow anyone to lay siege to the Secretariat and that preventive measures will be put in place to prohibit any such move. “This cannot be permitted at all. The city police has earmarked 13 places, such as Chepauk, Valluvar Kottam and Chintadripet, as protest sites. If law permits, we will grant them permission for staging protests at those site(s) between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. Even for that, they have to make an application at least five days in advance,” the AAG told the court.

However, in his affidavit, the petitioner, who claimed to be a journalist, stated that the police had been very soft on the anti-CAA protesters and had allowed them to squat in public places, preventing free movement of vehicles and pedestrians. He said such soft-pedalling had also led to pro-CAA protests in various parts of the city.

Accusing political leaders of inciting college students to join the anti-CAA agitation, the petitioner said: “The leaders are brainwashing the student community to muster support for their unlawful agitations. Unfortunately, the students too have fallen prey to these organisations by extending their support inside educational institutions.” He referred to DMK Member of Parliament S. Senthil Kumar having recently apologised after tweeting a photograph of a body and wrongly claiming that it was that of an anti-CAA protester. “When a responsible people’s representative is behaving like this, we can imagine how the vested interests are fomenting trouble,” he said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hc-restrains-anti-caa-protesters-from-laying-siege-to-secretariat/article30855240.ece
213,2020/02/19,‘Those asking others to go to Pakistan should go there’,"Kanimozhi says minorities in India have done a lot for the country

Those who were repeatedly asking the people who question the government [Centre] and raise voices against injustices to go to Pakistan are the ones who should go there as they seem to know more about Pakistan and are constantly referring to the neighbouring country, DMK MP Kanimozhi said on Tuesday.

In an apparent reference to the BJP, she said: “Some of the leaders in some parties have referred to Pakistan much more in one speech than I have ever done in my life. If somebody has to leave this country, you please do because you don’t fit in here, you don’t fit into the modern idea of India, Periyar’s idea of India. This State belongs to us.”

At a national conference on ‘Peace and Justice: A subaltern perspective’, organised by the Department of Social Work, Loyola College, in association with the Subalterns’ Alliance for Peace, she said the minorities in India were not minorities but had done more for the country than those who are oppressing the country today. “They fought for independence, they brought education to all than what you people have ever done,” she said.

“We see history being rewritten, we see inclusion being looked down on, we see reaching out to people as anti-national and if you voice your opinion against it, nobody less than the top leadership of the country calls you urban naxals,” Ms. Kanimozhi said.

She said reservation was being frowned upon and attempts were being made to disrupt the march towards justice, social equality and create divisions among the people which, unfortunately, were working.

Food politics

Referring to the Akshaya Patra Foundation being roped in to provide breakfast in government schools in Chennai, she said the nutritious meal scheme was very successful and every government in the State, despite ideological differences, focussed on improving and expanding the scheme. “But today, even that is privatised. Every government in Tamil Nadu, I am proud to say, despite ideological differences — not even one government stopped it…they focused only on expanding it.”",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/those-asking-others-to-go-to-pakistan-should-go-there/article30855222.ece
214,2020/02/19,Govt. lowers growth rate of commercial tax revenue,"Revised figure marks steep fall from the 20% growth in 2018-19

In yet another acknowledgement of the economic slowdown, the State government has lowered the growth rate of the revenue from commercial taxes for the current year.

Originally, the revenue was expected to grow by about 9.41%. Now, the figure has been brought down to 5.42%.

In other words, the government is expecting to net around ₹3,511 crore lesser than the amount it was hoping to get at the beginning of the year.

As per the revised estimates, the collection for 2019-20 is ₹92,666 crore.

The revised growth rate marks a steep fall from the 20% growth the State saw in 2018-19.

During the Budget speech last week, Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam projected a growth rate of 7.27% for the State’s economy during 2019-20, as against 8.17% in 2018-19.

He also referred to the adverse impact of the slowdown on his government’s receipts, especially Goods & Services Tax (GST), Value Added Tax (VAT) on non-GST goods and Motor Vehicle Tax.

Two broad components

Under the head of commercial taxes, there are two broad components – GST and non-GST or VAT on products such as petroleum and liquor.

As part of the GST system, a State gets GST compensation and Integrated GST (IGST) settlement, apart from collections through State GST.

Keeping 2015-2016 as the base year, a growth rate of 14% per year has been adopted for calculating the revenue of the States to determine compensation.

The settlement of IGST, imposed on inter-State sales, is provided to manufacturing States as GST is a consumption-based tax.

Shyam Sekhar, an investment banker, said Tamil Nadu, being a leader in the auto industry, had to take a hit as the industry had been affected very badly.

The accused in the murder of bank employee N. Divya surrendered himself before the police at Vemulawada on Wednesday. He was identified as S. Venkatesh Goud and Siddipet police are bringing him back to Gajwel for questioning.

Divya was brutally murdered on Tuesday at about 8 p.m. at her residence after she returned from her office. A native of Yellareddypet in Siricilla district, she was working at Andhra Pradesh Grameena Vikasa Bank and stayed along with her parents N Lakshmi Rajyam and Manemma. Her marriage was scheduled on February 26. The incident took place while she was speaking over phone with her would-be husband and her parents were out of station to supervise marriage works.

Ms. Manemma informed the police that Venkatesh has been harassing Divya for the past few months and a case was filed at Vemulawada. Venkatesh and Divya were childhood friends when both the families resided in Vemulawada. When they studied in a private engineering college in Karimnagar, they reportedly fell in love. Later, they went for coaching for higher studies in Hyderabad and reportedly informed their parents that they had got married and sent pictures. However, the girl’s parents opposed it and took her away and kept her in Yellareddypet. However, Venkatesh was frequently meeting her and harassing her. At this juncture, a case was registered in Yellareddy police station and he was counselled and a statement was taken from him that he would not meet Divya and harass her.

Police said that Venkatesh bore a grudge against Divya after she distanced herself from him and it only increased after her marriage was fixed with a boy from Warangal. The police suspect that the accused might have gone to her house on Tuesday night and reportedly committed the offence.

The parents and relatives of Divya staged protests at Gajwel hospital where the post-mortem was conducted demanding stern action against the accused. When the police assured to nab the culprit and take stringent action, the relatives bought the dead body to Yellareddypet and performed the last rites.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/am41m0/article30864201.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY20VENKQTESH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/murder-accused-surrenders/article30864202.ece

217,2020/02/19,Aadhaar notice to Hyderabad Muslims sparks NRC fears,"UIDAI unable to deliver 52 notices

Mohd Sattar Khan, the recipient of the notice from Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) directing him to prove his Indian citizenship, is living in fear. He is unwilling to talk, but after much prodding, he agrees to speak for a couple of minutes.

“I do whatever work I get. I drive an auto, and now I do videography,” he says with trembling voice. He confirms that his father worked in Hyderabad Allwyn Limited, once a public sector company. He is encouraged to speak by Muzaffar Ullah Khan, a lawyer who is providing him legal aid, but words fail the recipient of the notice. Two others, one also from Talabkatta, and another from Santosh Nagar, who have received similar notices are afraid to speak. They refuse to reveal their names.

And while UIDAI reacted to media reports and stated that 127 persons ‘fraudulently’ obtained Aadhaar cards in a response to a query from The Hindu, R S Gopalan, Deputy Director General, UIDAI in an email stated that the authorities were unable to send 52 notices to individuals as the addresses of recipients could not be found.

The UIDAI’s notice, directing Mr Khan to prove citizenship, has given rise to widespread concerns within the Muslims community. Some opine that the UIDAI’s notice bears striking similarity to a National Register of Citizen-like exercise.

“For a long time, I have been gathering documents of my father who died last year. These include property documents, government employment documents and other related paperwork. I thought these could come handy for me and my siblings and their children if NRC happens in Hyderabad. But UIDAI asking that man to prove citizenship has rattled me. There is so much confusion now,” says Saleem Ahmed (name changed), a businessman and resident of Jubilee Hills.

Hours after Mr Khan’s case was reported, All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen President Asaduddin Owaisi waded into the controversy and claimed that UIDAI did not adhere to due procedure and abused its powers. He sought to know which police officer provided UIDAI the names of 127 persons and on what grounds.

“Request @UIDAI & @TelanganaPolice to tell us how many of those 127 listed people are Muslim & Dalit @TelanganaPolice please stop asking for Aadhaar during your “search & cordon” operations. You’re not legally permitted to do so,” he tweeted.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/9yu2j6/article30695995.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY31OHISEEs,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/aadhaar-notice-sparks-nrc-fears/article30863240.ece
218,2020/02/19,Godavari should be seen as a resource: Rajendra Singh,"‘It is appalling to see the severity of pollution in the river’

River Godavari should be seen as a resource and not an unending luxury, said water conservationist and environmentalist Rajendra Singh on Wednesday.

He was addressing a meeting at the Ambedkar Learning Centre at the National Institute of Technology (NIT), Warangal, where he expressed concern over the state of the river. “It is appalling to see the severity of pollution in the Godavari,” said Mr. Singh, who hails from Alwar district in Rajasthan.

Mr. Singh, who is popularly known as the “Waterman of India”, was here as part of his “Aviral Nirmal Godavari Saksharta Yatra”.

Commenting on the extant water crisis in the 21st century, he said that climate refugees from Asian countries were already forced to migrate to European countries to survive severe water crisis.

Talking about “Aviral Nirmal Godavari Saksharta Yatra”, he explained how this journey was also an endeavour to reawaken the respect, sanctity, hygiene and health of the Godavari. He gave insights into water conservation and lift irrigation.

Cautioning about the impending water problem in India and the world, he emphasised on the importance of initiating rainwater harvesting and hydro-conservation projects.

Earlier, Director N.V. Ramana Rao, who welcomed Mr. Singh, appraised him of the initiatives taken by NIT Warangal towards water conservation. Registrar S. Goverdhan Rao, professor K.

219,2020/02/19,"Tiger or no tiger, villagers will defecate in the open fields","Big cat movement in Adilabad district in Telangana reveals the pathetic state of Individual Sanitary Latrines (ISLs)

Villagers of Tamsi (K) in Bheempur mandal of Adilabad district managed to maintain an inscrutable countenance when, on February 17, the Field Director, Kawal Tiger Reserve, C.P. Vinod Kumar asked them to shun open defecation to prevent a possible encounter with a tigress moving in the area.

They, however, could not hold themselves back once the top forest officials - led by Mr. Vinod Kumar, who is also the Conservator of Forests, Adilabad Circle - left the place.

Incomplete toilets

“Where else can we go in the morning?” asked village sarpanch Sk. Kareemuddin as he recalled Mr. Vinod Kumar’s suggestion even if it was meant for the villagers’ safety. “A good number of the ISLs are still incomplete,” he disclosed.

Mr. Kareemuddin said he was under tremendous pressure from the district administration to construct 120 ISLs in his village last year. As the government has released only half the amount of the total cost, many of the ISLs remain incomplete. Incidentally, each ISL costs ₹ 12,000.

Topless 100

“There are about 100 ISLs which need only the lid of the septic tank, and corrugated iron sheets for the roofing to be made functional. Until the construction is completed, the villagers will go to fields to defecate, tiger or no tiger,” he quipped.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/tiger-movement-reveals-incomplete-isls-in-adilabad-district/article30858955.ece
220,2020/02/19,Regulation of speed on Bharatnagar RoB suggested,"After the car accident on Rail Over Bridge (RoB) at Bharatnagar, Cyberabad Traffic Police along with Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) are going to take measures to regulate speed of vehicles. Police said that some minor accidents were reported on the bridge in the past few months.

Studs (which are embedded in road), rubber rumble strips, sign boards indicating speed limit, and others would be placed on and alongside the bridge in the coming days. With three lanes on each side, the RoB is one of the widest bridges in Hyderabad. People tend to gain speed as they ascend the bridge, more so when traffic is relaxed. The traffic police said that over-speeding and jumping lanes are two primary reasons for accidents there.

The accident which occurred on Monday night is suspected to have happened due to rash and negligent driving.

Cyberabad’s Deputy Commissioner of Police (Traffic) S.M. Vijay Kumar said that he, along with GHMC engineers visited the RoB. “I have suggested speed calming measures to be taken, such as placing studs,” Mr Kumar said.

While rubber speed breakers too were suggested to be placed, its impact would be examined as traffic tends to increase during peak hours.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/regulation-of-speed-on-bharatnagar-rob-suggested/article30854954.ece
221,2020/02/19,Provide details of tenants: Karimnagar CP,"Cordon and search operation held in Karimnagar

The Karimnagar Commissionerate of Police has made it mandatory for house owners, who have rented out their premises, to provide details of their tenants such as Aadhaar card etc. to the local police.

Commissioner of Police V.B. Kamalasan Reddy said that the police would help the house owners to provide complete details of the tenants if they give Aadhaar card details through SMS or Whatsapp.

The Commissioner of Police along with other police officials participated in the cordon and search operation in Pochammavada in Karimnagar One Town police station limits on Tuesday. On this occasion, the police seized 71 vehicles without valid documents and ₹ 7,500 worth gutka packets.

Speaking on the occasion, the CP called upon the house owners to utilise the opportunity of collecting the tenants’ details free of cost by sending their Aadhaar card. Warning that there was every possibility of anti-social activities by unidentified tenants, he said that the police would provide complete information about the tenants whether they had been involved in any crime in the country and show their credentials.

Appealing to the women to download the Hawk Eye app for their safety and security, he said that SHE teams would be deployed in the region to check eve-teasing and other crimes against the women.

222,2020/02/19,Central team assesses damage to crops in locust-hit Rajasthan,"Three-member panel interacted with a large number of farmers and asked about their efforts to deal with the situation

An Inter-Ministerial Central Team, visiting the locust-affected areas in Rajasthan, has taken stock of damage caused by insects to the crops in Jodhpur and Bikaner divisions and met the farmers, elected representatives and government officials after getting divided into three groups.

The team members inspected the damaged wheat, gram, castor, taramira, cumin and isabgol crops in Jaisalmer, Barmer, Jalore and Jodhpur districts on Tuesday and Wednesday. Crops in an area measuring 3.71 lakh hectares have been destroyed in the biggest-ever locust attack which started in the Thar desert in May 2019.

The tropical grasshoppers emerged in January 2019 from Sudan and Eritrea on Africa's Red Sea Coast and travelled through Saudi Arabia and Iran to enter Pakistan, where they invaded the cotton-producing belt of Sindh province. The swarms of locusts then entered the Thar desert, damaging the crops in western Rajasthan and northern Gujarat.

The Sate government has sought an assistance of ₹200 crore from the Centre to deal with the locust menace and compensate the farmers for their losses. A special crop assessment survey was earlier undertaken in some of the affected areas and ex-gratia assistance distributed to the farmers.

The Union Agriculture Ministry’s Locust Warning Organisation (LWO), headquartered in Jodhpur, has launched efforts on a war footing to control locusts. Teams carrying equipment were rushed to the villages during the last few months to spray high-intensity malathion insecticide to prevent the spread of locusts to other areas.

The Central team comprised Atish Chandra, Joint Secretary, Union Ministry of Agriculture; J.P. Singh from the Directorate of Plan Protection, Quarantine & Storage; Anil Dhillon from the Food Corporation of India; Manash Choudhary from NITI Ayog’s Agriculture Division and Dayanand Sawant from the Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying & Fisheries.

Farmers’ demand

The team members interacted with a large number of farmers and asked about their efforts to deal with the locust attack. While analysing extensive damage caused to the rabi crops, the team took note of the farmers’ demand for enhancement of compensation in view of the cost of sowing of the crops having exceeded the relief amount offered by the government.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/hxfnfx/article30864054.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE19-RAJASTHAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/central-team-assesses-damage-to-crops-in-locust-hit-rajasthan/article30864055.ece
223,2020/02/19,Punjab Assembly session likely to be stormy,"Opposition to take up power tariff issue

The budget session of Punjab Assembly, beginning February 20, is expected to start on stormy note as the Opposition parties have geared up to corner the ruling Congress government on the issues of power tariff hike, farmers’ plight and stray cattle menace.

The principal Opposition – the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) — have both planned to forcefully raise the issue of hike in electricity tariff among other public interest issues during the session.

“Congress promised to give electricity at ₹5 per unit, but the rate today is between ₹9 to ₹10 per unit. It’s the most expensive in the country. The Chief Minister’s remark about renegotiating power purchase agreements with private players is nothing more than a political statement. We will bring a calling attention motion on misgovernance,” former Minister and Akali Dal leader Bikram Singh Majithia told The Hindu.

Mr. Majithia, who along with other party leaders met Punjab Assembly Speaker K.P. Rana on Wednesday, said they have demanded a 15-day budget session to discuss issues.

“The Congress government should not run away from the debate. The Opposition should be given appropriate time during the budget session to take up people’s issues,” Mr. Majithia said.

“People want to know where are the jobs. Not only this, they want to know why unemployment allowance of ₹2,500 per month is still not being given. Discussions are needed on illegal mining, liquor smuggling besides farmers’ distress and loan waiver,” he said.

‘Promise not honoured’

Accusing the Congress government of not fulfilling its election promise of scrapping or reviewing the power purchase agreements with private thermal power plants, AAP MLA Aman Arora said instead of securing interests of the people, the State government has chosen to protect the interests of the private companies.

Mr. Arora said the Amarinder regime followed the dotted lines drawn by previous SAD-BJP dispensation, resulting in steep electricity tariff hike.

He said keeping in view the growing menace of stray cattle in the State, the party will move a motion during the session to effectively deal with it.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/xfazgb/article30864038.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE19-AMAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/punjab-assembly-session-likely-to-be-stormy/article30864039.ece
224,2020/02/19,"Ex-DIG, 4 others get 8 years in jail","Convicted for abetting a family of four to end their lives

A former DIG and four others were sentenced to eight-year imprisonment by a local court in a 2004 case in which a family of five ended their lives, blaming the accused for the extreme step.

A serving DSP of the Punjab Police was also sentenced to four years in jail.

The court of Additional District Sessions Judge Sandeep Singh Bajwa also slapped fine ranging from ₹10,000 to ₹20,000 on them.

Former DIG Kultar Singh, DSP Hardev Singh, Parminder Kaur, Palwinder Singh, Mohinder Singh and Sabreen Kaur were convicted in the case on Monday.

Kultar Singh was posted as the Amritsar Senior Superintendent of Police while DSP Hardev Singh held the charge of an Inspector in 2004 when the incident happened.

Hardip Singh, along with his wife, mother and two children, had taken some poisonous substance on October 31, 2004.

Note on the walls

Before taking the extreme step, the entire family had written a note on the walls of a room of their house.

They also sent copies of the note to their friends and some known people by post.

The family had directly blamed Kultar Singh for the extreme step.

The Amritsar police had registered a case in 2004 when public pressure mounted but the accused were not arrested then.

In 2009, Punjab Human Rights Organisation activist Sarabjit Singh Verka took up the matter before a local court and sought justice for the victims while alleging that the local police was not probing the case properly.

The court issued non-bailable warrants in September 2011 against Kultar Singh and Hardev Singh under Sections 306 (abetment to end live), 420 (fraud), 467 and 468 (forgery) of the IPC.

226,2020/02/19,AMU students condemn U.P. CM’s statement in Assembly,"‘He is trying to cover up State terror against students’

The Aligarh Muslim University students strongly condemned the statements made by Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath in the State Assembly on Wednesday accusing the university’s students of hitting the roads in large numbers to “burn” Aligarh city on December 15, 2019.

“His statement that the students of AMU used stones, petrol bombs and weapons against police is an absolute falsehood. He is trying to cover up the State terror committed against the students of AMU on December 15,” said Salman Imtiaz, president AMU Students' Union (2018-19).

“We demand the immediate resignation of U.P. CM Yogi Adityanath as his presence in the office is a great hurdle in the deliverance of justice. We ask the President of India to take notice of his false claims and seek his removal,” said a statement issued by Mr. Imtiaz.

Faizul Hasan, former president of AMUSU and one of the prominent faces of the ongoing protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and National Register of Citizens at the Bab-e-Syed, said, “either the CM has not been told the truth or he is lying. The AMU fraternity, which includes teachers and old boys, has never attempted to create a problem for the common man in the city. Perhaps, people are jealous of how we remained peaceful despite provocation,” he said.

Mr. Imtiaz said the truth remains that AMU students were protesting peacefully on the campus since December 8 against CAA-NRC.

“On December 15, a peaceful march was held to condemn the excessive use of force at Jamia Millia Islamia. U.P. police and other armed State forces were present in massive numbers at the university gates and were ready with ammunition.

228,2020/02/19,Central govt. cuts its share in flagship crop insurance scheme,"Enrolment in two schemes has been made voluntary for all farmers

The Centre has almost halved its contribution to its own flagship crop insurance schemes, slashing its share of the premium subsidy from the current 50% to just 25% in irrigated areas and 30% for unirrigated areas from the kharif season of 2020.

The Union Cabinet approved the revamp of the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) and the Restructured Weather Based Crop Insurance Scheme at its meeting on Wednesday.

In another significant step, enrolment in the two schemes has also been made voluntary for all farmers, including those with existing crop loans. When the PMFBY was launched in 2016, it was made mandatory for all farmers with crop loans to enrol for insurance cover under the scheme.

Announcing the decision after the Cabinet meeting, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said that 58% of farmers enrolled in the schemes are loanees who will no longer have to compulsorily take insurance cover. “The numbers [of enrolled farmers] may go down in the first year, but it will pick up again after that,” he said, adding that the Centre would launch an awareness campaign to encourage farmers to voluntarily sign up for crop insurance policies. Coverage under the scheme is now 30% of cropped area, according to government data.

Flak for PMFBY

PMFBY has come in from flak from a wide variety of stakeholders. Farmers groups and opposition politicians have claimed that private insurance companies have made windfall gains on the scheme. Several major insurers, including ICICI Lombard and Tata AIG, have opted out of the scheme in 2019-20, reportedly due to losses because of high claims ratios. Several States, including Punjab and West Bengal, have refused to participate in the scheme as well.

The Centre has made changes to the scheme based on consultations with States and inputs from all stakeholders, said Mr. Tomar.

Farmers pay a fixed share of the premium: 2% of the sum insured for kharif crops, 1.5% for rabi crops and 5% for cash crops. Currently, the Centre and State split the balance of the premium equally. However, the revamp now reduces the burden on the Centre and increases the share of States.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/yrj0hx/article30863983.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE19-FARMER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/central-govt-cuts-its-share-in-flagship-crop-insurance-scheme/article30863985.ece

The police have detained Mr. Geelani’s cook and a helper to question them on who video-graphed it and how the videos managed to bypass the joint CRPF-J&K police scrutiny at the gates. The separatist leader has been under house arrest since 2010. Only a close relation is allowed to see him.

Sibashis Nayak, the software engineer from Odisha’s Berhampur who has been stranded aboard the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship off Japan’s Yokohama, is concerned that he may now end up having to spend a further 14 days in quarantine as he has been lodged in a cabin meant for crew members.

Mr. Nayak, who had earlier tested negative for the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, messaged on WhatsApp on to express concern that while Wednesday was the last day of their 14-day quarantine period, an announcement made by the ship’s captain about a possible extension of quarantine for the crew members could extend his stay on-board the vessel.

“Six passengers including me, who are staying in crew area due to shortage of cabins may be wrongly considered crew staff instead of passengers,” he messaged.

The engineer, who fears that an increase in his quarantine period on the ship may increase the chances of his getting infected, urged the Indian government to take immediate measures to evacuate the uninfected Indians to their homes.

Asserting that he had not had adequate sleep over the last 14 days, he said he was surviving on frugal food such as noodles and fruits.

The incident happened in Baidyanathpur High School in Ratua police station area of the district.

It is alleged that soon after the exam began, the boy clicked three pages of the question paper while sitting inside the classroom, edited it on the TikTok app, added Bollywood music to the video and circulated it on social media, police said.

He will be produced before the district Juvenile Justice Board on Thursday, they said.

District Education Department sources said that the accused’s examination has been cancelled and he has been expelled.

The purported video, which shows some multiple choice and essay-type questions, started making rounds within an hour of the beginning of the examinations at 12 p.m.

The incident created a furore among parents and examinees, who questioned the security of examination centres where neither students nor the teachers are being allowed to carry any electronic gadgets.

232,2020/02/19,Odisha govt. not proactive in taking advantage of Central schemes: Ram Madhav,"It does not submit proposals for new projects and lags in spending sanctioned funds, says BJP leader

The Odisha government is not proactive in taking advantage of the Central government schemes, alleged BJP general secretary Ram Madhav here on Wednesday.

“The government does not submit proposals for new projects and also lags in spending sanctioned funds. It is the responsibility of the State governments to make full utilisation of the Central sector funds. The Odisha government should wake up from deep slumber and come forward to take advantage of the schemes,” said Mr. Madhav attacking the Naveen Patnaik government at a press conference here.

Stating that one of the important aspects of this year’s Budget was to provide support to the States basing on their performance, he said, “Heavy budgetary allocation has been made in fishery, solar and water resource sectors. If the State government comes up with good proposals, the Centre is ready to provide support.”

He termed the Union Budget growth oriented. The Budget had given priority to development of critical sectors such as agriculture, water resources and infrastructure and uplift of youth, women and socially and economically backward classes, the BJP leader said, adding that it would help the country come out of the economic slowdown.

“The experience with the Odisha government has not been pleasant one. Instead of making false allegations that it was ignored by the Central government, it must make utmost utilisation of the sanctioned fund. We want to give many projects to Odisha but the State is not ready to take them,” he said. The allegations of decrease in the Central allocation for the State were baseless, said Mr. Madhav.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ii16kl/article30474959.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03HYDVGN-India-GJR6UETNO4jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/odisha-govt-not-proactive-in-taking-advantage-of-central-schemes-ram-madhav/article30860004.ece
233,2020/02/19,Mamata Banerjee blames political vendetta for Tapas Paul’s death,"She says the actor was “mentally devastated” after his arrest

West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday alleged political vendetta behind the arrest of Tapas Paul was responsible for the actor’s death. The celebrated actor of Bengali cinema, also a two-time Trinamool Congress MP, died in Mumbai on Tuesday. He was 61.

Ms. Banerjee, who offered condolences to the family of the deceased actor at Rabindra Sadan during the day, said the actor passed away too soon. She said Paul was “mentally devastated” after his arrest. He was arrested by the CBI in December 2016 in connection with a Ponzi scam and was granted bail after 13 months.

“This was not the time for him to go.. He had to spend one year and a month in prison. What was his crime? As a director of the entertainment company, he had received some money as salary,” Ms Banerjee said.

The Trinamool Congress chairperson said former party MP Sultan Ahmed also died under similar circumstances in 2017 after receiving calls from a Central agency.

“This is political vendetta.. Nobody is being spared from this dangerous conspiracy,” she said.

The Chief Minister also raised the issue of the arrest of Srikanta Mohata, a well-known producer of Bengali films and proprietor of Sri Venkatesh Films Entertainment Pvt Ltd in connection with the Ponzi scam. She said that Mr. Mohata had been behind bars for over a year and was not keeping well. She also referred to the arrest of well-known journalist Suman Chattopadhyay in connection with the scam.

“Even in murder cases, a charge sheet is filed in three months. I am not sure whether a charge sheet was filed here or not. If somebody is guilty after trial, let that person be punished but what kind of strategy is it to put people behind bars for so long?,” she asked.

The Ponzi scam, in which thousands of depositors lost money to deposit-raising companies in West Bengal and adjoining States, came to the fore in 2013. In May 2014, the Supreme Court directed the CBI to take up the investigation in this case. Since then, the CBI has questioned and arrested a number of politicians and owners of Ponzi companies. The agency has filed over half a dozen charge sheets but the investigation in the case is still going on.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/o7a4nk/article30789507.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH11MAMATA-01,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/mamata-banerjee-blames-political-vendetta-for-tapas-pauls-death/article30858910.ece

The Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government will allot ₹23 crore for the preservation and development of Shivneri Fort, the birthplace of Maratha king Chhatrapati Shivaji, said Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister and senior Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Ajit Pawar on Wednesday.

Speaking at Shivneri Fort in Pune’s Junnar tehsil on the occasion of Chhatrapati Shivaji’s 390th birth anniversary, Mr. Ajit Pawar said: “At present, three departments, namely the Forest, the Archaeology and the Public Works Department (PWD), are in urgent need of funds amounting to ₹23 crore for the conservation works of Shivneri Fort.”

Mr. Ajit Pawar, who is also the Guardian Minister of Pune district, informed that he would clear the fund amount at a meeting on Wednesday evening itself.

“When Uddhav Thackeray assumed responsibility as Chief Minister, his first decision following the swearing-in was to allot ₹20 crore for the preservation of Raigad Fort [Shivaji’s capital]. The objective of our government is to preserve historical forts by maintaining a heritage touch so as to keep it as it was during Chhatrapati Shivaji’s times,” said the Deputy Chief Minister .

Earlier, Mr. Thackeray, along with Mr. Ajit Pawar and other Cabinet Ministers including Chhagan Bhujbal and local legislators, were present at the birth anniversary celebrations of the legendary Maratha warrior-king, who is said to be born here in 1630 C.E.

Mr. Thackeray witnessed a number of events, including the ‘cradle ceremony’, while reviewing the progress of the development works at the fort.

‘True people’s govt.’

Speaking on the occasion, the Chief Minister said that there was a palpable sense among the public of Maharashtra that “a true people’s government has come to power in the State in the form of the MVA government”.

He further said that Mr. Ajit Pawar (and the NCP) ought to have allied with the Sena much earlier for the benefit of the State.

“Ajit dada and me [the Sena] simply remained apart all these years when we ought to have united much earlier. However, now that we are together, I promise the people of the State that we [the MVA coalition of the Sena-Congress-NCP] will not rest until we have developed Maharashtra,” Mr. Thackeray said.

Likewise, in a veiled jibe at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government, Mr. Ajit Pawar said: “Today is unique as there is a visible feeling that a true government of the people has come to power in Maharashtra…This is the first time I am witnessing such enthusiasm, especially from the youth on the occasion of ‘Shiv Jayanti’ ”.

Mr. Ajit Pawar had recently startled the State with his intra-party ‘rebellion’ when he staged a coup on the morning of November 23 last year to be sworn in as Deputy Chief Minister with BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis taking oath as Chief Minister. After NCP supremo Sharad Pawar’s iron hand had prevailed and the NCP failed to split, Mr. Ajit Pawar had resigned from his post in less than 80 hours.

‘No difference of opinion’

However, speaking on Wednesday, Mr. Ajit Pawar stressed that there was no difference of opinion within the MVA coordination committee.

“The representatives of all three parties are carefully weighing every problem…We are addressing issues and taking decisions with a view to maintain peace and communal harmony in the State,” said the Deputy Chief Minister.

He also refuted suggestion of differences of opinion existing between the Sena, the NCP and the Congress over the Elgaar Parishad probe.

236,2020/02/19,Menstruation remark by Bhuj seer stokes controversy,"Krushnaswarup Dasji, a religious leader associated with the Swaminarayan Temple, which runs the Bhuj college where over 60 girls were forced to prove they were not menstruating, said menstruating women who cook for their husbands will be reborn as dogs, and men consuming such food will be reborn as bullocks.

Notably, Swami Krushnaswarup Dasji, who made these remarks, is associated with Swaminarayan Temple which runs a college in Bhuj whose principal and female staff had allegedly forced more than 60 girls to remove their undergarments to check if they were menstruating for “breaking a hostel rule that girls having their periods are not supposed to take meal with other inmates“.

“....It is certain that men will be born as bullocks in their next life if they consume food cooked by menstruating women.

“I don’t care if you do not like my views, but this is all written in our shastras (scriptures). If a menstruating woman cooks food for her husband, she will be definitely born as a female dog in her next life,” Swami said while delivering a sermon in Gujarati, the video of which has gone viral.

The swami belongs to “Nar-Narayan Devgadi” of Swami Narayan Sect.

Krushnaswarup Dasji also warned men from consuming food prepared by menstruating women.

Scolding women for being “careless” about their menstruation period, which he likened with “penance”, Krushnaswarup Dasji can also be heard asking men to learn cooking.

“Women do not realise that period of menstruation is like doing ‘tapasya’ (penance). This is written in our shastras. Even I do not like to tell you all these things, but I have to warn you. Men should learn cooking...It will help you,” he said.

The time and place of the video clip cannot be known. Such videos of sermons are available on the temple’s dedicated YouTube channel.

237,2020/02/19,Odisha police to expand probe into immoral trafficking of Bangladeshi girls,"STF moves MEA for early repatriation of the victims

The Odisha police are set to expand investigation into alleged immoral trafficking of girls from Bangladesh into the State.

The Special Task Force of Odisha Police, which was investigating the issue in Bhubaneswar, has moved the Ministry of External Affairs for early repatriation of the victims.

Last month, the STF had arrested four persons and rescued eight girls in a case of immoral trafficking.

All victim girls were produced before a local court and sent to a shelter home. According to Jai Narayan Pankaj, STF Deputy Inspector General of Police, it was found that seven out of eight girls were illegally trafficked from Bangladesh and forced into sex work.

One victim was from West Bengal, who had already been handed over to family members.

“As per UN and SAARC convention, girls are treated as victims and traffickers are dealt with differently. All the girls hail from Jashore district of Bangladesh. During investigation, what we could gather was that while one of the seven girls had prior knowledge that she would be engaged in sex work, rest had no inkling about what was in store for them,” said Mr. Pankaj.

“Agents used to target families who are financially vulnerable in Jashore district. Girls are trafficked in hope of getting employment. After girls are brought into India taking advantage of porous border, they become dependent on traffickers because they don’t have passport or visa,” he said.

Sources said as per investigation Bangladeshi girls being used in sex work was not a lone incident, there could be few more victims’ groups in the State.

Wildlife Society of Orissa, an environmental pressure group, demanded that all seized and rescued pangolins kept in Nandankanan Zoological Park (NZP) be released into the wild.

“The Indian Pangolin is an endangered species whose wild population has fallen in the last one decade due to relentless poaching and trade. In 2009, the NZP started a pangolin conservation breeding centre with an objective of ex-situ breeding followed by release into the wild,” said WSO secretary Biswajit Mohanty.

“The zoo has a total stock of 23 pangolins. However, we are appalled to note that not a single pangolin bred in captivity has been released so far in the last 11 years though seven pangolins were born in the conservation breeding centre. The zoo has already spent ₹45.70 lakh on their upkeep and feed but has failed to achieve the stated objective of releasing them into the wild,” said Mr. Mohanty.

“The zoo has received 24 pangolins, including two babies. Except for one pangolin from the Visakhapatnam, all the remaining 23 pangolins were either seized or rescued from the wild in various parts of Odisha. All the 23 were supposed to be released into the wild after check-up. However, this was not done. The zoo has illegally kept in captivity those pangolins temporarily brought for care and treatment,” he alleged.

Mr. Mohanty said, “since there has not been a single release of a pangolin born in the breeding centre over the last 11 years, there is an urgent need to reassess the need for continuing this pangolin conservation breeding programme as it has failed to achieve its stated purpose despite expenditure of nearly ₹46 lakhs of public funds.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/wc40sy/article26293408.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PANGOLIN2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/nandankanan-zoo-must-release-pangolins-kept-in-captivity-environmental-group/article30857621.ece
239,2020/02/19,Assam NGO demands complete re-verification of NRC,"An Assam NGO, Assam Public Works (APW), has requested the Supreme Court to order a 100% re-verification of the entire National Register of Citizens (NRC) process and a probe by a judicial commission into the alleged misappropriation of funds for the updating exercise.

According to APW, whose 2009 petition in the top court had led to the exercise of updating the 1952 NRC, the inclusion of ""80 lakh illegal immigrants, including jihadis"" has necessitated the total re-verification.

In its affidavit, the NGO also said that the misuse of NRC funds warranted a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), the National Investigation Agency (NIA) or the Enforcement Directorate (ED).

The NGO named four “jihadis” who allegedly became Indian citizens because of their inclusion in the NRC.

“There are many empty agricultural lands being transformed overnight into populated villages, especially in the Barkhetri Assembly constituency of Nalbari district ... The situation is getting worse with time,” the APW said.

The NGO also blamed the NRC for facilitating such transformation while citing the example of Sipajhar area in northern Assam where ""182 bighas of agricultural land have been converted into villages.”

The Supreme Court had monitored the NRC process that saw more than 19 lakh of 3.3 crore applicants being left out of the final list published on August 31, 2019. The process of filing claims in various foreigners’ tribunals by the excluded people is yet to begin.

The factory inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to manufacture field guns for the Army would be shut by September 2020 as they have delivered ahead of schedule and have no further orders, Larsen & Toubro Chairman AM Naik said in an interview to CNBC TV 18. “According to me, not much has happened,” he said when asked how the defence sector has opened up for private industry in the last six years.

Elaborating on the order for 100 K9 Vajra-T self-propelled artillery guns that the L&T is manufacturing under technology transfer from Hanwha Defence of South Korea, he said there were four types of which one was cancelled because it did not not succeed and nobody could really clear the requirements.

243,2020/02/19,"After MANS, now Trupti Desai seeks case against kirtankar","Preacher apologises; minister says govt. won’t take action

Gender rights activist and Bhumata Brigade leader Trupti Desai has demanded a police case be lodged against Marathi kirtankar (preacher) Nivrutti Maharaj Indurikar, even as the latter apologised on Tuesday for his controversial remarks.

Ms. Desai submitted a proposal to Ahmednagar District Superintendent of Police Sagar Patil, urging that the case be lodged within four days’ time.

She warned that if a case was not lodged or if Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and the Maha Vikas Aghadi government tried to support Mr. Indurikar, then she and her fellow activists would be “compelled to lock Mr. Thackeray inside his cabin” at the start of the next session of the legislature.

“I have submitted a proposal demanding an FIR be lodged against Indurikar as his remarks violated the Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (PCPNDT) Act as well as the anti-superstition law,” Ms. Desai said.

Mr. Indurikar, who is known for addressing social issues through his sermons by deploying witty though hard-edged satire, drew the ire of rationalists and activists when he allegedly said during a sermon in Ahmednagar district that a couple having intercourse on an even date would beget a male child, and on an odd date a girl.

“I regret if my remarks have hurt anyone’s feelings. That was never my intention. Through my sermons for the past 26 years, I have always laid great stress on rooting out blind faith and working towards social enlightenment,” Mr. Indurikar said in a handwritten note on his letterhead. The preacher, who has a massive following, said his remarks were taken out of context.

A follower of the kirtankar from Ahmednagar, Smita Ashtekar, allegedly threatened Ms. Desai on social media if the latter dared to enter the district, while other supporters protested Ms. Desai’s entry into the district by waving black flags at her.

However, Ms. Desai remained unperturbed, vowing not to rest until a police case was lodged against the preacher. “He [Indurikar] has been known to make derogatory remarks against women in his sermons. I have already spoken regarding this with Home Minister Anil Deshmukh, who has assured me that an inquiry would be conducted in this case … People should know that the Home Department is on the side of the women of this State and not of some preacher who makes offensive remarks against them,” Ms. Desai said.

Earlier, the Maharashtra Andhashraddha Nirmoolan Samiti (MANS), too, had demanded a police case against the preacher on the grounds that his comments violated the PCPNDT Act.

Minister of State for Women and Child Welfare Bacchu Kadu had earlier said the government would not file a case against Mr. Indurikar as he was working towards enlightening people.

244,2020/02/19,Centre wants to label Dalits as Naxals: Congress,"The manner in which the Central government transferred the Elgaar Parishad case to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) raises concerns and is an attempt to label people associated with progressive, Dalit and Ambedkarite movements as Naxals, State Congress president and Revenue Minister Balasaheb Thorat said on Tuesday.

“Elgaar Parishad was a platform for intellectuals, liberals and poets. It is wrong to take action against them just because they have spoken against the government. This is an attempt to the gag progressive and Ambedkarite voices,” he said.

His statement comes at a time when both Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar have advocated the need to set up a Special Investigation Team to probe the case. This is seen as an attempt by all three parties in the Maha Vikas Aghadi government to corner the Bharatiya Janata Party on the matter.

Mr. Thorat said the party is not supporting anyone who acted with any other intentions. “But the timing of the case being handed over to the NIA makes it even more suspicious,” he said.

However, Tuesday also brought to the fore the differences between the three parties over the National Population Register, with Mr. Thackeray saying the State would not block the exercise. Mr. Thorat said the Congress opposes the NPR, Citizenship Amendment Act and the National Register of Citizenship. “There is no question of going back on this.

245,2020/02/19,‘Who told Centre about review of probe?’,"Pawar questions conduct of police officers in Elgaar Parishad case, says Fadnavis govt. misused power

Raising questions over the conduct of the Maharashtra Police, and especially that of the Pune Police, in the investigation into the Elgaar Parishad and Bhima-Koregaon violence case, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar on Tuesday said the previous Devendra Fadnavis government had misused its power in the probe.

The former Union minister raised questions over the coincidence of the Centre transferring the case to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) from the Pune Police the same day the State government reviewed the status of the investigation.

“How did the discussion inside the meeting leak? Who told the Centre that the State government was reviewing the probe? Was it the senior officers who attended the meeting?” Mr. Pawar asked at a press conference in the city, a day after directing NCP ministers to form a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to look into the case.

“An SIT should be appointed to probe the conduct of the Pune Police and the misuse of power by the Fadnavis-led government. The Centre transferred the case from the State to the NIA fearing that the truth would be out,” Mr. Pawar said.

He also said the Elgaar Parishad matter and the violence at Bhima-Koregaon in Pune district on January 1, 2018, were two completely different cases, and the violence was a result of the different atmosphere created by Hindutva activists Milind Ekbote and Sambhaji Bhide. Mr. Pawar said, “Till then, even locals were in support of organising programmes without any ill feelings. Cases were registered by the Pune Police against those who were neither involved with Elgaar Parishad nor the Bhima-Koregaon violence.”

The matter relates to alleged inflammatory speeches delivered at the Elgaar Parishad, a conclave held at Shaniwarwada in Pune on December 31, 2017, which the police claim triggered violence near the Bhima-Koregaon war memorial in the district the next day.

During the probe, the Pune Police arrested left-leaning activists Sudhir Dhawale, Rona Wilson, Surendra Gadling, Mahesh Raut, Shoma Sen, Arun Ferreira, Vernon Gonsalves, Sudha Bharadwaj and Varavara Rao for alleged Maoist links and claimed there was a plan to assassinate the Prime Minister. They have been booked under the India Penal Code and the anti-terror law, Unlawful Acts (Prevention) Act.

“It is comical to say the plot was to murder Narendra Modi,” Mr. Pawar said.

246,2020/02/19,Karbis against ST status for hill Bodos in Assam,"Otherwise, our identity will come under threat, says Karbi outfit Karbi Longri and North Cachar Hills Liberation Front.

An Assam-based insurgent group of Karbis, which signed a ceasefire agreement with the Centre, has demanded that the Bodos in the hill areas not be given the Scheduled Tribe status as it will affect the “identity of the Karbis”.

The Home Ministry, the Assam government and Bodo groups signed the pact on January 27 to redraw and rename the Bodoland Territorial Area District (BTAD), spread over Kokrajhar, Chirang, Baksa and Udalguri districts.

Under the agreement, the Bodos in the hills will be given the Scheduled Hill Tribe status and villages dominated by the Bodos outside the BTAD will be included and those with non-Bodos excluded.

The Bodos, an ethnic group in Assam, had been demanding a separate State since 1972, and are recognised as a Scheduled Tribe (Plain).

After the conclusion of the latest Bodo pact, the Karbi Longri and North Cachar Hills Liberation Front (KLNLF), a militant group that signed a ceasefire pact with the Centre in 2009, has said a “political settlement” should be reached soon. “The identity of Karbis will come under threat if Bodos who live in the hill areas [along with Karbis] are also given a Scheduled Hill Tribe status,” KLNLF general secretary Thong Terong Kabi said.

The group’s primary demand was a separate State.

In Assam, there are 14 recognised Plain Tribe communities, 15 Hills Tribe communities and 16 Scheduled Caste communities.

After the peace accord with all Bodo groups, the Centre is at a very advanced stage of sealing a peace deal with other key militant groups, including the pro-talks faction of the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) and the Karbi insurgent group. But, with the Assembly election in Assam due in April-May next year, the final announcements could be tailored to suit the ruling BJP electorally. The BJP is expected to do well in the 15 Assembly constituencies in the Bengali-dominated Barak Valley because of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). The recent Bodo peace deal will give the ruling party an edge in 12 seats under the BTAD. Similarly, a Karbi peace deal will give the party an edge in the 5 seats in the hill districts.

There are 33 districts in Assam, and seven have been exempted from the CAA as they fall in the areas protected by the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution. The exempted districts comprise three autonomous district councils: BTAD, Karbi Anglong and Dima Hasao.

Mr. Kabi said there was a lot of pressure from the people to conclude talks with the Centre. The group is in talks with the Centre’s interlocutor A.B Mathur. “90% dialogue is complete, we have had more than 50 rounds of talks with three interlocutors in the past 10 years. We want a final settlement on the lines of the Bodo agreement,” KLNLF’s publicity secretary Rijak Dera said.

The Karbi Anglong Autonomous Council has 26 seats, and the elections to the councils are due in 2022. “It is one of the oldest councils in existence since 1951... Nagaland and Mizoram that were autonomous councils initially became States years ago; only Karbi Anglong and Dima Hasao remain. We want a ST status for the entire region so that non-tribals will not be able to contest in the elections,” Mr. Dera said. The non-tribals comprise 46% of the 9.6 lakh population of the council. The Bodos could not have a separate reservation in hills and plains, he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/c1nkzh/article30854947.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BODO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/karbis-against-st-status-for-hill-bodos-in-assam/article30854948.ece

The by-elections to over 12,000 panchayat seats in Jammu and Kashmir have been deferred for three weeks following “credible inputs from the law enforcement agencies”.

The by-elections were to be held from March 5 to 20 in eight phases, based on party lines.

U.S. President Donald Trump is scheduled to visit India for two days next week.

The model code of conduct had come into force with the announcement of the by-elections last week.

The panchayat elections were held in the erstwhile State of Jammu and Kashmir in 2018, and a total of 27,281 panches and sarpanches were elected. There are 12,776 vacant seats for sarpanches and panches.

The elections were then boycotted by the Peoples Democratic Party and the National Conference.

248,2020/02/19,Straddling the quotidian and the celestial,"N.S. Harsha’s show is careful look at social life and politics through playful works that balance the idiosyncratic and the cosmic

N.S. Harsha’s exhibition Recent Life features his works from the last two years that reveal an expansion of his palette, unique constructions of pictorial spaces, and a conscious scaling down in size from his distinctive panoramic paintings. Harsha’s works integrate elements from everyday life in Mysuru, where he grew up and currently lives. “He knows his city backwards — he knows what daybreak brings and what to expect at each changing hour. There is a deep personal relationship with his surroundings, the people, and those he passes-by on an almost daily basis,” says gallerist Shireen Gandhy in the accompanying exhibition note.

The artist deftly juxtaposes the idiosyncrasies and minutiae of daily life in his city with the macroscopic universe. His colourful canvasses, sculptures, and installations bring together recognisable elements from his long-term practice: depictions of the cosmos, repetitive forms, and characteristic figures. Harsha’s works, laden with detail, unravel rewardingly — the artist’s show “is a slow discovery of oneself, of life, of drawing, and most of all the richness of painting,” states Gandhy. Viewers will confront the juxtaposition of the terrestrial and the universal, the artist’s formal examination of space and time, and the absurdities of life.

Terrestrial and universal

Harsha simultaneously portrays the microcosmic - inviting an inward gaze of ourselves and societal structures, and a telescopic view of the universe. Both perspectives trigger questions of the unknown, of what exists within and beyond us. In his painting, ‘Agrarian Climb’, two farmers clasp the space probe, Voyager I that is entwined to a pumpkin creeper, while they attempt to climb steep slopes. ‘At the landing site of Voyager One’ features an intimate tea stall that attracts local customers as well as the titular spacecraft. In this painting, foreign objects and foreigners in suits occupy the same space as a cow giving birth, “testifying to India’s capacity to absorb contradictions and retain a sense of continuity,” states Girish Shahane’s observation on the wall. In ‘Donkeys giving birth here and there’, Harsha juxtaposes harvesting scenes, yogic postures, and birthing donkeys with motifs of astronauts and lucid brushstrokes revealing the cosmos. He blatantly amalgamates the arbitrary everyday of Mysuru with the capricious planetary space.

The cosmos is even more pronounced in his work ‘Ascent or descent to reality’ in which Harsha layers fabrics reminiscent of the ubiquitous image of clothes that hang outside middle-class homes, on a ladder that is installed horizontally. The work communicates a desire for orientation as evidenced in the form of the work, as well as for transcendence, suggested by the solar system painted on the fabrics. A nine-foot fibre-glass monkey has an imposing presence in the gallery — it points up seemingly at the cosmos while embodying it, collapsing the gap between the earthly and the celestial.

Space and time

Harsha says, “Paint has a direct co-relation with time and space. As an artist I love the idea of paint. I follow where paint goes.” Through his formal inquiry, the artist challenges traditional narrative structures. His dream-like canvasses feature loose compositions of figurative paintings, miniature drawings, and imagery influenced by poster art and text-book illustrations. Even as his works depict routinely activities as seen in paintings such as ‘At the Opening Bell’ that focuses on labourers, Harsha embraces the cyclical nature of time through repetition, and references to the cosmic. “Although the show’s title speaks of proximate time, Harsha is equally preoccupied with the long duree, discovering profound civilisational qualities in the daily life,” Shahane argues. The artist says, “There are certain images which come up in my paintings which are from ‘here’ in Mysuru but they amplify a voice which is of humanity, not of some specific place and time.”

The largest painting on display, a diptych entitled, ‘That which divides and bonds’ features the artist’s characteristic plastic chairs placed at even intervals to create a grid-like structure. Every individual seated on the chairs exhibits differing temperaments, attires, and gestures. Through a play of repetition and difference, Harsha dismantles the ostensible symmetry within his space. The diptych also features the artist’s large iconic brush stroke that renders the universe, with stars and planets. Viewers are reminded of the infinite and endless cycles of life and death that undermine socio-economic and cultural realities that are premised upon linear structures of time and space.

Humour and absurdity

Within his paintings, Harsha discretely renders whimsical and fantastical figures. His depictions of the universe contributes to a further estrangement that viewers may experience while engaging with his works. Harsha tests our grasp of the familiar and the extent to which the unknown influences our ways of being. His painting, ‘A4ian Time Drifts’ addresses systems of power. The work pays tribute to the A-4 sized paper, synonymous with documentation and bureaucracy. The work features a queue of people lined up as if for an Aadhar card, or passport. The people portrayed are diverse and strange — Harsha depicts a donkey’s head on human body, a woman with three heads, and a celestial being among others, highlighting the question of identity that they are expected to prove. The queue meanders in a manner that parallels a flowing river also featured on the canvas. The figures portrayed with a great degree of variation, a recurrent style in Harsha’s practice, compel processes of free association. This is also seen in his painting, ‘Chain Snatcher’, where “a series of heads and objects is plucked from the void and materialised on canvas. The philosophical inquiry that animates ‘Chain Snatcher’ pervades the exhibition as a whole,” explains Shahane. Harsha alerts us to notions of randomness, chance, and fickleness that not only govern the universe but pervade systems that are ostensibly systematic and straightforward. His persistent references to the cosmos may be viewed simultaneously as a subversive choice, to remind us of the absurdity of socio-political upheavals and bureaucratic frameworks in light of a grander scheme of things.

249,2020/02/19,How Restore founder Nandi Shah turned to photography,"With her photographs featured in Delhi’s India Design ID, food entrepreneur Nandi Shah’s work comprises quaintly plated food and traditional utensils

Like other achievements in Nandi Shah’s life, the most recent one can also be traced back to her love for food. And her love for her roots. The founder of Restore, Chennai-based Nandi has been educating the city about organic foods and local varieties of produce for years. Research and business skills aside, Nandi is now being recognised for more artistic reasons, having displayed a collection of her photographs at the recently-concluded India Design ID.

India Design ID, a luxury design week held in Delhi every year, featured artists handpicked by Apparao Galleries — among many others — in this edition. Nandi was among those approached by Sharan Apparao for her photographs: a feat unto itself, considering the fact that she is a self-taught photographer.

“I picked up the DSLR only for my food blog, about two or three years ago. Aside from some help figuring out camera settings — which I am grateful for — I figured everything else on my own. Lines, lighting, framing...” she says. So it is no surprise that she never took compliments about her photography seriously, not until she was approached by Sharan. One look at her photographs, however, make the reason behind the choosing fairly clear.

The Still Life, as her series is called, features just that — still after still of quaintly plated food and traditional utensils. Set to bare, dark backdrops, there is something in them that is reminiscent of classical paintings, and that something is very deliberate. “As a student of Fine Arts, I used to primarily do watercolours. With this series, I wanted to do still life with an Indian accent,” explains Shah. So, the style of her imagery is inspired by the Dutch masters of painting, even as the subjects stay unwaveringly Indian.

The food in the photographs is hers, as are all the utensils — “I love not only old recipes, but also old objects of brass and patina.” With the quiet dignity contained in the former and a tinge of nostalgia provided by the latter, the mood throughout each image is uniform, and soothingly nostalgic. “I have always loved to style my food, so styling and plating comes naturally to me,” says Shah, and she has a brass tray filled with pink-and-gold potpourri-esque rosebuds to back her claim.

But that image is a fairly recent one — Shah admits that her photography was not this fine when she had first started out. The growth in her personal style of photography can be visibly traced through the her blog posts over the past three years... “In the colour, designs, lines, style... we are all constantly growing as people,” she concludes.",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/r6zu76/article30860961.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19MPNandiShahjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/how-restore-founder-nandi-shah-turned-to-photography/article30860967.ece
250,2020/02/19,How Kathakali artiste Ettumanoor P Kannan is turning theatre egalitarian,"As academic, artiste and administrator, Ettumanoor P Kannan tries to make Koodiyattam and Kathakali accessible and relevant through new training techniques, themes and adaptations

For the average Kathakali actor, going two years without a performance might be a worrying track record. Ettumanoor P Kannan is not your average Kathakali actor, though. He is much more — an academic, arts administrator, yoga scholar and trainer in abhinaya.

The 52-year-old has worn many hats in his long artistic career. As an educator, he has helped shape a new curriculum for post-graduate students of Kathakali. He has dabbled in inter-cultural and post-modern theatre in India and abroad. He holds abhinaya training sessions for dancers and theatre practitioners. He uses yoga and spirituality to train the young in mind awareness management workshops.

FridayReview caught up with Kannan recently. Excerpts from an interview...

Essentially, you are a Kathakali actor. Yet you are currently the director of Sangeet Natak Akademi’s Kutiyattam Kendra...

I may be an outsider but I am no stranger to Koodiyattam. I have been trained by the great Koodiyattam guru Mani Madhava Chakyar. There may have been some apprehension in the beginning since my background is Kathakali. But I believe I have won the trust of the Koodiyattam community.

When I took over this post in 2016-end, I launched several activities to promote Koodiyattam. One was creating a directory of artistes. With that database, we try to route programmes to as many artistes as possible. Then I organised a three-day conclave of all Koodiyattam artistes and families to facilitate a conversation among them. We also launched an annual five-day Natyadharmi festival, where most of the artistes get a chance to perform.

I also wanted to influence the training methodology and syllabus. Students need motivation. They should be made to perform earlier. I visit different Koodiyattam schools and talk to them. Be it Kathakali or Koodiyattam, we need to change with the times and evolve modern teaching methodologies. This is what I tried to do in 2007 in Kerala Kalamandalam when they were starting the post-graduate course. The old kalari system alone was not enough. I faced resistance from the senior teachers as they thought I was tampering with a well-established tradition. But later, many of the sceptics came around to my view. I returned there in 2013 as campus director when we offered MA in 14 subjects.

Coming back to Kathakali, you performed at Ettumanoor recently. That was after a gap of two years. Isn’t that unusual?

After my pre-degree, I had doubts about continuing in Kathakali. Then in 2007, when I realised I wasn’t getting enough time to focus on my PhD thesis, I went off to Auroville (in Puducherry) for a year. Then these last two years, I have been busy with the Kutiyattam Centre.

All this has to do with my growth as an artiste and as an individual. I started Kathakali training at the age of 10 when my first guru, the late Kalanilayam Mohankumar, set up a kalari at Ettumanoor. My father wasn’t very keen; he warned me that my Kathakali would stop the day I slipped below third rank in school. By the time I was in eighth standard, I had become a professional with around 80 programmes a year, initially travelling with my guru and, later, on my own. I won at youth festivals and attended summer camps at Kerala Kalamandalam.

After my pre-degree, I enrolled for BA in Malayalam. The restless youth in me started thinking, started questioning and rebelling... I was at the crossroads: Kathakali or an ascetic life. I was inclined to take the spiritual philosophic route.

Why were you disillusioned with Kathakali?

I was busy as a performer but my mind wasn’t in it. I suppose there was a quest to find a deeper meaning after being influenced by my reading. One day, a Kathakali patron told me to meet the late Mani Madhava Chakyar. This was just 15 or 18 months before Chakyar Asaan died. He was frail and could only sit leaning on his bed. That year I spent with him was a turning point. He demolished my ideas about classical art and made me realise that this artform is compatible with the philosophies I have been reading about. Kathakali, which until then was a performing art to me, became a philosophy.

Every day, Chakyar Asaan would teach me eye exercises. During the day, he would recite Sanskrit slokas and explain them to me. He would make me write them down. He would link them to the mudras and style of Kathakali. I had learnt Sanskrit as a child and that helped. Chakyar Asaan was an expert not just in Koodiyattam but in astrology and Ayurveda as well. He taught me nadi sasthram since it impacted abhinaya.

In the works The first priority will be Kathakali performances. I am already busy in this area this season. I intend to step back from arts management since it consumes a lot of time.

I will also work on cross-cultural platforms. I have done international Kathakali workshops for several years. The Asia-Pacific Performance Exchange that I attended in 2000 exposed me to an entirely new group of artistes. That made me think of using Natyadharmi methodology to present a non-Indian epic. I worked with Peking opera artiste Peng Jingquan and Taiwanese-American actress Cheng-Chieh Yu to present Oedipus. When I was working in UCLA, I got a chance to work with the theatre group Dog & Pony Show in Pittsburg in 2001. An adaptation of Macbeth that we did was selected as one of the 10 best plays of the year. The next year in Pittsburg, I performed Tagore’s Dialogue Between Karna and Kunti in collaboration with Odissi dancer Sreyashi Dey. The possibilities to use the Indian system of abhinaya in post-modern theatre are endless. Then I conduct abhinaya workshops for dance and theatre groups in India and abroad. What they do might be Kuchipudi or Kathak or modern theatre, but underlying that is our ancient technique of abhinaya — breath control, focusing the mind and creating awareness. There is a step-by-step process to get there. The course will awaken certain faculties in them that they were not aware of before. After all, that is what yoga is all about — tap the potential of the human body and intellect to the maximum.

So you decided that it is Kathakali for you. Did any others influence you?

The year I spent with Chakyar Asaan led me to realise my inadequacies. I approached Kalamandalam Vasu Pisharody and joined Kalamandalam as a special student to train with senior students. Four years of training with Vasu Asaan made me what I am today. This was around the time I interacted with Kathakali activists and aesthetes such as K B Rajanand and Dr T S Madhavankutty. I could sound off their ideas on Vasu Asaan. I attended workshops of Kunju Nair Trust and interacted with a bunch of young actors. It was an enriching period for me.

While conducting Kathakali appreciation courses, I met the late academic-turned-actor Narendra Prasad. He introduced me to European theatre theorists such as (Jerzy) Grotowski, (Konstantin) Stanislavski and (Bertolt) Brecht, whose works helped me connect theatre and Kathakali.

You were one of the first to bring cholliyattam, or Kathakali without costumes, onto the performance arena. What was the idea behind it?

I realised that those new to Kathakali will better understand it without the costumes. I had worked with the theatre department of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), from 2000 for five years, spending four months there every year. On weekends, I used to do cholliyattam of certain set pieces with the help of some local drummers. The response was overwhelming. Again, when I was teaching at the National School of Drama, New Delhi, from 2007 for five years, I performed cholliyattam on weekends. It was a revelation for North Indian students there. Some of them told me that they had watched Kathakali for years but could never penetrate it beyond the costumes. Kathakali had seemed unapproachable till they watched my cholliyattam. That allowed them to watch the body of Kathakali at work. I had used this same technique in some inter-cultural plays effectively. I intend to revive this. But I need to think more about it. It should not be the typical cholliyattam of Kathakali but specially choreographed pieces.",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/kk685l/article30860827.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14tvfEttumanoorPKannan,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/how-kathakali-artiste-ettumanoor-p-kannan-is-turning-theatre-egalitarian/article30860836.ece
251,2020/02/19,"The sport is getting bigger, says Catherine Dalton","Says the Women’s T20 World Cup will be a game changer

As a coach with the Ultimate Pace Foundation, Catherine Dalton has made quite a few trips to India, holding camps at Bangalore, Pune, Hyderabad and Delhi. One of the few bio-mechanics expert to be associated with fast bowlers, she expects the forthcoming ICC Women’s T20 World Cup to be the game changer for women’s cricket.

“There is high expectations as far as quality is concerned. The buzz can be felt worldwide,” she told The Hindu from London. “It’s going up. The game is getting bigger. With the World Cup coming up we are going to see some fantastic cricket. It’s exciting time for women’s cricket. There is place for women’s cricket which has increasingly become competitive.”

Catherine has had very pleasant experience of coaching in India. “I have never experienced any resistance as a woman coach. When I went to India I wasn’t sure how I would be received by the players. The players warmed to me very quickly because they could see they could learn something from me. I was fortunate to have a good understanding of the game, particularly of the bio-mechanics of the fast bowling.”

Like many in India, Catherine also picked up the game watching her father and brothers play. “When I was younger I used to be taken to our local cricket club where my brother played lots of cricket. I decided to join and fell in love with the game. I was nine years old at that time. I just got hooked to cricket. I also played tennis and a huge amount of football. I just wanted to bowl fast because I wanted to do things quickly,” said Catherine, who also played football for West Ham Club.

“When I was 17, at a cricket camp, I decided to give cricket a full go. That was the turning point I switched from football to cricket.”

The biggest highlight for Catherine was working with Deepak Chahar when she was invited by the Rajasthan Cricket Association a few years ago to do a specific fast bowling camp. “I learnt a lot from him and hopefully passed on some of my knowledge to him as well,” said Catherine, named Middlesex Player Of The Year in 2013.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ndz8hg/article30863963.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH20Coach,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/the-sport-is-getting-bigger-says-catherine-dalton/article30863964.ece
252,2020/02/19,Australia targets fifth title at Women’s T20 WC,"The home team opens the 10-team tournament against India on Friday

Mighty Australia goes into its home Twenty20 World Cup this week as overwhelming favourite as it looks to cement its superiority in women’s cricket and draw a world-record crowd in the process.

Meg Lanning’s defending champion, and four-time winner, was rarely tested through the second half of 2019 when it whitewashed an injury-ravaged West Indies and a developing Sri Lanka team in the short format.

Giving a glimmer of hope to its rivals, it surprisingly slumped to defeat against India and England this month, before rallying to win the warm-up tri-series.

“To be put under pressure like this heading into a World Cup is extremely good preparation,” Lanning insisted.

Despite the recent losses, Australia is widely expected to contest the March 8 final at the MCG.

Along with Lanning, Australia boasts wicketkeeper-batswoman Alyssa Healy, all-rounder Ellyse Perry and bowling sensation Jess Jonassen, all among the world’s best.

Australia has been dominant since the World Cup was introduced 11 years ago, winning four of the six tournaments so far and crushing England by eight wickets in the 2018 final in the West Indies.

The only other teams to lift the trophy are England on home soil in 2009 and the West Indies in 2016.

Lanning’s side open the 10-team tournament here on Friday against an Indian side which includes teen batting sensation Shafali Verma.

Australia and India are 2-2 across their last four meetings and Indian skipper Harmanpreet Kaur said her side had improved markedly since the last World Cup, when it lost to England in the semifinals.

“If I look back two years, India’s 50-over side was doing well and our T20 was struggling. But in the past two years, we have transformed as a T20 team and are very positive going to Australia,” she wrote in a column. “All of the teams have strengths — but so do we. Our strength is spin,” she added, with the dangerous Radha Radav and Poonam Radav in the ranks.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ye46kf/article30863751.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH20WOMEN,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/australia-targets-fifth-title-at-womens-t20-wc/article30863752.ece
253,2020/02/19,Batsman Ross Taylor on verge of a special ton,"Will become the first to play 100 matches in each format

He’s a modern batsman with bat speed and whiplash hits who can also play the delicate strokes. Ross Taylor can wait for the ball to land, turn it off the surface and essay the late-cut.

Of course, some of his horizontal bat shots can be fierce too. Not many batsmen have put the slog-sweep to such devastating effect as Taylor has done.

Touch of class

From 2007, when he made his Test debut against South Africa in Johannesburg, Taylor has been with this New Zealand side through the seasons, often making his mark with a touch of class.

How wonderful it would be then that this Wellington-born charmer would be playing his 100th Test, in front of his family, friends and fans, when he steps on the field against India on Friday at the Basin Reserve, his home ground.

He is versatile, across formats. Taylor, in fact, is on the verge of becoming the first batsman to play 100 matches in Tests, ODIs and Twenty20 Internationals. He has played 231 ODIs and 100 T20Is. “It’s satisfying. People now-a-days give up on a format to focus on the others,” he said.

Natural strokemaker

He has indeed been a natural strokemaker, galloping on his skills when the going is good, conjuring moments of magic. And he has shown the heart to survive periods of struggle. His appetite for runs hasn’t diminished a tad. “I am still as hungry as ever to score runs. After my first series, I wouldn’t have been putting much money on myself to be playing 100 Tests, that’s for sure.”

Not surprisingly, he got a call from another Kiwi in the 100-Test club — Brendon McCullum. Soon a message from Daniel Vettori, one more century-of-Tests man, arrived.

India captain Virat Kohli paid his tribute. “He’s one guy who has made an impact a lot of times for New Zealand. I have been fortunate enough to play with him in the RCB. Lovely guy, I get along really well with him. Really hardworking and a very keen thinker of the game.”

Passion, not job

Cricket, for Taylor, was a passion and not a job. “I guess it’s a proud milestone, more so in Tests. I love playing cricket, first and foremost. It’s not a job, it’s something you love doing,” he said.

Asked about the key to defeating India, the 35-year-old Taylor said, “They are the world’s best side and leading the World Championship. To win Test matches, you got to be good in all three facets.”

High highs, low lows

On his remarkable journey, Taylor said, “I have had some pretty high highs and some pretty low lows. Been able to deal with it the whole way through your career. I wouldn’t put one thing that outweighs anything, just the whole journey. Failures along the way shapes you as a person.”

Looking at the forthcoming Test, Taylor pointed out that the Indian attack was not about Jasprit Bumrah alone. He said the pitch at the Basin looked the same every time but played differently each time. He looked at the series against India as a sort of redemption after the debacle against Australia.

He’s still full of beans. Ask Taylor and he will tell you that life begins at 100!",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/dwpbbn/article30863675.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH20ROSS,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/batsman-ross-taylor-on-verge-of-a-special-ton/article30863676.ece
254,2020/02/19,Virat Kohli to play all formats for three years,"“At a time when the body doesn’t respond as well, you might have a different conversation,” the Indian skipper said

How long can Virat Kohli continue playing all three formats considering India’s hectic schedule right through the year?

The India skipper answered, “I think it’s been eight or nine years that I have been playing almost 300 days a year with the travelling and practice sessions. And the intensity is right up there all the time. So it does take a lot out of you.” He added, “It’s not that easy. Then being captain and having intensity in practice sessions and discussing the game, so it does take a toll on you. So I am not in that space at the moment. So periodic breaks for me seem to work pretty okay.”

Kohli said, “At a time when the body doesn’t respond as well, maybe when I am 34 or 35, you might have a different conversation. But for the next two-three years, I have no issues at all. Can keep going on with the same intensity.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/40sniq/article30858647.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CRICKETSLTOURININDIA2NDT20,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/virat-kohli-to-play-all-formats-for-three-years/article30863612.ece
255,2020/02/19,India in NZ | A test of skill and character for Virat Kohli & Co.,"Virat Kohli and his men face a searching examination of skill and character as the first Test, beginning on Friday, approaches.

There is grass on this Basin Reserve surface and the New Zealand pacemen will be relentless in their quest for scalps.

However, Neil Wagner, that battering ram, who hustles batsmen with well-directed short-pitched bowling, could miss the first Test since he is awaiting the birth of his child. Matt Henry has been called in as a cover for Wagner.

Kohli was confident that his batsmen would be upto the task. The Indian skipper was also gung-ho about his own pace pack where Ishant Sharma appears to have put fitness troubles behind.

The Indian captain said, “He looked pretty similar to how he was bowling before the ankle injury and was hitting good areas. Really good to see him bowling with pace. He has the experience too.”

Tactically flexible

The Indian team, Kohli said, would be tactically flexible. “We are going to look to adapt to what’s in front of us rather than having a set template.”

Playing in New Zealand had its own challenges but Kohli said his team would focus on its own strengths. “We have to show more patience than our opposition. If the opposition plays the waiting game, we are gonna play the waiting game. If they counter-attack, we have the opportunities to take wickets and score runs [and] vice-versa.”

There is bound to be pressure on the not-too-experienced opening pair of Mayank Agarwal and Prithvi Shah against the moving ball on the greenish track here.

Kohli felt the fairly experienced Mayank understood his game in red-ball cricket and the disciplined mode of batting.

Prithvi, he revealed, had been given the freedom to play his own game. “He is a talented player and we want him to follow his instincts. Look, these guys have no baggage of having failed overseas in the past. A bunch of new guys can play the kind of fearless cricket that can give the whole team confidence.”

Role of the wind

The wind blowing across the Basin Reserve would play a massive role in the outcome, said Kohli. “We have to decide who bowls into the wind, who bowls with it. If the breeze is blowing across the stadium, then who is more effective bowling the in-swingers or the out-swingers.”

The wind would impact the batsmen too, Kohli said, “The ball might not travel in the air a lot more when you are hitting against the wind. So you need to be prepared to run a lot more. It’s something we learnt the last time.”

Kohli elaborated, “And if you have a light bat, then you are in trouble. You need to be firm with your stance and where your bat is, because it can really swing around. I experienced it the last time”

Intense and fit guys

On the New Zealand team, Kohli said, “They are intense and very, very fit guys and they can keep going all day and test your patience, really skilled with what they do as both bowlers and batsmen and are obviously brilliant fielders. So they don’t give you a lot within the game to sort of bank on or pounce on. They could bounce back from the 0-3 reverse in Australia.”

Talking about the Test championship, Kohli noted, “The Test Championship, as an ICC tournament, should be right up there. All the other tournaments, for me, start under that.

“This is going to be the biggest of them all. And every team wants to make it to the final at Lord’s.”

Even in these conditions, Kohli spoke about the advantages of having a world-class spinner in the attack.

India was close to finalising the eleven, he said. From what one gathered, R. Ashwin and Rishabh Pant are likely to play.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/6z46am/article30863571.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH20CRICKET,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/india-in-nz-a-test-of-skill-and-character-for-virat-kohli-co/article30863572.ece
256,2020/02/19,Ranji Trophy | Gujarat vs Goa — a mismatch of sorts,"Since this is a quarterfinal, we are not going to take any team lightly: Parthiv

Moments after he finished multiple wicketkeeping drills, had a short stint with the willow at the Sardar Vallabhai Patel Stadium in the tiny coastal town, Gujarat captain Parthiv Patel waved at Sairaj Bahutule. The team’s coach joined him in and the duo did a round of sprints together in the searing heat.

Having topped the top tier in style — five outright wins in eight league games — Gujarat will be gunning to dash past Goa in a Ranji Trophy quarterfinal that appears to be a mismatch of sorts, thanks to the BCCI’s inexplicable decision to let a Plate Group team have a go against the big teams in the knockouts.

No doubt, Goa won seven games outright and two on the basis of first innings lead in the league stage.

In fact, its tally of 50 points is the highest by any team. But the fact remains that Goa was relegated after a poor show in Group C last season and competed against a majority of newbies.

Amit Verma has led from the front, almost scoring 800 runs and picking 40-plus wickets with his effective leg-breaks.

“Obviously, our primary target was to top the group and get promoted to Group C. With that achieved, we have nothing to lose and I hope the young bunch puts up a spirited fight in the big match,” Verma told The Hindu on Wednesday.

Despite Gujarat being rank favourite, Parthiv stressed there is no question of complacency creeping in.

“It’s satisfying to see how we have bounced back after two bad matches in the middle stage. I think we are peaking at the right time and despite Goa being a Plate team, since this is a quarterfinal, we are not going to take any team lightly.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/sx7y0r/article30863500.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH20PARTHIV,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ranji-trophy-gujarat-vs-goa-a-mismatch-of-sorts/article30863501.ece
257,2020/02/19,Former Tamil Nadu and South Zone captain P.K. Belliappa passes away,"The keeper-batsman skippered South Zone and Tamil Nadu

Former Tamil Nadu and South Zone captain P.K. Belliappa passed away in Bengaluru on Wednesday morning. He was 79 and is survived by his wife, a son and a daughter.

Belliappa, who made his debut for Tamil Nadu (then Madras) in 1959, played 94 First Class matches till 1974.

An opening batsman and a wicket-keeper, he made 4061 runs at an average of 29.42 with a highest score of 141 and had 93 catches and 46 stumpings to his credit.

Former India leg-spinner V.V. Kumar said “I played with him for close to 20 years and he was a great captain in the 60s. Under him we really did well in various tournaments. He was a gritty opening batsman and very good ’keeper who gave valuable inputs to the bowler as well. He was a self-made cricketer and off-the field, the heart and soul of any party.”

Another contemporary, former TN fast bowler B. Kalayanasundaram, remarked “he was my captain when I made my debut in Ranji Trophy and someone who always encouraged players. Once played me in an inter-district match when I was not well and made me bowl just five overs before allowing me to take rest, so that he could then pick me for the State side.”

“I knew him from my younger days as we were neighbours in Harrington Road and used to play with a golf ball. He was a very pleasant person and incidentally, I made my debut in his last Ranji Trophy match,” said former India wicketkeeper Bharat Reddy.

The TNCA president and members condoled the demise of Belliappa in a statement.

259,2020/02/19,"Given limited resources, Delhi did well: Bhaskar","Frontline bowlers’ poor returns cited as one reason for failure

After being a credible finalist, Delhi failed to reach the Ranji Trophy quarterfinals for a second season in succession. The reasons for this slide were not hard to seek. The infamy of the Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA) is just one of them.

With Virat Kohli and Rishabh Pant on National duty, Delhi had the services of Shikhar Dhawan for just one match while speedsters Ishant Sharma and Navdeep Saini were available for two. Add to this, injuries suffered by bowlers like Pradeep Sangwan, Vikas Tokas, Pawan Suyal and Vikas Mishra meant Delhi played its league by fielding a second string team.

No wonder, Delhi could win only two games — both at home. Compared to the previous season when Delhi finished with 14 points, this year the tally stood improved to 21.

“For me, that jump of seven points is nothing but a zero because we did not qualify,” reasons Delhi’s coach K.P. Bhaskar, the soft-spoken man who guided Delhi to the final two seasons ago during his first stint.

Key moments

“Given the limited resources we had throughout the season, I think we did well. I know, had Delhi played a few key moments better, held on to a couple of more catches, especially in the slip-cordon, a place in the last-eight was not beyond us.”

A look at Delhi’s bowling performances throws up only one name — Simarjeet Singh. The hard-working seamer took 31 wickets from seven matches. Ishant (11) and all-rounder Kunwar Bidhuri (10) were next best.

“For a team to do well, at least three of your bowlers have to account for 20-25 wickets each. Unfortunately that was not the case,” says Bhaskar.

Delhi’s batting suffered owing to the inconsistency of the top-order. Nitish Rana and skipper Dhruv Shorey, the batting mainstay, had their moments but could not finish with a flourish.

Lack of faith

Another key factor was the lack of faith shown by the Delhi selectors in some of the players. Kunal Chandela, fellow comeback-man Kulwant Khejroliya, Lalit Yadav, Vikas Mishra and Subodh Bhati were among those dropped for different reasons. This, in turn, led to a sense of insecurity in the unit.

Looking forward, Bhaskar says, “There are a number of talented players, both at under-23 and senior level. If Delhi teams can travel to play in tournaments, say in the southern part of the country or even play abroad, this move could help the youngsters a great deal. With more self-belief to go with their immense potential, Delhi stands to gain a lot more.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/given-limited-resources-delhi-did-well-bhaskar/article30862527.ece
260,2020/02/19,"Women’s T20 WC | Shafali is a very important part of the team, says Harmanpreet Kaur","India takes on host Australia in the tournament opener at Sydney Showground Stadium here on Friday

Skipper Harmanpreet Kaur pointed to Shafali Verma as the pick of the youngsters in India’s ICC Women’s T20 World Cup squad. Exciting opening batter Shefali, 16, is expected to play a crucial role in India’s campaign at the mega-event.

India takes on host Australia in the tournament opener at Sydney Showground Stadium here on Friday.

“This year, we have a few new faces in the team. Shafali has been doing very well, and we are very happy for her. She understands her game very well. She is a very important part of the team,” Harmanpreet said at the official welcome event for the Australian and Indian teams at the Sydney Opera House here on Thursday.

Harmanpreet is counting on fan support to boost her team’s morale. “Everyone loves cricket in India. Whether you play in India or abroad, we always get support.

“I love the fact that wherever we play in the world, we always have Indian fans in the stadium,” Harmanpreet said.

Pressure

Australian captain Meghann Lanning spoke about the pressures of playing at home.

“Our players have had a chat about handling the pressures of playing at home. But there will always be pressure involved in playing a big event like the World Cup, regardless of where it is played.

‘Massive challenge’

“Everyone starts on an even keel; there is no real advantage or disadvantage to playing at home. It’s going to be a massive challenge, starting with the match against India on Friday. We’re hoping for a big crowd and lots of support,” Lanning said.

The teams were welcomed by Stuart Ayres, MLC Minister for Jobs, Investment, Tourism and Western Sydney, Bronnie Taylor, MLC Minister for Mental Health, Regional Youth and Women and ICC T20 World Cup CEO Nick Hockley.

Meghann and Harmanpreet were presented with commemorative cricket bats painted by Wollongong indigenous artist Zachary Bennett-Brook.

In light of the recent bushfires, 30 junior players from Camden Cricket Club presented each player with an annual koala adoption from Port Stephens Koalas, a gift that helps with the rescue and treatment of sick and injured koalas in the region.

261,2020/02/19,‘Our boys are mentally very strong’,"Chance to create history, says skipper Rasool

Ashiq Hussain Bukhari tells a story from August, soon after the state of Jammu and Kashmir had gone into virtual lockdown. With no other means of reaching his players, Bukhari, CEO of the JKCA and a former DIG, sent word to police stations in the districts. They were to reach out to certain Ranji Trophy probables in their towns, and ask them to assemble in Jammu, from where the group was to fly out to Baroda for a pre-season camp. As a patrol vehicle reached one player’s house, he got out and ran, afraid that he was going to be arrested. He returned only after the police had explained the situation to his father.

“It was a difficult time because phones were blocked,” says the J & K captain Parvez Rasool. “I didn’t even know if my neighbour was there. In that situation, what do you do? Credit should go to CEO saab.”

That J & K recovered from that painful interruption to pre-season and has now gone on to reach the quarterfinals of the Ranji Trophy says much about the team’s mental strength. During the team’s training camp in Baroda, mentor Irfan Pathan and coach Milap Mewada made it a point to talk to their Kashmir-based players every day. “We were worried for them because they could not reach their families. But they were fine,” says Mewada.

This is only a second Ranji Trophy quarterfinal appearance for J & K, and a first knockout match on home soil. “This is a chance to create history,” says Rasool. “I was telling our players that this game can prove to be a turning point in their career.”

That Jammu is hosting a game of this magnitude could prove to be hugely significant for cricket in the state. “You can see how much passion for cricket exists,” says Rasool, still the only cricketer from the state to have played for India. “There is no infrastructure in Kashmir but you go to any alley there, you will see that they are playing only cricket. In the last two years, we have got players from the remotest of towns, from districts like Doda and Kishtwar. All these external things do not affect us. Our boys are mentally very strong. They have no alternative.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/our-boys-are-mentally-very-strong/article30862396.ece
262,2020/02/19,Karnataka favourite but would do well to be wary,"Hungry J & K no pushover as it seeks to leverage home advantage

The erstwhile Prince of Wales College is an unusual setting for a Ranji Trophy quarterfinal. By the Geology block, students sip tea on benches, lost in conversation. Over in the 115-year-old main block, with its glorious arcades, young boys sprint to class. On the front lawns, students lie on the grass, poring over their books in the shade of tall pine trees. In a far corner of the 65-acre campus, past the hostel block and the library, Karnataka and Jammu & Kashmir will battle each other from Thursday for a place in the semifinals of the country’s premier domestic tournament.

As the two teams trained at the Gandhi Memorial Science College — as it is now known — on match-eve, there was no escaping the presence of security forces. “Too close for comfort,” said Karun Nair, as armed police casually stood around the nets. Karnataka had concerns about playing in Jammu and the KSCA had sought to have the fixture moved to Bengaluru but J & K had no intention of losing home advantage.

Well rounded

Karun Nair’s men, though, will still be favourites. This is a strong, well-rounded side, and any concerns over form were swatted aside last week as Karnataka booked its spot in the last-eight in emphatic fashion, crushing Baroda in three days. Karun, who had hitherto struggled for runs, made 47 in the first innings and then marshalled the run chase with an unbeaten 71.

Manish Pandey’s arrival is a boost. The batsman rejoined the side after a decent outing with the Indian team in New Zealand and will slip into the middle-order straight away. It remains to be seen who makes way for Pandey. Pavan Deshpande would seem the likely candidate but Shreyas Gopal has been poor this season. The all-rounder could sit out if the team management feels Deshpande’s off-breaks are reliable.

Full pace attack

Karnataka has its full pace-bowling attack of Prasidh Krishna, Ronit More and Abhimanyu Mithun available, with the left-arm pace of Prateek Jain an added option. J & K, though, will be no pushover. Parvez Rasool’s men finished on top of Group C with six outright wins, advancing to the quarterfinals for only the second time in their state’s history. This is a young team: six of the 11 that featured in the previous game, against Haryana, had played fewer than 10 First Class matches. The 18-year-old middle-order batsman Abdul Samad is an exciting prospect: he is the team’s top-scorer this season, with 547 runs at a strike rate of 116. He has smashed 35 sixes so far this season; it is no surprise he was snapped up by SRH in the IPL.

With Irfan Pathan’s mentorship and the administrative changes that have taken place over the last year or so, J & K has found a renewed zeal. Karnataka will do well to be wary.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/a63rfw/article30862091.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH20KARNATAKA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/karnataka-favourite-but-would-do-well-to-be-wary/article30862092.ece
263,2020/02/19,Can Andhra spring a surprise?,"Will be up against a confident Saurashtra that has a potent attack

A struggling Andhra, which suffered losses in its last two league games, takes on a confident Saurashtra in their Ranji Trophy quarterfinal at the CSR Sarma College Ground here from Wednesday.

Like the choice of the venue, preferred ahead of the more established centres like Visakhapatnam and Vijayawada, there is scope for surprises from the home team given the fact that it won all the three league matches it played this season here.

For the record, Andhra has qualified for the knock-out phase for the fourth time after 1985-86, 2001 (from the South Zone) and 2014-15 from the Plate Group. Interestingly, this is first time the team has made it to the last eight stage after coming into the Elite Group.

For Saurashtra, it is a second straight knockout appearance.

Key absence

Andhra will feel the absence of India star G. Hanuma Vihari, not just for his batting but for his experience as a leader too. Meanwhile, the likes of the seasoned Ricky Bhui, D.B. Prashanth, C.R. Gnaneswar, Karan Shinde and wicketkeeper-batsman and captain K. Srikar Bharat have been shouldering the responsibility with the willow quite well.

Andhra will ideally look for a big score and then hope that the bowling attack comprising lead wicket-taker and pacer K.V. Sasikanth (35 wickets this season) with new-ball partner Mohammad Rafi, left-arm pacer Y. Prithvi Raj or C.H. Stephen sees it through on a pitch expected to assist fast bowlers. The efficient off-break bowler Md. Shoaib Khan can be a surprise packet here.

The Unadkat factor

Saurashtra’s hopes will clearly hinge on the prowess of 28-year-old left-arm pacer Jaydev Unadkat, who has a stunning haul of 51 wickets from seven games (he was rested for the last league match).

On form, Saurashtra could well be the favourites but again a lot depends on how well the frontline batsmen Arpit Vasavada, Sheldon Jackson, Chirag Jain, all-rounder Dharmendrasinh Jadeja, and Avi Barot respond to the occasion.

In bowling, Unadkat leads the attack with pacer Prerak Mankad, with offie Kamlesh Makwana and left-arm spinner Dharmendrasinh expected to give the pace duo the kind of support it looks for in a crunch game.

The teams (from): Andhra: K. Srikar Bharat (capt), Ricky Bhui, C.R. Gnaneswar, D.B. Prashant, B. Sumanth, Md. Shoaib Khan, K.V. Sasikanth, Y. Prithvi Raj, S.M.D. Rafi, A. Vinay Kumar, Nitish Kumar, Jyothi Sai, Karan Shinde, P. Girinath Reddy, C.H. Stephen and M. Praneeth.

Saurashtra: Arpit Vasavada (capt), Sheldon Jackson, Jaydev Unadkat, Snell Patel, Prerak Mankad, Harvik Desai, Samarth Vyas, Dharmendrasinh Jadeja, Kamlesh Makwana, Kushang Patel, Chetan Sakariya, Parthkumar Bhut, Avi Barot, Vishvaraj Jadeja and Kishan Parmar.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/kx7y7v/article30862063.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH20ANDHRA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/can-andhra-spring-a-surprise/article30862064.ece
264,2020/02/19,My mindset is on the bigger picture: Kohli,"The team wants a lot of my contribution in the next two to three years, says the Indian skipper

Ever since making his international debut in 2008, Virat Kohli has become an integral part of Indian cricket. He has achieved all the records in his 12—year—old career so far and is counted among the modern—day greats.

And now, post the MS Dhoni—era, he has been leading the side in all the three formats and has made sure India remain at the top, be it in Tests, ODIs or T20Is.

However, Kohli — who will turn 32 this year in November, believes the next three years — which will see two T20 World Cups and a 50—over World Cup —— will be “rigorous” for him where he will be playing in all the formats and wants to win the an elusive ICC trophy, something which he has not been able to win as India captain.

“My mindset is on the bigger picture as I prepare myself for a rigorous three years from now and after that, we might have a different conversation,” Kohli told reporters ahead of the first Test against New Zealand at the Basin Reserve.

“At a time where the body can’t take anymore, maybe when I am 34 or 35, we will have a different conversation. For the next two to three years I have no issues at all.

“I can keep going on with the same intensity and also understand that the team wants a lot of my contribution in the next two to three years so that I can ease into another transition that we faced five—six years ago,” he added while talking about the transition phase which will set in the coming two—three years.

The Indian skipper further endorsed the idea of talking about the issues of fatigue and workload management.

“It’s not a conversation you can hide away from in any manner. It is around eight years now that I have been playing 300 days a year, which includes travelling and practice sessions. And intensity is right up there all the time. It does take a toll on you,” he said.

“It’s not that the players are not thinking about it all the time. We do choose to take a lot more breaks individually even though the schedule might not allow you to. Especially guys who play all the formats.

“It’s not easy being captain, having that intensity in the practice sessions. It does take a toll on you. Periodic breaks seem to work pretty okay for me,” he added.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/40sniq/article30858647.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CRICKETSLTOURININDIA2NDT20,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/my-mindset-is-on-the-bigger-picture-kohli/article30858648.ece

New Zealand on Wednesday called in pacer Matt Henry for the first Test against India as cover for Neil Wagner, who is awaiting the birth of his first child.

266,2020/02/19,World Test Championship pinnacle of all ICC tournaments: Kohli,"We want to make sure that we qualify as soon as we can, says the India captain

India captain Virat Kohli on Wednesday rated the World Test Championship as the biggest among all the ICC events in the wake of revelations that the game’s governing body is planning to have more flagship white ball tournaments during the next eight-year cycle from 2023-2031.

According to ICC’s proposed 2023-2031 Future Tours Programme (FTP) cycle, a proposed T20 Champions Cup is earmarked for 2024 and 2028 and an ODI Champions Cup in 2025 and 2029, alongside the T20 World Cups in 2026 and 2030, and the ODI World Cups in 2027 and 2031.

“I think World Test Championship as an ICC tournament should be right up there. All the other tournaments for me they start under that. This is probably the biggest of them all as every team wants to make it to the final at the Lord’s. We are no different. “We are in that zone. We want to make sure that we qualify as soon as we can and be in that frame of mind to hopefully win that (championship),” said the Indian skipper ahead of first Test against New Zealand from Friday.

Kohli has no doubts that World Test Championship has added a context to the traditional format making the contests more exciting with points on offer.

“It has made Test cricket more exciting and that’s something we have experienced as a side although we haven’t had too many games away from home. Couple of games in the West Indies and we haven’t had a tour of Australia as a part of Test Championship. This is our first away tour since the start of home season,” said Kohli.

The skipper expects that the two-Test series will be as intense as the recent series between England and South Africa.

“Games will be intense and teams will go for wins rather than settling for draws which is what we need to see in Test cricket. The South Africa versus England series was very exciting.

267,2020/02/19,T20 Mumbai franchises threaten boycott,"We will not participate in the league under Probability Sports, owners tell MCA

All eight owners of the T20 Mumbai have threatened to pull out of the local league in case Probability Sports — which has been handed the responsibility to plan, market and conduct the league by the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) — continues to be involved in the league.

Representatives of all the eight owners had a meeting with MCA president Vijay Patil at the MCA Club in Bandra-Kurla Complex on Tuesday. They submitted a joint letter to Patil, asking him to intervene and ensure smooth conduct of the event.

Joint decision

“We have decided that unless MCA is not taking charge of the league, we owners will not be participating in the league henceforth under Probability Sports,” the letter, accessed by The Hindu, stated.

While Patil and Probability Sports remained unavailable for a comment, The Hindu understands that the meeting was called by Patil following a letter last week by the team owners against Probability Sports, citing lack of transparency.

Probability Sports — a firm jointly formed by IIFL and Wizcraft only for T20 Mumbai’s conduct — has been handed over a five-year deal by the MCA. While the MCA is paid an undisclosed annual sum — around ₹3 crore per annum, for five years, Probability Sports virtually runs the league.

For the inaugural edition, the six franchisees had entered into a bilateral agreement with Probability Sports.

Supplementary pact

However, before the league’s expansion to eight teams, after receiving complaints about conduct of the league, the MCA had signed a supplementary agreement, making it a party to the franchise agreement besides Probability Sports.

However, according to a team official, no franchisee has been provided with a copy of the supplementary agreement so far.

Interestingly, the much-delayed amendments to the MCA constitution, in line with the Supreme Court-directed administrative reforms, make it clear that the league cannot be outsourced. Clause 28 of the MCA constitution about “Governing Council for T20 Mumbai League/any other premier league” specifies that a seven-member governing council, including the secretary and the treasurer, should be appointed in the annual general meeting.

But the MCA is yet to convene the AGM despite the new set of office-bearers having taken over on October 4. Until the AGM is convened, the fate of T20 Mumbai hangs in the balance.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/t20-mumbai-franchises-threaten-boycott/article30855789.ece

Members of various Muslim organisations staged protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Population Register (NPR) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Erode, Salem, Krishnagiri and Dharmapuri districts on Wednesday.

In Erode, over 2,000 people took out a march on Perundurai Road. As it was earlier said that the protesters would lay siege to the Collectorate, District Revenue Officer S. Kavitha held a meeting with the representatives of various Muslims organisations on Tuesday evening and it was decided to take out a march.

Protesters gathered in front of Kalingarayan Illam with the national flag. They also held placards with slogans such as “No to CAA, NPR and NRC”.

The stretch from Collectorate Junction to GH Roundabout was closed for traffic and huge police contingent was deployed on Perundurai Road and at the entrance of Collectorate. Protesters raised slogans against the Central government. The march and the protest were held for two hours and later the protesters dispersed. Traffic was restored on Perundurai Road after 12.30 p.m.

Special Correspondent in Krishnagiri adds

In Krishnagiri, over 700 protesters thronged Anna statue and gave a clarion call against the Citizenship Amendment Act.

The protesters held placards stating that they were “Indians by citizenship and Muslims by religion”. Men from various jamaaths and other Muslim outfits and women raised slogans against the Citizenship Amendment Act.

The banners held by women read “Nafrat Chodo, Bharat Jodo, Samvidhan Bachao” (shun hatred, unite Bharat and save the Constitution)

The protesters, scattered across the narrow junction of the protest venue, demonstrated their opposition and demanded that the State Assembly pass a resolution against the CAA. At the end of the protest, a few representatives marched to the Collectorate and submitted a petition against the CAA.

In Dharmapuri, over 500 protesters held a demonstration against the CAA on Bharathipuram Road. After a two-hour-long protest, the protesters dispersed peacefully. Few representatives later met the Collector and handed over the petition.

271,2020/02/19,Telecom services remain cut off in Bargur Hills,"Optic fibre cable damaged during ghat road works

Telecom services remain cut off in Bargur Hills since Tuesday evening after the optic fibre cable (OFC) was damaged during ghat road widening works here.

Work is on to double lane Anthiyur – Kollegal Road by the National Highways Authority of India and the project is executed by a private company.

Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) is the only service provider in the hill area and serves people in over 10 remote villages. Deployment of earth-movers for digging resulted in frequent damage to optic fibre cable laid on the ghat road that leads to Thamaraikarai and Bargur and restoration works were carried out by BSNL employees then and there.

On Tuesday, around 50 joints in the cable were fixed on a stretch of eight km. At 4 p.m. on Tuesday, the cable was again damaged causing disruption of mobile services in the hill area. Efforts by BSNL workers to fix the cable did not yield the desired result.

On Wednesday, Collector C. Kathiravan chaired a meeting with senior officials of BSNL, NHAI and representatives from the private company. BSNL officials said that damaged cable on a stretch of 4 km needs to be replaced.

The cost of replacing the cable would come around ₹ 4 lakh and BSNL was asked to replace cable on one-km stretch, and the remaining three-km by the private company.

A senior BSNL official said that only after replacing the cable, service to the hill area could be restored. He said that while BSNL is ready with the cable, the private company needs to procure the cable and handover it to the department for replacement.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/hyzwa2/article30864292.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ER20BSNL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/telecom-services-remain-cut-off-in-bargur-hills/article30864293.ece
272,2020/02/19,Highways Authority to start land acquisition for Karur-Coimbatore bypass,"An official said the Collectors of three districts through which the road will pass through had approved of the alignment in 2018, and the consultant is expected to give the land acquisition details next week

The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) plans to start land acquisition for the Karur-Coimbatore bypass road shortly.

An official of the NHAI said the Collectors of three districts through which the road will pass through had approved of the alignment in 2018, and the consultant is expected to give the land acquisition details next week. This will give a clear picture of the total land required.

The officials made a presentation to the Coimbatore District Collector recently, at the District Road Safety Committee meeting and it is learnt that they were asked to review the alignment.

“We made a presentation at the meeting to give an idea about the project. But the alignment is already approved,” the official claimed.

However, farmers, the Coimbatore MP and some officials too, have objected to the ₹ 3,500 crore project.

On Wednesday, Coimbatore Member of Parliament (MP) P.R. Natarajan and several farmers submitted a memorandum to Coimbatore District Collector K. Rajamani saying the existing road between Karur and Coimbatore should be widened rather than taking up a greenfield project.

Mr. Natarajan told The Hindu that according to details provided by the NHAI officials earlier, nearly 2,000 acres of agriculture land will have to be acquired for the project and it will reduce the distance for those travelling from Karur to Coimbatore by just six km. This too is according to the NHAI estimate.

“There seems to be a hidden agenda behind many of these road projects. It looks like these are taken up to benefit a few people. The Pollachi MP and I have already registered our objection to the project. There is a lot of government land that can be used to to widen the existing road. But the NHAI is not keen on doing it because only if a new road is developed can it come under toll collection,” he said.

According to K. Kathirmathiyon, secretary of Coimbatore Consumer Cause who is also a member of the road safety committee, the project was not presented in any road safety committee meeting earlier. Hence, the members do not know when the Collector approved it. There should be transparency about the project and the approvals given. Many of the officials had expressed their reservation to the project and its alignment at the recently-held meeting of the committee. The existing road should be widened rather than taking up such a project. If there is toll collection on the new road, users will start using the existing road and the new one will remain under-utilised, he said.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/s4aht8/article30859850.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19FEBTH--BYPASS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/highways-authority-to-start-land-acquisition-for-karur-coimbatore-bypass/article30859851.ece
273,2020/02/19,Goonj launches ‘School to School’ scheme in Coimbatore,"Goonj, a non-governmental organisation that focuses on rural development using surplus material from urban areas, launched its initiative for rural schools in Coimbatore on Monday.

Titled ‘School to School’, this initiative would encourage children from urban schools to donate their school materials which would be distributed to schools in rural areas, the NGO’s founder Anshu Gupta told mediapersons. The materials would include school uniforms, books, water bottles and stationery. Goonj would be collaborating with SNR and Sons Charitable Trust here for this initiative, he said.

Swathy Rohit, Chief Operating Officer of SNR and Sons Charitable Trust, said that a total of 90 private schools from Coimbatore city had been invited to be a part of this initiative. “We are working with the schools to collect the materials, segregate them and send them over to Goonj,” she said. The collection of materials would start from March, Ms. Rohit said.

Apart from schools, Mr. Gupta said that Goonj would also accept donations of surplus cloth material, particularly the leftover pieces of cloth, by textile companies in Coimbatore. “We have come up with a model where not even a single inch of cloth can go waste,” he said.

Goonj particularly addressed the basic need of clothing in rural areas through its initiatives, including distribution of inexpensive sanitary pads made out of under-utilised cotton cloth. The organisation distributed clothes in the form of ‘Family Packs’ not as a charity measure, but as a reward for the people working on local issues such as cleaning of roads and water bodies in rural areas, Mr. Gupta said.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/goonj-launches-school-to-school-scheme-in-coimbatore/article30854893.ece
274,2020/02/19,50th anniversary of Ooty Radio Telescope celebrated,"The 50th anniversary since the Ooty Radio Telescope (ORT) first observed occultation of a radio source by the moon was celebrated at the Radio Astronomy Center (RAC) here on Tuesday.

Scientists, professors and retired staff of the ORT over the last five decades attended a special event to mark the occasion.

Professor Pramesh Rao (retired) at the National Center for Radio Astrophysics, said that the ORT was set up by Professor Govind Swarup, the pioneer of radio astronomy in India.

He said the ORT was one of the first radio telescopes that were set up in the country, and the first observations of a lunar occultation event were made on February 18, 1970.

Over the years, the ORT, built at ₹ 60 lakh, had contributed to observations that had helped support the theory of the Big Bang.

“Findings and observations from the ORT have helped support the theory of the expanding universe, when there was debate between two schools of thought – with one half of the scientific community propounding the theory of the Big Bang, and another, proposing that the ‘steady-state model’ to be valid,” said Prof. Rao.

Despite being operational for 50 years, the ORT still continued to contribute to scientific observations even today, said Professor Bhal Chandra Joshi, National Center for Radio Astrophysics.

“The ORT still proves to be a valuable tool in analysing solar winds and coronal mass ejections.

These crucial observations help protect satellites and communication networks all across the world,” said Mr. Joshi.

Another area of fundamental research, which the ORT was being used for, was the observation of 11 pulsars, or neutron stars, being done in collaboration with other observatories across the world to detect low frequency gravitational waves, said Prof. Joshi.

“We feel immensely privileged to have worked in the RAC, knowing that our work contributed to the growth of radio astronomy in India, with lessons and expertise gained from the ORT eventually leading to the setting up of the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) in Pune,” said A.J.Selvanayagam, engineer (retired).

Also present at the event were retired engineers, A.M. Batcha, S. Maria Louis, and V Packiaraj, administrative officer (retired).",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/50th-anniversary-of-ooty-radio-telescope-celebrated/article30854888.ece
275,2020/02/19,Man gets life term for sexually assaulting minor,"The special court for the trial of cases registered under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act in Coimbatore on Tuesday sentenced a man from Ganapathy to undergo life imprisonment for sexually assaulting and impregnating a minor girl.

The court also ordered the State Government to give ₹ 5 lakh as compensation to the girl and her child.

Special court judge J. Radhika awarded the punishment to M. Keerthiraj (29) who had impregnated a 15-year-old girl from the same area in 2015 by promising to marry her.

The girl was staying with her mother and sister near Ganapthy. The mother had allegedly forcibly discontinued her studies at VIII standard as she was suffering from asthma.

The accused got introduced to the girl through her friend and he proposed to marry her. The accused assaulted the girl sexually on multiple occasions when she was alone at house.

The girl became pregnant and the mother lodged a complaint with the police which led to the arrest of Keerthiraj.

Of the ₹ 5 lakh which the court ordered the government to pay as compensation, ₹ 3 lakh was for the girl and ₹ 2 lakh for the child, said Public prosecutor R. Sarojini.

The court also imposed a fine of ₹ 2,000 on Keerthiraj.

According to Sudha Sundaram, Chief Operating Officer of Nitya Gurukula, 10 volunteers will be employed in the initial stage of the helpline service. The phone lines will be open from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. from Wednesday.

On January 7, ‘Prana’ was launched in the presence of Chairman of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan (Coimbatore) B.K. Krishnaraj Vanavarayar and Joint Correspondent of Kumaraguru Institutions Shankar Vanavarayar. N.G.

278,2020/02/19,Footboard travel in buses remains a concern,"It is prevalent in both government and private buses; bus crew has been instructed to prevent it

Despite awareness campaigns and stringent actions, the dangerous act of travelling on the footboard of buses continues unabated in the city.

In the absence of other modes of public transportation such as sub-urban trains, metro rail or mono rail or mass rapid transit system, the pressure on road traffic continues to increase. Either there is increase in number of vehicles, causing traffic snarls on roads, or the buses are fully packed, leading to travel on footboards during peak hours. During the peak hours (7.30 a.m. to 11 a.m and 3 p.m. to 7 p.m.), one could observe commuters travelling on the bus footboards in places like Avinashi Road, Trichy Road and Saravanampatti.

Consumer activist K. Kathirmathiyon said the problem was equally prevalent in government and private buses during the peak hours. The major reason for footboard travelling was the lack of adequate number of buses. “In most of the buses, the number of passengers standing is higher than the capacity of the bus,” he claimed, alleging that neither the Transport Department nor traffic police were penalising such buses as per the Motor Vehicles Act. Overcrowding in buses, which led to commuters travelling on footboards, was an indication of inadequate number of buses, he said.

Noting that overcrowding was particularly high in private buses, Mr. Kathirmathiyon said that people preferred private buses to government buses because of the excess fare charged.

“Deluxe buses run by the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) continue to charge excess fare, which makes many passengers wait for private buses,” he said. A member of the District Road Safety Committee, Mr. Kathirmathiyon noted that no strong action had been taken by the district administration to tackle these issues despite multiple representations.

A senior official from TNSTC Coimbatore Division said that all the newly-arrived buses had automatic doors, which prevented footboard travelling. However, in government buses that did not possess doors, conductors had been instructed not to allow footboard travel. “We are taking all possible measures to curb footboard travelling in the city,” the official said. Overcrowding and footboard travelling only occurred during peak hours and that TNSTC could not operate additional buses solely for these time periods every day, the official said.

A Transport Department official from one of the Regional Transport Offices (RTOs) in the city said the traffic police personnel must monitor footboard travel across the city. “We do not have the numbers to check buses all over the city,” the official said. Nevertheless, the Motor Vehicle Inspectors and Regional Transport Officers from the four RTOs in the city conducted regular checks and issued notices to drivers and conductors of the buses that did not prevent footboard travelling.

Although a potentially fatal activity, footboard travelling is considered only a “minor offence” and is penalised under Section 177 (General provision for punishment of offences) of the Motor Vehicles Act, according to the Transport Department official. Even that attracts a meagre fine of ₹ 100 and it fails to act as a deterrent.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (Traffic) R. Mutharasu said that no major accidents due to footboard travelling had occurred in Coimbatore city recently. “We conduct awareness programmes for college students advising them not to travel on footboards,” he said. During road safety meetings, the traffic police had instructed the conductors of private and government buses not to allow footboard travelling, Mr. Mutharasu said.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/2ne8iz/article30854811.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB19FOOTBOARD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/footboard-travel-in-buses-remains-a-concern/article30854812.ece
279,2020/02/19,Divine vision,"Scriptures speak of the Lord’s transcendental form as subtle, infinite and beyond the reach of human intellect and speech; while His gross form is shown to be His manifestation and immanence in the entire creation. Only realised souls are blessed to experience both His transcendence and gross forms in their heart and inner being. Dhruva gains this divine vision and jnana through the penance that he undertakes in all sincerity, pointed out Sri Ramanujam in a discourse.

Dhruva begins by meditating on the Lord’s form and on the sacred mantra as advised by Narada. In the first month he takes fruits every three days; in the second month, withered grass and leaves every sixth day; then only water every ninth day in the third month. It becomes only air every twelfth day in the fourth month and in the fifth month he stands on one foot and meditates on the Lord with intense breath control. This yoga affects all the worlds. The earth begins to tilt and all beings feel the suffocation.

The Lord then rushes to grant vision to the child and comes mounted on His Garuda. To make Dhruva come out of his meditation, He causes His form that Dhruva worships in his heart to disappear. Dhruva then opens his eyes and sees the Lord in person. He undergoes an indescribable experience. Unable to speak, he merely falls at the Lord’s feet. When the Lord gently touches his cheek with His conch, Dhruva is blessed with the power to sing His glories. Who can sing His glories but for His grace? He sees the truth of God as the only single force behind all creation from the highest Brahma to the smallest ant or insect. He is the prime mover in all beings, ever aware of the needs of each one and always at hand to protect each and every aspect of His creation.",faith,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/faith/divine-vision/article30863730.ece
280,2020/02/19,Aligning with dharma,"The Ramayana illustrates the many facets of saranagati when people seek refuge in God for various purposes, from fulfilling worldly aims to that of attaining salvation. At first, the celestial beings along with Brahma seek Lord Narayana for help, unable to bear the atrocities of Ravana. The Lord then makes known His Sankalpa to take a human form to kill him. Others such as Ahalya, Guha, Bharata, the rishis of Dandakaranya, Kabandha, Sabhari, Sugriva, are shown to seek His grace through surrender. But Vibhishana’s act of surrender at the feet of Rama is singled out as the most comprehensive explanation of the essence of saranagati by many learned scholars and interpreters, pointed out Damal Sri Ramakrishnan and Srimati Perundevi in a discourse.

It defines the bhava and attitude of the seeker and also the unequalled supremacy of the Lord as the sole refuge for the entire universe. Vibhishana of upright character is a dedicated younger brother; but at one stage, he is unable to accept the unjustness in Ravana’s act of coveting Sita. When his warnings go unheeded, he knows that his next move is to seek the Lord. He knows very well what he is renouncing, namely, family and other possessions and also what he is seeking, the invaluable grace of God. Generally human beings are swayed by doubts owing to the power of maya and find it difficult to make the right choice. But the jivatma who receives God’s grace is able to perceive the truth with clarity. Then, the noose binding one to the cycle of birth is loosened and there is no turning back. Like the calf that rushes to the mother cow when it is unleashed, Vibhishana too does not tarry and very quickly reaches the place where Rama and Lakshmana stay, which indicates the urgency of his strong leanings to align with dharma.",faith,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/faith/aligning-with-dharma/article30856785.ece

The JNU Teachers’ Association on Tuesday said that the university through its Executive Council meeting has decided to end the process of deducting a voluntary sum from the salaries of all teachers towards the subscription of JNUTA.

In a statement, the JNUTA said that it condemns Vice-Chancellor M. Jagadesh Kumar’s action of using the Executive Council as an instrument of his vendetta against the JNUTA.

“Instead of owning up responsibility for the horrendous violence JNU suffered under his charge, he [V-C] is compounding his gross dereliction of duty by launching a low level assault on the JNUTA and the constitutional right of teachers to form an association,” the JNUTA said.

By his decision to end what was a pure administrative arrangement — the process of the voluntary subscription of JNUTA members being automatically deducted from their salaries — he has only revealed that he treats the university as his private property, the teachers said.

The JNUTA said that the step of the V-C will only serve to increase the resolve of the teachers to fight and end his misrule.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/v-c-using-executive-council-for-his-vendetta/article30855435.ece

You have occupied prestigious positions and have been recipients of many recognitions. JNU alumni will agree that JNU has made a significant difference in their lives. It is time for you to think of your alma mater and be a part of its ongoing journey.”

Mr. Kumar said that around the globe, higher educational institutions benefit a great deal from contributions received from their alumni and the time has come for JNU to reach out to its alumni across India and around the globe to contribute to “Alumni Endowment Fund”.

The administration said that higher education today is facing many challenges and there was a need to critically assess the future of JNU and how to get there.

The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) on Tuesday informed the National Green Tribunal that the setting up of a Water Front Management Authority, as directed by the green tribunal earlier, was not possible as it required legislative provisions which was not under the purview of the urban body.

A Bench headed by NGT chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel was told that as pointed out by the Yamuna Monitoring Committee, the DDA or the INTACH would require assistance from the municipal corporations or the police as they did not have regulatory powers.

“The suggestion of the Yamuna Monitoring Committee [YMC] is for setting up of Water Front Management Authority under the aegis of the DDA. It is submitted that DDA is already an authority constituted through a separate Act. Therefore, constituting another authority under the aegis of the DDA may not be possible legally as the constitution of the authority may again require legislative provision,” the urban body said in a report filed before the tribunal.

DDA report

Adding that other authorities and stakeholders were involved in management of the riverfront, the DDA in its report said, “Several experts are also involved from time to time... these organisations can access funds from their own budgets. While coordination between all these agencies is of utmost importance but any society or other body may not be able to exercise the powers of these organisations.”

Stating that there was effective monitoring of encroachments and unauthorised construction on the floodplain by the police, the DDA said, “Land in Delhi is with the government of India and the DDA is the agency authorised to manage land parcels in Delhi. Therefore, the landowner by the DDA along the riverfront cannot be transferred to any other agency.”

Justice Navin Chawla sought the response from Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports and Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment on the petition filed by Arjuna awardee Virender Singh.

In his petition, filed through advocate Ajay Verma, Mr. Singh said he is a Deaflympic Champion Wrestler of international repute with 100% speaking and hearing disability.

Mr. Singh said he had also represented India at the international-level in Deaflympics and is popularly known as “Goonga Pahalwan”.

Deaflympics, organised by the International Committee of Sports for the Deaf, is the highest competitive international championship for world deaf athletes with a minimum of hearing disability of 55 decibels.

The Paralympic Games, on the other hand, are international multi-sport event for athletes with physical disabilities or intellectual impairments. This includes athletes with mobility disabilities, amputations, blindness, and cerebral palsy.

Special awards

In 1986, the government introduced scheme of special awards to the medal winners in international events and their coaches.

The objective was to incentivise the achievements of outstanding sportspersons, encourage and motivate them for higher achievements.

Advocate Verma contended that as per the scheme, the award is given to sports disciplines in Olympics or Asian Games or Commonwealth Games and chess.

The plea argued that the current policy of rewarding the persons winning medals in Olympics or Para Olympics games is discriminatory with the persons winning medals in blind or deaf championships.

“In fact, Para Olympics are being treated at par with Olympics and are getting the same cash rewards awarded by the government of India to the winner of open category,” the plea said, adding that the government has kept the deaf or blind championship as a separate category.

A Bench of Justice Vipin Sanghi and Justice Sanjeev Narula stayed the notice issued by the National Anti-Profiteering Authority (NAPA) to Johnson & Johnson and said no penalty proceedings will be initiated till the next date of hearing on September 24.

Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal met Lieutenant-Governor Anil Baijal at the L-G Secretariat here on Tuesday on the eve of a crucial review meeting to discuss the way forward in regard to several flagship schemes prioritised by the newly sworn-in Delhi government.

Garbage-free Delhi

Mr. Kejriwal, who is also scheduled to convene the first Cabinet meeting at the Delhi Secretariat here on Wednesday, will discuss implementation of the Guarantee Card that includes issues related to uninterrupted power supply, a garbage-free Delhi and basic facilities for unauthorised colonies, said sources.

He will also discuss the quality of potable piped water, education for every child, free bus rides for various sections of society, including students and senior citizens, healthcare facilities, safety of women and cleaning of the Yamuna in the meeting.

Environment Minister Gopal Rai will hold a meeting on Thursday with officials of the Environment Department and has asked them to submit a presentation on the status of different projects and plans that are in the pipeline, said officials.

The Environment Department of the government will propose quarterly third party audit of air pollution in the city, increase public involvement, add more locations to list of air pollution hot spots to address the air pollution in the city in the meeting with Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday, said officials on Tuesday.

“The Delhi Pollution Control Committee[DPCC] does not have the manpower or resources to take stock of the ground-level situation across the city and that is why we think that it will be better if a third party does it for us. Also, there will be better documentation if we have more people working on it. It is up to the Chief Minister to take a call on whether to go ahead with it or not,” a senior DPCC official said.

If the plan is approved, the government will then float a tender to hire an organisation to do the audit. “We would also propose in the meeting that there should be better public involvement in solving air pollution like the government had done in the fight against dengue. We are already in touch with an agency, which is ready to do pro-bono work on developing different creatives. We then plan to take it to people through newspaper and television advertisements,” the official said.

‘Individual effort’

The plan is to convey people what can be done on an individual-level to reduce air pollution.

In 2019, the Delhi government had run an extensive campaign on how to prevent dengue with Mr. Kejriwal and other Ministers featuring in videos and photos and through advertisements in different mass communication channels.

“We would also propose to add more areas to the list of air pollution hot spots in the city and better monitoring of these areas, followed by a strong escalation mechanism,” the official said.

Real-time study

The officials will also discuss with the Chief Minister about a real-time source appropriation study being done by the University of Washington in St. Louis, on identifying what are the causes of air pollution.

Last year, 4,000 entrepreneurs had interacted with 3,10,309 students, Mr. Sisodia said.

“We need to create a pool of 17,000 entrepreneurs. There is the need to inculcate an entrepreneurial mindset amongst our students in which the live interactions with entrepreneurs play a very important part. Our entrepreneurs’ recollection of their journey will help the students learn from real-life experiences,” he said, adding that the government has planned to give ₹1,000 as seed money to the Class XI and Class XII to enable them to ‘think-out-of-the box’ and take on a solution-centric approach.

“It is our attempt to let students gain hands-on experience about the entrepreneur’s life, their everyday challenges and achievements. We are also looking to involve parents through Parent-Teacher Meetings where our teachers will help them understand the curriculum. At the end, it’s the parents who would be encouraging their wards to take active participation in the programme,” Mr. Sisodia said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/17000-entrepreneurs-for-classroom-interactions/article30854630.ece
301,2020/02/19,"One in three adolescents faces online abuse, finds study by NGO","It shows lack of awareness among students on Internet safety guidelines

One in every three adolescents exposed to the Internet are victims of cyberbullying and other forms of online abuse and nearly half of the users display some level of addiction, revealed a study on school students on Tuesday.

In an attempt to assess the pattern of Internet use and online safety, an NGO — Child Rights and You (CRY) — conducted a survey in collaboration with Forum for Learning and Action with Innovation and Rigour (FLAIR). It was conducted among 630 adolescents aged between 13-18 years from eight schools in Delhi-NCR. The study involved students filling up a test form and answering a questionnaire.

The study shows that adolescents had easy access to the Internet with 93% of them using it in their homes. There was a clear gender disparity in access to personal devices with 60% boys and 40% girls owning a device.

Thirty percent of adolescents had a negative experience online, the study points out. When broken down across different categories of abuse, it is found that 10% of adolescents experienced cyberbullying, 10% had either their profile misused or account hacked and 23% had seen a morphed image or video online. Only half of these instances were reported by the teenagers.

One of the limitations of the study is that it was not able to record instances of sexual abuse in cyberspace as it was conducted in a controlled environment, said director of policy research and Advocacy of CRY, Preeti Mahara.

Internet Addiction Test

There was also a lack of awareness among the students on the Internet safety guidelines developed by the NCERT with only 30% respondents being familiar with them. Nearly 48% of students were found to be either mildly or moderately addicted to the Internet, while 1% were found to be severely addicted. For this exercise, the students were made to take an Internet Addiction Test.

Access to the Internet is not all harmful as 40% of the respondents said they used it to take help in their studies such as through online search for words or information, tutorials and access to their school’s online education programme.

The same ratio of children also used the Internet for extra-curricular activities such as for music, painting or sports. As many as 50% of students used the Internet for both studies as well as extra-curricular activities.

The study recommends familiarity with Internet safety rules and the skill to use them for reporting to be built into the school curriculum as well as the need to modify the Central government’s child protection scheme to build infrastructure to deal with cybercrimes against children. It also presses for schools to recognise an increase in online crimes against children and develop strategies on prevention, reporting and redressal.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/one-in-three-adolescents-faced-online-abuse-finds-study-by-ngo/article30854618.ece
302,2020/02/19,Tailor who went missing found killed,"Police suspect personal enmity as reason behind the crime

A 40-year-old man was found murdered in Rohini’s Prem Nagar on Tuesday afternoon, the police said.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (Rohini) S.D. Mishra said Rajesh Kumar Gupta from Prem Nagar was a tailor in the area.

The victim on Monday had left his shop at 6.30 p.m. on Sunday but did not return home after which his family approached the police to file a missing report.

‘Strangulated to death’

While a team was looking for Gupta, a PCR call was received at 12.30 p.m. regarding a body lying in the area. On reaching the spot, the body was identified. “It appears that the victim had been strangulated to death. There was also a head injury. Personal enmity appears to be the reason behind the murder as the rings worn by the victim were intact,” Mr. Mishra said.

303,2020/02/19,"Indian pharma industry has come of age, says USFDA official","A senior official in the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) office in India has emphasised the importance of effective and timely communication from pharma companies in their engagement with the health regulator.

Companies that had been issued Form 483, post an USFDA inspection, have to respond within 15 days. They can seek more time to fix the issues, engage a consultant, but all of that they have to convey to the agency within the deadline.

They need to provide more information and communicate more as that’s always helpful, Deputy Country Director Sarah E. McMullen said, adding the pharma companies in India over the years had matured with their regard to quality systems. On its part, the USFDA is engaging with the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) and Gujarat, Telangana, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka that host the most FDA registered pharmaceutical facilities in the country.

Ms. McMullen, who spoke to media, on the sidelines of a panel discussion at the BioAsia 2020 Conclave here on Wednesday, said the number of inspections of pharma units in India by USFDA was pretty consistent. A little over 200 pharmaceutical inspections were carried out by the regulator in the country in a year, she said.

The USFDA issues a Form 483 post inspection in the event of the inspectors observing any conditions that may constitute violations of the norms. The responses of the company, to how it is planning to address the issue, should be comprehensive, thoughtful and realistic, she said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/indian-pharma-industry-has-come-of-age-says-usfda-official/article30864248.ece
304,2020/02/19,Subramanian Swamy terms GST ‘biggest madness’,"BJP MP says investors should not be terrorised by I-T and GST provisions

BJP leader and MP Subramanian Swamy stressed the need for ensuring economic growth at 10% a year for the next decade for the country to become a super power.

Towards this end, efforts should be made to see that investors are not terrorised by the provisions of the income tax and goods and services tax. The GST, he said, was the “biggest madness” of the century and it is so complicated that no one understood the finer aspects like which form to fill and where. The BJP MP was speaking on ‘India – an economic superpower by 2030’, an event organised by Pragna Bharati here on Wednesday.

He expressed concern over the insistence on submission of the GST-related forms online and said the focus should instead be on improving the efficiency levels of investments for ensuring the anticipated 10% annual growth for the next 10 years. The country had achieved 8% growth from time to time, but there had been no improvements relating to the reforms put in place by former Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao.

Also Read Rahul and Sonia will lose Indian citizenship soon: Swamy

The country was currently faced with shortage of demand as people did not have money to spend and this was in turn hindering the economic cycle. If the country wanted to achieve 10% growth, the investment rate to the GDP should be 37%. For this, the efficiency factor ought to be 3.7%.

“How do we achieve that efficiency needed to utilise investments? Firstly fight corruption and second, reward those who will invest,” he said. Laying emphasis on this would ensure that the country could overtake China and would be in a position to challenge the United States for the number one position in the next 50 years.

He demanded that P.V. Narasimha Rao be given the Bharat Ratna, the highest civilian award of the country, for the reforms that were introduced during his tenure. “We have not improved on the reforms that Narasimha Rao with former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh as Finance Minister in his Cabinet implemented,” he said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/y68di5/article30864178.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy20swamy,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/subramanian-swamy-terms-gst-biggest-madness/article30864179.ece
305,2020/02/19,GHMC to take up enumeration of illiterates,"Exercise follows KCR’s call to achieve 100% literacy in State

The Urban Community Development (UCD) wing of the GHMC is taking up a 10-day enumeration of illiterate persons in the city, between February 24 and March 4.

The survey is being taken up following Chief Minister K.Chandrasekhar Rao’s New Year pledge to achieve 100% literacy in the State.

As part of his new year message on January 1, Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao called upon literate citizens to educate illiterate persons in the State, under the theme ‘Each one, Teach one’.

“We have prepared a programme for the 10-day drive, and will cover all the wards of GHMC. Deputy Commissioners in all circles will act as nodal officers for the survey,” said D. Sowjanya, Project Director of the UCD wing.

Project officers of the UCD wing would assume the supervisory role, while at the ward level, Assistant Engineers would monitor the enumeration, which would be carried out by Sanitation Field Assistants and Entomology Field Assistants.

For the purpose of survey, 250 households were designated as an enumeration block, each to be covered door to door by one enumerator.

“The enumerator will collect the details in a printed format, and maintain a register to keep track of the households that he or she covered every day. At the end of each day, the ward level supervisor will check all the forms, which will then be sent to the circle office for uploading online,” Ms. Sowjanya said.

The aim is to get all the illiterate persons literate by the next Census exercise, she said.

As per the 2011 Census, the number of illiterate persons is above 5 lakh in Hyderabad district alone. The UCD wing had already attempted the ‘Each one Teach one’ formula in the self-help groups under its purview, through a joint programme with Adult Education department, Ms. Sowjanya said.

As part of the initiative, illiterate women were identified in each group and were put under the tutelage of educated women from the same group.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ghmc-to-take-up-enumeration-of-illiterates/article30863552.ece

312,2020/02/19,UIDAI seeks proof of citizenship,"Hyderabad resident to move HC; over 1,000 have received notices, claim lawyers

A resident of the old city of Hyderabad who was reportedly asked to prove his Indian citizenship by the Unique Identification Authority of India is all set to move the High Court once the first hearing concludes.

An association of lawyers which came to the resident’s defence claimed that UIDAI had sent similar notices to over 1,000 individuals.

Notice sent by the Unique Identification Authority of India to Mohammed Sattar Khan of Hyderabad.

Rule 30

Mohammed Sattar Khan, a resident of Bhavani Nagar in Talabkatta, a carpenter and autorickshaw driver, received the notice under Rule 30 of Aadhaar (Enrolment and Updates) Regulations, 2016 at home on February 16, his counsel Muzaffar Ullah Khan said. Section 30 deals with communication to a cardholder of deactivation of the card.

“Mr. Khan is an Indian citizen. He has never left the country. He was born here, his parents were born here. In fact, his father worked for Hyderabad Allwyn Limited,” the lawyer said.

The notice, signed by Hyderabad Regional Office Deputy Director Amita Bindroo, informed him of a complaint which alleged that Mr. Khan was not an Indian citizen and that his Aadhaar card was obtained by furnishing false documents.

The notice further directed him to appear before her at a function hall in Balapur, an area which houses Rohingya camps, in Rangareddy district with “all the necessary documents in original to prove all your claims of citizenship”.

The notice directed Mr. Khan to prove that he had entered the country legally and his stay is valid if he is a foreign national. In case Mr. Khan failed to appear, the matter would be decided suo motu.

“The UIDAI has no powers to ask any person to prove citizenship. What it can do is deactivate Aadhaar under Section 33 A. We are going to appear before the Deputy Director and will approach the High Court once the order is given,” the counsel said, adding that two others who had received the notice had approached him.

Notice condemned

Earlier on Tuesday, the Advocates Joint Action Committee condemned the notice and announced free legal aid to those who had received the notices.

Speaking to The Hindu, JAC convener Mohd. Vali-ur Rahman said, “Once we got to know of this notice, we started our own inquiries. People by the dozens started calling us, this is why we can say that around 1,000 notices have been sent. People are afraid to come out, which is why we are offering free legal aid and representation.”

UIDAI clarifies

The UIDAI, in a release, said that Aadhaar has got nothing to do with citizenship.

It said the UIDAI regional office, Hyderabad, received reports from the police that 127 people had obtained Aadhaar on false pretences because they were found to be illegal immigrants. Such Aadhaar numbers are liable to cancellation. Therefore, the regional office had asked them to appear before the Deputy Director on February 20.

Since they may need more time to collect original documents, the UIDAI has postponed the hearing to May.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/o8hgt8/article30858173.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH18KRAAADHAAR2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/uidai-seeks-proof-of-citizenship/article30858174.ece
313,2020/02/19,LIC told to honour claim of accident victim’s widow,"To pay insured sum of ₹1.85 lakh

The bereaved family of a road accident victim was in for relief after a consumer forum directed the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) to pay the sum insured amounting to ₹1.85 lakh. The forum found evidence that LIC had failed to settle the claim.

The District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum was dealing with a complaint filed by M Chandrakala, a resident of Srirampur in Mancherial district.

In her complaint, she stated that her husband, who died in April 2016, had obtained three policies under the Salary Savings Scheme. She filed a claim and when there was no response, she sent a legal notice.

The LIC then communicated to Ms. Chandrakala that the policies had lapsed, and repudiated the claim.

Bone of contention

For its part, the LIC stated that the policy had lapsed and that the Salary Saving Scheme works in such a way that the employer pays the premium. If, due to some reason, that does not happen, it is up to the employee to pay the premium.

It also stated that there is around ₹20 crore in lapsed policies and that LIC incurs heavy expenses for reminding policy holders to make payments.

“If the policy lapses for non-payment of premiums within first three years of commencement of policy, it is in fact a drain on the finances of the corporation. If LIC has to honour all such claims under these lapsed policies, as and when policy holders die, the entire life fund of the corporation would not be sufficient to meet such a mammoth liability,” it stated.

Reminder of duties

Taking arguments and evidence placed on record, the forum noted that the complainant relied on a National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission order which stated that the LIC is liable to pay the claim even if the employer does not pay premium.

The forum stated that on one hand, it is the duty of the LIC to inform of non-payment of premium, and on the other, it is the duty of the policy holder to ensure that premium is remitted on time.

Interest imposed

Apart from honouring the claim with relevant payment deductions, the forum imposed interest at 9% per annum and ligitation costs of ₹5,000.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/lic-told-to-honour-claim-of-accident-victims-widow/article30854813.ece
314,2020/02/19,‘COVID-19 is India’s chance to scale up API production’,"Pharma industry leaders on Tuesday said the COVID-19 outbreak and the resulting pressure it has brought on the raw material imports from China should be viewed as an opportunity to scale up domestic production of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs).

Speaking at a CEO’s Conclave at BioAsia 2020, Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance president and Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories chairman Satish Reddy said the country was one of the largest producer of APIs. But with time, China became the leader in the space. From a position of strength, India has come to rely heavily on the raw materials on China. As per industry estimates, around 70% of the requirement of pharma industry in India is met by China.

Mr.Reddy said with necessary impetus from the government, the Indian pharma industry, which has the capability, can rise to the occasion.

Biocon CMD Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, who spoke to media earlier, also there were reports that the pharma units in India had (raw material) stocks to last two-three months. “But, we should not wait for the stocks to run out. About time we should fill up some of the buffer on our own. If we have the capabilities, we should do it now,” she said, adding the government policy enablement should happen now, not later.

Speaking at the Conclave, the Union Minister appreciated the pharma industry for doing well amid the economic slowdown. Hoping that the outbreak of the virus should not come in the way, he said it is possible that Coronovirus will possibly throw up new opportunities.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/covid-19-is-indias-chance-to-scale-up-api-production/article30854783.ece
315,2020/02/19,MMA choir performs at Dubai Opera for the first time,"Musica Gloria concert celebrates 50 years of Holy Trinity Church, Dubai

The Chennai-based Madras Musical Association choir has literally taken Anton Bruckner’s motet — ‘Locus iste a Deo factus est’ — to heart. The Latin phrase translates to “this place was made by God”; for the choir, it is the Dubai Opera — it will perform this piece at the Emirate at the invitation of the Holy Trinity Church that celebrates its 50th year.

Musica Gloria, includes an ensemble of choral performances by four international choirs — Dubai Camerata Singers, Kuwait Chamber Chorale, Dubai Chamber Choir and the MMA choir. They are accompanied by the Emirates Community Symphony Orchestra. The concert has in its repertoire choral performances in six languages, with 250 voices singing the finale — George Frederic Handel’s ‘Dixit Dominus’, a baroque masterpiece based on Psalm 110.

The Holy Trinity Church is unique in that it is an inter-denominational Christian church rooted in the Anglican tradition but its premises is used as a place of worship by nearly 120 different Christian congregations numbering almost 10,000, and, sometimes sees services in many languages. Since its foundation in 1970, on land granted by the Emir of Dubai Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, people have gathered around its Canterbury Cross to pray.

“The 127-year-old MMA choir, the sole invitee from India to participate in Musica Gloria, will be part of this heritage,” says Vijay Chacko, bass singer and member of the choir committee. “The 77-voice choir will be helmed by music director Augustine Paul..”

Paul says, “It’s an honour for us to sing at the prestigious Dubai Opera that regularly hosts some of the world’s most outstanding talents. We have been practising for over two months. Tours like these add to our experience and expose our choir to a high level of musical standard.”

Apart from ‘Locus iste’, the choir will also perform ‘Storm Is Passing Over’, ‘Sing the Lord Ye Voices All’ and the beloved Tamil hymn ‘Ellam Yesuve’.

Mary Rodrigues, MMA president says, “It’s a tribute to our capability that we get such invitations,” underlining the fact that since its inception in 1893, the choir, usually comprising 90 voices, (several with international accreditations) has excelled in a wide range of musical genres, including classical, spiritual, jazz and pop. They also have performed at the Sydney and London Olympics and in Rome, Vienna, Singapore and Colombo.

319,2020/02/19,"SLMC slams corpn., to submit report","The State Level Monitoring Committee (SLMC) on Solid Waste Management will submit a detailed report before the National Green Tribunal (NGT) stating that the failure of the Kochi Corporation in resolving the legacy waste menace at Brahmapuram had resulted in frequent fires at the dumping site.

“Except for the roads set up for easy access to fire engines, the local body has not yet complied with the committee recommendations that include taking immediate steps to remove legacy waste; ensuring proper leachate treatment; and setting up an overhead water storage tank having adequate capacity,” said A.V. Ramakrishna Pillai, Chairman of the SLMC, who had visited the site on Tuesday ahead of submitting his report before the tribunal.

The NGT had issued an order on January 24 asking the Secretary, Urban Development, Kerala to appear before it on February 28 after stating that the government had not taken any meaningful action to resolve the legacy waste problem. The tribunal had taken into consideration a report filed by Mr. Ramakrishna Pillai on the unscientific dumping of waste in violation of Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, causing huge pollution at Brahmapuram.

The committee had earlier reported that the civic body had not complied with its recommendations to prevent frequent fire hazards at Brahmapuram including the setting up of a fire belt, heavy duty pump sets, and an overhead water storage tank of adequate capacity. It had pointed out that the authorities could only install a temporary pump and a motor set at the site to tackle fire.

In its order issued in July on the legacy waste situation across the country, the NGT had referred to Brahmapuram. “Though known as Brahmapuram waste management plant, it has only been acting as a large garbage dump for many years,” it said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/slmc-slams-corpn-to-submit-report/article30855224.ece
320,2020/02/19,Munambam model to be replicated,"Stakeholders to have direct role in running fishing harbours and their upkeep

The success of the Munambam Harbour Management Society in efficiently managing the affairs of one of the busiest fishing harbours in the State has prompted the Fisheries Department to replicate its success in 13 more harbours.

There are 24 fishing harbours across the State and management societies have been constituted in 13 of them. “They will follow the example of the Munambam society,” said a senior Fisheries Department official.

The society is headed by respective district collectors as chairpersons and deputy director of fisheries as member secretary.

The society will have representatives from all spheres of activities associated with the fishing harbour to ensure that all interests are represented at the harbour management level.

The Munambam Harbour Management Society was registered under the Travancore-Cochin Charitable Societies Act and the society took over the day-to-day running of the harbour from the Harbour Engineering Department in 2005. Since then, the harbour management had been in the hands of the society, which comprised representatives of stakeholder communities that included fishers, Fisheries Department, workers and fish sellers, said the official.

Girish Munambam, a boat owner and a veteran in the field, said that the running of the Munambam harbour had been orderly and efficient over these years.

He said the best part of the management was that stakeholders had a direct role in the running of the harbour, its daily works and upkeep.

The official said that while the society was in no position to make capital investments, it was able to raise money through tolls and user fee imposed on stakeholders.

Located in the Pallippuram panchayat, Munambam harbour is the home base for more than 500 vessels that include 350 trawler boats, 100 gill netters and 50 traditional fishing boats.

During the peak season of the year between August and September, the harbour is able to handle around 100 boats at a time.

The fisheries harbour is constantly inspected by the Export Inspection Agency and other agencies like NETFISH under the Marine Products Export Development Authority.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/qkzp34/article30855220.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19KIMUNAMBAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/munambam-model-to-be-replicated/article30855221.ece

322,2020/02/19,Waterlogging: efforts on to widen Karanakodam Canal,"Efforts are on to widen the Karanakodam Canal before the monsoon sets in to alleviate waterlogging issues at Kadavanthra, Kaloor and Elamkulam.

“The canal may have originally been around 13-m wide, but considering the constructions in the vicinity, it might only be feasible to increase the width to around 8.5 m, which is the width at the tail end of the canal,” said Sujatha M.K., Idamalayar Irrigation project executive engineer, who is part of the technical committee attempting to ensure smooth flow of water in the canal. Desilting of the canal has already begun under Operation Breakthrough — a project spearheaded by the district administration to resolve the city’s waterlogging woes.

Concrete slabs had been placed over sections of the canal, reducing its width to around 4.5 m and obstructing the flow of water, Ms. Sujatha said. The slabs, especially near Subhas Chandra Bose Road at Kadavanthra and Sebastian Road at Kaloor, are now being removed. “All of the rainwater from the Kaloor area will flow through this 6.5-km-long canal, which begins near the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, before it drains into the Chilavannoor lake at Elamkulam. Since the existing culverts are very narrow, widening these stretches where the width has reduced drastically is important,” she said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/waterlogging-efforts-on-to-widen-karanakodam-canal/article30855217.ece
323,2020/02/19,Centralised sewage treatment facility for city mooted,"Amicus curiae submits report to HC in Marine Drive case

The amicus curiae, appointed by the Kerala High Court in the Marine Drive case, on Tuesday suggested setting up a centralised sewage treatment plant in the city.

In a report submitted to the High Court, Amicus Curiae Liju V. Stephen said that sewage waste disposal still posed a problem to the city because of lack of proper drainage.

The report was filed in respsonse to a High Court directive for inspecting Marine Drive areas and checking whether the sewage from nearby buildings was being emptied into the backwaters.

The Kochi Corporation and officers of the State Pollution Control Board had informed the amicus curiae that a sewage treatment plant maintained by the Kerala Water Authority at Elamkulam catered for only six per cent of the population of Kochi. It was found that due to the non-functioning of the central sewage pipeline, the STP was not functioning to its full capacity. The report suggested that a modern STP be installed on the land of KWA at Elamkulam so that major problems in sewage disposal could be addressed.

The amicus curiae further submitted that unless proper sanitation measures were taken, a civic society could not sustain a healthy environment. The government and local body authorities needed to provide sufficient infrastructure to address such issues.

The officers of PCB informed the amicus curiae that no licence or consent had been issued to apartment complexes at Marine Drive for discharging effluent water into the backwaters.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/centralised-sewage-treatment-facility-for-city-mooted/article30855216.ece
324,2020/02/19,"Yet another fire breakout at waste plant, authorities clueless","Fire spreads to a large area; PCB experts monitoring air quality at Brahmapuram

Yet another fire broke out at the waste dumping yard of the Kochi Corporation at Brahmapuram on Tuesday evening even as the reasons for the earlier fires remain mysterious.

The fire that started at the small patches of waste in the afternoon spread over a large area as the day progressed. Smoke billowing from the waste enveloped the sky over the area, raising health concerns. The civic authorities said they had been taking extra care since December to prevent fire accidents at the site. Powerful motors were being used to pump water over the garbage heaps to keep them wet. The plastic waste had caught fire during the last summer too, putting the civic authorities in a tight spot.

The local body had earlier made pathways through the waste heaps for firetenders to reach various points of the yard as the inaccessibility of the area had posed serious challenges to firefighters.

Meanwhile, Mayor Soumini Jain, who visited the site, said the fire was brought under control in a few hours after the blaze. The reasons for the fire outbreak was unknown. The waste might have caught fire as the atmospheric temperature had gone up significantly during the day hours, Ms. Jain said.

A tough task

As the outbreak of the fire was reported, the staff deployed there alerted Fire and Rescue Services officials, who sprung into action. The waste has been spread over a vast area outside the gate of the yard. As the efforts to douse the blaze continued, fresh fire broke out in other places, making firefighting a tough task, said Ms. Jain.

A communication issued by the Ernakulam district administration said efforts were being taken to control the fire. Water was being pumped from Kadamprayar, which flows next to the plant site, on waste. Fire and Rescue Services personnel from various city units and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited were engaged in the rescue operations. The area was lit up to continue the drive during the night hours, said the communication.

The administration had also asked the civic body to deploy officials from health and engineering wings to augment fire controlling measures. “A team of environmental experts from the Kerala State Pollution Control Board will monitor the air quality in the region following the fire,” the communication said.

Incidentally, the police investigation into the reasons of earlier fires has not made any headway. “The police took my statement once. Nothing was heard of the probe since then,” said Ms. Jain.

The Kochi Corporation council decided to approach the police after allegations of some miscreants setting the waste heaps on fire surfaced. No clues could be obtained into the reasons of fire as the CCTV visuals from the yard were missing. The hard disk of the CCTV cameras were found tampered with, raising the suspicion that the garbage heaps were set on fire, Ms. Jain said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/jj9xkf/article30855214.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19KIBRAHMAPURAM1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/yet-another-fire-breakout-at-waste-plant-authorities-clueless/article30855215.ece
325,2020/02/19,Yogi woos youth with jobs,"Number of ‘registered jobless’ rose by 16 lakh since Nov. 2017

In a bid to woo the youth, the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh on Tuesday introduced two new employment schemes in its latest budget.

The government has its task cut out as, according to its own admission, the number of “registered unemployed” persons or job seekers in the State has witnessed a spike of almost 16 lakh since November 2017, the year when Yogi Adityanath came to power.

Presenting a budget of ₹5.13 lakh crore for the year 2020-21, State Finance Minister Suresh Khanna introduced two new employment and self-employment schemes for the youth – the Chief Minister Apprenticeship Promotion (CMAP) scheme and the Yuva Udyamita Vikas Abhiyan (YUVA).

Under CMAP, youths would be imparted on-job training in MSME units and be linked with employment for definite periods. Not only will the youths be imparted training but also given a monthly stipend, out of which ₹1,500 will be borne by the Centre and ₹1,000 by the State government and the remaining by the concerning industry.

A budget of ₹100 crore was allocated to the scheme, said Mr. Khanna in his speech.

Through YUVA, employment would be provided to lakhs of trained youths and YUVA Hubs will be set up in every district to assist them in project conception and operation of unit while providing them financial help for one year, the government said.

This scheme will take over 1 lakh youths towards “self-reliance”, said Mr. Khanna.

329,2020/02/19,Deal with Jio Infocom leadsto chaos in Council meeting,"A meeting of the Kozhikode Corporation Council on Wednesday ended up in chaos over the revised demand made by Jio Infocom Ltd for setting up its poles in the city.

Congress councillor P.M. Niyas alleged that there was large-scale corruption in the deal and the councillors in the ruling front were party to it. This kicked up a row, with the ruling front councillors demanding Mr. Niyas to take back his words, thus exonerating all of them. However, Mr. Niyas stood by his word, resulting in the chaos.

It was the 100th item on the council agenda that requested the council’s permission to grant the permission to Jio infocom for a much lower rent quoted by the Corporation in a previous council meeting. In the meeting of November 27, 2019, the Corporation had demanded ₹500 rent per pole for 6,166 poles with the rent for two years to be paid in advance. The Corporation had served a demand notice of ₹3.99 crore under the assumption that all poles will be made on concrete surface that cost ₹5,473.44 per pole.

However, the company made a request to lower the rent on grounds that all poles will not be on concrete surface. It agreed to pay rent for five years in advance. Under the revised estimate, there will be only 186 poles on concrete surface, while the others will be on other surfaces, bringing the rent much lower to ₹3.01 crore.

Mr. Niyas alleged that the demand made by the company, if approved, would incur huge loss to the Corporation and questioned the haste shown by the Finance Standing Committee in approving the demand. This led to altercations during which he alleged corruption in the deal and that every one except the Mayor from the ruling front had a role in it.

The council took a break to discuss the situation when the ruling front councillors wanted Mr. Niyas to withdraw the comment and he would not relent. However, when the meeting resumed, K.V. Baburaj, CPI(M)’s floor leader, requested his fellow-councillors to let the comment pass, thus putting an end to the impasse.

The council, however, approved the company’s demand with the ruling front councillors voting in its favour, despite the Opposition’s demand to rethink the deal.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/deal-with-jio-infocom-leadsto-chaos-in-council-meeting/article30863177.ece
330,2020/02/19,City Corpn. urges Centre to withdraw gas price hike,"BJP councillor says the increase does not affect those who receive subsidies

The Kozhikode Municipal Corporation has urged the Union government to withdraw the hike in the price of cooking gas as it is an added burden to the common people.

An adjournment motion to this effect was moved by CPI(M) councillor M.M. Padmavathi at the Corporation council meeting here on Wednesday. She termed the hike anti-people.

Criticising the Union government for its proposed sale of public sector enterprises, demonetisation and introduction of GST that allegedly crippled the economy, Ms. Padmavathi alleged that the Centre had a step-motherly attitude towards Kerala.

In the discussions that followed, Congress councillor Vidya Balakrishnan said those Bharatiya Janata Party leaders who had vehemently opposed the nominal hike in petrol and cooking gas prices a few years ago had nothing to say about the present hike.

LJD councillor P. Kishenchand said the increase in LPG prices was a pre-runner to the sale of the Indian Oil Corporation and that it was intended to help the corporates that were to take over the company.

However, BJP floor leader Nambidi Narayanan maintained the stand that the LPG rates were revised timely and that the increase did not affect those who received subsidies. On the other hand, those who had given up their subsidies understood the situation and would not mind paying the price, he added.

Price of hotel food

Later, Independent councillor Mohammed Shameel called the council’s attention towards the exorbitant prices being charged by some restaurants for basic food. He said the restaurants did not exhibit their prices for all customers to see and this led to the customers walking into a trap. He demanded that there should be some sort of regulation for the pricing.

Corporation Secretary Binu Francis answered that a bylaw to this effect was under the consideration of the State government. IUML councillor C. Abdurahiman said the issue should be sorted out through a meeting with the representatives of the hotel and restaurants association.

Building tax

The council discussed the confusions regarding the revised building tax and decided to strengthen the help desk to handle the issues brought in by the public in this regard.

Councillor Satheesh Kumar raised the issue of discontinued breakfast scheme in some schools, which, Education standing committee chairman M. Radhakrishnan said, was to be revived as soon as the treasury ban was lifted.

Water connection

The need for an ownership certificate to get drinking water connection under the JICA Project was brought in by CPI(M) councillor Mullaveettil Moideen.

The council decided to request the State government to relax the clause and provide water connections based on residency certificates and ration cards, just like the electricity connections.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/city-corpn-urges-centre-to-withdraw-gas-price-hike/article30863019.ece
331,2020/02/19,Work on new Korappuzha bridge to take more time,"It will be completed only in August, instead of earlier schedule of April-May

Completion of the construction of the new bridge across the Korappuzha river on the National Highway connecting Kozhikode city and Kannur is set to be delayed as only 40% of the work has been finished so far.

The bridge under construction should have been completed by April-May. But now it is scheduled to be completed in August, a senior Public Works Department (PWD) official said.

The finished works included construction of two of the seven spans of the bridge. Also, the piling works for the 224-metre bridge has been completed. It was the devastating floods of last monsoon that delayed the completion of the new bridge, he said.

The Uralungal Labour Contract Cooperative Society Limited (ULCCS) had bagged the contract for the construction ₹27.17 crore. The demolition work of the old bridge began in mid-December, 2018.

Constructed during the British era, the 80-year- old bridge became unmotorable due to the plying of heavy vehicles. This apart, it was frequently closed to vehicular traffic for repair work.

Then the government proposed the construction of a new bridge. The Kerala Road Fund Board had channelised the funds for the project through the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board. The new bridge will be constructed with bowstring arch girder with Macalloy suspension.

The new bridge with pile foundation will have improved vertical clearance level from the water. So also, the bridge will be constructed with footpaths. The demolished bridge had only 5.5 metres width and had no footpaths that posed a risk to pedestrian safety. Now the width proposed for the new bridge is 12.5 metres.

Earlier there was also a delay in securing the technical sanction, thus resulting in the postponement of calling tenders. This decision should have come January- February of 2018 and the the construction work should have begin in August that year.

As of now, buses halt either at Korappuzha and Elathur on both sides of the river. Vehicles proceeding from Kozhikode city to Koyilandy side take the Vengalm-Pooladikunnu- Pavangad route and vice versa.

The PWD has reconstructed the footbridge across the Korappuzha that was damaged in the floods so as to solve the travel woes of the residents in and around Elathur. Previously the ULCCS has constructed a jetty at Elathur for conducting boat services. But now it has been demolished.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/work-on-new-korappuzha-bridge-to-take-more-time/article30862830.ece

A collective effort to strengthen panchayats is the need of the hour, Minister for Local Self-Government A.C. Moideen has said.

Inaugurating the closing ceremony of the three-day State-level Panchayat Day celebrations at Vythiri here on Wednesday, Mr. Moideen said the State government would seriously consider the long-pending demand of the elected representatives of panchayats to hike their honorariums.

The local bodies had contributed much to the Rebuild Kerala initiative of the government after the floods in 2018 and 2019, the Minister said. The efforts of the local bodies in constructing over two lakh houses under the LIFE Mission had also resulted in creating more jobs in the construction sector of the State, he said.

Mr. Moideen urged the local governments to create a positive and easy atmosphere for entrepreneurs in the State. Laws have to be modified for addressing the difficulties being faced by entrepreneurs in obtaining various licences from local bodies, he said.

All the 939 panchayats, except two, in the State got ISO quality certification and it had made the government proud, he said.

Kerala needs to classify its available land into sectors so that there is enough for agriculture, industry and other requirements, said Minister for Water Resources P. Krishnankutty on Tuesday.

Opening the third Indian National Groundwater Conference at the Centre for Water Resources Development and Management (CWRDM) here, he called upon the farmer community to use water judiciously considering the shortage.

“There is a misconception that the crop would be better with more watering. Judicious use of water will give better crop, thus enriching the economy of the State,” said Mr. Krishnankutty, who claimed to be an ordinary farmer. Drinking water should be preserved for the next generations as well, he added.

The Conference focuses on the topic ‘Groundwater resources management for sustainable development: Special emphasis on coastal and urban environment’. It also encompassd an international workshop on groundwater modelling, which was held on Monday.

Around 300 delegates are taking part in the conference. Around 200 thesis will be presented. Delegates from Russia, Canada, USA, Nigeria, Bangladesh, France, and Nepal are taking part in the four-day conference.

334,2020/02/19,Child’s murder: accused mother taken for evidence collection in Kannur,"Saranya had confessed she killed the 18-month-old child to live with her paramour, who is also a close friend of her husband

The 23-year-old woman, Saranya, accused of killing her 18-month-old child was taken to the crime scene for the collection of evidence in Kannur on Wednesday morning.

The city police took the accused to her residence and the crime scene at Thayyil beach for evidence collection around 10 a.m. The police had a difficult time managing the crowd, including neighbours, relatives and villagers who gathered here. They hurled abuses and turned aggressive against the accused as she walked back with the police after collection of evidence. Police had to whisk her away from the scene, as more people started arriving in the area.

Ms. Saranya showed no remorse as she explained about the crime to the investigating police. When brought to her house, her father Valsraj said she should be hanged for the crime.

“I would be happy if my daughter is hanged for what she did. They do not want Saranya, and no one should go through such a situation,” said an emotional Mr. Valsaraj, who was very close to the child.

Kannur City Circle inspector P.R. Satheesh said they arrested the accused after she confessed of the crime. She killed the child Viyan to live with her paramour, who is also a close friend of her husband.

She took the child from her house near Thayyil beach early on February 17 and threw him on the sea wall. The post-mortem report revealed that head injuries were the cause of the death.

335,2020/02/19,CAG report: BJP seeks Central agency probe,"Ekta Yatra taken out by the party concludes in Kozhikode

BJP national general secretary P. Muralidhar Rao has sought an inquiry by the CBI or NIA into the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) that slammed the Kerala police for missing rifles and cartridges in its special armed units and charging it with misappropriation of funds.

At a news conference here on Tuesday, he said that only a Central agency could carry out a fair probe into the “grave issue”. Besides, the issue assumed significance in the context that sleeper cells of the Maoists and other extremist forces had aligned with the CPI(M) in the State, he said.

Mr.Rao was in the city in connection with the conclusion of Ekta Yatra led by BJP district president V.K. Sajeevan on Tuesday.

Regarding the anti-CAA stir organised by the CPI(M) and the Congress and other parties, he said that the protest only gave a handle to Pakistan which was facing international isolation for funding and sponsoring terrorism.

‘Misleading minorities’

The CPI(M) was misleading the minority communities, especially the Muslims, in the name of CAA that offered citizenship to minorities facing religious persecution in the neighbouring Islamic nations of Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. The CAA had nothing to do with Indian citizenship irrespective of one’s religion, Mr.Rao said.

He wondered why the CPI(M) had been seeking citizenship for Muslims from Pakistan and Rohingya Muslims from Rakhine State, Myanmar. No Indian citizen would accept their logic. At the same time, the CPI(M) had never spoken a word in favour of the Assamese when they had a demographic problem or when the Kashmiri Pandits were displaced, he said.

He accused the Left parties of creating a fear psychosis among Muslims. It was the undivided Communist Party of India that endorsed the Pakistan Resolution of the Muslim League that called for the creation of Pakistan, he said.

The BJP leader said that Indian Muslims were being provoked after raising non-issues such as the NRC which had not even been discussed by the government.

Before taking any decision, the government would discuss the matter and reach a consensus with all stakeholders and State governments, he said.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/93wv0o/article30857688.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18KIBJP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/cag-report-bjp-seeks-central-agency-probe/article30857689.ece
336,2020/02/19,Corporation sees red over compostable bags,"Civic body plans crackdown as non-biodegradable products flood the market

With the State government redefining the ban on single-use plastic, the Kozhikode Corporation has stepped up alert against the use of compostable plastic carry bags. The move comes in the wake of finding several products that pass off as compostable plastic flooding the market.

Good results

The implementation of the ban was carried out effectively by the health wing of the Corporation in the early stages.

It earned good results as most supermarkets and merchant outlets got rid of disposable polythene and polypropylene bags and the public learning to carry cloth bags with them.

“The implementation has sent a clear message to the public. We noticed that the number of plastic carry bags collected by the sweepers has been cut down to 10%,” said Corporation Secretary Binu Francis.

However, the ban had excluded compostable products in the first phase, which earned the products a sudden mileage among the merchant community as they were found to be a perfect alternative for plastic bags. However, investigations revealed that many of the products that pass off as compostable were in fact non-biodegradable. It lead to the ban on compostable products last week.

The Corporation recently held a meeting of merchants, requesting them to abandon compostable products as well. The merchants’ request for three months’ reprieve to get rid of the stock was denied. “The merchants had stocked compostable bags as it was allowed in the earlier phase of the ban. They asked for time, but we cannot allow it. The inspections will resume soon and even compostable products will not be spared,” said Mr. Francis.

Food packaging

Meanwhile, a recent meeting of the State-level task force on plastic ban has called upon manufacturers of food products to convert their packaging to compostable plastic before April 2, 2020.

They are also to take steps to compensate for the pollution they cause, by taking back their packaging as their extended producer responsibility.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/qj1dt6/article30854693.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG20200218221220,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/corporation-sees-red-over-compostable-bags/article30854694.ece
337,2020/02/19,"Awareness of crimes against women, children necessary: Madurai MP","MP calls upon district administration to stop child marriages

Madurai MP Su. Venkatesan on Wednesday said crimes against women and children had risen by 250%, according to data provided by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB).

Speaking at Negizchi 2020, an event organised by Lady Doak College on its premises in collaboration with UNICEF focussing on the need to end violence against women and children, Mr. Venkatesan said it was essential for men to stop being primitive to stop perpetuating crimes.

“Until then, the notion of development will be non-existent,” he felt.

The district administration and authorities from various departments, including the Child Welfare Committee and the District Child Protection Unit, must make efforts to ensure that any and all child marriages were stopped in Madurai.

“If the Collector of a small district like Perambalur can stop 600 child marriages in a year, we must stop at least 10 times the number of marriages in our district,” he said.

The MP said that there was a need to keep a close watch on the relationship between the number of drop-outs and the number of juveniles convicted for murder. To ensure that students did not go astray, education routes must be strengthened.

Director, Thozhamai, A. Devaneyan said it was imperative to consider those between 15 and 18 years of age as children and not adults.

He added that students from schools and colleges must be taught to use ‘1098’ Childline service without hesitation in times of dire need.

338,2020/02/19,Man convinced son’s death not due to custodial torture,"He had earlier demanded a CBI probe into the incident

MADURAI

The father of a 22-year-old man, who had sustained injuries in the custody of Avaniapuram police that led to his death, informed the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Wednesday that he was convinced that his son’s death was not a case of custodial death.

The court was hearing the suo motu proceedings initiated on the alleged custodial death of M. Balamurugan, who sustained injuries in police custody and subsequently died at Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) here in October last year.

Balamurugan and his associates were arrested by the police for allegedly kidnapping a youth and demanding money from his parents. Later, the parents of Balamurugan were informed that their son was admitted to the GRH.

P. Muthukaruppan, the father of Balamurugan, who had earlier sought a CBI probe into the death of his son, chose to withdraw his petition. However, advocate Henri Tiphagne, who had earlier represented Mr. Muthukaruppan pro bono, urged that the petition be heard suo motu.

When the case was taken up for hearing, Mr. Muthukaruppan, through his counsel A. Kannan, informed a Division Bench of Justices M. Duraiswamy and T. Ravindran that he was convinced that his son’s death was not a case of custodial death.

However, advocate Henri Tiphagne argued that Mr. Muthukaruppan withdrew the petition due to threat from the police and he was being coerced not to depose against those involved in the case. He also argued that certain transactions had taken place in this regard.

Denying the charges, Additional Advocate General K. Chellapandian said that the allegations were false and the State was already conducting an inquiry into the incident and against those involved. He also submitted a counter affidavit in this regard.

Taking cognisance of the submissions, the court directed Mr. Muthukaruppan to file an affidavit and adjourned the hearing till February 26.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/man-convinced-sons-death-not-due-to-custodial-torture-avaniapuram-madurai/article30863283.ece

MADURAI

After a retired conservancy worker from Usilampatti in Madurai district moved the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court seeking payment of his monthly pension, the court on Wednesday directed the State to consider his plea.

Justice M.S. Ramesh directed the State to consider the plea of the retired conservancy worker, N. Balu, and pass appropriate orders within six weeks.

The petitioner said that he had served as a conservancy worker at Thimmanatham panchayat office in Usilampatti for over 20 years. At the time of his retirement in 2018, his service was reviewed and officials expressed their satisfaction with his record.

Meanwhile, the State government in 2017 had passed a Government Order with a direction that all employees in government departments and local bodies in the special time scale of pay should be granted special monthly pension and a lump sum payment at the time of retirement.

Mr. Balu said that after his retirement he submitted an application to the State to avail himself of the retirement pension. However, the authorities concerned had not considered the application. Even repeated reminders of the pendency of the application fell on deaf ears, he said.

341,2020/02/19,Vendors to get chic vending carts,"1,243 carts will be stationed on three select streets

As a measure to improve the lot of street vendors, Madurai Corporation has planned to provide mobile vending carts to 1,243 vendors at three spots in the city.

The project, which aims to support urban street vendors, will be executed under National Urban Livelihood Mission. Corporation officials said that administrative sanction had been obtained for the project and tenders called for.

Corporation Commissioner S. Visakan said that recently ₹6.78 crore was sanctioned for the project by the Commissionerate of Municipal Administration.

“After Chennai, Madurai is the second urban civic body in the State to have received the funds for the project,” he said.

Of the total 1,243 vendors, 390 have been chosen from East Chithirai Street, 354 from Thalavai Street and 499 from T.P.K. Road.

Assistant City Health Officer S. Vinoth Raja said that all the vendors on these streets, with an identity card, have been chosen under the project. “These streets, which are usually thronged by shoppers, were chosen based on a survey,” he said.

He said that each cart will have a shed and multiple provisions to store the products. “We have also proposed to have two bins in each cart, so that the vendors can segregate waste into biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste and dump them into the bins,” he said.

Explaining the importance of the project, the Commissioner said that this project will help the street vendors to carry out their business irrespective of weather conditions.

“These vending carts will help in streamlining the vendors and it will be easier for the civic body to regulate them. These uniform carts will take up less space and hence will help in reducing traffic congestion on roads. It will also improve hygiene of food sold by the street vendors ,” he said.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/9i1jiu/article30857323.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18MACITY-CARTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/city-vendors-to-have-chic-vending-carts-soon/article30857324.ece

343,2020/02/19,Retired TNSTC employees demand hike in DA,"MADURAI

Hundreds of members of Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) Retired Employees’ Welfare Association staged a demonstration in front of the TNSTC- Madurai headquarters on Tuesday, demanding a hike in dearness allowance (DA).

Joint general secretary of the Association R. Devaraj said that there had been no revision in their DA since November 2015. “Currently, the DA paid to the retired employees stand at 119%. In January this year, the government announced that the DA has been increased to 174%. Though the rate of DA paid to the retired employees increases every six months, there has been no revision in the DA paid to us for the past 52 months,” he complained.

The protesters said that in September last, the State Transport Secretary, after consultation with top management officials had promised to address their demands within 45 days. “But, till date our demands have not been fulfilled. Since the DA has not been increased for the past 52 months, it is becoming difficult for us to make both ends meet when the inflation rate is rising,” said Mr. Devaraj.

The protesters also urged the State government to provide health insurance to retired employees and disburse terminal benefits to them, which they claimed, had been pending since last April.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/5fdwlq/article30857353.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA19MDUTNSTC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/retired-tnstc-employees-demand-hike-in-da-madurai/article30854896.ece
344,2020/02/19,"Paddy procurement centres mismanaged, say farmers","They demand setting up of more facilities so that they need not travel long distances

MADURAI

A section of farmers from the district are of the view that the number of direct purchase centres (DPCs) for paddy, which are being set up by the district administration, are insufficient. Even the ones functioning are mismanaged, leaving space for corruption, they say.

M. Mani, a farmer from Thumbaipatti, said that a large group of farmers from five surrounding villages had finally received order to establish a DPC in Thumbaipatti after staging protest and mounting pressure on the district administration after having submitted a petition on January 13, requesting the setting up of a centre.

“This year, there has been sizeable production of paddy. In places where people have only produced 10 tonnes of paddy, we have been able to produce 15 tonnes. The administration does not have enough manpower or funds in circulation. Should they not actively work with the farmers to set up procurement centres to meet the demand?,” he asked.

N. Palanisamy of Tamil Nadu Sugarcane Farmers Association, who raised the issue during the farmer’s grievance meeting held in January, said that since the administration had not set up an adequate number of DPCs, farmers were selling paddy at rice commission mandis. These mandis, in turn, were selling the paddy for higher rates at the DPCs. Mr. Palanisamy said that farmers who rarely made good production each year had got the rare opportunity to get some additional income this year. “The administration should helpi them, but is clearly not taking any proactive steps,” he said.

While the DPCs were located at an interval of half to one kilometre in Chellampatti, people in blocks like Kottampatti and Melur had to travel at least 10-15 km, carrying their produce, weighing tonnes, he said.

Mr. Mani and S. Jeyakumar, a farmer from Vadipatti, said that the DPCs collected between ₹40 and ₹50 for each bag as ‘labour charges’. “We have no choice but to part with the amount. Ideally, the Tamil Nadu government must pay for the labour and transportation expenses,” Mr. Mani said.

The farmers added that the additional need to procure a signed document from the Village Administrative Officer (VAO) specifying the exact amount of paddy produced and sold to the DPC, was a long and exhaustive task. “While some VAOs are cooperative, many others take their own time to get back, delaying the process even further for the farmers,” he says.

An official from the Civil Supplies department said that the Collector had issued an order to open 65 DPCs across the district and more had been opened eventually on request through petitions. “The process is systematic and will take time according to the rules. We have officials from the civil supplies department monitoring the personnel in each centre to ensure that no sort of under-the-table dealings take place,” he added.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/paddy-procurement-centres-mismanaged-say-farmers-madurai/article30854836.ece

346,2020/02/19,"Bankers have to be true to values to grow, says former SBI chief","In this digital age, it is necessary for bankers to retain the trust of customers and ensure that all actions taken are in the best interest of the latter, said former chairman of State Bank of India Arundhati Bhattacharya here on Tuesday.

Speaking on ‘A peep into the future of banking’ during the Founder’s Day celebrations of Karnataka Bank, Ms. Bhattacharya said banking is all about acquiring the trust of customers. “Do not use data that is detrimental to customers. Use this only with their express consent. Customers should feel that the decisions taken by the bank were in their best interest.” This, she said, was the way to tackle ethical issues arising through adoption of digital technology in banking.

Adoption of digital technology, she said, was not just about providing ATM cards and Internet banking. “It’s all together a different world. It is a change in the whole banking process,” she said referring to initiatives such as opening bank accounts using fingerprint scanners and Aadhaar card, taken during her tenure in the SBI. “Yes there will be hiccups. But we have take up this digital journey,” she added.

Among the concerns of adopting digital technology will be condition of the 90% of workforce when artificial intelligence systems take over their functions. “You have to bear in mind that people still prefer advice on health and wealth issues,” she said, while advising banking personnel to migrate from being accountants to wealth advisers.

Asking bankers to ensure that the data of their customers is kept safe, she expressed the need for bankers to be more vigilant. “You need to be one step ahead of the person trying to access your domain,” she said, and added that the fight against cyber criminals was an ongoing one and bankers needed to keep working to keep criminals at bay.

In the welcome address, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Karnataka Bank Mahabaleshwara M.S. said the bank was adopting digital technology in a big way and was emerging as a bank of future.

During the MDA programme, all the people in the district were compulsorily given albendazole and diethylcarbamazine (DEC) tablets. These measures proved to be effective. After the programme, the Transmission Assessment Survey (TAS) and Post-Mass Drug Administration (MDA) survey were conducted in the district in 2014, 2016 and 2019. These surveys showed that there was no case of filariasis in the district.

For formal declaration of the district as ‘filariasis-free’, a certification from the World Health Organisation (WHO) is needed. The certificate had been sent to WHO for approval and it was awaited.

349,2020/02/19,Residents of multi-storeyed buildings told to adopt rainwater harvesting,"‘Taking it up will help increase water table and people will feel a sense of responsibility for usage of water, while helping address water scarcity’

Deputy Commissioner G. Jagadeesha said on Tuesday that all residential multi-storeyed buildings should give importance and adopt rainwater harvesting measures on their premises.

He was speaking after inaugurating a rainwater harvesting system whose water will be used for an open well and a borewell at the Sai Radha Enclave apartments near the Police Grounds here.

Mr. Jagadeesha said that adopting rainwater harvesting system would help increase the water table. Besides, people would feel a sense of responsibility for usage of water when they adopted the rainwater harvesting systems. This would help address the problem of drinking water scarcity which the city faced during summer.

In places such as Kolar, people and farmers alike treated water like gold, saved it and made its optimum use. When he had earlier served as the Chief Executive Officer of the Kolar Zilla Panchayat, he was instrumental in the construction of about 700 check dams there and it had helped in water conservation, he said. Udupi district had many rivers and rivulets. But it was necessary to build check dams on these rivers in as many places. Steps were being taken towards this end. This would help in improving the water levels in water wells in such places, Mr. Jagadeesha said.

Chief Executive Officer of the Udupi Zilla Panchayat Preeti Gehlot said that Udupi district received over 4,000 mm of rain annually. But, during summer, the district faced water scarcity. Hence, it was the duty of everyone in the district to conserve water, she said.

Joseph G.M. Rebello, social worker and rainwater harvesting expert, said that rainwater from the roof of this apartment block would be allowed to flow freely from June 1 to 7 so that dirt, if any, on the roof was cleared.

After that, water from the roof would be allowed to flow into two tanks which had three layers of jelly and a layer of sponge to filter it. Then, water from these two tanks would be directed to a well and a borewell. There were 40 flats in the apartment block, he said.

350,2020/02/19,Alemane that came only as an alternative is an instant hit,"Umanath Shetty who returned to test his luck in agriculture has set up a traditional sugarcane crushing and processing unit at Thekkatte

The Alemane (traditional sugarcane crushing and processing unit) that he set up after finding no buyers for the sugarcane grown on his field has now become an instant hit with consumers lining up to buy freshly prepared jaggery in Udupi district.

Umanath Shetty of Cherkadi, who was into hotel business in Hubballi, returned to his in-law’s place at Shanadi-Kedoor, off Thekkatte in Kundapur taluk of Udupi district, a decade ago to test his luck with agriculture. He raised sugarcane in about 12 acres; but unfortunately, the Brahmavar Cooperative Sugar Factory was not revived.

Nevertheless, the 60-year-old commerce graduate established the Alemane by spending about ₹ 5 lakh a couple of months ago to process sugarcane on his own. He does not use any chemical additives either for cultivation or for processing jaggery, Mr. Shetty said.

“We just boil the juice and later allow it to dry. Initially, I hadn’t thought of selling the product at the site; but when a few visitors showed interest in buying, I thought of directly connecting with consumers,” he told The Hindu.

His neighbour Ramachandra Bhat took marketing responsibility; and through social media and word of mouth, the Alemane became known in the region. Mr. Shetty said that while he produces about three quintals of jaggery every day, the demand is for about eight quintals.

Devidas Shanbhag, a cloth merchant from Maravanthe, vouched for Mr. Shetty’s claim saying that he had to return with just two boxes of jaggery on Sunday. Though he wanted more, he would have had to wait for three hours as the juice was still boiling in a large pan.

Wooden clock specialist and freelance photographer Dinesh C. Holla from Saligrama said that the product was mouthwatering. Unlike other jaggery in the market, Shanadi Alemane Jaggery, though solid in look, melts in one’s mouth as one tastes it, Mr. Holla said.

Mr. Shetty said that the Alemane might run for another fortnight, till the standing crops are harvested. If he gets more sugarcane from other farmers, he may continue it for some more time. He sells jaggery at ₹ 70 a kg if the customer brings his own container; it is also available for ₹ 150 in a 2-kg container.

Venkatesh called on the Governor, the Chief Secretary and the Director-General and Inspector-General of Police in Bengaluru on Saturday. He said that they were courtesy calls, after assuming office.

A release from Coast Guard District Headquarters, Karnataka, here said, Mr. Venkatesh briefed Governor Vajubhai R. Vala about various facets and developments pertaining to the Indian Coast Guard, especially in Karnataka. With ever increasing challenges of security and safety at sea, discussions were focussed on strengthening the maritime domain of coastal Karnataka.

He also called on Chief Secretary T.M. Vijay Bhaskar and appraised him about various developments in Area of Responsibility and the envisaged plans to strengthen the maritime domain towards the security of the Karnataka coastline.

During his meeting with the Chief Secretary, various issues relating to Coast Guard facilities, infrastructure, coastal security, fishermen and the progress on proposed setting of Indian Coast Guard Academy Project (ICGAP) in Mangaluru were discussed.

Mr. Venkatesh, during his meeting with DG & IGP Praveen Sood, discussed the role of enhanced security and increased surveillance of the Karnataka coast. The Commander also appraised a regular community integration programme in place in coastal districts to educate and assist fishermen. The main area of concern was to educate fishermen about the need to carry lifesaving equipment for survival at sea during distress.

The State government was assured that Indian Coast Guard in Karnataka would continue providing rescue and relief to the fishermen whenever they were in distress at sea.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/mtk4v9/article30855038.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19MNCOASTGUARD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/coast-guard-commander-calls-on-governor-officials/article30855039.ece

The COVID-19 outbreak in China will be considered a ‘force majeure’ situation, which refers to extraordinary events and circumstances beyond human control, the Finance Ministry said on Wednesday.

The move provides some relief to companies with central government contracts forced to default on contract obligations due to delays in input shipments from China.

The declaration of a ‘force majeure’ situation was one of the major demands of industry representatives who met Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to discuss the fallout of the epidemic on Tuesday.

Senior government officials met on Wednesday afternoon to discuss their demands and the response measures needed to deal with supply chain disruptions.

The Expenditure Department has now issued an office memorandum to the Secretaries of all Central government Ministries and departments in this regard.

“A doubt has arisen if the disruption of the supply chains due to coronavirus in China or any other country will be covered in the Force Majeure clause. In this regard, it is clarified that it should be considered as a case of natural calamity and FM may be invoked, wherever considered appropriate...” said the memo.

“This would avoid imposition of penalties and other negative consequences on the companies executing government contracts who may be dependent on supplies from affected areas,” said a senior official.

The memo noted that an FM clause “does not excuse a party’s non-performance entirely, but only suspends it for the duration of the FM.

353,2020/02/19,RTI replies flag concerns about tea waste’s use as adulterant,"The Tea Board’s response to an RTI query, filed by a Nilgiris resident, has revealed that 23 companies in Southern India were granted licenses to purchase “tea waste” between January 1, 2010, and November 5, 2019.

The replies given by authorities to two separate Right to Information (RTI) requests have raised concerns about the possibility that “tea waste,” ostensibly being bought for use in bio-fertilizer plants, is instead being used by manufacturers to adulterate tea.

The Tea Board’s response to an RTI query, filed by H. Intesar, a Nilgiris resident, has revealed that 23 companies in Southern India were granted licenses to purchase “tea waste” between January 1, 2010, and November 5, 2019. According to the government, tea waste is described as “tea sweepings, tea fluff, tea fiber or tea stalks or any article purporting to be tea which does not confirm to the specification for tea laid down under the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954 (37 of 1954), but does not include green tea or green tea stalks.”

Of the 23 companies given licenses to purchase tea waste, 15 purchase it for use in bio-fertilizer plants, eight of which are located in Coimbatore and Tirupur, said Ms. Intesar. “When we filed another RTI query with the [Tamil Nadu] Department of Agriculture, it was clarified that none of the companies functioning in these areas have applied for permits to run bio-nutrient fertilizer facilities,” observed Ms. Intesar, who said that the findings raised major concerns about what was being done with the tea waste.

“If the tea waste is not being used to produce fertilizers, it could point to the waste being supplied to tea manufacturers to be used as an adulterant,” she added.

A tea manufacturer in the Nilgiris, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that the RTI replies raised an “enormous number of questions, as to how much of the quantity of tea being produced in the Nilgiris is adulterated, and as to how many factories are involved in such practices”.

“It should be the responsibility of the Tea Board to ensure that companies that do purchase tea waste use it for the purposes that they are reporting,” the manufacturer said. “There should be periodic checks and action taken against companies purchasing tea waste without getting the requisite permissions,” he added.

Officials from the Tea Board said that based on the returns submitted by the manufacturers of bio-fertilizers, a total of 2.16 lakh kg of bio-fertilizer had been produced over the last five years by 15 companies.

A senior official from the Tea Board said that the allegations raised by the RTI activist would be seriously looked into. “We have already cracked down on a number of factories found to be adulterating tea, and will continue to aggressively clamp down on anyone found to be doing so,” asserted the official, who declined to be identified.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/5y05g4/article30862256.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TEAWASTE,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/rti-replies-flag-concerns-about-tea-waste-use-as-adulterant/article30862257.ece
354,2020/02/19,Vistara plans to start in-flight broadband service by March-end,"It would also be the first domestic carrier to provide in-flight broadband for fliers.

Full service carrier Vistara plans to offer in-flight broadband service on certain international routes by March-end after inducting Dreamliners and Airbus 321 planes, a senior airline official said on Wednesday.

A joint venture between Tatas and Singapore Airlines, Vistara has tied up with Tata group firm Nelco to offer in-flight connectivity service.

Vistara would also be the first domestic carrier to provide in-flight broadband for fliers.

The airline would offer access to in-flight connectivity only on Dreamliners, which is Boeing 787 aircraft and Airbus 321 aircraft on international routes, Vistara Chief Strategy Officer Vinod Kannan told reporters here.

The service would also be available for domestic customers when these planes are operated in the Indian airspace.

Nelco has partnered with Panasonic Avionics Corporation to start the service.

“We have ordered Dreamliners and A321 which will be delivered by February-end or March. We will start their commercial operations on international routes by March-end or April with in-flight service on board.

“In the next two weeks, we will sit with Nelco and Panasonic to decide on the price,” Mr. Kannan said.

Vistara has ordered six Dreamliners and ten A321 planes. In-flight broadband service would be made available on all these aircraft.

“We will get four Dreamliners and two A321 aircraft this year. By end of 2021, we will be offering in-flight connectivity in 10 aircraft,” Mr. Kannan said.

According to him, a decision on offering the service in domestic flights would also depend on routes where Dreamliners and A321 aircraft would fly.

“We will initially look at offering broadband service. We have not decided on offering voice calls,” Mr. Kannan said.

Nelco MD and CEO P J Nath said the capability to provide both broadband and voice services would exist. It would depend on airline partners on the way they would like to package the services, he added.

“We are delighted that Nelco is spearheading in providing the long awaited Aero in-flight connectivity services in the country. Vistara is first airline to sign up for this service,” Mr. Nath said.

Panasonic Avionics Corporation Vice President Tom Eskola said passengers would be able to access the service even at a height of 35,000 feet.

“We currently cover 99.6% of routes on which aircraft fly. We are also migrating our system to generation 3 from generation 1. Vistara will have access to our generation 3 system when they start operation which will offer high speed broadband service during flight as they get on ground,” Mr. Eskola said.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/8sxpof/article30859476.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/INDIRAGANDHIINTLAIRPORT,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/vistara-plans-to-start-in-flight-broadband-service-by-march-end/article30859477.ece

The country’s largest two-wheeler maker Hero MotoCorp on Tuesday announced investment of ₹10,000 crore over the next 5-7 years on various activities, including research and development and setting up new manufacturing facilities.

Announcing that the company’s Vision 2020 will “be the future of mobility”, Hero MotoCorp Chairman and Managing Director Pawan Munjal said the company also aims to be carbon neutral by 2030.

“Today even as we continue to rationalise our costs, we will not leave any stone unturned to realise our Vision of ‘The Future of Mobility’.

“Over the next five to seven years, we would be investing around ₹10,000 crore in research and development of alternative mobility solutions, modern, state-of-the-art, sustainable manufacturing facilities, network expansion, and brand building across the globe,” Mr. Munjal said.

He said ever since the company started its solo journey in 2011 after parting ways with Japan’s Honda, Hero MotoCorp has invested USD 1 billion on new plants, machineries and product development while another USD 600 million was pumped into R&D.

Munjal said, later this year the company expects to cross 100 million cumulative sales since the company started its journey way back in 1985.

Hero MotoCorp on Tuesday launched BS-VI compliant versions of its Glamour motorcycle model priced at ₹68,900 and ₹72,000 and Passion Pro bike priced at ₹64,990 and ₹67,190.

The company also unveiled premium bike Xtreme 160R which will hit the markets in March.

Sharing the company’s sustainability targets, he said Hero MotoCorp aims to be carbon neutral by 2030; waste neutral by 2025 and 500 per cent water positive by the same year.

Munjal also stressed on the company’s ambition to become a force to reckon with in global landscape and said the company is now exporting to over 40 countries as compared to just four when it started the solo journey in 2011.

There has been a lot of innovation by the company’s global partners and more will come, he said adding “sooner than later we will find our rightful place in global automotive business”.

He further said, “Changing times call for a change in structure. So, to address the new, emerging trends, we have created a separate vertical — the Emerging Mobility Business Unit (EMBU) that is working on a range of mobility solutions for the future.”",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/4twrvs/article30857956.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HEROMOTOCORP,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/hero-motocorp-to-invest-rs-10000-crore-in-rd-other-activities/article30857957.ece
356,2020/02/19,It’s time to empower mayors,"Elections to urban local bodies should take place on non-party lines

The spectacular victory of the Aam Aadmi Party in the Delhi Assembly election is seen as a reiteration of voters’ confidence in the leadership of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, even though several factors together contributed to the poll outcome. This development may again give rise to the demand for a ‘strong mayor’ helming urban local bodies (ULBs), as the role of the Delhi Chief Minister is treated on a par with the role of a mayor of a municipal corporation. With electoral politics in India becoming increasingly personality-centric, the idea of an empowered mayor may find many takers.

Indirect elections

In the last six months, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu decided to have indirect elections of ULB chiefs. In Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan,the Congress won in a majority of ULBs after effecting the change. In fact, according to one estimate, the system of direct election of mayors is in vogue only in two States — Uttarakhand and Jharkhand.

The larger issue at hand is the quality of urban governance. It is unrealistic to expect a high quality of governance as long as political parties have a complete grip over the way civic bodies function. It is time policymakers and political leaders began to seriously contemplate party-less elections to ULBs. This idea is not new. It has been debated at the All India Mayors conference. But due to the unwillingness of parties to examine the concept, the idea has not taken off.

Already, in a majority of the States, the election for the posts of presidents and councillors of gram panchayats is done on non-party lines. At least in respect of rural local bodies (RLBs), there is some justification for the presence of political parties as, otherwise, caste alone might determine votes. But in ULBs, the caste factor remains subdued, especially during elections. Besides, there is no sound rationale for holding polls for ULBs on party lines as these bodies neither legislate nor frame policies. Also, there is no scope for any political ideology to play a role in the affairs of ULBs. The main task of the bodies is to handle problems concerning sanitation, water supply and solid waste management. Even in the area of water supply and sewerage, the role of the municipal corporations of Chennai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad has got reduced as there are entities exclusively for this purpose. Delhi too has a Jal Board, headed by the Chief Minister.

Protagonists of the party system may point out that there has been a tradition of political leaders heading ULBs. They may also argue that the participation of political personalities in elections to ULBs cannot be prevented. But the reality is that the calibre of the political leadership is in short supply and the issues concerning ULBs have undergone a sea change over time. According to the 2011 Census, there are about 8,000 towns in India. There are at least 50 cities or urban agglomerations with more than a million people, says the 15th Finance Commission. These cities face challenges of pollution, ground water depletion and sanitation. There are also inter-State disparities in the level of urbanisation and in the urban poverty ratio. ULBs don’t have finances, a problem ignored by the elected representatives.

Parties have nothing to fear

There is also political justification for why elections to the ULBs should take place on non-party lines. Under the present scheme, Chief Ministers do not want strong ULB chiefs to emerge, especially if the person happens to be from his or her party. This explains why parties prefer indirect elections. On the contrary, if the polls are held on non-party lines with direct elections for chiefs of ULBs, a new crop of leaders will emerge outside the political class. Well-educated and well-qualified youngsters will be encouraged to take part in the election process. More importantly, municipal elections are bound to become cheaper as there will be no need for competitive spending by nominees of rival parties. Even if some successful mayors emerge in the process and want to take on established parties in the Assembly or Lok Sabha polls, this will be a herculean task for them, so parties have nothing to fear. In fact, parties stand to gain, as MLAs may not be villified for all the wrongdoings of local bodies.

Also Read No substitute for local governance

Questions will be raised about the credentials of candidates for the post of mayor. State Election Commissions can prescribe qualifications for mayors, over and above the existing ones, to address them. The issue of cohesion between mayors and councils will also be raised. This remains a major problem but committed individuals, if elected, can easily thrash out this issue. ULBs can have meaningful empowerment only if the concept of non-party elections is adopted. This is a prerequisite for the implementation of the ‘strong mayor’ model.

357,2020/02/19,The significance of the term ‘secular’,"It enables focus on religion-based discrimination and misrecognition

What value is added by the term ‘secular’ to liberal democracies, i.e. states that safeguard liberties of individuals and political freedoms of citizens? For some scholars, virtually nothing. Why? Because, while secularism is against discrimination only on the basis of religion, a ‘liberal democracy’ is against all forms of discrimination. The term ‘liberal democracy’ subsumes ‘secularism’. Why bother with ‘secularism’ then? Why not commit ourselves to the priorities of a liberal democracy instead? This is a fashionable view in Europe. Even some Indian scholars argue for the sufficiency of Articles 14-16 and 19 of the Constitution.

Discrimination and recognition

This view is inadequate, if not wrong. The word ‘secular’ is important. Those who claim the sufficiency of ‘liberal democracy’ must think again. True, their claim has had some validity in Europe, but it is losing relevance there too. But in places like India, it is a virtual non-starter. Why? Let us first get a handle on Europe’s specificity. Secular states did not emerge in Western Europe in the immediate aftermath of the religious wars. These wars were stopped by the establishment not of a secular but a confessional state in which people were forced to embrace the religion of the king. Those who did not comply faced death or expulsion. Every European society from then on became religiously homogenous — England became Anglican; Scandinavia, Lutheran; France, Catholic. Over time some dissenting groups were tolerated, but not without paying a price for their dissent. For example, although they were permitted to have their own church, it had to be hidden away in bylanes. Even the rich were forced to build chapels within the premises of their homes. Dissenters lived under the threat of persecution and daily harassment. The tolerant states of early modern Europe were a far cry from modern European liberal democratic states.

Also Read The return of the secular

Once other religions were eliminated or tamed, a struggle began against a politically meddlesome and socially oppressive church. The demand to separate church and state (which later came to be called political secularism) was supported by those who favoured free markets, private property and personal liberties. The moment this separation was sufficiently achieved, it began to be taken for granted, and slowly receded into the background. In this sense, ‘secularism’ lost its political and social salience in these religiously homogenous societies. The fight for a liberal state seemed sufficient.

Centuries later, when the general ethos in Western Europe witnessed the further decline of Christianity, the term ‘secular’ found itself linked to a humanist world view for which religion, whatever its private benefits, was potentially a public problem. While becoming increasingly less salient, it was etched in the bitter collective memory of these societies as the source of discord from which they had mercifully escaped. A religion, already on the defensive, faced greater devaluation and marginalisation. No one wanted religion-grounded recognition. With this, the idea of separation of state and religion lost its normative value further. These liberal states, where religion was no longer significant, granted formal equality to all citizens and called themselves liberal democratic.

But what if Europeans had to institute a liberty-loving, equality-caring state as soon as religious wars erupted? What if there was not much of a time lag between religious wars and the growth of a serious commitment to the values of liberty, equality and fraternity? Had this been so, demands for ending the religious persecution of dissenters and preventing religious homogenisation would have been immediate. How else could a state live up to the ideals of liberty and equality? Moreover, the dynamics of a multi-religious society is such that religion would not have lost salience. Then, instead of getting rid of religious dissenters and minorities, a general consensus might have been sought to prevent their domination by the majority religious community. Had multiple religious identities been part of the social climate, a commitment to equality would have compelled European states to give impartial public recognition to all religions. Such states would be secular precisely in the sense that Indians conceived it — something with which to fight not just religious fanaticism and intra-religious oppression but also the domination of one religion by another. They would have been forced to call themselves not just liberal (subsuming within it secular in the European sense) but also ‘secular’ in the sense defended by Gandhi, Nehru and Ambedkar where it designates impartial public recognition to all religions. My point then is that the greater the salience of religion and depth of diversity in society, the larger the prospect of intra- and inter-religious domination, and the more pressing the need for a state — given its commitment to liberty, equality and impartial recognition — to call itself ‘secular’.

Also Read How to rescue genuine secularism

Also, if religion-related bigotry and denial of recognition is present persistently, then it is hard to forget or ignore it. People potentially affected by them need to be repeatedly told that the state is there for them. The function of the term ‘secular’ is to do precisely that, to reassure anyone threatened by religious or religion-based exclusion, discrimination or misrecognition that the state is committed to preventing all this. To drop the word ‘secular’ then undermines confidence in the impartial character of the state.

Why use a specific term?

The point can be made differently. Why lump together all forms of discrimination and oppression under the same general term? If the term ‘secular’ focuses on one specific kind of domination, why not to use it? Isn’t de-cluttering our world and helping us focus on particular features an important function of all concepts? Why not call a flower ‘red’ when you have a distinguishing word for it? What point would be served by simply calling it coloured? To be sure, in some contexts, this might be sufficient. For example, if our purpose is to differentiate it from all white flowers the use of the term ‘coloured’ is adequate but not if one coloured flower is to be distinguished from another. Likewise, ‘secular’ helps focus on institutionalised religious domination, to demarcate it from other kinds of domination based on class, gender, ethnicity, etc. ‘Secularism’ implores us to resist it.

Also Read Is India still a minimally decent society?

In religiously homogenous societies, particularly where the importance of religion has weakened, liberal democratic states tend to be relatively indifferent to the term ‘secular’. However, in religiously strong and diverse societies such as India, ‘secular’ is indispensable. It cannot disappear from public and constitutional discourse. Is it surprising then that after a few years of exile, it has recently resurfaced in India?

Here we cannot follow European habits but must embrace both liberal democracy and a form of secularism that fights religion-based misrecognition. Indeed, even Europe is changing. After the migration of workers from former colonies, Europe’s new religious diversity has brought religion-based recognition to the fore. Therefore, in Europe too demands for an impartial secular state (in the Indian sense) will become louder.

358,2020/02/19,Lending a helping hand,"India’s tepid response to China’s woes has put its impressive soft power gains on notice

Prime Minister Narendra Modi had pitched considerable personal capital to trigger an uptick in India’s mass cultural appeal in China. Chinese netizens have not forgotten Mr. Modi’s carefully choreographed itinerary during his state visit to Xian and Beijing in 2015. While his presence with President Xi Jinping at the Big Wild Goose Pagoda in Xian, showcasing Chinese monk Xuanzang’s epic journey to India, stirred the deep undercurrent of India and China’s common heritage of Buddhism, other events that were staged were no less significant. A Yoga-Taichi demonstration, in the presence of Mr. Modi and Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang at the Temple of Heaven, a world heritage site, showcased the tantalising possibility of a symbiotic revival of two ancient civilizations. By opening a Weibo social media account, the Prime Minister established a direct cyber connect with China’s tech-savvy millennials.

Bollywood further built on these foundations. Dangal, Secret Superstar, Hindi Medium, and Bajrangi Bhaijaan were super hits, establishing a deep emotional connect with Chinese audiences. TikTok, the short video-sharing app, opened new channels of curiosity about India among young Chinese.

Striking the right balance

But India’s tepid response to the mounting woes of ordinary Chinese — the target of the novel coronavirus, which has killed over 1,800 people, spread panic, and threatened to derail the economy — has put these impressive soft power gains on notice. Chinese netizens question whether India has struck the right balance in protecting its domestic population from the deadly disease and dousing the flames of a neighbour whose house is on fire. “Chinese people believe that a drop of water given in need shall be returned with a burst of spring, which means if others offer even a little bit of help, one should return the favour with all he or she can,” wrote the state-run tabloid Global Times, on India’s response.

Also Read China’s envoy thanks India for support during coronavirus crisis

Many contrast New Delhi’s arguably overcautious response — initially banning all export of face masks, suspending e-visas for over a billion Chinese, and sending a delayed message of empathy at the highest level to the distressed Chinese — with the solid and spontaneous support shown by the Japanese for their embattled neighbour.

Japan’s response

Disregarding the trauma of Tokyo’s 1937 invasion and its enduring fallout, Chinese Internet users have showered praise on a retailer from Japan, which donated one million masks to the city of Chengdu. The Japanese city of Oita sent 30,000 masks to its sister city, Wuhan. The hashtag #Japan sends a million face masks to aid Wuhan# went viral, with more than 500 million views on Weibo. The Japanese also avoided fire-walling their borders. In their initial response, Japanese authorities barred the entry of only those Chinese citizens whose passports had been issued in Hubei province, the epicentre of the COVID-19 outbreak.

Despite the initial damage, there may still be an opportunity for India to recover some of its soft power erosion. The key would be to follow the precedent of 2003, when George Fernandes, then Defence Minister, travelled to Beijing to express India’s full support to the Chinese people, during the SARS outbreak.

That visit reminded people of Dwarkanath S. Kotnis, an Indian surgeon who had died in China, where he had gone in 1938 as part of a five-member medical team to assist Chinese revolutionaries at the time of the Sino-Japanese war. That team had been cobbled together by Subhas Chandra Bose, on the instructions of Jawaharlal Nehru, to flag anti-colonial internationalism in Asia. Incidentally, before entering ground zero of the Chinese revolution, the Indian medical unit had been moved from Hankou port in Wuhan, where SARS-CoV-2 was first detected.

359,2020/02/19,Birds hit: On state of Indian birds,"Bird diversity in India must be protected for cultural and ecological reasons

Birds are under increasing pressure from human activity, struggling to survive as habitat loss, pesticides, hunting and trapping for the pet trade push them closer to the edge. Once-thriving endemic or migrant bird populations have been decimated over the past quarter century in India, as the scientific report, State of India’s Birds 2020, points out. The analysis, produced by 10 globally influential organisations, is a major addition to ornithology. It is a rare synthesis of scientific understanding and citizen-led initiatives, using over 10 million observations made by over 15,500 bird watchers, achieving what would be difficult for small groups of researchers working alone. What emerges is an alarming picture of long-term declines of several species for which enough data is available over a 25-year period, as well as a more recent trend of annual losses. Data inadequacies have led to the exclusion of many species. Some bird species assessed as ‘least concern’ by the IUCN, were found in peril in India. Remarkably, in spite of having a rich ornithological tradition, only 261 species out of 867 spotted qualified for a full analysis, based on robust long-term data; 52% of them are now classified as being of ‘high concern’. The heartening news is that sparrow numbers remain stable overall, although the bird has largely disappeared from some of the big cities. But the Western Ghats offer bleak prospects, and the abundance index of 12 endemic species there has dropped by 75% since 2000. The fortunes of the Nilgiri Pipit, Nilgiri Thrush and several Sholakilis are tied to the survival of the high shola forest-grasslands. Equally critical to some species, such as the Hodgson’s bushchat wintering away from Mongolia, is the protection of terai grasslands in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and the northeastern States.

India’s conservation community expects the Environment Ministry, which released the status report at the global conference of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals at Gandhinagar, Gujarat, to secure a future for birds. Resolute steps to protect forests and other habitats will confer multiple benefits, protecting other myriad species too. The latest report is refreshing as it taps into citizen science for good data and should serve as a foundation for further collaborative work. It is essential to revive the Great Indian Bustard, now pushed to precariously low numbers. Coursers and floricans need help with their delicate habitat, as do neglected small birds such as the Green Munia that is widely trapped. Bird diversity makes India, Kerala in particular, a birdwatching destination. That variety must be protected not just for cultural reasons, but to improve the health of forests, wetlands, open country habitat and high mountains.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/birds-hit-the-hindu-editorial-on-state-of-indian-birds/article30854103.ece
360,2020/02/19,Visa power: On deportation of British MP,"While mounting a diplomatic offensive, India should be more accommodative of criticism

The government has explained its decision to detain and deport British Labour MP Debbie Abrahams, saying that she had attempted to enter India on an “invalid visa”, as the government had revoked her e-business visa three days prior to her travel. It also seems clear that the decision to revoke the visa was prompted by her frequent criticism of India on the issue of human rights in Jammu and Kashmir, and a proclivity towards echoing Pakistan’s line on the issue. After the government’s amendment to Article 370 in August, Ms. Abrahams, who is the Chairperson of the U.K.’s All-Party Parliamentary Group on Kashmir, had stepped up her campaign, and raised the issue of J&K in the British Parliament as well. The government has not explained, however, how someone it considers so inimical to Indian interests received a one-year business visa in the first place in October 2019, and why it took four months to cancel it. Eventually, its reaction to her arrival in New Delhi, detaining and questioning her before deporting her was nothing short of ham-handed. To be clear, the government is well within its rights to deny entry to anyone that it desires to. However, if its plan was to avoid public criticism of its actions in J&K or of its democratic values, then its treatment of the MP has only ended up having spotlighted its actions even more. Parallels will also be made to the response to criticism from the U.S. Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, who like Ms. Abrahams has family ties with India, and co-sponsored a House resolution critical of India on J&K. External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, in Washington in December, cancelled a meeting with the influential House Foreign Affairs Committee as a snub to Ms. Jayapal, instead of trying to engage her at the meeting. The government is apparently banking on the fact that Ms. Jayapal and Ms. Abrahams are from Opposition parties, and hence it will not face adverse consequences from the Trump administration or the Johnson government.

Where governments like those in Turkey and Malaysia have themselves been critical, India’s response has been equally sharp: the démarche to the Turkish Ambassador this week and travel advisories issued earlier to Indians travelling to Turkey, or the trade restrictions on palm oil imports, most of which are from Malaysia, are notable examples. New Delhi’s anger over negative comments by Turkish President Erdoğan or Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on India’s “internal affairs” would seem more valid if it was not at the same time organising groups of envoys to visit J&K and encouraging them to express their positive opinions on the situation there. In the same vein, the boycott or deportation of politicians, visa denials to foreign journalists, all appear to be a part of a pattern of whimsical behaviour not suited to a democracy like India that prides in its traditions of openness and debate.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/visa-power-the-hindu-editorial-on-deportation-of-british-labour-mp-debbie-abrahams-over-kashmir/article30854092.ece
361,2020/02/19,Elevated corridor project back on the agenda,"BJP MLAs meet Deputy CM ahead of budget

City MLAs from the BJP met Deputy Chief Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan on implementing the controversial elevated corridor project that had been opposed by several BJP leaders when it was mooted by the previous Congress-JDS government.

The MLAs suggested taking up the project in a phased manner to decongest the city with priority being given to corridors where land acquisition will not pose a hurdle.

Karnataka Road Development Corporation Limited (KRDCL) officials were present at the meeting.

Yelahanka MLA S.R. Vishwanth told The Hindu that many are of the opinion that work on an elevated corridor should be taken up from K.R. Puram to Yeshwantpur on a priority basis. “Earlier, there was a proposal to build the corridor from Hebbal to Silk Board via Jayamahal Road, Shantinagar, but land acquisition is not easy. The K.R. Puram to Yeshwantpur corridor is easier to implement. The MLAs will approach the Chief Minister to allocate ₹5,000 crore in the coming Budget to implement the project.”

When asked about public opposition given the environmental impact, the MLA said, “There will be opposition, but a solution is needed for the growing congestion on the roads. Measures should be taken to implement the project with minimum impact on the green cover.”

Back and forth

As per the original plan, the KRDCL had proposed to build an elevated corridor from RMZ to Yeshwantpur via Millers Road, Jayamahal Road, Mehkri Circle. The previous JD(S) and Congress coalition government had allocated ₹1,000 for the project.

The KRDCL had floated a tender for implementing one arm of the elevated corridor from Baptist Hospital to Silk Board, prior to the Lok Sabha elections.

The project faced criticism from citizens and also some BJP politicians.

After coming to power, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa scrapped the tender process, and the project was put on hold.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/elevated-corridor-project-back-on-the-agenda/article30863930.ece
362,2020/02/19,10 teams win Aarohan Social Innovation Awards,"The awards recognise innovative solutions for the underprivileged and marginalised in India

The Infosys Foundation on Wednesday felicitated winners of the second edition of the ‘Aarohan Social Innovation Awards 2019’, which recognise and reward individuals, teams, and NGOs for creating innovative solutions to support the underprivileged and marginalised in India.

Five teams won the ‘Gold Award’ with a prize of ₹20 lakh for each team. The ‘Silver Award’ with a prize of ₹10 lakh was also presented to five teams.

The Gold Award winners will be a part of an eight-week residential mentorship programme at the Indian Institute of Technology-Hyderabad where they will incubate and scale their innovations.

Among the winners of the Gold Awards for Sustainability were Rashid K., Vimal Govind M.K., and Nikhil N.P. from Kerala who have developed a manhole cleaning robot, which they call ‘bandicoot’. “Our main aim is to eliminate the inhuman practice of manual scavenging. We hope to add dignity to human life, and that one day manholes will be called robot holes,” the team said.

Ramalingam P.L. from Chennai won the Gold Award for creating an affordable wheelchair that enables children and those suffering from spinal cord injury to stand with normal arm pressure. He said that the challenge was in the size. It had to be small enough to fit the average Indian house. “Attention was also given to issues such as low on maintenance and easy to assemble. We wanted it to be as simple as possible and as affordable as possible,” he said.

Among the winners in the Silver Award category were Aneesh Kumar, who has developed a mechanic orthotic caliper. “The ones available now range between ₹70,000 to ₹3 lakh. However, mine costs only around ₹10,000. The final clinical trial is on,” he said.

Most of the winners said that they faced hurdles due to the area of research as well as getting clearances from authorities.

“All these are disruptive innovations that have immense potential to benefit lakhs of people. Hence, more support and mentoring from the government is needed,” said Dr. Vishal U.S. Rao, who has developed a voice prosthesis that helps throat cancer patients to talk.

The jury accepted submissions in six categories: Healthcare, Rural development, Destitute care, Women’s safety and empowerment, Education & sports, and Sustainability. However, the winners of the 2019 awards cover only four categories: Healthcare, Sustainability, Rural development, and Destitute care

Sudha Murthy, chairperson of Infosys Foundation, said that the Foundation is open to more ideas and would expand to more fields/categories in the future. “The government should think over such social innovations and encourage them in various ways. If any such innovator comes to me, I will definitely give them a recommendation letter and talk to the authorities,” she said.

Nandan Nilekani, co-founder of Infosys, said that innovation in the social area was a challenge as the problems were complex. “The challenge is also in frugal innovation as it needs to be more accessible and affordable,” he said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/k7wvlv/article30863892.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20BGINFOSYS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/10-teams-win-aarohan-social-innovation-awards/article30863893.ece

The Karnataka High Court on Wednesday directed the Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) to close within a month a bio-methanisation plant, dry waste collection and transit point established on a civic amenity site at 2nd stage, 2nd phase, Mahalakshmipura without obtaining consent for operation from the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB).

A division bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Hemant Chandangoudar passed the order during the hearing of a PIL petition filed by Mahalakshmipuram 2nd Stage, 2nd phase Residents’ Welfare Association

The bench also directed the BBMP to restore the site, measuring, 4,747 sq.m., to the original condition within two months of closure of the plant.

However, the bench said that the BBMP is at liberty to submit an application seeking consent from the KSPCB to operate the plant as per the law.

365,2020/02/19,‘Working class finds BMTC fares too high’,"Findings of a survey on the state of public transport

A survey conducted by the Bengaluru Bus Prayanikara Vedike (BBPV) on mobility among the working class, mainly street vendors, domestic workers, pourakarmikas, security staff, construction workers and garment workers, found that fare pricing remains an issue. The respondents said that BMTC bus fares are too high when compared to other modes of transport, including private buses, maxi cab services, share autos and two-wheelers.

Around 80% of the people surveyed found the bus fares too high while 41% of non-bus users said they would shift to public buses if fares were reduced. The survey revealed that commuters spend 21% of their earnings on commuting, of which 15% was spent on bus fares and the rest on first- and last-mile connectivity.

The sample size, however, was small — only 95 — when compared to the lakhs of people using BMTC buses every day.

Vinay K. Sreenivasa of the Vedike said the purpose of the survey was to present an overview of the state of public transport.

Further, the survey reveals that 17.3% commuters used BMTC because it was convenient while 5.8% used it because it was affordable and safe. The BMTC should focus on increasing the percentage of commuters who use its services for convenience, affordability and safety, said the Vedike.

They have urged the government to set up a fare stabilisation fund to help BMTC reduce fares significantly, and grant funds to purchase 3,000 more buses this year as well as ensure the fleet is doubled in two years. It has also demanded that the bus priority lane be extended to high-density corridors, and consult commuters’ groups on the budget.

“The government consults stakeholders of various sectors before the budget, but does not consult anyone who uses public transport. Hence, we conducted a survey whose results will be submitted to the government,” said Mr. Sreenivasa.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/tkpu98/article30854620.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19BGSHIVAJINAGARBUSSTANDBMTC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/working-class-finds-bmtc-fares-too-high/article30854622.ece
366,2020/02/19,Long security queues at Chennai airport irk passengers,"Every day, nearly 40,000 passengers travel through the airport and many of them say the terminals are choked during peak hours

Air passengers flying out of Chennai airport are irked as they have had to wait for long periods during security checks in both domestic and international terminals.

Every day, nearly 30,000-40,000 passengers travel through this airport and many of them say the terminals are choked during peak hours; as a result of this, they have to wait from anywhere between half hour to 45 minutes at times. Jeyanthi S, a resident of the city who recently travelled to Hyderabad says, she had to wait to for nearly half hour to finish her security check. “With two bags in hand, by the time I was done with the security check, I was fed up. Either they are terribly understaffed or the authorities are unbelievably slow in checking passengers. For a metro airport like this one, if they don’t resolve this problem at the earliest, passengers will dread coming here,” she said.

Many irate passengers have repeatedly posted pictures of long serpentine queues they stand in and why there is no respite for this problem.

Gautham CB, a passenger posted this on Twitter: “@HardeepSPuri: Sir, Chennai Airport security check is a mess. Queue management in temples are better. There is no orderly. Why can we have more space to do this efficiently? This airport deserves better. Poor @CISFHQrs too. Help them.”

Officials of Airports Authority of India (AAI) said, the terminal capacity is almost saturated and with the limited space, it is quite a challenge to fix this problem immediately. “We have been taking measures to ease congestion for many months now. As soon as the new modernisation work is complete and the new integrated terminal is opened, such issues will not exit and passengers can easily complete the security check,” an official said.

The phase II modernisation work will be over in another one year, officials said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/w5h7q3/article30861153.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19FEBTH-AIRPORT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/long-security-queues-at-chennai-airport-irk-passengers/article30861154.ece
367,2020/02/19,"Chennai’s P.S. Sivaswami Salai in Mylapore causes multiple accidents, say residents","The road is in terrible condition, apart from being narrow and filled with potholes and has not been re-laid in years, commuters say

Accidents happen in the blink of an eye on P. S. Sivaswami Salai in Mylapore, especially in the stretch between Vivekananda College and Thiruvika High Road. The road looks as if it has been cut all along, and added to this are multiple speed breakers.

“The stretch from Oliver Road to Vivekananda College too, is bad and has potholes apart from being narrow. but it is definitely better than the second stretch. Two-wheeler riders find it very difficult since the surface is uneven throughout. Bigger vehicles like buses manage and if they speed up, it spells danger for two-wheeler riders and autorickshaws that require more balance,” said Selvan of Ayyanar Stores near Vivekananda College.

Mylapore resident, T. Raghunathan said that the road has been in the same condition for several years now. During Chief Minister Jayalalithaa’s previous regime some work pertaining to the sewage network was taken up but after that the road was not restored properly, he said.

Residents said not even patch works were undertaken by the Chennai Corporation. The road was used for many years by motorists to reach Royapettah High Road from Luz Corner.

368,2020/02/19,Insolvency proceedings ordered against Kanishk Gold,"A case filed by the State Bank of India said the company owes about ₹311.49 crore as on July 9, 2019

The Division Bench of National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) has ordered insolvency proceedings against Kanishk Gold Private Ltd, in a case filed by State Bank of India.

According to the petition the company had availed of credit facilities from a consortium of banks, with SBI as a lead bank. SBI said the company owes it about ₹311.49 crore as on 09.07.2019.

The other banks in the consortium include Punjab National Bank, Bank of India, IDBI Bank, Syndicate Bank, Union Bank of India, UCO Bank, Central Bank of India, Corporation Bank, Bank of Baroda, Tamilnad Mercantile Bank, HDFC Bank and Andhra Bank.

Incidentally, SBI on behalf of the consortium had filed a petition against the company before the Debt Recovery Tribunal, in which it said the company owes the banks ₹842.47 crore as on 31.1.2018. SBI and other banks had declared the loans as a non-performing asset.

NCLT admitted SBI’s petition and has named Ebenezar Inbaraj as the interim insolvency professional. Under the insolvency process, a maximum of 330 days is given to find a suitable plan to revive the company. If it fails, the company goes into liquidation.

In 2018, Enforcement Directorate had arrested Kanishk Gold Managing Director Bhupesh Kumar Jain over allegations of defrauding the banks. It also attached the properties worth ₹281 crore belonging to Kanishk Gold and its promoters under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).

An FIR was also registered by the CBI’s Banking Securities (BS) and Fraud Cell, Bengaluru, against Jain, his company and others.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/dwhrg1/article30858183.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19FEBTH--KANISHK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/insolvency-proceedings-ordered-against-kanishk-gold/article30858185.ece
369,2020/02/19,Corporation to get ₹400 crore to clear Perungudi dumpyard,"Clean-up of Kodungaiyur yard to cost nearly ₹1,000 crore

The Madras High Court on Tuesday recorded a statement made on behalf of the State government that a sum of around ₹400 crore, required by the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) for cleaning a garbage dumpyard at Perungudi through bio-mining would be sanctioned in a month.

Justices N. Kirubakaran and P. Velmurugan recorded the submission made by Additional Advocate General P.H. Arvindh Pandian during the joint hearing of two public interest litigation petitions, including one filed by advocate V.B.R. Menon, with regard to the processing of garbage and the increase of property tax.

GCC Commissioner G. Prakash, too, appeared before the court and explained that a high-power committee had already cleared the proposal for the grant of ₹400 crore and that only a government nod was required for the sanction of funds. In so far as the Kodungaiyur dumping yard was concerned, it may require nearly ₹1,000 crore, he said. Pointing out that no civic body had given attention to processing of garbage until the Swachh Bharat Mission took off, he said that according to a rough estimate, about seven million tonnes of garbage would have accumulated at the Kodungaiyur dumping yard, in the last 40 years, and about ₹1,100 crore would be required to clear it.

He added that the Kodungaiyur yard could be cleared only after Swachh Bharat-II takes off. The Commissioner went on to state that the city generates around 5,100 tonnes of garbage every day, at the rate of 650 g per capita. As of now, the Corporation has a processing facility for only about 500 tonnes of garbage. However, by the year-end, another 1,500 tonnes of garbage processing facility would be up and running and by June 2021, “we will start 100% processing,” he told the court. It was stated that around 400 motor vehicles of various sizes, which could carry between 500 kg to 15 tonnes, were pressed into service right from 5.45 a.m. every day, to collect garbage in the city.

All those vehicles were fitted with GPS devices and they could be tracked by Corporation officials through a mobile application, he said. “In bazaar and market areas, we do night collection as well,” he said, and assured the court that a study on logistics would be carried out to avoid school zones during morning hours.

When the judges insisted upon knowing the rough manpower of the Corporation, He said the approximate sanctioned strength of both permanent and temporary staff , beginning from the level of the Commissioner to sanitary staff, would be around 21,000, though the available working strength was only about 16,000.

Facing a deficit

He also said that the expenses of the Corporation would run into about ₹5,000 crore a month, and that it would be facing a deficit of somewhere around ₹1,000 crore every month. Giving a break up, he said the revenue through own sources such as taxes was about ₹1,500 crore, and the rest of the income was through government schemes and Finance Commission grants.

After hearing him, Justice Kirubakaran wondered how even those who own houses worth crores of rupees could complain about the revision of property tax. He added that it would be very difficult for the civic body to maintain hygiene when its territory had expanded from just 174 sq m to 426 sq m in 2009, by the annexation of adjoining municipalities and panchayats.

Later, he adjourned the cases to next month for further hearing.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/corporation-to-get-400-crore-to-clear-perungudi-dumpyard/article30855325.ece
370,2020/02/19,"Digital banners may be allowed for family, social gatherings","But ban will remain in place for political parties

City residents and local bodies in the State may soon be permitted to erect digital banners for family celebrations, social gatherings and religious festivals.

But the ban on them remains for political parties in Chennai and other parts of the State.

Following a meeting of representatives from digital banners’ association with Chennai Corporation Commissioner G. Prakash on Tuesday, the civic body has decided to forward the representation to the State government for issuance of a new government order on digital banners, which will be applicable for the entire State.

High Court ban

Currently, the Corporation and other local bodies in the State do not give permission for digital banners, following a ban on political banners by the High Court.

The meeting was organised at the Chennai Corporation Amma Maaligai, following a High Court direction.

“Political banners will not be allowed. Other banners for residents and the community may be allowed. For example, residents will be permitted to erect digital banners for marriages, birthdays and other celebrations. A decision will be made after February 27,” said an official.

The Corporation has already formed a committee to study issues relating to digital banners on roads, particularly road accidents caused by them.

Tamil Nadu Digital Printing Association founder-president M. Suresh said the ban on digital banners had affected the livelihood of hundreds of people.

“Over 400 digital printing units have shut down. There are more than 5,000 such units in the State, offering livelihood for five lakh people,” he said.

“We have requested the government to issue an order banning digital banners on road medians to prevent accidents,” he said.

“We also want the size of the banners to be reduced to 10 ft by 15 ft on the 100 feet roads, the largest permissible dimension. According to the old G.O., 12 ft by 24 ft banners were permitted on the 100 feet roads. These may cause accidents,” Mr. Suresh added.

New demand

Currently, many protesters against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act are printing digital banners and carrying them during protests, without erecting them along the road.

“We are receiving a lot of orders for digital printing for CAA protests. But it was not discussed at the meeting on Tuesday,” according to a printer.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/digital-banners-may-be-allowed-for-family-social-gatherings/article30855308.ece
371,2020/02/19,Gujarat firm to lay piped gas distribution network in Chennai,"SC gives Torrent Gas nod for operations in Chennai and Tiruvallur

Gujarat-based Torrent Gas, engaged in the supply and distribution of Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) and Piped Natural Gas (PNG), has received the Supreme Court’s nod to create distribution networks in Chennai and Tiruvallur in Tamil Nadu.

In September 2018, Torrent Gas won the bid floated by the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) to lay the City Gas Distribution (CGD) infrastructure to provide CNG and PNG in Chennai and Tiruvallur districts.

However, the authorisation by PNGRB was challenged by another Gujarat-based company, Adani Gas Limited, on the ground that the bid of Torrent Gas was unreasonably high and PNGRB ought to have rejected the bid. The court, on February 17, rejected the Adani group’s petition and held that the power to determine the reasonability of the bids resided solely with the PNGRB, by virtue of Clause 14.2 of the bid document and that PNGRB’s determination on reasonability was neither arbitrary nor in violation of the principles of natural justice.

All contentions of the plaintiff petitioners were rejected, and their appeals against the PNGRB’s award dismissed.

Decks cleared

“This judgment of the Supreme Court clear the decks for laying CGD infrastructure in Chennai and Tiruvallur, which is the only metro region in the country where CGD infrastructure doesn’t exist as on date. Torrent Gas is committed to building a robust and efficient CGD network and making CNG and PNG widely available to the citizens of Chennai and Tiruvallur districts,” said Jayesh Desai, executive director of Torrent Group.

According to him, Torrent Gas is one of the leading CGD companies in the country and has been authorised for 16 Geographical Areas (GA), covering 32 districts across 7 States, namely Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Punjab, Tamil Nadu and Telangana and the Union Territory of Puducherry.

In Chennai and Tiruvallur, the company is expected to invest ₹5,000 crore in creating city gas distribution networks, spread in 3,569 sq km of area.

“We will be commencing our work from the first quarter of financial year 2021 and gas supply and distribution will progressively begin from the subsequent quarter,” Mr. Desai told The Hindu.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/8idlit/article30857056.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19THPIPEDLPG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/gujarat-firm-to-lay-piped-gas-distribution-network-in-city/article30855297.ece
372,2020/02/19,"In U.S. trade action, an Indian counter-strategy","Indian interests would be well-served by maintaining a reasonable level of tariff protection

Last week, the United States officially designated developing and least-developed countries for the purposes of implementing the countervailing measures provided by the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (ASCM) of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). According to the ASCM, developing countries are allowed to grant higher levels of subsidies as compared to the developed countries before countervailing duties (CVD) can be imposed.

The agreement stipulates that any countervailing duty investigation for a developing country must be terminated if the subsidies granted are found to be de minimis, which is defined as less than 2% of the value of imports of the product being investigated. For a developed country the de minimis is 1% of the import value of the investigated product. The United States’s annual exercise of designating developing, and least developed countries has assumed importance for India this year: it has been dropped from the list of developing countries. In other words, in its future countervailing duty investigations, the U.S. would treat India as a developed country.

India as target

Under the WTO rules, any country can “self-designate” itself as a developing country. In fact, the WTO does not lay down any specific criteria for making a distinction between a developed and a developing country member, unlike in the World Bank where per capita incomes are used to classify countries. But despite this clearly laid down criteria in the WTO rules for making a distinction between developing and developed countries, the United States Trade Representative (USTR) employed an arbitrary methodology that took into consideration “economic, trade, and other factors, including the level of economic development of a country (based on a review of the country’s per capita GNI) and a country’s share of world trade” to exclude India from list of designated developing countries.

This is the second instance in less than a year, when the U.S. has refused to extend to India the benefits enjoyed by developing countries under the multilateral trade rules. On May 31, 2019, U.S. President Donald Trump announced that India would be taken off the list of beneficiary-developing countries under its scheme of Generalised System of Preferences (GSP). The GSP is a special window provided by the U.S. and several other developed countries, through which they import identified products from developing countries at concessional rates of duties. Importantly, GSP confers non-reciprocal benefits, implying that the developed countries cannot expect reciprocal market access from the beneficiary developing countries. Yet, the U.S. denied GSP benefits to India arguing that India was unwilling to offer better market access to its products.

Excluding India from the lists of developing countries for the purposes of using countervailing measures or denying benefits of GSP are but two of the more recent initiatives that the U.S. has taken to challenge India’s status as a developing country in the WTO. Over the past years, the U.S. has been arguing that the emerging economies, especially Brazil, China and India, have performed much better that those in the developed world and therefore they should no longer enjoy the slew of benefits that they have as developing country members of the organisation.

The impact

What are the benefits that developing countries enjoy in the WTO and what could the potential impact of the exertions that the U.S. is making to deny India the status of a developing country be? Potentially very large, for India would then lose the ability to use the special and differential treatment (S&DT) to which every developing country member of the WTO has a right. In short, S&DT lessens the burden of adjustment that developing countries have to make while acceding to the various agreements under the WTO. Besides, when the WTO finalises an agreement in a specific area, developing countries are allowed longer implementation periods. This measure helps developing countries to introduce a new agreement in phases and are thus required to deploy resources beyond their capacities. S&DT has been particularly beneficial for India in two critical areas: one, implementation of the disciplines on agricultural subsidies and, two, opening up the markets for both agricultural and non-agricultural products.

The WTO Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) provides an elaborate discipline on subsidies. Subsidies are classified in three categories; but two of these are virtually outside the discipline since the WTO does not limit spending on these categories of subsidies. The discipline exists in case of price support measures (minimum support price) and input subsidies which is the more common form of subsidies for most developing countries, including in India. For developing countries, spending on price support measures and input subsides taken together cannot exceed 10% of the total value of agricultural production. In contrast, developed countries are allowed to spend only 5% of their value of agricultural production.

Shifting to DBT

India is a major user of price support measures and input subsidies, and given the constraints imposed by the AoA, the government has spoken about its intention to move into the system of direct benefit transfer (DBT) for supporting farmers. A shift to DBT is attractive for India since there are no limits on spending, unlike in case of price support measures and input subsidies. Further, faced with on-going farm distress, the government has had to rework its subsidies’ programme in order to extend greater benefits, especially to small and marginal farmers.

However, implementation of DBT in agriculture has several insurmountable problems. Targeting potential beneficiaries of DBT seems difficult at this juncture for a number of reasons, including inadequate records of ownership of agricultural land on the one hand, and the presence of agricultural labour and tenants on the other. This implies that in the foreseeable future, India would continue to depend on price support measures and input subsidies. Given this scenario, the government needs the policy space to provide adequate levels of subsidies to a crisis-ridden agricultural sector, and therefore it is imperative that continues to enjoy the benefits as a developing country member of the WTO.

Issue of tariffs

The issue of market access, or the use of import tariffs, is one of the important trade policy instruments. It has some key provisions on S&DT, which the developing countries can benefit from. The most important among these is the undertaking from the developed countries that they would not demand reciprocal tariff cuts, and this reads as follows: “The developed contracting parties do not expect reciprocity for commitments made by them in trade negotiations to reduce or remove tariffs and other barriers to the trade of less-developed contracting parties.”

Over the past two years, the government of India has been extensively using import tariffs for protecting Indian businesses from import competition. With increasing use of tariffs, almost across the board, India’s average tariffs have increased from about 13% in 2017-18 to above 17% at present. The 2020-21 Budget has enhanced the level of protection of the domestic players in several key sectors, thus pushing the average tariffs even higher. Developed country members of the WTO have generally maintained very low levels of tariffs, and, therefore, India’s interests of maintaining a reasonable level of tariff protection would be well served through its continued access to S&DT, by remaining as a developing country member of the WTO.

373,2020/02/19,Powering the health-care engine with innovation,"There is potential for private care providers, innovators and start-ups to be partners in the Ayushman Bharat scheme

It has been close to 18 months since the Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, launched the country-wide implementation of Ayushman Bharat-Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY), or the national health protection scheme; the initial momentum has been very encouraging. The scheme is currently being implemented in 32 of 36 States and Union Territories. It has provided 84 lakh free treatments to poor and vulnerable patients for secondary and tertiary ailments at 22,000 empanelled hospitals, countrywide. Under PM-JAY, there is one free treatment every three seconds and two beneficiaries verified every second.

Expanding the supply side

As the scale of this scheme grows, a key area of focus is to expand the secondary and tertiary hospitals empanelled under PM-JAY and ensure their quality and capacity while keeping the costs down. At present, there is one government bed for every 1,844 patients and one doctor for every 11,082 patients. In the coming years, considering 3% hospitalisation of PM-JAY-covered beneficiaries, the scheme is likely to provide treatment to 1.5 crore patients annually. This means physical and human infrastructure capacity would need to be augmented vastly. Conservative estimates suggest the we would need more than 150,000 additional beds, especially in Tier-2 and -3 cities. While a comprehensive long-term strategy will focus on expanding hospital and human resources infrastructure, an effective near-term approach is needed to improve efficiencies and bridge gaps within the existing supply and likely demand. A strong, yet under-tapped lever for accelerating health system efficiency and bridging these gaps is mainstreaming innovation in the Indian health system.

Transformative solutions

India’s burgeoning entrepreneurial spirit combined with a systematic push for the development of a start-up ecosystem has led to a plethora of innovations in health care. It is estimated that there are more than 4,000 health-care technology start-ups in India. Today, start-ups are working to bring innovative technologies and business models that leapfrog infrastructure, human resources, cost-effectiveness and efficiency challenges in Tier-2 and -3 cities. Artificial Intelligence platforms that aid in rapid radiology diagnoses in low resource settings, tele-ICU platforms to bridge the gap in high-skilled critical care personnel, centralised drone delivery of blood, medicines and vaccines to reach remote locations cost-effectively and reliably are all no longer just theoretical ideas. They are real solutions that are ready to be tested on the ground and potentially implemented. It is high time for transformative solutions to make their way into our hospitals, especially in Tier-2 and -3 cities, to turbocharge the way health care is delivered at scale.

This mainstreaming of health-care innovations, is lined with challenges at every step. The friction in their path to market often stems from multiple reasons.

Addressing the constraints

One challenge is non-uniform regulatory and validation standards. Regulatory requirements, specifically for biomedical start-ups, are still evolving in India. As a result, hospitals often rely on foreign regulatory certifications such as FDA and CE, especially for riskier devices and instruments. In addition, it is difficult for a start-up to understand the minimum necessary validation requirements in order to qualify for procurement by hospitals. Lack of standards in this area leads to a huge variation in validation requirements at States and hospitals, forcing the start-up into a spiral of piloting studies. The government is now pushing ahead to overhaul Indian med-tech regulatory standards and product standards which will help bridge this trust-deficit.

Another problem in promoting start-ups is the operational liquidity crunch due to a long gestation period. Health-care start-ups spend long periods of time in the early development of their product, especially where potential clinical risks are concerned. The process of testing the idea and working prototype, receiving certifications, performing clinical and commercial validations, and raising funds, in a low-trust and unstructured environment makes the gestational period unusually long thereby limiting the operational liquidity of the start-up.

Another hurdle is the lack of incentives and adequate frameworks to grade and adopt innovations. Health-care providers and clinicians, given limited bandwidth, often lack the incentives, operational capacity, and frameworks necessary to consider and adopt innovations. This leads to limited traction for start-ups promoting innovative solutions.

Start-ups also face procurement challenges in both public and private procurement. They lack the financial capacity to deal with lengthy tenders and the roundabout process of price discovery. Private procurement is complicated by the presence of a fragmented customer base and limited systematic channels for distribution.

To accelerate this process of mainstreaming innovations within the hospital system in India, we need to focus on identifying promising market-ready health-care innovations that are ready to be tested and deployed at scale. There is a need to facilitate standardised operational validation studies that are required for market adoption, to help ease out the start-up procurement process such that these solutions can be adopted with confidence. This, in effect, will serve the entire ecosystem of health-care innovators by opening up health-care markets for all. A strong theme in mature health-care systems in other parts of the world is a vibrant and seamless interface between hospitals and health-care start-ups. Through Ayushman Bharat, India has the unique opportunity to develop a robust ecosystem where hospitals actively engage with health-care start-ups by providing access to testbeds, communicating their needs effectively and adopting promising innovations. Start-ups can be effective collaborators for the most pressing health-care delivery challenges faced by hospitals, as opposed to being mere suppliers of technology or services.

We believe that the launch and expansion of Ayushman Bharat-PM-JAY is a watershed moment for the Indian health-care service delivery ecosystem. The government has taken a big step by rolling out world’s largest and most ambitious publicly funded health-care assurance programme. We are now calling out to private sector health-care providers, health innovators, industry and start-ups to become equal partners in this movement. The dream of an accessible, affordable and high-quality health-care system for all, will be achieved when we work in alignment to complement each other and jointly undertake the mission of creating an Ayushman Bharat.

375,2020/02/19,Women officers,"Talk of empowerment of women to enable them to live with a life of dignity, honour, equality, recognition and respect have been making waves in recent years (Page 1, “Women Army officers eligible for permanent commission: SC”, February 18). Gender bias based on physiological features is baffling in an environment where women continuously outperform men in various fields. Considering that woman officers constitute only a fraction of the total number of officers in the Indian Army, the Court order would be an incentive for more women to join the forces. The watershed judgment, by opening up new avenues for women, has dispelled the wrong notions about their ability to sparkle in an area earmarked specifically for men in the past.

V. Subramanian,

Chennai

One must be wary of drawing sweeping and unqualified conclusions from the Supreme Court’s verdict, ordering the provision of permanent commission to women army officers (Page 1 and Editorial, “Women-at-arms”, both February 18). The facts do not justify the construction of any moralising narrative about a tussle between a progressive judiciary and a patriarchal and misogynistic government. Having announced a policy to provide a permanent commission to women officers in 10 streams of the “Combat Support Arms” and “Services” sections, there was no reason for the government to convey the impression that it did not intend to walk the talk.

A judicial pronouncement is not merely about what it finally says. It should ideally involve a process of consultations with various stakeholders, either directly or through legal counsels, to ensure that justice is seen as done. More than the abstract notions and superior legal knowledge of judges, it is the mundane and first-hand knowledge of those working on the ground that should matter in approving changes in policies, especially those relating to battlefield conditions. The question is, did the court seek direct feedback from the Indian Army instead of merely relying on affidavits drafted by bureaucrats?

377,2020/02/19,BLAQ is the upmarket Townhall,"The fabulous vibe makes up for ordinary food

There are some places where the food makes up for the décor, and they survive. There are others where the décor is the star attraction and the food is a disappointment — they die despite the often high investment made.

And then there are those where the vibe and the buzz of the place ensure that nothing else matters, and they are successful. Blaq: A Coqtail Affair is definitely in the last category.

Spread over the top two floors of a building on the Defence Colony main road (opposite Lajpat Nagar), the lower level has an art deco club type energy and the top floor has a relaxed but upmarket green house feel, with a retractable glass roof and lovely terrace area with high table seating.

The cocktail list is excellent but fails in execution — a lot of effort is put into the presentation but the balance of the drinks we ordered was all off. The food menu is extensive and reminded me of Townhall, Khan Market. A long selection of soups, salads, sushi, dumplings, pizza, pasta, small and large plates from around the world, but as is the case with most restaurants that attempt to do this, there was nothing memorable on the menu. However, don’t get me wrong, I will still go back to Blaq for the vibe and ambience.

The vibe: Warm, inviting, stylish and upmarket without being pretentious. A place where you can sit for hours, sipping your drinks and chatting with friends, listening to great house music. A place to unwind and as the night progresses, party.

Do try: The Chicken Veloute soup was delicious (although it was meant to have orecchiette pasta which is shaped like a small ear, but none was to be found). The Cheese and Gold dumpling was melt in mouth and the sushi was definitely snack worthy, though a purist would frown.

Skip: Definitely the Rolled Tenderloin, supposedly “Classic Blaq”, but it was tough and inedible. Also save calories and skip the desserts – simply not worth it.

Go with: A date, with friends and even work colleagues. A great place to host a private party too

Space bar: 80 covers across 2,500 sq. ft.

How much: ₹3,000 for two, sans alcohol

Getting there: D 21 Defence Colony.

378,2020/02/19,Doctor seeks help from government to get mother’s body from China,"The body has been kept at the morgue of a hospital in Zhengzhou since January 24

A doctor from Mumbai has sought help from the Central government to get his mother’s body from China, which is hit by the novel coronavirus epidemic.

The body has been kept at the morgue of a hospital in Zhengzhou since January 24, when Rita Rajinder Mehra died. Dentist Puneet Mehra (35) told PTI that the Embassy of India at Beijing informed him on Monday that the transportation of his mother’s body had got delayed in view of the restrictions on movement of people and vehicles in China following the Coronavirus outbreak.

The Bandra-based doctor has, thus, sought help from the Centre to get his mother’s body at the earliest so that her last rites can be performed here with due respect.

According to the doctor, on January 24, he and his mother were travelling from Melbourne to Mumbai via Beijing on an Air China flight. After about nine hours of the flight takeoff, his mother went to the lavatory. But, as she failed to return to her seat, Mr. Mehra alerted the crew.

The lavatory door was later opened and Mr. Mehra’s mother was found in an unconscious state, he said.

A doctor and a nurse, who were among the passengers, and the crew tried cardiopulmonary resuscitation and later the plane made an emergency landing at Zhengzhou Airport, but the woman died by then, he said.

Mr. Mehra returned on February 7, but his mother’s body is still at the morgue of Henan Provincial Hospital in Zhengzhou.

The doctor has written to President Ram Nath Kovind, office of the External Affairs Ministry, and the Ambassador of India in Beijing to help in getting the body.

“I have also written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and requested the government to facilitate the process of transportation of my mother’s remains to Mumbai at the earliest so that the last rites can be performed with due respect,” Mr. Mehra said.

He said this situation has caused a lot of stress to him and his family. “It has been over 24 days now and we are extremely shattered and going through a lot of emotional stress in this helpless situation.”

He said the hospital in China initially issued a certificate mentioning the cause of his mother’s demise as ‘death before rescue’. After three days, the hospital gave Mr. Mehra another certificate mentioning the cause as “sudden cardiac death very likely”. Later, another certificate was issued mentioning the cause as “sudden death”, he said.

But, China is also facing an equally tragic situation.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/vh1anp/article30857123.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19BMCORONA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/doctor-seeks-help-from-government-to-get-mothers-body-from-china/article30857124.ece
379,2020/02/19,"Aurangabad industries dependent on Chinese parts, looking for alternatives","Coronavirus outbreak has disturbed supply chain of material

The novel coronavirus outbreak has hit industries in Aurangabad district, a manufacturing hub, with companies finding it difficult to procure substitutes for Chinese parts.

Companies have started sourcing products from other countries to continue their manufacturing without interruptions. “Aurangabad has more than 4,000 companies and some of them source parts from China. The coronavirus outbreak in China has disturbed the supply chain of material,” Prasad Kokil, former chairman of Chamber of Marathwada Industries and Agriculture, said.

The gap in the supply of raw materials can create problems, he said, adding this is a chance to look for substitutes and reduce the dependency on Chinese parts. The micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) can grab this opportunity, Mr. Kokil said.

Companies working in solar and energy sector have to import parts from China, solar and energy equipment manufacturer M.P. Sharma said.

“The production of solar items has been impacted, as the supply of raw materials from China has been disrupted. We have found new alternatives in Vietnam and Taiwan,” he said.

“Imported parts make 60% of our products. We need to buy them even if they are 13-15% costlier than Chinese imports,” he said.

One of the manufacturers who has invested ₹3.5 crore in Chinese machines is unable to get his consignment, as he can’t send anyone to transport the equipment from there, industrialist Sunil Kirdak said.

When asked if local MSMEs can profit from this development, Confederation of Indian Industry’s zonal chairman Mukund Kulkarni said it would be highly unlikely as the parts would have to be delivered in a short span of time. “We can make quality parts, but we may not be able to meet the demands in a short span of time. Hence, imports will continue, only the countries we import from will change,” he said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/aurangabad-industries-dependent-on-chinese-parts-looking-for-alternatives/article30857117.ece

Thousands of depositors, who have been facing severe difficulties after the bank’s collapse, have been protesting and trying to meet officials since September 2019.

On Tuesday, a six-member delegation representing the depositors met Nationalist Congress Party leader Supriya Sule to request her to raise the issue with the Central government.

Anita Lohiya, a depositor who was part of the delegation, said they asked Ms. Sule to arrange a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Reserve Bank of India governor Shashikanta Das. “She has said she would try to arrange a meeting with both of them. Since the restrictions on the bank are about to end next month, we requested her to recommend that the restrictions not be extended. If the authorities don’t give clear signs, we have no option but to go on a fast unto death,” Ms. Lohiya said.

A group of depositors on Tuesday also visited the bank's head office in Bhandup to meet Jay Bhagwan Boria, the RBI-appointed administrator, but said Mr. Boria did not provide a satisfactory reply to their queries.

Vidya Merwade, another depositor, said PMC account-holders are facing a lot of stress due to their money being stuck. “The death toll of PMC depositors has reached 23. It could be someone from our family next time. We just want our money back and punishment for the culprits. Even if they cannot pay us our money till March, we want the RBI governor or the Central government to give a satisfactory reply on the issue.

A fire broke out at a chemical processing unit in Dombivli on Tuesday. Though extensive damage to property is expected, no casualties were reported

The fire broke out at Metro Chemical Company in the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation, Phase II, at around 12.46 p.m.

According to Santosh Kadam, Chief of Disaster Management, the fire began in a chemical drum, and the unit’s workers were immediately evacuated.

Senior Police Inspector (Zone III), Dombivli division, D.K. Choure, said the reason for the fire will only be known once fire fighting operations were over. “The fire started spreading from the first floor of the building,” Mr. Choure said. A total of 16 fire tenders and nine water tankers were pressed into service.

Shrikant Shinde, MP from Kalyan, said the factory had paints and other solvents. “We still do not know how much of the storage was permissible. All the factories have to work according to safety norms. We will look into it,” Mr. Shinde said.

Vinayak Londe, joint director of industrial safety, who reached the spot around 8 p.m., said cooling operations were on, and that the building was damaged. “The Abhinav Vidyalaya school in the neighbourhood curtailed classes in the afternoon due to the foul odour of chemicals released due to the fire. The workers and residents were immediately alerted and evacuated,” said Raju Nalawade, a resident of Splendor Villa Society, which is a kilometre away from the site of the fire.

Mr. Nalawade said a similar incident in May 26, 2016, had claimed 12 lives. “There are 250 chemical companies in Dombivali MIDC. These highly hazardous chemical companies should be shifted.

383,2020/02/19,Two Dawood aides charged under MCOCA for 2013 extortion case,"Tariq Parveen, Salim Penwala had demanded ₹2 crore from a dry fruits businessman

The Crime Branch on Tuesday applied the stringent Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) against Dawood Ibrahim’s close aide Tariq Parveen, and Salim Penwala alias Salim Maharaj in connection with an extortion case where gangster Ejaz Ladkawala had demanded a sum of ₹2 crore from a South Mumbai dry fruits businessman in 2013.

Police alleged that after receiving threatening calls, the victim approached Mr. Parveen who took the responsibility to settle the matter in ₹10 lakh. The meeting was held in Mr. Parveen’s office in South Mumbai where Salim Maharaj was also present. The accused sent his man to the victim’s shop and collected ₹3 lakh while the victim said he would pay the balance in a few days.

Mr. Parveen and Mr. Maharaj were constantly demanding money due to which victim shut his business and shifted to his native place in Gujarat. The Anti-Extortion Cell of the Mumbai Crime Branch produced the duo before the special MCOCA court and demanded their police custody which was opposed by Mr. Parveen’s lawyer Bharat Tiwari.

Mr. Tiwari questioned the application of MCOCA, and also contended that Mr. Parveen had no connection with Mr. Lakdawala. He argued that the two had a rift over the specific case.

He also stated that the complainant had first approached Mira Road police station in 2013 to register a case against Mr. Lakdawala but the police had just registered a non-cognisable offence despite the matter being serious in nature.

He also asked why a case was registered after so many years. The prosecution however. claimed that they are yet to arrest Mr. Lakdawala in the case and that the investigation is still in progress.

The Mumbai Crime Branch will record a statement of an additional commissioner of police in connection with a 2018 assault case against two aides of gangster Ejaz Lakdawala, which was mysteriously transferred to a different police station within two hours of it being registered.

The case was taken over by the Crime Branch last Saturday as part of its investigation against Tariq Parveen and Salim Maharaj, the alleged aides of Mr. Lakdawala. Following their arrest, it came to light that a two-year-old case had been pending against them with the MRA Marg police station.

Senior Crime Branch officials said statements of two senior inspectors, Sanjay Kamble and Sukhlal Varpe, who were in charge of the MRA Marg police station in the past two years, have been recorded. On Wednesday, Additional Commissioner of Police Pravin Padwal, who is now with the Traffic Police, was summoned to record his statement. Mr. Padwal was the Additional Commissioner of Police, South when the case was transferred from Pydhonie police station to MRA Marg.

“We asked Mr. Kamble and Mr. Varpe about the sudden transfer of the case. Both of them have said they had received ‘orders from above’ and were just following them,” a senior officer with the Mumbai Police said. The officers will have to explain why there was no progress on the case for over two years, he said.

“They did not even invoke the Customs Act in the case despite indications that the complainant was assaulted by Mr. Parveen and Mr. Maharaj over a smuggling-related dispute. No attempts seem to have been made to apprehend the accused; neither was a summary report filed in court stating that no substantiation had been found of the complainant’s allegations,” the officer said.

Another officer said Mr. Padwal will also be asked about the transfer of the case and the grounds for doing so.

The police was acting on a complaint by Raigad district special auditor Umesh Tupe, who scrutinised the bank’s accounts of the last four months.

“According to the audit report, there are discrepancies in the documentary evidence of disbursed loans. The report hints at manipulation and forgery of disbursement of loans since 2008. Of the 76 accused, 62 are loanees to whom the loans were disbursed without surety following which the amounts were allegedly transferred to a trust run by chairman Mr. Patil,” said Shatrughn Mali police inspector from Panvel City police station.

“Due to the huge sums of money involved, it will be transferred to the Economic Offences Wing. Some of the accused have said they were not aware of what was happening with their bank accounts. Further investigations would reveal the truth,” said Ashok Dudhe, deputy commissioner of police, Zone II.

For the past few months BJP leaders Prashant Thakur (MLA) and Kirit Somaiyya were warning about the ongoing fraud in the bank, which led to huge protests by the account holders. The fear of losing their money led several account holders to withdraw their savings, leading to a major crisis, following which the bank had to restrict the withdrawals.

The accused have been booked for cheating, breach of trust, forgery, fraudulent cancellation or destruction of valuable document, causing disappearance of evidence and criminal conspiracy under IPC and relevant sections under the Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors Act.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ex-mla-among-76-booked-for-misuse-of-512-crore-deposits-in-karnala-cooperative-bank/article30855475.ece
386,2020/02/19,"East to East: a synergy of cultures, art forms","‘The Same Same But Different’ show brings together the modern and the classical from Korea and India

On Friday, the city will host a collaborative music and dance performance called ‘Same Same But Different (SSBD),’ that bridges cultural forms between India and Korea.

Korean new wave music group Noreum Machi has produced SSBD, a concert series launched in 2013.

The Mumbai performance has been conceived and produced by InKo Centre, The Korea Foundation in collaboration with The Royal Opera House and Avid Learning. The SSBD series is dedicated to bringing together artists from different cultural backgrounds and provide an opportunity to Korean traditional music to converge with different art forms from across the world.

Friday’s performance in the city will feature pioneering contemporary dancer and choreographer Astad Deboo and Trayam, an ensemble of three critically acclaimed Indian musicians: percussionist B.C. Manjunath, singer and flautist Varijashree Venugopal and percussionist, composer and music director, Praveen D. Rao.

Together with Noreum Machi, these artistes will merge traditional Korean sounds with classical Indian music, complemented with the stillness and flow of contemporary dance. Korean percussionists Howon Lee and Hyun-ju Oh, the traditional Korean double reed piri player Gyeongsik Kim and gayageum player Hyeyeong Oh will also perform.

For this series, artistic director Ju-Hong Kim said he has taken traditional Korean music to countries like Germany, Turkey, Austria and Mongolia. He believes Indian culture has much in common with Korea’s traditional arts. “There are instruments like mridangam and jango, which are common to both cultures,” he said. “Jango is known as [an] instrument which has historically been handed down from India.”

Indian expressions, he said, are “as detailed and distinguished as the stars in the sky”, and Korean expressions are “the moon”. “Indian and Korean performers have interacted extensively to compose a single track which considers the characteristics of each instrument,” said Mr. Kim.

Mr. Deboo, who has collaborated with Korean artists since 2015, said this project was initiated by Rathi Jafer of InKo Centre, and premiered in 2017 in Chennai. It subsequently travelled to Hyderabad, Mumbai and Bangalore. Mr. Deboo, who has receieved training in kathak and kathakali, believes every culture has its unique points and each of them are distinct.

“But for me, music is universal. I have a very eclectic choice of music and musicians,” he said.

This edition of SSBD is its sixth, and is sub-titled ‘Universe’. “We agreed to retain the title as it effectively captures the spirit of the project which is to celebrate both the distinct music and movement vocabularies and cultural specificities of Korea and India,” said Ms. Jafer. “In terms of percussion, rhythm, the blend of traditional instruments with a contemporary twist and in the inward-looking yet outward flamboyance of dance, this distinct yet similar vocabulary is most evident.”

387,2020/02/19,Chanda Kochhar’s petition lacks application of mind: ICICI Bank to HC,"ICICI Bank’s counsel on Tuesday questioned the maintainability of former managing director (MD) and chief executive officer (CEO) Chanda Kochhar’s plea challenging her termination from the bank before the Bombay High Court, saying it lacks ‘application of mind’.

A Division Bench of Justices Nitin Jamdar and M.S. Karnik was hearing a petition filed by Ms. Kochhar on November 20, 2019, challenging her termination and the denial of agreed remuneration to her, without previous approval of the RBI She alleged that this was a breach of statutory obligation under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, that too, after her request for early retirement was accepted by the bank’s board of directors.

ICICI Bank’s counsel Darius Khambata questioned the maintainability of the petition. He said because the dispute is contractual and concerns a private body, a judicial review cannot be incurred under Article 226 of the Constitution, which empowers High Courts to issue directions, orders or writs.

He read out three Supreme Court judgments and two High Court judgments supporting the same and argued that that the petition is mala fide in intent and that there is no application of mind to it.

On December 2, 2019, another Division Bench had allowed Ms. Kochhar to amend her plea and add RBI as a respondent, however, Mr. Khambata said doing so cannot revive the plea.

He reiterated that retired Justice B.N. Srikrishna’s report had several serious findings on how Ms. Kochhar failed to discharge her fiduciary duty and was terminated on the basis of this.

On November 30, 2019, ICICI had filed an affidavit contending that the reliefs in the petition are not maintainable and Ms. Kochhar deserves to be dismissed as ICICI is a private bank and is administered under the Companies Act, not the State or its agency.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/chanda-kochhars-petition-lacks-application-of-mind-icici-bank-to-hc/article30855373.ece
388,2020/02/19,Metro 3: MMRCL to monetise 1.5 lakh sq.ft. space at stations,"Leasing area for retail to generate ₹20-25 crore annually

The Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation Limited (MMRCL) has set the ball rolling to lease around 1.5 lakh sq. ft. of space across stations of Metro Line 3 as part of its initiatives to generate non-fare revenue.

The corporation recently floated an expression of interest for the initiative and hopes to generate approximately ₹20 to ₹25 crore per annum from the same once the line is operational.

The retail spaces for the initiative have been broken into two categories — large format retail and kiosk-based retail. While nearly all stations will have space carved out for the latter, MMRCL has large contiguous spaces ranging from 20,000 to 40,000 sq.ft. at four stations: Cuffe Parade, Siddhivinayak, Bandra Kurla Complex and Terminal 2.

Around 1.17 lakh sq.ft. is covered under large format retail, with the largest continuous space at Siddhivinayak and Terminal 2 — 31,000 sq.ft. of space each at the mezzanine level in the former and at the concourse in the latter.

Cuffe Parade has the most amount of space, nearly 37,000 sq.ft., divided between 24,000 sq.ft. in the mezzanine level and 13,000 sq.ft. at the concourse, which can be leased.

“The space available can be accessed by both passengers and non-passengers alike. So we are looking at food courts, supermarkets, salons, bank branches and pharmacies that can be set-up in the area,” an MMRCL spokesperson said.

Under the kiosk-based retail segment, small spaces have been carved within the non-ticketing area of other stations. The spaces would typically range between 300 to 1,000 sq.ft. and will largely cater to the passengers’ needs. The space mix being explored includes food stalls and kiosks, travel retail stores like the 7-Eleven formats, ATMs and vending machines among others.

Shadab Siddiqui of Auctus Advisors, which is providing consultancy to MMRCL for these initiatives, said currently there was no format of ‘transit retail’ within the larger retail space.

“Transit retail has grab and go product assortment for people with low dwell time. This covers ready-to-eat packed meals, packed sandwiches, newspaper and magazines, coffee vending machines and more. These are low-involvement products with high trading velocities,” he said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/metro-3-mmrcl-to-monetise-15-lakh-sqft-space-at-stations/article30855360.ece
389,2020/02/19,Show cause notice to undersecretary for giving incorrect data on wetlands,"HC also wants to know if he is willing to pay a fine of ₹1 lakh

The Bombay High Court on Tuesday issued a show cause notice to Joy Thakur, an undersecretary in the State Environment Department, asking him why contempt proceedings shouldn’t be initiated against him for putting forth incorrect information about wetlands in Maharashtra.

A Division Bench of Justices S.J. Kathawalla and M.N. Jadhav was hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Vanashakti Public Trust. The PIL claimed that no action was taken against builders who indiscriminately reclaimed lands and dumped debris on wetlands and mangroves, which violated the rules of the Environment Protection Act.

Mr. Thakur had filed an affidavit in which he had stated that there were 803 wetlands in the three districts of Nagpur, Nandurbar and Parbhani while the district collectors had said that there were no wetlands in their jurisdiction.

Based on the affidavit, the HC had summoned the collectors. While appearing before the Bench last week, the three collectors said that there were no wetlands in the districts. Following this, the HC asked Mr. Thakur for an explanation on his false statement.

On Tuesday, Mr. Thakur filed another affidavit which stated that the numbers depicted in the early affidavit were only of the number of sites visited, and not the number of wetlands.

The court found the explanation unacceptable and asked the government pleader, P.P. Kakade, to check if Mr. Thakur was willing to pay a fine of ₹1 lakh for wasting the court’s time and also of the three responsible officers.

Mr. Thakur’s earlier affidavit had said that the wetland atlas published by the space application centre in January 2010 showed 44,714 wetlands in Maharashtra. However, after the change in definition of a wetland, the number had come down to 15,865. The Bench had earlier directed the State against any reclamation or construction on areas identified as wetland.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/d12aj4/article30855381.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19BMBOMBAYHIGHCOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/show-cause-notice-to-undersecretary-for-giving-incorrect-data-on-wetlands/article30855345.ece
390,2020/02/19,NMMC presents ₹1.09 cr. surplus budget; focus on unfinished work,"Funds to be used for civil works, waste segregation, e-governance, health, education

Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) Commissioner Annasaheb Misal on Tuesday presented a civic budget estimate of ₹3,850 crore for 2020-21, which also includes the opening balance of ₹1,217 crore from the revised budget estimate of ₹4,275.31 crore for the financial year 2019-20. With an estimated income of ₹3,850 crore and expenditure of ₹3,848.91 crore, Mr. Misal has calculated a surplus of ₹1.09 crore this year.

The NMMC plans to earn ₹3,850 crore through local body tax, property tax, development fees, licence and advertising fees, encroachment fees, and State and Central schemes. Mr. Misal claimed that the budget had been made keeping the needs and feedback of the public in mind.

The administration plans to spend this income on the development of the city, civil works, waste segregation, e-governance, health, education and transport.

The budget focuses on finishing the incomplete projects from last year and has also introduced a few new projects. The Central library at Turbhe, connecting the missing link of Palm Beach Road after Ghansoli, modular sewage plant for the slums, entrance door at the beginning of Navi Mumbai, cycle tracks, sports complex at Ghansoli, biogas unit and street light replacements are some of the new projects planned for the year.

Speaking on tax collection, Mr. Misal said, “We have not increased property tax rates, but going by the current prices of real estate, the total tax collected is likely to increase. The property tax collected up till November last year is ₹251.77 crore, and this is expected to go up to ₹700 crore by March.” He also said the estimated property tax collection for the year 2020-21 is ₹630 crore.

Taking into consideration the ever-increasing residential societies and incidents of fire, the administration has proposed to buy a 68-m high turn table ladder and a water bowser with a 60-m tower monitor attached to it.

On the education front, the NMMC, which provides education to over 37,000 children across 53 primary and 19 secondary schools, has proposed the introduction of a locker system in schools to decrease the baggage weight carried by students. The administration has also planned to replace carpets at Balwadi schools with colourful benches.

Under the FAME II scheme, the civic body is expecting to induct 50 new electric buses by August and 50 more by April next year.

“The return ticket scheme introduced in September 2019 has helped passengers save 10% on travel in NMMT,” Mr. Misal said. He also said ₹13 crore has been designated for disaster management cell to buy required equipment and to train its staff.

“To tackle the problem of paramedical staff in civic run hospitals, we are planning to have a nursing college attached to the hospitals… To solve the issue of hawkers, we need more markets and for the same we have asked CIDCO for 100 plots, of which 38 would be handed over to us soon,” he said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/s533up/article30855304.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19BMNMMCRevisedcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/nmmc-presents-109-cr-surplus-budget-focus-on-unfinished-work/article30855306.ece
391,2020/02/19,Chemists run out of masks in Mumbai,"As fear of coronavirus grips people, manufacturers and suppliers struggle to meet high export orders

The panic triggered by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak in China has led to a severe shortage of surgical masks and N95 respirators in the market. While chemists in the city have no stocks, suppliers are struggling to cope with bulk export orders ranging from two to five crore pieces. Some retailers and online sellers who have leftover stocks have hiked the prices.

“People are making bulk purchases because of the fear. With very high orders for exports, manufacturers and suppliers are concentrated there,” Abhay Pandey of All Food and Drug Licence Holders Foundation, an association of suppliers, said.

A Mumbai-based manufacturer, who did not wish to be named, told The Hindu that he has pending orders of five crore disposable surgical masks. “The orders are from France, Dubai, Kenya and China, but I am unable to supply to any one due to an acute shortage of raw material.”

The manufacturer also said he sources a non-woven netted cloth-like material from Gujarat to make the masks. “But over the last few weeks, the raw material has been unavailable.”

To control the situation, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry on January 31 prohibited the export of personal protection equipment, including clothing and all kinds of masks. However in another circular issued on February 8, the ministry prohibited export of only N95 masks.

“Soon after the exports opened, the orders from the domestic markets went into a backlog,” said Dilip S. Modi, a disposable items supplier from Mumbai, who has pending orders for 50 lakh pieces since past week.

A survey carried out by Local Circles tapped the public perspective about masks.

Nearly 13% of those surveyed said India should continue production but ban exports to focus on domestic demand while 43% felt that production should be increased but exports should be maintained only after ensuring buffer stock for domestic market. However, with the worldwide demand for masks, the domestic market has been neglected.

Hakim Kapasi, who heads a chemist association in north west Mumbai, said none of the 600-odd shops in the region have any masks. “We have a WhatsApp group and members are constantly putting up requests hoping to get supplies from somewhere.”

Mr. Kapasi said he had received a bulk order of two crore pieces of surgical masks, which he had to turn down. According to Mr. Kapasi, there are three common types of masks available — three-layered disposable mask, cotton reusable mask, and N95 respirator that provides better filtration. “The demand for the disposable three-layered surgical masks and N95 is the highest.”

While a chemist procures the disposal three-layered surgical mask for ₹2, the selling price ranges from ₹5 to ₹10. However, due to the shortage, they are now sold at ₹40 to ₹50 per piece. The N95 masks, which were priced between ₹75 and ₹140, are now being sold for ₹200 and above.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/4q5vuz/article30855299.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19BMMaskRevcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/chemists-run-out-of-masks-in-mumbai/article30855272.ece

393,2020/02/19,Unity in diversity underlines the Udaipur World Music Festival,"The three-day event featured 150 musicians from around the globe

A cover of coots is paddling furiously near Doodh Talai on Lake Pichola. Mist hangs heavily on the waters and boats glide past. The palaces of Jag Niwas and Jag Mandir, built between the 16th and 18th centuries, appear like ghostly galleons in the distance. A weak winter sun stripes the jetty with diffused light as we board the boat to Ambrai Ghat on the far side of the lake. There’s a nip in the air and the quiet thrum of the engine sets off a flock of pigeons that wheels over the City Palace and settles into its looming minarets. As we approach the ghat, colonised by a huge peepul tree in whose shade resides a Durga figurine astride a tiger, men dip themselves in the icy waters and offer salutations to the sun. The day stirs at Udaipur to the sound of Mico Kendes’ bouzouki, a lute.

At the ghat, the Syria-born, Switzerland-based Kurdish musician sings of lost lands and lost loves. He is one of many musicians from around the globe in the Mewari city for the fifth edition of the Vedanta Udaipur World Music Festival. Conceptualised by Seher with ‘We are the world: Unity in Diversity’ as its focus, the festival has sounds from the breezy West coast of Africa, the sands of Rajasthan, the Iberian peninsula, rock music from mountainous Switzerland, Karelian music from Ukraine and multi-lingual voices from indie bands across the country.

The three venues — Ambrai Ghat in the mornings, Fateh Sagar Paal in the afternoons and Gandhi Ground in the evenings — echo the vast culture of the music, while showcasing a city that sits on the cusp of the medieval and the modern.

The mural of Shiva at Ambrai Ghat seems to watch the audience with half-closed eyes as they listen to Kendes sing a repertoire sunk in Sufism and mysticism. Strips of leheriya panels rise and fall with the breeze, marigolds scent the air, waves lap around the stone jetty of one of the city’s favourite hangout spots for the selfie-enthusiast, as Kendes passes over the political, the need for an identity and state for the Kurdish people, and instead sings of the country of his heart, a land he can never travel to, the citizen he can never claim to be. And yet his music is universal in theme, redolent of emotions that speak of unity in diversity.

In the afternoon, at the Fateh Sagar Paal that is framed by the lake constructed by Maharana Fateh Singh in the 1680s — its islands have a public park and an observatory — the Udaipur Jail University band, comprising convicted inmates belts out Sufi numbers with deep passion. I take Ankur Tewari and the Ghalat Family’s song ‘Sabse Peeche Hum Khade’ quite literally and walk to the last row of chairs. It is peppered with police personnel humming along to Tewari’s whistling, as the Aravalli mountains ringing the lake turn pink and then a sentinel grey. In the latticed balconies that garland Fateh Sagar, couples slow-dance as the sun sets.

Gandhi Ground sees a clash of civilizations as Bollywood’s Nikhita Gandhi meets Habib Koite’s Malian music, French jazz meets Thaikkudam Bridge’s guttural roar and peppy When Chai Met Toast is served with Mame Khan’s haunting Manganiyar tunes.

It is the wee hours of the morning, as dinner ends at the Sunset Terrace, the al fresco restaurant in the City Palace complex. The palace is surreal in the moonlight, a very different place from daytime, when the imposing grandeur of its structure that houses the famous Silver and Crystal galleries lords over the cityscape. Portuguese fado singer Sara Correia’s melancholic voice floats over its ramparts and settles on molten-silver Lake Pichola below — Udaipur’s own sound-and-light show for world music.

394,2020/02/19,Bird Interpretation Centre soon in Puducherry,"The first-of-its-kind centre will be open to the public from April and provide comprehensive information on the flora and fauna of Oussudu Lake, officials said

﻿

Soon, bird watchers and tourists will get to know about the rich biodiversity of Oussudu Lake, an important wetland on the outskirts of Puducherry, by visiting the first-of-its-kind Interpretation Centre for Birds coming up at the premises of the Department of Forests and Wildlife.

“The Bird Interpretation Centre is being built by the Cooperative Building Centre with the assistance of ₹90 lakh from the Centre and will be open to public from April. The centre will cater to wildlife enthusiasts, environmentalists, tourists and students. It would provide comprehensive information on the flora and fauna of the Oussudu Lake,” said G. Sathiyamoorthy, Conservator of Forests.

The objective of the interpretation centre is to help students and tourists develop a better understanding of nature with a particular focus on Oussudu Lake. Schools and colleges can bring their students for a visit to the centre and a nature expert will interact with them and explain the various aspects on display

The Interpretation Centre will be coming up on 1,500 sq.ft. in the premises. The ground floor will have artworks of birds carved on granite stone pillars and carvings of the endangered Olive Ridley turtles, where students can gain knowledge on the turtles and the importance of their conservation.

The first floor will house a multi-purpose auditorium with a seating capacity of 70 persons. The interpretation centre will also have full-sized 3-D displays on the Greater Flamingos and a few other endangered birds that visit the Oussudu Lake every year, Mr. Sathyamoorthy said.

The Oussudu Lake is identified as a wetland of national importance under the National Wetland Conservation Programme of the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) and has also been declared one of the 93 significant wetlands in Asia by the Asian Wetland Bureau. The inter-state lake covers an expanse of 800 hectares, of which 390 hectares lies in Puducherry.

According to the Forest and Wildlife Department, 66 species of birds belonging to 47 families were recorded from the lake. The critically endangered Spoon-billed sandpiper and endangered White-bellied Sea Eagle were also sighted.

Flamingos, Darter (snake bird), Spot-billed Pelican, Great White Pelican, Painted Stork, Eurasian Spoon Bill and Pallid Harrier are frequent visitors to this wetland. Another regular is the Grey-breasted Prinia, while one of the species that arrives in flocks is the Common Coot.

395,2020/02/19,"She is going places, literally","Kazi Asma Azmery, from Bangladesh, has travelled to 115 countries and counting

Her home-town in Bangladesh may not have an airport, but a combination of passion and grit has helped Kazi Asma Azmery realise her dream of flying far and wide across the world.

The young woman from Khulna, in the city after a tour of Madurai, has visited 115 countries, and the bucket-list isn’t half complete.

Perhaps, her story could not have panned out any differently given her childhood fascination with the exploits of Ibn Battuta, the 14th century Moroccan traveller, read out to her by her mother.

Ms. Azmery began her remarkable journey of smashing gender, identity and language barriers with her small savings and by selling off jewellery which she saw no use for.

Her friends, who had visited about 25 countries, showed her that globe-trotting was not an impossible feat for a woman.

“In 2009 I resolved to explore the world beginning with Nepal” she says.

Travel blog

Ms. Azmery, who maintains a travel blog, says she chalks out her travel plans after browsing through publications like the Loney Planet and by getting inputs from her now widespread circle of travel buddies.

She has wanted to visit Puducherry ever since she watched the movie Life of Pi. Of all the places she has toured, Turkmenistan is special, she says since it commemorated her 100th journey.

She has run into her share of rough weather — once detained for over 24 hours in Cyprus and getting deported, losing passport and other belongings in Milan and starving on the street until help arrived from friends and the Embassy another time.

Extra scrutiny

Holding a Bangladeshi passport invites some extra scrutiny, she says. “I sometimes wonder why immigration authorities across the world cannot adopt a kinder view towards travellers from developing countries”.

“People everywhere are generally kind,” she said, adding “In spite of being a solo woman traveller I never felt unsafe.” Language has not been a barrier as she has communicated with sign and body language.

Ms. Azmery engages with organisations like the Red Cross and Rotary to undertake social work in the places she visits.

She shares here experience with youth on college campuses. Her advice to them is: “If you have the ambition and the patience, no goal is beyond the achievable”.

The backpacker sticks to budget accommodation and food. She foregoes the smallest of luxuries to add to the corpus of a new destination. “You won’t find me shopping for new sarees. For me, that money is better spent on tickets to a new place!”",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/3clzm9/article30857506.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BANGLADESHTRAVELLER3,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/she-is-going-places-literally/article30857507.ece

399,2020/02/19,Drug traffickers to face stricter action,"They can be detained for two years under the PITNDPS Act

With cases of ganja trafficking on the rise, the police have decided to detain repeat offenders under the Prevention of Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (PITNDPS) Act.

The police have sought technical assistance from the Narcotics Control Bureau to frame proposals seeking sanction from the District Collector to detain drug traffickers who mastermind and finance illicit transport and sale of ganja and other narcotic substances.

Culprits caught in the illicit trade of ganja are currently booked under provisions of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act. In rare cases, Section 4 of the Juvenile Justice Act are invoked against those found selling cannabis to children.

“We found the present legal provisions inadequate to give stringent punishment for drug traffickers. PITNDPS is almost like detaining anti-social elements under the Goondas Act, but the narcotics act is more stringent,” Senior Superintendent of Police (Law and Order) Rahul Alwal told The Hindu.

Post to be created

A repeat offender booked under PITNDPS could be detained for two years, he said, adding that the provision would be invoked from the next month.

The government was also planning to create the post of Superintendent of Police (Narcotics) to have a focussed approach on curtailing the drug menace, he added.

In one of the biggest crackdowns last year, the Special Task Force, with the involvement of the respective police stations, arrested 55 persons and seized from their possession around 35 kg of contraband. During the year, the law enforcers have also seized 160 LSD (psychedelic drug Lysergic Acid Diethylamide) stamps from a person while he was transporting the narcotic for sale among party-goers.

“Ganja trade is a quick way of making money and a profitable one too. So it needs to be curbed before it takes further roots,” he added.

Those involved in the illicit trade procure ganja for ₹15,000-20,000 a kg. They then sell the weed in packets weighing 3 g, to regular clients, including college and school students, for ₹300-500, the SSP said. The weed is sold to foreigners and tourists at a much higher price, he added.

Last year, four persons were booked under the JJ Act for selling the contraband to minors. The Act prescribes stringent punishment of seven years’ imprisonment, and a fine up to ₹1 lakh for giving intoxicating liquor, narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances to children. Parents of children found to be in touch with drug peddlers were duly informed and counselling was given to them, he said, requesting the public to give more specific inputs about drug trade in their localities.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/j7urfm/article30854926.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19THGANJA2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/drug-traffickers-to-face-stricter-action/article30854927.ece
400,2020/02/19,NLCIL opens auditorium at Govt. Arts College,"Construction of the ₹1.12-crore facility was part of its CSR activities

NLC India Limited (NLCIL) has inaugurated a newly-constructed auditorium for the Kolanjiappar Government Arts College in Vriddhachalam, as part of its corporate social responsibility initiative. According to a press release, the project, executed at a cost of ₹1.12 crore, was inaugurated by Collector V. Anbuselvan, in the presence of NLCIL Director (Human Resources) R. Vikraman, on Monday.

‘Practised since start’

Mr. Vikraman said that the initiatives of the PSU, under CSR, mainly focused on development works in the fields of education, public health and augmentation of water resources in peripheral villages. Though the concept of CSR was included in the Companies Act, 2013, it has been effectively practised by NLCIL since its inception, he said.

Mr. Vikraman also inaugurated the Virudhachalam-Pudukuraipettai Road, laid by NLCIL. The 2.25-km road was completed at a cost of ₹1.98 crore.

He also inaugurated a reserve-osmosis water purifying plant installed by the PSU at the Government Hospital in Vriddhachalam. The modern water purifying plant, costing a lakh, can purify 1,000 litres of water in an hour.

Mr. Anbuselvan said that with the Cuddalore district being prone to natural disasters like cyclones and floods, NLCIL was extending assistance to the district administration by strengthening the bunds of waterbodies.

There are preschools that function under the General Education Department in the State, anganwadis that function under the Women and Child Development Department, not to mention scores of unrecognised preschools. However, there is no uniformity in what students learn here. In 2018-19, Samagra Shiksha had put forward the idea of scientific pre-schooling before the Ministry of Human Resource Development. This was so that programme implemented in preschools under the General Education Department reached anganwadis too.

When it was decided to extend activity corners as part of Samagra Shiksha’s project to 1,000 preschools this year, status studies were conducted in the institutions.

402,2020/02/19,Corporation to revamp Kunnukuzhy abattoir,"The local body to ink an agreement with KEL

A meeting of the city Corporation council on Tuesday decided to ink an agreement with the Kerala Electrical and Allied Engineering Company Limited (KEL) for the renovation of the slaughterhouse at Kunnukuzhy, which was closed down in 2013.

Although the work was earlier awarded to KEL last year, the civic body went in for a re-tender after the company demanded a mobilisation advance, amounting to 50% of the total cost of the project.

Uproar

This particular clause had led to much uproar from the opposition benches when the project was placed before the council in June last year. When the work was re-tendered, only KEL responded, quoting a project cost of ₹10.09 crore. Following negotiations, this was reduced to ₹9.57 crore, almost identical to the figure that it had quoted in the previous tender.

The completion period of the project is one year. BJP councillor M.R. Gopan said the company, which had taken up a work in his ward had delayed the project, and requested the Mayor to ensure that they comply with the deadline.

Advance amount

The council meeting also decided to allocate an advance amount from the Corporation’s own fund for projects to be taken up under the local body’s detailed project report (DPR) for solid waste management, as the funds from Centre and the State were yet to be credited to the Corporation’s account. The health supervisor, the implementing officer of the project, informed the council that projects worth ₹14 crore could be completed by March.

But this agenda item led to an uproar in the council meeting, with BJP councillor Anilkumar interpreting it as the quick preparation of a new DPR. Raising corruption allegations, he questioned how the preparation of a DPR for such a huge amount and implementation of the projects could be completed by March. The councillors of the United Democratic Front (UDF) also joined in, criticising the move.

However, Mayor K. Sreekumar clarified that these were projects, the DPRs of which were already approved by the State government. An allocation from the Corporation’s own fund was being made to ensure that there was no delay in the works, he said. While the UDF members seemed to be satisfied with this explanation, the BJP councillors stuck to their stand. The agenda was later passed including the objections of the BJP councillors.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/corporation-to-revamp-kunnukuzhy-abattoir/article30855144.ece
403,2020/02/19,"A healthy heart, the narrow way","Open, bypass surgeries give way to minimally invasive techniques

Gone are the days when complex heart diseases required only open or bypass surgeries. Minimally invasive techniques are now becoming a common method for their diagnosis and treatment, claim cardio-vascular professionals.

The new practices have altered the procedures being adopted by healthcare professionals and doctors. Kerala reportedly has the highest number of advanced cardiac catheterisation labs for treating complex heart ailments in the country.

Functionaries of the Society of Invasive Cardio-Vascular Professionals say the latest imaging techniques provide a three-dimensional view of the surgical fields enabling catheter-based interventions with extreme precision even in complex cases.

“Blocking of blood vessels is the main reason for most of the heart ailments. Compared with open or bypass surgeries, only limited incision is required for minimally invasive procedures such as angioplasty,” says T. Mohan Kumar, Society of Invasive Cardio-Vascular Professionals. A tiny balloon catheter is inserted in a blocked blood vessel to help widen it and improve the blood flow to the heart. It is often accompanied by the insertion of a small wire mesh tube called stent that helps prop the artery open, reducing chances of its narrowing again, he says. Most stents are coated with medication to help keep the artery open.

Mr. Mohan Kumar says angioplasty is now preferred for partial, complete and multiple heart blocks, and only in severe cases bypass surgery is advised.

Benefits

“Faster discharge from hospitals is one of the benefits of minimally invasive procedures. While bypass surgery requires patients to be in hospital between one to 10 days, they can be discharged within three days after angioplasty. It can be performed faster as well,” he says. Only local anesthesia is given for angioplasty. Bypass surgery requires proper anesthesia, accompanied by the possibility of further complications. The death rate after angioplasty is lower too. “If the patient has other diseases, the risk is higher in bypass surgery. In angioplasty, it is relatively low and the patient will be comfortable,” Mr. Mohankumar says. Bleeding and post-operative pain will be less, and the scars will be smaller.

“If primary angioplasty is done within six hours of heart attack, the chances of patient survival are higher. However, bypass surgeries cannot be done on such patients and there will be variation in their heart beat and the pumping of blood will be less,” Mr. Mohankumar claims.

There is also difference in the cost of procedure. Depending on the condition of patients, angioplasty is less expensive by around ₹50,000, he notes.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/ydwowm/article30855119.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19tv-health-hub,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/a-healthy-heart-the-narrow-way/article30855123.ece
404,2020/02/19,Rarely seen strawberry finch spotted at Akkulam Lake,"Locally known as Kumkumakuruvi, this sparrow-sized bird is of the family Estrildidae

The strawberry finch, a beautiful bird rarely seen in the State, especially south Kerala, has been spotted in the vicinity of Akkulam Lake.

Locally known as Kumkumakuruvi, this sparrow-sized bird of the family Estrildidae was spotted by two bird watchers Anoop Palode and Suraj Choodal of the Swasthi Foundation.

The Swasthi team of conservationists and nature photographers was able to locate even the nest of these rare birds.

30 birds spotted

More than 30 of these birds were spotted, raising the possibility of Akkulam being a natural habitat for these birds.

The spotting of the Strawberry Finch, also called Red Avadavat or Red Munia, highlights the urgent need for conservation and protection of Akkulam Lake.

Uncontrolled urbanisation in the area and pollution have been posing a huge threat to the lake.

A report on the birds of Akkulam compiled by Aswin B. Raj, official bird watcher of Mission Akkulam, mentions more than 100 birds commonly found in the lake vicinity that were observed during field visits December last and January this year.

These birds include winter visitors, transitory migrants, and residents.

Report

A report on the aquatic biology of the lake says conversion of the shoreline into residential areas and restaurants has resulted in observance of very high abundance of invasive bird species such as house crows and common mynas.

This could affect other species such as the little egret by predation and competition and lead to homogenisation of species diversity in the lake ecosystem.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/4u5ueq/article30855100.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19TVTVBIRD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/rarely-seen-strawberry-finch-spotted-at-akkulam-lake/article30855102.ece
405,2020/02/19,Football — India to host 2022 AFC Women’s Asian Cup,"Championship to be expanded from eight to 12 teams

India will host the 2022 AFC Women’s Asian Cup. India was awarded the tournament by the Asian Football Confederation (AFC)’s Women’s Committee here on Tuesday.

It was felt that India, which will also host the FIFA Women’s U-17 World Cup later this year, was best placed among the three bidders — Chinese Taipei and Uzbekistan were the other competing candidates — to maximise the promotion of the women’s game.

The venues proposed by India — D.Y. Patil Stadium, Trans Stadia Arena and Fatorda Stadium — are also being used in the FIFA tournaments, the AFC said.

Best opportunities

AFC’s Women’s Committee chairperson Mahfuza Akhter Kiron said: “India offers the best opportunities to build the event commercially as well as increasing the value and India is also committed to developing the women’s game and while all three were strong bids, India stands out.”

The committee decided that the expanded AFC Women’s Asian Cup — from eight to 12 teams — will be played in three groups of four teams with a minimum of 25 matches with eight teams qualifying for the newly introduced quarterfinals.

The committee agreed that the minimum length of the competition would be 17 days and that the administration would be mandated to organise the relevant play-off matches depending on the AFC slots at the 2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup.

407,2020/02/19,ISL | FC Goa swamps Jamshedpur,"Becomes first Indian club to play in AFC Champions League group stage

FC Goa on Wednesday became the first team from the country to qualify for the group stage of the AFC Champions League, the continent’s top-tier club competition, after beating Jamshedpur FC 5-0 in an Indian Super League match here.

Ferran Corominas (11th), Hugo Boumous (70th and 90th), Jackichand Singh (84th) and Mourtada Fall (87th) scored for FC Goa to ensure that their side ended the league phase of the ISL on top spot. The top team at the end of the league stage of ISL has been guaranteed a berth in the 2021 AFC Champions League.

FC Goa ended the league phase with 39 points after 18 matches. It is now six points clear of ATK which is on second spot with 33 points with one match left to play.

Indian clubs like Mohun Bagan and East Bengal have played in the Asian Club Championships but no team from the country has ever played in the group stage of AFC Champions League since its introduction in 2002.

I-League champions used to play in the preliminary/play-off rounds of the AFC Champions League till this ongoing season but none have been able to qualify for the group stage.

With the ISL having been recognised as the top-tier league in the country by the All India Football Federation, its top team in the league phase will represent India in the prestigious AFC Champions League.

Under Asian Football Confederation’s member association ranking system issued in November 2019, India has been allotted one slot in the expanded AFC Champions League as the country occupied eighth spot in the West Zone.

Bengaluru FC suffered a 2-1 defeat away to Maziya S&RC in the first leg of the AFC Cup playoff round at the Maldives National Football Stadium here on Wednesday.

Cornelius Stewart scored with ten minutes left to give Maziya the advantage ahead of the return leg in Bengaluru next Wednesday.

After a goalless first period, Ibrahim Mahudhee opened the scoring for Maziya just after the hour mark, firing home from distance. Substitute Deshorn Brown earned a penalty for BFC minutes later which Nili Perdomo converted to even matters.

But Stewart’s strike meant that BFC had to be satisfied with just the away goal.

The club will play ATK in the ISL on Saturday before Maziya come calling for the second leg.

409,2020/02/19,Goian — a hard-nosed defender,"Former MCFC captain is now representing Chennaiyin

Lucian Goian is a former teammate worthy of respect and friendship for most Mumbai City FC players. From forward Modou Sougou to gaolkeeper Amrinder Singh, the hard-nosed Romainan is a familiar face at the Mumbai Football Arena. As a committed and dogged defender, the former played his part in ISL 2016-17 when the blues topped the league stage, and made their first-ever semifinal appearance before losing to ATK in the semifinals.

In season six Goian will be wearing Chennaiyin FC colours on Friday night as he stands in Mumbai City’s path as it chases a win at all costs in the race to finish among the top four.

The 37-year-old is remembered for the rapport struck with the squad over three seasons at MCFC from 2016 onwards when Alexandre Guimaraes was chief coach.

Off-field friends

Amrinder, closest to the Romanian on the pitch, remembers: “We trusted each other when playing together and became friends off the field. Now he is with another team, trying hard to win for his side, like I am for mine.”

Goian’s communication skill caught the team management’s attention and pitchforked him to captaincy. The India goalkeeper pointed out: “He is a good talker and is interested in listening to what his teammates wish to say. On the pitch, he is extremely competitive and our understanding was based on trust in each other.”

Amrinder named Best Goalkeeper in 2016-17 now wears the captain’s armband for the home team.

Positive and negative

Goian often advanced into the rival goalmouth during corner-kicks and sometimes overlapped to finish off moves. The Mumbai City custodian is ready for such surprise visits by the Romanian for CFC. “It is a positive thing for a defender to do. But there is a negative side to this. We can take advantage if he does not get back into position in time.”

Amrinder also talked about the Romanian’s interest in reciting the Jana Gana Mana before kick-off. “He talked about this wish in his second season in ISL and had memorised it before the next season started. Goian would stand next to me and sing our National anthem. Aa an Indian, I felt proud that a close friend from another country is able to do this.”",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/jlfo9s/article30862381.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH20GOIAN,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/goian-a-hard-nosed-defender/article30862382.ece
410,2020/02/19,Champions League | Dortmund beat PSG 2-1 with sensational Haaland double,"Haaland, the first Dortmund player to score in his first league, German Cup and Champions League matches, has reached 10 goals in seven games in Europe's elite competition this season, including eight for Salzburg in the group stage, faster than anyone.

Borussia Dortmund teenager Erling Haaland scored twice in eight minutes to lead his team to a 2-1 victory over Paris St Germain in their Champions League Round of 16 first leg on Tuesday.

The Norwegian, 19, who joined in the winter and has already netted eight times in five Bundesliga matches, stabbed in from close range after a quick-fire passing move in the 69th minute.

He then thundered in an unstoppable shot for his second goal in the 77th, two minutes after PSG's Brazilian forward Neymar had levelled for the French champions.

Haaland, the first Dortmund player to score in his first league, German Cup and Champions League matches, has reached 10 goals in seven games in Europe's elite competition this season, including eight for Salzburg in the group stage, faster than anyone.

He is only the second teenager to net 10 Champions League goals, after Kylian Mbappe, and is the first teenager to score 10 in a single campaign in the competition.

“I still need to improve, keep working,” Haaland said. “I want to go far in the Champions League. With the second goal I enjoyed the moment.”

PSG, who were eliminated at this stage of the competition in the previous three seasons, had fit-again Neymar and Mbappe back in the starting lineup but they were almost completely shut out by an extremely efficient Dortmund backline.

In a cautious first half the French side had the slight advantage in possession but Dortmund carved out the only real chance after 27 minutes with a curled shot from Jadon Sancho.

Mbappe and Neymar were kept under tight surveillance, with Dortmund defenders Mats Hummels, Lukasz Piszczek -- on his 350th appearance for the club in all competitions -- and Dan Axel Zagadou denying the pair any space to manoeuvre.

The Germans' main firepower, Haaland, was also shackled for about an hour before finally finding some space to complete a quick Dortmund move.

PSG, who will be without Marco Verratti and Thomas Meunier for the return leg after they picked up bookings, drew level through Neymar, who found the net after a fine run down the right by Mbappe. The Brazilian also later hit the post.

But the visitors could do nothing when 17-year-old substitute Giovanni Reyna found Haaland at the edge of the box and the in-form forward released a fiercely struck left-foot effort that gave PSG goalkeeper Keylor Navas no chance.

Champions League holders Liverpool will need to summon another famous European comeback at Anfield next month after they were beaten 1-0 away to Atletico Madrid in their last-16 first leg on Tuesday.

Spain midfielder Saul Niguez struck the only goal of the game in the fourth minute by bundling into the net from close range following a corner, their traditional weapon of choice in recent years.

Liverpool, who have won 25 of 26 Premier League games this season and are on course for a record-smashing title win, missed a series of chances to equalise in the second half, with Mohamed Salah and captain Jordan Henderson coming closest to scoring.

Juergen Klopp's side play at home to Atletico on March 11 in the return leg at Anfield, where they produced an incredible 4-0 win over Barcelona in last year's semi-final second leg after losing the first match 3-0.

Atletico's Wanda Metropolitano stadium was the scene of Liverpool's 2-0 triumph over Tottenham Hotspur in last year's final but they faced a very different type of atmosphere this time around.

Clouds of billowing red smoke greeted the Atletico bus when it arrived at the ground as the home supporters stoked up a scorching atmosphere throughout the game to give their side a lift in the middle of their worst season in recent memory.

Diego Simeone's men have looked nothing like the sides that reached the 2014 and 2016 Champions League finals and challenged Real Madrid and Barcelona's duopoly of La Liga for most of this campaign. They trail league leaders Real by 13 points.

But on Tuesday they produced a vintage defensive display, sitting deep and barely giving Liverpool any space for their attacking trident of Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane to work their usual magic.

Mane was fortunate not to be sent off late in the first half after clashing with Sime Vrsaljko while on a yellow card and he was swiftly substituted by Klopp for Divock Origi, who scored the second goal in last year's final.

He caused little disquiet to Atletico's towering defenders, yet Salah should have levelled with a header which went wide of the near post, while Henderson also narrowly missed the target from inside the area later on.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/xlh16y/article30856439.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MADRIDKB,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/champions-league-atletico-madrid-edge-liverpool-with-vintage-defensive-display/article30856440.ece

413,2020/02/19,Farmers urged to cultivate grapes,"Cultivation of grapes is highly profitable and there is a good scope for tapping export opportunities by adopting good farm practices in raising the crop, said G.S.Prakash, former Head, Division of Fruit Crops, Indian Institute of Horticulture Research, Bengaluru.

Addressing students of the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University’s Horticultural College and Research Institute for Women and Anbil Dharmalingam Agricultural College and Research Institute (ADACRI) here on Tuesday, Dr.Prakash, an international consultant in viticulture, said grape is an important fruit grown widely in India and the country was a major exporter of fresh grapes. Grapes is among the top foreign exchange earners among fruit crops. Cultivation of grapes creates employment opportunities for farmers, farm labourers, exporters, traders and indirect employment to several others.

In India, grapes is being cultivated on a wide range of soils right from sandy loam to saline and alkali soils. Grapes are grown across a range of agro climatic zones. Though more than 20 varieties are under cultivation in the country, only about a dozen are commercially grown. Currently, Thompson Seedless is the ruling grape variety raised on about 55% of the total area under cultivation. Bangalore Blue occupies approximately 15% of the total area while Anab-e-Shahi and Dilkhush (15%), Sharad Seedless (5%), Perlette (5%) and Gulabi and Bhokri together (5%) are the other varieties grown.

Nowadays, grape growers are following good agricultural practices (GAP) to attain international standards and explore better opportunities for export. Adopting GAP in pruning, vineyard management, irrigation, fertilization, crop protection, appropriate stage and method of harvesting, packaging, storing and transporting are important.

“Grapes cultivators in India are highly dedicated and committed group and have established a leading position in the world grapes trade through their own effort. Now the time has come for small and marginal farmers too to take up grape cultivation by adopting GAP,” he said.

414,2020/02/19,Call for revamp of educational system,"Governor makes the clarion call during the inauguration of Gyanotsav 2020 at National College

Calling for revamp of educational system and integration of the country's rich knowledge traditions and values to make learning enjoyable, Governor Banwarilal Purohit said on Wednesday that the country's 70 crore strong population of youth has to be transformed into skilled human resource to derive the demographic dividend for the next three to four decades.

‘If the youth is properly educated and provided with proper skill set to take advantage of all that 21st century India has to offer them, they will contribute to the major demographic dividend, he said participating as chief guest at the inauguration of Gyanotsav 2020, an educational conclave, organised by National College and Shiksha Sanskriti Utthan Nyas (SSUN). The discussion on BJP’s Sankalp Patra (election manifesto) to arrive at solutions for the present problems involved participation of vice-chancellors, principals and academicians.

Emphasising on the significance of ancient universities Nalanda and Takshashila for their greatness, encouragement to diverse fields of learning and quality of knowledge creation, he said these institutions attracted scholars from all over the world.

The focus of institutions of learning started by the British was limited to the needs of the colonial government and had no concern for the welfare and skill development of the masses.

Institutions must adopt villages, provide them support, enlighten them about various schemes of Centre and State governments and contribute to the welfare of the society.

‘If learned citizens understand, as a society, as a nation, where we stand and where we are lagging behind and take appropriate steps to close the gap, the nation will soon emerge as one of the productively developed countries in the whole world, he said.

All moves to promote dissemination of mother tongues serve not only to encourage linguistic diversity and multilingual education but also develop fuller awareness of linguistic and cultural traditions throughout the world and inspire solidarity based on understanding, tolerance and dialogue, he said.

Character building, personality development and value-based education, quality education and research, education in mother tongue and environmental education figured among the themes of the two-day conclave.

419,2020/02/19,Protest against CAA continues in Tiruchi,"Members affiliated to various Islamic organisations gathered in front of the Tiruchi Collectorate here on Wednesday in protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act, the National Population Register and the National Register of Citizens.

Over 3000 people, led by Jamaat-ul-Ulama, gathered asking the State government pass a resolution to revoke CAA. Raising slogans, they said they would refuse to show documents proving their citizenship if NRC is implemented. Although the Citizenship Act was amended four times since independence, it has differentiated citizens based on religion for the first time now, they said.

Abdul Raheem, district secretary, Jamaat-ul-Ulama condemned the ‘inaction’ of the State government and said the AIADMK is using former Chief Minister late Jayalalithaa’s name but it is not following her ideologies. ‘Until she was alive, the BJP could not step foot in our state,’ he said. Six states have passed resolutions against the ‘discriminatory’ Act. If she were alive, Tamil Nadu would have been one of the first states to reject it, he said adding ‘the State government is acting against its ideals by aligning with the Centre.’

Mr. Rahim stressed that the protest was not solely for Muslims but was also for Sri Lankan Tamils, the poor and the downtrodden. ‘Brothers and sisters of Eelam are our flesh and blood. We will not let anything happen to them,’ he said.

CPI State Secretary R. Mutharasan on Tuesday urged the State Election Commission and the government to conduct elections to rural local bodies in nine districts, where the polls were not held earlier, and urban local bodies at the earliest.

He also called upon the State government to allot adequate funds for rural local bodies which became functional in 27 districts after a gap of three years.

“The State should take steps for devolution of funds from the Centre for local bodies and ensure that they are able to function effectively,” Mr. Mutharasan told reporters in Kumbakonam.

He was in the temple town to participate in a conference of the party’s elected representatives to rural local bodies.

Referring to the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act, Mr. Mutharasan said it was not just Muslims who were protesting. “All sections of people are protesting. The government should come forward to have a discussion on the issue in the Assembly and pass a resolution stating that it would not enforce the Act in Tamil Nadu.”

421,2020/02/19,"Abu Dhabi, Doha beckon travellers","Finally, a response from an airliner to clamour from travellers in central region

The introduction of overseas flight services from Tiruchi to Abu Dhabi and Doha from next month by low-cost carrier Air India Express is set to give a big boost to passenger traffic at this fast growing non-metro airport.

The recent announcement made by the country’s first international budget airline has gladdened tourism circles and travellers here since it has come at a time when there has been a clamour for long from travellers in this part of the region for introduction of flight services to newer destinations in West Asia.

Direct connectivity to overseas destinations from Tiruchi international airport will now increase to seven after Air India Express begins its services to Abu Dhabi and Doha from March-end.

Tourism industry circles here say the long-awaited sectors connecting Tiruchi with Abu Dhabi and Doha has been finally done by Air India Express, which is already operating daily flights to Dubai, Sharjah and Singapore from here.

The launch of the new services comes at a time when the airport is on an expansion mode with a swanky passenger terminal under construction to cater to future traffic growth and poised for completion in 2021.

The introduction of direct flights to Doha and Abu Dhabi from Tiruchi will certainly be a boon to people of central region and those in the southern districts as they no longer have to travel to Chennai or other airports to reach the destinations, says M.A. Aleem, member, Advisory Committee, Tiruchi international airport.

Flight services to the two new destinations will augur well for travellers as a substantial work force in different West Asian countries hail from the central and southern parts of Tamil Nadu. Besides providing an impetus to passenger movement, the new services will eventually bring in revenue to the Tiruchi airport as well as to the government, says Mr. Aleem, a frequent overseas traveller.

The United Arab Emirates is a popular tourist destination in West Asia with regular group tours being organised by tour operators to Dubai and Abu Dhabi from this part of the region.

Tourists, who wind up their tour in Abu Dhabi, now have the option of boarding a flight to Tiruchi instead of driving back to Dubai. This sector will be a lucrative one for Air India Express, said an office-bearer of Tiruchi Tourism Federation.

Adding flight connectivity to newer overseas destinations will also help Tiruchi’s economy by attracting more tourists and improving business further, says Mr. Aleem.

The new services to Abu Dhabi and Doha will certainly have good load factor, feels Achar Singh, member, Confederation of Indian Industry, Tiruchi.

Tiruchi is a unique non-metro airport with direct connectivity to more international destinations than domestic ones. At present, overseas flights are being daily operated to Colombo, Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, Dubai and Sharjah.

Notwithstanding overseas services to select destinations in South Asia, South-East Asia and West Asia, international passenger traffic has been on the upswing at the airport. International passenger movements alone has already exceeded 10 lakh in the current fiscal from April to December, according to Airports Authority of India statistics.

Once the new services are launched, passenger traffic and the total number of international flight movements is only bound to increase further. The direct connectivity from West Asia will also give rise to inbound tourism and medical tourism, says the office-bearer from Tiruchi Tourism Federation.

Mr. Aleem says completion of expansion of the runway at the airport expeditiously will enable in bringing in wide-bodied jets.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/2jxm1h/article30855093.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY19-111AIRPORT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/abu-dhabi-doha-beckon-travellers/article30855095.ece

433,2020/02/19,Remove riders in GO on slum development: E.A.S. Sarma,"‘Livelihoods will be hit if dewellers are shifted to faraway places’

The State government has issued the GO 463 with the good intention of providing houses to slum dwellers, but the conditions and riders go against the spirit of the order, former bureaucrat E.A.S. Sarma has said.

Addressing a meeting of slum dwellers organised by Visakhapatnam Slum Dwellers Association and Progressive Organisation for Women at the Mahatma Gandhi statue near the GVMC on Tuesday, Mr. Sarma pointed out that the conditions mentioned in the GO were not in favour of slum dwellers.

“The GO has six or seven conditions based on which the land can not be regularised in the favour of slum dwellers. The conditions include the land should not be of high value, it can be made useful for public purpose, objectionable encroachment, it should not be on a hill or beside water body or in catchment area. The officials concerned should realise that the land were encroached by the dwellers over five decades ago at most of the places, and the then and present conditions can be different,” he pointed out.

‘In situ development’

Moreover, he said, if the government really intends to benefit the poor slum dwellers, then it should remove the conditions and develop slum ‘in situ’ rather than pushing the dwellers 25 km away from their present place of living. “This will hit their livelihood,” he said.

According to Lakshmi of POW, the authorities concerned had earlier shifted a number of slums to far away places, and this had affected the livelihood of the people.

“We urge the government to remove the conditions in the GO and plan in situ development of the slums,” she said, adding that the conditions stand as obstacles for slum dwellers who intend to apply for a house site.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/9hnxp5/article30855190.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18VZ3SLUMDWELLERSPROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/remove-riders-in-go-on-slum-development-eas-sarma/article30855191.ece

The officials of Vigilance and Enforcement Department and the Food Safety wing of the GVMC raided a food court operating out of a shopping mall at Dwaraka Nagar on Tuesday and found frozen products beyond expiry date being used in the kitchen.

According to Food Safety Officer M. Koteswara Rao, the teams found 31 sealed packets of chicken, prawn and other products worth ₹7,700 that were beyond expiry date by one to six months in the refrigerator of the kitchen.

He said the food court staff claimed that though the packets were in the refrigerator, they were not being used.

“As per the norms, the expired products should either be destroyed or kept in store rooms with ‘not for use’ labels affixed to them. Keeping the products in refrigerator hints that they are being served to the customers,” said Mr. Koteswara Rao.

435,2020/02/19,‘Framework for setting up skill development varsity ready’,"Plans afoot to incentivise MSMEs based on performance in the new policy, says Industries Minister

The State government is focussing on attracting more industries to Andhra Pradesh and the thrust is on encouraging non-polluting and green industries, Minister for Industries, Commerce, IT and Skill Development Mekapati Goutham Reddy has said.

Delivering the keynote address at a meeting on ‘UNIDO-DPIIT initiatives for inclusive and sustainable industrialisation in Visakhapatnam district’ here on Tuesday, he said Visakhapatnam is among six pilot districts that have been selected by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade for promotion of sustainable industries, as part the DPIIT- United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO) initiative.

“It is a step in the right direction. The framework for establishment of a skill development university and skill centres in each Parliamentary constituencies in the State is ready and the final decision will be taken after a discussion in the Cabinet,” said Mr. Goutham Reddy.

The Minister said that MSMEs which generate the maximum employment after the farm sector in the State were plagued by issues such as lack of access to capital, modern technology, advanced marketing techniques, availability of skilled manpower and high fixed costs.

“A plan is on the cards to incentivise MSMEs basing on their performance in the new policy for industrial development and export promotion for 2020-25,” he said.

To a question, he said too many subsidies would attract short-term investments and the government was looking for long-term investments. “As many as 50,000 IT jobs will be created in Visakhapatnam in the near future,” he said.

Growth engine

Mr. Goutham Reddy said blessed with a strong base of industries and good rail, road, air and seaport connectivity, Visakhapatnam would be the growth engine for industrial development of the State.

Speaking at the programme, Tourism Minister Muttamsetti Srinivasa Rao said that more industries were bound to come to Vizag, with its selection as the Executive capital of the State. He appealed to the Industries Minister to appoint nodal officers in the three regions to liaison with all government departments and help get speedy approvals for various projects.

UNIDO India Representative Rene Van Berkel elaborated on the initiatives undertaken by the UNIDO in various parts of India to build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrial development and foster innovation.

Mr. Rene Van Berkel said that the UNIDO was looking at opportunities for inclusive industrial development. Apart from development of new industries, those in the existing industrial clusters would be equipped with latest maintenance equipment and the workforce with better skills.

Director of Industries (A.P.) J.V.N. Subramanyam spoke about the immense potential of Visakhapatnam in industry, IT and tourism sectors. “The city is generating more than 14 % of the State GDP and it has a vast talent pool with the presence of many universities and engineering colleges in the region,” he said.

436,2020/02/19,Bandaru dares Botcha for open debate on land pooling,"Former TDP MLA alleges violations of norms, collusion

Alleging coercion and violations of norms in the land pooling exercise being undertaken in several villages, former TDP MLA Bandaru Satyanarayana Murthy on Tuesday claimed that it was against the assertion of the government that land would be acquired only after getting the consent of people.

He dared Minister Botcha Satyanarayana for an open debate or to convene an all-party meeting on the land pooling exercise in the district.

“Lands being cultivated by SC and BC farmers for decades are being forcibly taken after taking the ryots into custody. Officials are going with earth movers and posse of police personnel. Such instances have been reported from Juttada, S.R. Puram, Pinagadi, Jerripotulapalem, Mudapaka and six villages in Padmanabham mandal,” claimed the TDP leader.

Supreme Court ruling

He alleged that the Supreme Court ruling that assigned land should be treated on par with the patta land was ignored and no compensation was paid for the cashew and mango trees grown on the land selected for acquisition.

“The officials, in collusion with the ruling party leaders, are recording the years of encroachment in a discriminatory manner. The extent of land is deliberately shown less with ulterior motives,” alleged Mr. Satyanarayana Murthy.

Cancellation of pension

Former MLA Palla Srinivasa Rao alleged that pensions were cancelled based on a on six-step randomisation computer system. “Officials are saying that if the persons concerned show proof to the contrary, the pensions will be restored. The village/ward volunteer system can be used to verify the claims. Even in the case of other services, the volunteer system is not integrated with the administrative structure at the ground level,” he said.

442,2020/02/19,Sanofi joins hands with U.S. govt. to expedite development of coronavirus vaccine,"Sanofi plans to investigate an advanced pre-clinical SARS vaccine candidate and will use its recombinant DNA platform to produce a 2019 novel coronavirus vaccine candidate

Sanofi Pasteur, the vaccine division of French pharma major Sanofi, on Wednesday said it will leverage its previous development work for a SARS vaccine to develop a potential vaccine for COVID-19 (coronavirus disease).

As part of the initiative, the company said it will collaborate with Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

“Addressing a global health threat such as this newest coronavirus is going to take a collaborative effort, which is why we are working with BARDA to quickly advance a potential vaccine candidate,” Global Head of Vaccines at Sanofi David Loew said in a statement.

Also read | What is the source of the new SARS-like disease reported in China?

While the company is lending its expertise where possible, it believes the collaboration with BARDA may provide the most meaningful results in protecting the public from this latest outbreak, he added.

COVID-19 is a respiratory disease due to novel coronavirus.

In late-2002, the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) coronavirus emerged and then largely disappeared by 2004.

Sanofi plans to further investigate an advanced pre-clinical SARS vaccine candidate that could protect against COVID-19.

The company said it will use its recombinant DNA platform to produce a 2019 novel coronavirus vaccine candidate.

The recombinant technology produces an exact genetic match to proteins found on the surface of the virus.

“Emerging global health threats like the 2019 novel coronavirus require a rapid response,” BARDA Director Rick A Bright said.

He further said, “By expanding our partnership with Sanofi Pasteur and leveraging a licensed recombinant vaccine platform, we hope to speed development of a vaccine candidate to protect against a new virus.

In December 2019, Sanofi had also entered into an agreement with BARDA to establish facilities in the U.S. for the sustainable production of an adjuvant recombinant vaccine for use in the event of an influenza pandemic and based on the same technology platform that will be used for the COVID-19 programme.
