3,2020/02/20,Asian wrestling | Indian women pin three gold in freestyle,"Divya, Pinki and Sarita triumph while Nirmala comes off second-best

The absence of Chinese and North Korean wrestlers was expected to impact the quality of the women’s section at the senior Asian Championships and India was the biggest beneficiary, winning three gold medals and a silver on Thursday.

With Japan also sending a largely second-string squad — barring former World champion Mayu Mukaida — the Indians were favourites for medals. Barring the 50kg, the other four weight categories in action on the day had seven or fewer competitors, forcing the organisers to conduct bouts in Nordic (round-robin) format.

Emphatic wins

Asian Games bronze medalist Divya Kakran was the first to ensure a gold in the 68kg, winning all four of her bouts in the morning session by pinning her opponents.

“I had to win by fall to get five points from all my bouts because the Japanese was winning all her bouts by big margins, so I took the risk even though my coach told me I didn’t have to.”

She admitted the absence of China made a difference. “Yes, it did benefit but if you have just five wrestlers, it becomes tough because you have to fight everyone and win big,” she added.

In the evening session, Pinki (55kg) and Sarita (59kg) added to the gold tally but not before being pushed by their Mongolian opponents.

While Pinki won 2-1 in a largely defensive bout that saw all three points being scored through the opponent’s passivity, Sarita had to dig deep in the final 15 seconds for a 3-2 victory.

“I already had a slight elbow injury and it got aggravated a bit in the morning so I wanted to be cautious. Also, I am simply happy to win my first medal, that too gold, in the competition,” Pinki said.

On her part, Sarita said she was confident even when Battsetseg Altantsetseg took a crucial point with 21 seconds left to level 2-2, lifting her out for the winner.

Nirmala Devi won silver after going down 2-3 to Japan’s Miho Igarashi in the 50kg. “I tried my best but she was very strong and also had very good defence. I need to work on my leg defence a lot more now ahead of the Olympic qualifiers,” she admitted.

Kiran was the only disappointment for the host on the day, crashing out of the medal rounds in the 76kg after losing two of her three bouts in the morning.

The results: 50kg: 1. Miho Igarashi (Jpn), 2. Nirmala Devi (Ind), 3. Valentina Ivanova Islamova (Kaz) & Dauletbike Yakhshimuratova (Uzb).

55kg: 1. Pinki (Ind), 2. Dulguun Bolormaa (Mgl), 3. Marina Zuyeva (Kaz); 59kg: 1. Sarita (Ind), 2. Battsetseg Altantsetseg (Mgl), 3. Madina Bakbergenova (Kaz); 68kg: 1. Divya Kakran (Ind), 2. Naruha Matsuyuki (Jpn), 3. Delgermaa Enkhsaikhan (Mgl); 76kg: 1. Hiroe Minagawa Suzuki (Jpn), 2. Aiperi Medet Kyzy (Kgz), 3. Elmira Syzdykova (Kaz).",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/ezmnbw/article30873924.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH21PINK,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/asian-wrestling-indian-women-pin-three-gold-in-freestyle/article30873925.ece
4,2020/02/20,Spain Masters | Saina makes quarterfinals,"Sameer also through, Ajay dashes Srikanth’s hopes

Saina Nehwal secured a straight game win over Ukraine’s Maria Ulitina to storm into women’s quarterfinals of the $170,000 Barcelona Spain Masters badminton here on Thursday.

Saina brushed aside Maria 21-10, 21-19 in the second round to set up a last-eight clash with Thailand’s third seed Busanan Ongbamrungphan, who has beaten the Indian twice in the last two encounters.

Sameer Verma also made it to the last eight with a hard-fought 21-14, 16-21, 21-15 win over Germany’s Kai Schaefer.

However, K. Srikanth went down 21-6, 21-17 to fellow Indian Ajay Jayaram, dashing his hopes of qualifying for the Tokyo Games.

Srikanth desperately needs to win a tournament or make it to the quarters and semifinals consistently to qualify for the Olympics.

The results (second round):

Men: Sameer Verma bt Kai Schaefer (Ger) 21-14, 16-21, 21-15; Ajay Jayaram bt K. Srikanth 21-6, 21-17.

5,2020/02/20,Top names for India Open,"Chawrasia, Lahiri among strong home-grown golfers

Some established names and rising stars will join the European Tour regulars when the 56th edition of $1.75 million Hero Indian Open tees off at the DLF Golf and Country Club at Gurugram on March 19.

Almost all the leading Indian names and a couple of past champions like S.S.P. Chawrasia (2016 and 2017), Anirban Lahiri (2015), Jyoti Randhawa (2000, 2006 and 2007) along with Shubhankar Sharma, Shiv Kapur, Gaganjeet Bhullar, Rashid Khan, Udayan Mane and others will be part of the field that has some tough overseas challengers.

Though the final list of entries is yet to be finalised, defending champion Stephen Gallacher (Scotland), Andy Sullivan (England), Joost Luiten (Nederlands), Thomas Bjorn (Denmark), Yuta Ikeda (Japan) besides some young talents like Justin Sub (US), Akshay Bhatia (US), Nicolai Hojgaard (Denmark) and Mathew Jordan (Great Britain) are part of the field.

The winner of the event receives $291,660 (approximately ₹2.08 crore) while the 70th finisher takes home $3,200 (₹2.29 lakh).

Speaking to The Hindu, Kapur said, “I’ve marked three or four weeks to peak this season. Indian Open week is among them. I’m playing three weeks leading up to it — New Zealand next week, then Malaysia and Thailand — working my way back, planned it in such a way that travelling gets reduced. Playing in Dubai has helped me prepare for challenges that courses like the DLF sort of presents — with sloppy, fast greens.”

Mane, winner of three successive titles on the domestic PGTI Tour recently, could well follow Rashid Khan to the Tokyo Olympics this year. He said, “Indian golfers do not have any great “home advantage” of playing at the DLF course. It is a modern course and many players in both continents have adjusted to the challenges such courses offer. We do have the crowd backing us. But over all, it is a fair test for everyone.

“I am looking to make my game better. I am just looking to improve and sharpen my sword for, when ever the day comes of me winning, that’s the ultimate goal of learning more about my swing, my game, polish and re-polish my skills. I am going to come three days before Indian Open and get myself as acclimatised to the weather and the golf course.”

Shubhankar said, “I’ve had a few good results recently but I really want to do well here. DLF was once my home course and it will be great to do well there.”",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/w9a1dc/article30872373.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH21GOLF,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/top-names-for-india-open/article30872374.ece
6,2020/02/20,Sindhu wins third successive ESPN’s Female Sportsperson of the Year award,"Saurabh Chaudhary bagged the honour in the male category

World champion shuttler P.V. Sindhu on Thursday won the ESPN’s ‘Female Sportsperson of the Year’ award for a third consecutive time while young shooter Saurabh Chaudhary bagged the honour in the male category.

Saurabh won a total of five World Cup gold medals — two in the men’s 10m air pistol and another three in the 10m air pistol mixed team event at the ISSF World Cup 2019. He also won a 10m air pistol bronze medal at the World Cup in Rio.

Sprinter Dutee Chand became the first winners of the ‘Courage’ award for being inspirational both on and off the field. She fought the world athletics governing body — the IAAF’s discriminatory hypoandrogenism regulations, and earned her right to race again.

In 2019, she became the first Indian athlete to come out and talk about being in a relationship with a female friend.

Ace chess player Koneru Humpy won the award for the ‘Comeback of the Year’ after claiming her first world title in December 2019 by winning the Women’s World Rapid Chess Championships in Moscow to cap a remarkable comeback.

The former junior world champion had taken a two-year maternity sabbatical between 2016 and 2018 to look after her newborn daughter.

Wrestler Deepak Punia’s gold in the world junior championship, silver in the world senior championship, and earning a qualification for the Tokyo Olympics made him a natural choice for the coveted ESPN’s ‘Emerging Sportsperson of the Year’ award.

Pullela Gopichand, chief national badminton coach, claimed the ‘Coach of the Year’ award, for nurturing two Olympic medalists in Saina Nehwal and Sindhu.

Sindhu’s World Championship win, the first by an Indian in badminton, has also been selected as the ‘Moment of the Year’

Manu Bhaker-Saurabh Chaudhary grabbed the ‘Team of the Year’ honour.’ The 10m air pistol mixed team combination completed their clean sweep at 2019 World Cups.

Manasi Joshi, 30, won ‘Differently-abled athlete of the year/Para-athlete of the year’ award. Joshi became world champion after winning the gold medal at the BWF Para-Badminton World Championships in 2019.

Hockey legend Balbir Singh (Senior), one of independent India’s most celebrated Olympians, has been conferred with ESPN’s ‘Lifetime Achievement’ award.

Balbir played a starring role in the national hockey team’s triple golds in London 1948, Helsinki 1952 and Melbourne 1956. He also worked with the national team as coach at the 1971 World Cup and as a manager in Kuala Lumpur four years later, when India won their only World Cup title to date.

7,2020/02/20,PGTI and WGAI sign pact,"In a move that has potential to help professional golf in the country for both genders and attract new sponsors, Professional Golf Tour of India (PGTI) and Women’s Golf Association of India (WGAI) have signed an “Affiliation Agreement.”

PGTI President Gautam Thapar and WGAI President Kavita Singh signed the agreement here on Wednesday and sounded confident of raising the profile of country’s professional golfers.

Clarifying that this was no merger of the two bodies that govern professional golf, Thapar said, “Since the PGTI events carry world ranking points, we are looking at ways to get similar points for our women professionals.

“In the long run, we want to see more money for professionals of both genders, more prize-money tournaments for women and events that could attract quality players from around the world. We are looking at the novelty of the mixed field (where both men and women professionals get to play), attracting new sponsors. Also, a single body that deals with professional golf makes it easier for the Government and other stakeholders, too.”

Kavita said, “At present, there are only 40 women professionals in the country and we want the number to grow. This partnership with PGTI is sure to help make the sport attractive for more girls to turn professional.”",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/pgti-and-wgai-sign-pact/article30865368.ece
8,2020/02/20,Poonawalla Breeders’ Multi-Million on Feb. 23.,"‘Clash of Titans’ competition also to be held

The 31st successive running of the richest juvenile race in the country, the Poonawalla Breeders’ Multi-Million (Gr.1), (PBMM) is scheduled for 6 p.m. on Sunday (Feb. 23). The Intervalve Poonawalla Ltd. Million, for maiden three-year-olds over 1,200m, shall be run at 4 p.m. on the same day.

The total stakesmoney for the plum event is ₹1,45,42,875 with the winner’s purse being ₹87,25,725.

Among the 11 contestants in the PBMM, the top contender is the Bengaluru-based trainer Suleiman Attaollahi’s filly Forest Flame. She won the Breeders’ Produce Stakes during the Indian Derby weekend at Mumbai almost by a distance and given her track performances, she may repeat.

The two challengers from Mumbai, Giant Star and California who may pose a threat, hail from trainer Malesh Narredu’s yard. Malesh’s son Deepesh Narredu will be saddling both the horses as the former is facing one month suspension.

Giant Star’s winning debut on the Derby weekend over 1600m trip was very impressive. With excellent morning trials, he may have a say at the finish. Stablemate California, winner of the Gool S. Poonawalla million, is in fine nick.

S. Padmanabhan-trained Golden Oaks, winner of the B.K. Rattonsey Maiden Million, may add pep, while Hyderabad-based trainer L.V.R. Deshmukh’s ward Lombardy, winner of two races, may be a dangerous threat.

For the racegoers at the Mahalaxmi race course, there will be a “free contest of skill’ where they will have to nominate the first four placings of the PBMM. The first prize is a Honda Amaze car and the other three prizes are a scooter, LED TV and a laptop.

To promote the sport, the Poonawalla Family has decided to give away a ₹50 betting voucher, a free contest of skill form and free entry to the first 7,500 racegoers in the first enclosure on Sunday.

There will be a bonanza for the tote-betting punters, as a gross amount of ₹20,14,350 will be added to the combined jackpot pool. A gross amount of ₹10 lakh will be added to the collection of the super jackpot pool.

There will be a championship battle between Indian and foreign jockeys and a glittering prize distribution parade will be held.

The Indian team has A. Sandesh, P. Trevor and P.S. Chouhan, while the foreign combine is made up of David Allan, David Egan and Nicky Mackay.

Upto five races, in which at least two jockeys from each team are declared, will be considered for the Clash Of Titans and same shall be decided after the declarations. For calculating points, equal number of riders will be selected from each team.

In addition, there will also be a trainers’ championship with points given in all races except the last race of the day.

The top three placings will get 15, 10 and 7 points respectively, while the next three will fetch 5, 3 and 1 points.",races,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/races/poonawalla-breeders-multi-million-on-feb-23/article30871687.ece

11,2020/02/20,Ameeta Mehra: Trotting to a new dawn,"In a bid to re-energise the industry, Indian stud farm owners, led by Ameeta Mehra, are pushing to race their horses abroad

At the ongoing Asian Racing Conference 2020 in Cape Town today, there will be a meeting with a special focus on India. Albeit on the sidelines, and on the eve of a larger panels titled “Promoting the international movement of horses” and “Major developments and current strategies in the Asian region”, securing this meeting at the 38th edition has been a win for the Indian horse-breeding and racing community.

Spearheading this effort is Ameeta Mehra, owner of Usha Stud Farms near Gurugram. Mehra, who took over the farm in her early 30s following her parents’ untimely death in a tragic accident in 2001, has kept the enterprise’s successes going. According to the Stud Book Authority of India, in the year 2013-2014, Usha Stud Farm topped the country in terms of prize money that the horses from her farm raked in. The horses have registered 27 wins across multiple races across India, in barely the first two months of 2020 alone.

Despite these figures, the industry has been seeing a slow decline for close to two decades now — and it is this push to sell and race horses from Indian farms in the international market, that can be a positive solution.

Towards recovery

For years, horse breeding and racing has been seen as an elite pursuit with windfall gains. However, various industry-wide issues, coupled with no designated government department to take up their concerns, had affected it adversely.

The formation of a Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry, and Dairying in 2019 (separate from being just a department under the larger Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare), gave some sense of relief to stud farm owners in that they had a dedicated place to where they could address their problems.

But, Mehra notes, the effect of the new Goods and Services Tax, which was announced two years before this only compounded their problems.

“As an industry, we hadn’t been too proactive in tackling problems, but when the new GST regime came into effect in 2017, horse racing was given a body blow,” she says.

She chalks this up to the 28% charge that was levied on the total revenue collected by race clubs. The tax regime wasn’t entirely off the mark, says Mehra, but had been “misapplied” — the tax should have been levied on the commission earned on a club’s earnings, she stresses, instead of being charged on the total revenue.

However, there is a glimmer of hope: the recent Union Budget gave a tax break to importing of racehorses for the year 2020-21. The customs duty, which earlier stood as high as 30% is now at zero.

“This has given a fillip to the breeding industry,” Mehra says, distinguishing it from the racing industry. Imported horses after all, are not allowed to participate in races in India.

Capitalising on all these developments therefore, the idea to have India-bred horses participate in races abroad — “especially the ones in Korea, Macau, Singapore, Mauritius, Bahrain, and Saudi Arabia — might offer some monetary reprieve to the industry at large.

Pushing the agenda

Accompanying Mehra to the meeting that will happen on February 20th, are veterinarians, the heads of leading race clubs in India, including Dr. Surender Reddy of the Hyderabad Race Club. Dr. Praveen Malik, the Animal Husbandry Commissioner has also confirmed his participation via video conference.

Getting all heads together too has been a steady process. Earlier in December in the lead up to the Conference, Mehra brought together various prominent leaders of the horse breeding and racing industry, ranging from Dr. C. V. Niranjan, Chairman of the Veterinary Commission; Satish Iyer, Keeper and Registrar of the Indian Stud Book; Dr. Hasneyn Mirza, a veterinarian specialising in horses, as well as representatives from prominent stud farms like Poonawalla, Kunigal, Mukteshwar, and Sohna. This was organised in order to get everyone to participate and put their weight behind their common end-goal, which was to find ways to race their horses abroad.

The result of the December meeting is a compiled dossier detailing the best health practices of Indian stud farms. This was made based on a report by the World Organisation for Animal Health’s Guidelines on the Establishment, Management, and Self-Declaration to the OIE of an Equine Disease Free Zone.

Govt involvement

In the same December meeting, representatives from the Department of Animal Husbandry also agreed to send a written letter to the European Union, showing the government’s interest in supporting stud farm owners to send their horses abroad.

“I was told that [the various countries] probably want to listen to the Government’s side, about how we plan the export of thoroughbreds to the European Union. For example, [it’s required that] the horses [inhabit] specific physical zones [Equine Disease Free Zone] that are free from some diseases [like glanders],” notes Dr. Malik.

He adds that he will make a case for their readiness for “whatever is possible in terms of health, surveillance, and tracking”.

The result of these efforts, will be put to test on the Thursday evening in Cape Town. Until then, it is notable that after decades of heading towards a lull, stud-farms, even those that were earlier excessively competitive against one another, are coming together to forge a new future for themselves.",races,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/races/8jgvnl/article30870324.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ameeta-with-yearling,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/races/ameeta-mehra-trotting-to-a-new-dawn/article30870328.ece

14,2020/02/20,Majority of Indians have confidence in Donald Trump’s handling of world affairs: Pew Research Center,"The survey, conducted between June 24 and October 2, 2019, was based on 2,476 adult respondents, surveyed face to face.

With U.S. President Donald Trump’s arrival in India only days away, a new survey from the Pew Research Center suggests that while Mr. Trump is positively perceived by Indians in India, his specific policies, including trade, are not as positively regarded. The survey also found that Indians who associate with the BJP are more likely to think favourably of Mr. Trump than those associated with the Congress.

The survey, conducted between June 24 and October 2, 2019, was based on 2,476 adult respondents, surveyed face to face, found that a majority (56%) of Indians surveyed in 2019 had confidence in Mr. Trump doing the right thing regarding world affairs. This number has increased from 14% in 2016. A large part of this increase is because the share of “don’t know” responses (or those declining to respond) to the question on Mr. Trump’s approach to world affairs has decreased from 67% to 30% over three years. The proportion of those saying the lack confidence in Mr. Trump’s handling of world affairs has more or less flat-lined since 2016.

Prior to former U.S. President Barack Obama’s departure from office, 58% of Indians had confidence in his handling of world affairs, 9% had no confidence and 33% did not opine on it.

Other survey results were also highlighted by Pew just before Mr. Trump’s visit to India. Forty eight per cent of Indians disapprove Mr. Trump’s policies of increasing fees and tariffs on goods from other countries entering the U.S., roughly a quarter approve and another quarter do not offer an opinion. BJP supporters are just as likely as Congress supporters to disapprove of Mr. Trump’s tariff policies, and less likely to provide an answer. These results are based on another Pew survey conducted in the spring of 2019.

The last two years have been tense as far as trade relations between India and the U.S. are concerned with Mr. Trump calling India “Tariff King”, including India on a list of countries slapped with tariffs on steel and aluminium, revoking India’s access to the U.S.’s preferential trading system, the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP). India slapped retaliatory tariffs on 28 U.S. products. The two sides are yet to work out a modest trade deal and have ambitions to eventually work towards a more comprehensive free trade agreement.

15,2020/02/20,Angela Merkel slams ‘poison’ of racism after nine killed in shooting,"Suspect wanted to ‘destroy’ people from two dozen countries

Chancellor Angela Merkel condemned the “poison” of racism on Thursday after a shooter with suspected far-right beliefs killed nine people at a shisha bar and a café in the German city of Hanau.

The suspect, identified as 43-year-old German Tobias R., was found dead at his home following an hours-long manhunt. The body of his 72-year-old mother was also found at the flat in what appeared to be a murder-suicide.

Federal counter-terror prosecutors investigating the case said they saw “a xenophobic motive” behind the shootings, the latest deadly attack blamed on the far right in Germany.

“Racism is a poison, hatred is a poison and this poison exists in our society, and it is already to blame for far too many crimes,” Ms. Merkel said in Berlin.

Among the dead were “several victims of Kurdish origin”, the Kon-Med association of Kurds in Germany said in a statement.

The bloodshed plunged Germany into mourning, and rallies are scheduled in Berlin, Hanau and other cities on Thursday to honour the victims. Relatives and friends of the victims gathered at the Arena bar around midday Thursday, an AFP reporter said, embracing one another in tears.

Killer’s document

In a rambling 24-page document seen by AFP, the alleged gunman wrote that people from over two dozen countries should be “destroyed”.

He also said he had never been with a woman, which he blamed on being “watched” by unspecified secret services.

Ms. Merkel pledged to fight back against “all those who try to divide Germany”.

She cited the murders carried out by the neo-Nazi “NSU” cell between 2000 and 2007 as well as last June's killing of pro-migrant politician Walter Luebcke, and the deadly anti-Semitic attack in Halle in October as examples of the threat posed by the far right.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/1dduxf/article30439513.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ANGELAMERKEL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/angela-merkel-slams-poison-of-racism-after-nine-killed-in-shooting/article30873498.ece

China on Thursday touted a big drop in new virus infections as proof its epidemic control efforts are working, but the toll grew abroad with deaths in Japan and South Korea.

Fatalities in China hit 2,118 as 114 more people died, but health officials reported the lowest number of new cases in nearly a month, including in hardest-hit Hubei province. However, Beijing said it has again changed the method of counting patients and will now include only those diagnosed by sophisticated laboratory testing. It is the second time in just eight days that the country has revised its criteria — a move that could muddle statistics and complicate efforts to track the spread of the illness.

More than 74,000 people have been infected by the virus in China, and hundreds more in over 25 countries. The number of deaths outside mainland China climbed to 11.

17,2020/02/20,Michael Bloomberg comes under attack at Democratic debate,"The billionaire candidate was accused of trying to buy his way into White House

Michael Bloomberg faced a barrage of attacks at his first Democratic presidential debate on Wednesday, as his rivals assailed the free-spending and fast-rising billionaire over his record on race, history of sexist comments and the use of his massive fortune to muscle his way into the contest.

In a rough debate début that gave voters their first unscripted look at the media mogul and self-funding former New York Mayor, Mr. Bloomberg seemed uncomfortable and hesitant as he defended his record and argued that he is Democrats’ best chance of beating Republican President Donald Trump in November.

Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar, Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg all lined up to go after Mr. Bloomberg, who has surged in polls helped by an unprecedented advertising blitz. But they also heaped personal attacks on one another in the most contentious of the nine Democratic White House debates.

All of the contenders on the Las Vegas debate stage accused Mr. Bloomberg of trying to buy his way into the White House and said his record as Mayor and businessman was not good enough to beat Mr. Trump.

“We’re running against a billionaire who calls women fat broads and horse-faced lesbians,” said Ms. Warren, a Senator from Massachusetts. “And, no, I’m not talking about Donald Trump, I’m talking about Mayor Bloomberg.”

“Democrats take a huge risk if we just substitute one arrogant billionaire for another,” she added.

Mr. Bloomberg has been accused over the years of many sexist and misogynistic comments, and several lawsuits have been filed alleging that women were discriminated against at his media company.

Remarks about women

He did not respond to Ms. Warren’s comments about his alleged remarks about women, taken from a booklet given to him in 1990 that was said to be a compilation of his sayings over the years. A campaign spokesman has said Mr. Bloomberg “simply did not say the things somebody wrote in this gag gift”.

Mr. Bloomberg, who entered the race in November and is skipping the first four early voting states in February to focus on later nominating contests in March, has risen to No. 2 among Democrats behind Mr. Sanders, according to a Reuters/Ipsos national poll released on Tuesday. Mr. Bloomberg said at the debate that he was using his money for an important cause. “I’m spending that money to get rid of Donald Trump, the worst president we’ve ever had. And if I can get that done, it will be a great contribution to America and to my kids.”

Mr. Trump was happy to inject himself into the debate pile-on of Mr. Bloomberg, telling supporters at a rally in Phoenix: “I hear he's getting pounded tonight.”

The debate came at a pivotal time, three days before Nevada’s presidential caucuses, the third contest in the state-by-state race to find a challenger to Mr. Trump in the November 3 election.

High stakes

The high stakes were evident in the intensity of the exchanges, with Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren, in particular, facing the do-or-die task of reigniting their campaigns after poor showings in Iowa and New Hampshire earlier this month.

Both Ms. Warren and Mr. Biden, the former Vice-President and one-time front-runner who lost ground to Mr. Sanders and Mr. Bloomberg in recent weeks, criticised Mr. Bloomberg for his treatment of women, and asked him to commit to releasing women who had signed non-disclosure agreements to settle lawsuits.

Mr. Bloomberg refused, saying they were made “consensually” with the expectation they would stay private.

“We are not going to beat Donald Trump with a man who has who knows how many non-disclosure agreements, and the drip, drip, drip of stories of women saying they have been harassed and discriminated against,” said Ms. Warren, who had her most aggressive debate.

Mr. Bloomberg said there were “very few” non-disclosure agreements. “None of them accuse me of anything,” he said. ”Maybe they didn't like the jokes I told.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/g71g9z/article30873413.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20THRDDEMOCRATS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/michael-bloomberg-comes-under-attack-at-democratic-debate/article30873414.ece
18,2020/02/20,"‘Historic’ pact with U.S. will be signed soon, says Taliban","Deputy leader says insurgents are ‘fully committed’ to deal.

The Taliban’s deputy leader said the group would soon sign a agreement with the U.S. to reduce violence for seven days, adding that militant commanders were “fully committed” to observing the “historic” accord.

“That we today stand at the threshold of a peace agreement with the United States is no small milestone,” Sirajuddin Haqqani wrote in an opinion piece in the New York Times, in the first significant public statement by a Taliban leader on the accord for a week-long reduction in violence.

The agreement in principle, which was struck during negotiations between U.S. and Taliban representatives in Qatar, could lead to a withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan.

“Achieving the potential of the agreement, ensuring its success and earning lasting peace will depend on an equally scrupulous observance by the United States of each of its commitments,” wrote Haqqani.

Clashes between Afghan forces and the Taliban have continued, but Afghanistan’s Interior Minister said a deal to cut violence would be enforced within five days.

Sirajuddin Haqqani also addressed fears about Afghanistan becoming once again a springboard for Islamist militants, calling such concerns “inflated.”

Writing about how women's rights in Afghanistan would look if foreign forces left, Sirajuddin Haqqani envisioned an “Islamic system” in which “the rights of women that are granted by Islam from the right to education to the right to work are protected.”

The Taliban banned women from education and work and only let them leave their homes in the company of a male relative. Overnight, women disappeared behind the all-enveloping burqa, their activities restricted to their homes.

Sirajuddin Haqqani stressed in the piece the need for a complete withdrawal of foreign forces. Officials in Afghanistan and the United States have said a certain number of troops would remain in the country to ensure stability.

19,2020/02/20,19 children died in Yemen air strikes: United Nations,"UNICEF said that it was an attack on a civilian-populated area where children were in the vicinity.

Nineteen children were among at least 31 civilians killed in air strikes on rebel-held northern Yemen last week, the United Nations said on Thursday.

“UNICEF is sad to confirm that the recent attack in Al-Jawf, north of Yemen, on February 15, took the lives of 19 children (eight boys and 11 girls) and injured another 18 (nine boys and another nine girls),” the UN children’s agency said in a statement.

“It was an attack on a civilian populated area where children were in the vicinity,” UNICEF regional communications chief Juliette Touma said.

Saturday’s air strikes came after the Iran-aligned rebels claimed to have shot down an aircraft of the Saudi-led coalition supporting the government.

The rebels reported multiple coalition air strikes where the plane went down, while the coalition conceded the “possibility of collateral damage” during a “search and rescue operation” at the site of the jet crash, which left the fate of its crew uncertain.

UNICEF urged the warring sides to put an end to the conflict, adding that the “worrying escalation of violence over the past few weeks is a harsh reminder that children in Yemen continue to carry the heaviest burden of the conflict”.

The Saudi-led coalition intervened in the war in 2015, shortly after the rebels seized control of the capital Sanaa.

Since then, tens of thousands of people – mostly civilians – have been killed and many more displaced in what the UN has called the worst humanitarian crisis.

The coalition has been widely criticised for the high civilian death toll from its bombing campaign, which has prompted some Western governments to cut arms deliveries to the countries taking part.

20,2020/02/20,Turkey unhappy with talks with Russia on Syria offensive,"The diplomat, Mevlut Cavusoglu, said Russian and Turkish delegations would hold further talks on how to reduce tensions in Syria’s Idlib province.

Turkey’s Foreign Minister said on Thursday that Turkey and Russia have inched closer toward each other’s positions during talks in Moscow this week on restoring calm in northwestern Syria, but that their discussions have not produced the results yet that Ankara desires.

The diplomat, Mevlut Cavusoglu, said Russian and Turkish delegations would hold further talks on how to reduce tensions in Syria’s Idlib province and that the Turkish and Russian leaders could meet too, if necessary.

“It is true that at the moment, there are differences in the (two sides’) positions,” Mr. Cavusoglu told state television TRT. The delegations narrowed their differences a bit but “are not yet at the point we want” to be at, he added.

Mr. Cavusoglu’s comments came a day after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned of an imminent military operation to force the Syrian government forces to retreat. “We could enter (Idlib) suddenly one night,” Mr. Erdogan told legislators on Wednesday.

The Syrian government forces have, for weeks, been conducting a crushing military campaign to recapture parts of the last rebel-held areas in Idlib province as well as the countryside of neighbouring Aleppo province. The swift advances have triggered the largest single wave of displacement in the nine-year civil war, with nearly 1 million people driven from their homes toward the Turkish border.

The advance has strained cooperation between Moscow and Ankara — which have been working together despite supporting opposing sides in the Syria conflict — and led to direct clashes between Syrian and Turkish troops. Turkey and Russia have closely coordinated their moves in recent years in Idlib province. A truce reached between the two countries collapsed in late 2019, leading to the current Syrian offensive, backed by Russia.

Russian officials have said they hold Turkey responsible for the collapse of the cease-fire deal struck in Sochi, Russia, saying Ankara had not held up its end of the deal to rein in militants in Syria who continued attacking Syrian and Russian targets.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/article19504361.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CAVUSOGLU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/turkey-unhappy-with-talks-with-russia-on-syria-offensive/article30873131.ece
21,2020/02/20,COVID-19: China once again changes how new cases are counted in Hubei province,"There should be a consistent way of measuring and reporting cases, say epidemiologists.

On February 12, the number of new COVID-19 cases reported from mainland China witnessed the biggest increase for a given day when 15,152 people were diagnosed with the disease. There was also a spike in the number of deaths reported in a single day — 254. In Hubei province alone the increase in the number of cases was 14,840 and deaths shot up to 242.

The reason for the sharp increase in the number of cases and deaths was because, in Hubei province, officials stopped using molecular diagnostic tests to confirm COVID-19 disease and instead began counting patients based on clinical diagnosis.

‘Seeking clarity’

“We are seeking further clarity on how clinical diagnoses are being made to ensure other respiratory illnesses including influenza are not getting mixed into the COVID-19 data,” World Health Organisation (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a daily coronavirus media briefing in Geneva on February 14.

Also Read Envoy Sun Weidong says China will win battle against coronavirus

On February 20, the National Health Commission once again changed the criteria used for confirming COVID-19 cases. In Hubei province, which is the epicentre of the outbreak, clinical methods used for confirming cases will cease to exist and instead cases would be counted only when confirmed using molecular diagnostic tests. All clinically confirmed cases will now be classified under suspected cases and will be labelled as confirmed cases only if molecular testing carried out tests positive.

Explained | Also Read Explained | When can people transmit the novel coronavirus?

Based on the new case definition, on February 20, China reported 394 new cases and 114 deaths from 31 provinces the previous day. The Hubei province alone reported just 349 cases and 108 death. With this, the total number of cases went up to 74,576 and deaths to 2,118.

Prior to the new case definition being applied, the number of new cases reported on February 19 was 1,749 from 31 provinces and 1,693 cases in Hubei province alone.

False negative results

Molecular test to confirm SARS-CoV-2 positive case has proven to be a challenge as the test does not have high sensitivity and hence returns many false negative cases. Even when people exhibit overt symptoms, the molecular test has in several cases come out negative. It takes at least two days to process the results of the test.

“For an epidemiologist, it’s really frustrating when case definitions keep on changing,” Benjamin Cowling, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Hong Kong told The New York Times. “Why can’t they work out what’s a probable, suspected and confirmed case? It’s totally confusing.”

“To know whether the number of cases is going down or increasing during the outbreak, there should be a consistent way of measuring and reporting cases,” said Dr. Manoj V. Murhekar, Director of the Chennai-based National Institute of Epidemiology (NIE). “Whether the epidemic is coming under control or increasing cannot be assessed unless we know how many are being tested each day.”

Information unavailable

China has so far not shared important information that might help scientists to better understand the progression of the epidemic. For instance, it releases the number of new cases each day but not when the patients became ill. Without knowing the date of symptoms onset, it becomes difficult to tell if the epidemic is growing or slowing down. It also does not reveal the age of newly diagnosed patients and those who are severely affected, nor the number of positives among the total tested.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pvxtik/article30871990.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20IN-COVID,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/covid-19-china-once-again-changes-how-new-cases-are-counted-in-hubei-province/article30871883.ece
22,2020/02/20,Google updates terms in plain language after EU scrutiny,"The company updated its terms of service on Thursday — its largest update to the general use contract since 2012 — in response to a pair of court orders in Europe

Google is attempting to make sure people know exactly what they’re signing up for when they use its online services - though that will still mean reading a lengthy document.

The company updated its terms of service on Thursday — its largest update to the general use contract since 2012 — in response to a pair of court orders in Europe.

Google has been updating its policies and tweaking what is and isn’t allowed on its sites for the past couple of years as scrutiny of the tech industry heats up across the U.S. and Europe. Google, Facebook, Twitter and other digital companies have been forced under a spotlight as regulators and customers examine just how much the companies know about their users and what they do with that information.

Facebook last year updated its terms of service to clarify how it makes money from user data.

Google says it hasn’t changed anything significant in the document, but rather used plain language to describe who can use its products and what you can post online.

“Broadly speaking, we give you permission to use our services if you agree to follow these terms, which reflect how Google’s business works and how we earn money,” the document reads.

The document is now about 2,000 words longer than it was before, in part because Google included a list of definitions and expanded it to cover Google Drive and Chrome. The new terms take effect in March.

Google’s privacy policy is separate and was substantially updated in 2018 after Europe enacted broad-reaching privacy laws.

The company also separately updated its “About Google” page to explain how it makes money from selling advertisements, often informed by the vast amount of customer information it collects.

As Britain prepares to leave the European Union, Google also announced it is switching the service provider for U.K. customers from one based in Ireland to its main U.S. provider. The company says that it won’t change how U.K. customers’ data is protected or used.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/npswqg/article30857833.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19NETGOOGLEADSENSE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/google-updates-terms-in-plain-language-after-eu-scrutiny/article30870528.ece
23,2020/02/20,COVID-19: South Korea reports 1st virus death as 2.5 million urged to stay home,"So far South Korea has reported a total of 82 cases of COVID-19

Yonhap news agency says South Korea has reported its first death from a new coronavirus. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did not immediately provide details.

The report came as South Korea is struggling to cope with the outbreak and its economic fallout. Earlier on Thursday, South Korea said it has confirmed a total of 82 cases of the virus.

Earlier the day, the mayor of the South Korean city of Daegu urged its 2.5 million people on Thursday to refrain from going outside as cases of a new virus, linked to a church congregation, spiked and he pleaded for help from the central government. Mayor Kwon Young-jin made the appeal in a nationally televised news conference after the southeastern city and its nearby towns reported 35 additional cases of infection with the new coronavirus on Thursday.

""National quarantine efforts that are currently focused on blocking the inflow of the virus (from China) and stemming its spread are inadequate for preventing the illness from circulating in local communities,” Mr. Kwon said.

The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 28 of those 35 new patients went to church services attended by a previously confirmed virus patient or contacted her at other places inside a Daegu church. That patient is a South Korean woman in her early 60s who has no recent record of overseas travel, according to center officials. She tested positive for the virus on Tuesday, becoming the 31st case in South Korea. On Wednesday morning, Daegu confirmed 13 cases and 11 of them either went to the same church with the woman patient or contacted her at a hospital, according to the disease control center.

""We are seeing infections in some areas like Seoul and Daegu where it’s difficult to confirm the cause or routes of the infections,” Kim Gang-lip, South Korea’s Vice Health Minister, said in a briefing.

""Our judgment is that (COVID-19) which has been introduced from abroad is beginning to spread through community transmissions in limited ranges,” he said, adding that the government would need to change its quarantine strategy that has been focused on tracing contacts.

South Korea has reported a total of 82 cases of COVID-19, a disease first detected in Wuhan, China, in December.

In a telephone conversation with Kwon later Thursday, President Moon Jae-in said the central government will make all available assistance to help Daegu fight against the virus’ further spread, according to the presidential Blue House.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/za44nr/article30869574.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AP2202020000031A,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/covid-19-south-korea-reports-1st-virus-death-as-25-million-urged-to-stay-home/article30869575.ece
24,2020/02/20,"Prince Harry, Meghan Markle fix March 31 for royal exit","Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have announced that they will formally exit as Britain’s frontline royals on March 31 following discussions with Buckingham Palace on formalising their new financially independent roles.

Mr. Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, will no longer have an office at Buckingham Palace in London as they stop carrying out formal royal duties for Queen Elizabeth II from April 1, with the formal arrangements of the split to be assessed after 12 months.

“The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will formally step down as senior royals from March 31,” a spokesperson for the couple said on Wednesday.

Mr. Harry (35) will retain his military ranks of Major, Lieutenant Commander and Squadron Leader and will not use his honorary military positions or perform any official duties associated with these roles.

The couple will retain their His and Her Royal Highness (HRH) titles but would not be permitted to use them. The use of the word “Royal” as part of their Sussex Royal brand is reportedly still under discussion with palace officials.

The spokesperson for the couple, who are expected to settle down in Canada and spend some time in the UK “regularly”, said that they will unveil further details of their non-profit charitable foundation later in the year.

Meanwhile, the duo will be back in the UK in the next few weeks to complete around six formal engagements, including Mr. Harry’s attendance at an Invictus Games event with singer Jon Bon Jovi.

Ms. Markle (38) is set to attend an International Women’s Day event in early March, with the couple joining other senior royals for a Commonwealth Day Service at Westminster Abbey on March 9.

Last month, in a royal family first, the couple had signed up to a formal exit deal, which saw them give up their UK taxpayer funding.

The deal, which now comes into effect from April 1, means the couple will no longer be representing the Queen in an official capacity.

Queen Elizabeth II said the agreement followed months of discussions and was a “constructive and supportive” way forward for her grandson and his family after Harry and Meghan had announced plans to step back as senior royals.

“Harry, Meghan and Archie will always be much loved members of my family,” the 93-year-old monarch’s personal statement read at the time.

“I recognise the challenges they have experienced as a result of intense scrutiny over the last two years and support their wish for a more independent life,” she said, as she thanked the couple for their work for the UK and across the Commonwealth.

25,2020/02/20,COVID-19: Japanese data on cruise ship infections backs quarantine strategy,"Japan has been criticised for its handling of the quarantine, as more than 620 people on board have been infected with the virus and two elderly passengers have died

Newly released data from a Japanese research institute appears to back the government's case that its quarantine strategy for the Diamond Princess cruise ship was successful in stemming contagion of COVID-19 among passengers.

Japan has been criticised for its handling of the quarantine, as more than 620 people on board have been infected with the virus and two elderly passengers have died.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has said the quarantine may not have been sufficient.

But a report released on Wednesday by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) showed that the onset of symptoms from confirmed cases of COVID-19 peaked on Feb. 7 before tailing off to zero by Feb. 15.

Cases among crew were observed to steadily increase, peaking on Feb. 13.

“The decline in the number of confirmed cases, based on reported onset dates, implies that the quarantine intervention was effective in reducing transmission among passengers,” according to the report. Later transmission “appears to have occurred mostly among crew or within passenger cabins.”

The NIID is Japan's top research institute of infectious diseases.

More than 620 passengers have been infected on the ship, which has been quarantined since Feb. 3, initially with about 3,700 people on board. The health ministry announced on Thursday that two passengers in their 80s had died, the first fatalities from the ship.

The NIID report was “very reassuring,” said Kentaro Iwata, an infectious disease specialist from Kobe University Hospital who had been one of the harshest critics of the quarantine. After visiting the ship, Iwata had posted YouTube videos decrying the infection controls he saw.

The videos got over a million views before Mr. Iwata took them down, saying at a press briefing on Thursday that the new data and reports of improved controls on the ship convinced him that the government had responded to his criticism.

The United States, Canada and other nations evacuated their citizens ahead of the Feb. 19 end of the quarantine. Remaining passengers have been released in batches and advised by health authorities to stay at home and monitor their condition.

The health ministry will provide assistance to those returning passengers, as there is still a risk they could develop symptoms, said Koji Wada, a professor at the International University of Health and Welfare in Tokyo.

“We can say the quarantine has been done as we planned,” said Mr. Wada, who has worked as an advisor on site at the Diamond Princess. “I'm not sure if I can say it's a success.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/y5motw/article30868543.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/JAPANOUTBREAKSHIP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/covid-19-japanese-data-on-diamond-princess-infections-backs-quarantine-strategy/article30868544.ece
26,2020/02/20,COVID-19: Two elderly passengers taken off cruise ship die in Japan,"Japan’s government has been questioned over its decision to keep people on the ship, which some experts have called a perfect virus incubator

Two elderly passengers taken off the Diamond Princess cruise ship because they were infected with a new virus have died, Japan’s Health Ministry said Thursday, becoming the first fatalities from the virus-stricken vessel.

Japan now has three deaths linked to the COVID-19 disease.

Japan’s NHK public television said both were Japanese in their 80s. A Health Ministry official only confirmed that they had been previously hospitalised for serious health condition and had existing chronic diseases. The official spoke anonymously, citing office protocol.

The coronavirus outbreak began in China late last year and has infected tens of thousands of people, mostly in central China’s Hubei province. The 621 cases confirmed among the Diamond Princess’s original 3,711 people on board are the most anywhere outside China. In all, Japan has more than 700 confirmed cases, including the country’s first death unrelated to the ship.

The Diamond Princess, docked in Yokohama port near Tokyo, started letting passengers who tested negative for the virus off the ship Wednesday, when the government-set 14-day quarantine ended. On Thursday, hundreds of other passengers were also expected to leave in a massive disembarkation process expected to last through Friday. Test results are still pending for some people on board.

Japan’s government has been questioned over its decision to keep people on the ship, which some experts have called a perfect virus incubator. Some medical experts who observed the quarantine process on board also raised caution over lax protective measures on the ship.

Kentaro Iwata, an infectious diseases expert at Kobe University Hospital who got on the ship as part of a medical relief team earlier this week, said in a YouTube video that he was alarmed by the lack of control measures, including distinction between clean and contaminated zones, and the inadequate use of protective gear. He called it “chaotic” and said it made him scared of getting infected himself.

Iwata, currently in self-imposed quarantine at a hotel, blamed poor management in a video conference Thursday.

Iwata also said Japan should follow the example of the U.S. and other countries requiring an additional two-week quarantine for passengers they brought home from the ship.

About 440 passengers had left the ship by Wednesday evening, and Japanese officials said more than 1,000 others will be gone by Friday. The Diamond Princess was quarantined after one passenger who left the ship earlier in Hong Kong was found to have the virus.

Crew members, who couldn’t be confined to their rooms because they were working and causing secondary infections, are expected to stay on the ship. In a preliminary report issued Wednesday, the National Institute of Infectious Diseases said that the substantial transmission of the virus occurred before the February 5 implementation of the quarantine, and that a downtrend in the number of confirmed cases based on reported onset dates indicated secondary transmission among passengers was effectively reduced during the process.

Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said a more controlled health watch for the crew would start as the passengers get off because they can isolate themselves by spreading out and using vacated passenger rooms.

Before the quarantine on the ship had ended, the United States evacuated more than 300 Americans and put them in quarantine in the U.S. for another 14 days. South Korea, Australia and Hong Kong evacuated their residents for quarantines as well, and Canada and Italy sent flights for their citizens as well.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/tmvkbh/article30868404.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/JAPANSHIP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/covid-19-two-elderly-passengers-taken-off-cruise-ship-die-in-japan/article30868406.ece

A gunman suspected of shooting at least nine people dead at two shisha bars in Germany was found dead at his home. Officers also found another body at the same address, police said.

Police gave no details of the suspected gunman but said “there are currently no indications of further perpetrators.” They did not give details of his possible motive or how he died, or specify why they believe “with a high degree of probability” that he was the assailant.

The number of dead in the shootings Wednesday evening rose to nine, a police statement said.

Officers sealed off and searched the apartment in Hanau’s Kesselstadt district, near the scene of one of the shootings, after following up witness statements on a getaway car. Police said work to confirm the identities of the two bodies at the home was still underway, and they couldn’t immediately give details either on them or the identities of the victims of the earlier shootings.

Earlier on Thursday, police said that eight people were killed and around five wounded. They said a dark vehicle was seen leaving the location of the first attack and another shooting was reported at a scene about 2.5 km (1.5 miles) away.

Police officers swarmed central Hanau, cordoning off the area of one of the shootings as a helicopter hovered overhead. A car covered in thermal foil also could be seen, with shattered glass next to it. Forensic experts collected evidence.

“This was a terrible evening that will certainly occupy us for a long, long time and we will remember with sadness,” Hanau Mayor Claus Kaminsky told the Bild newspaper.

28,2020/02/20,India ‘bigger problem’ than China on reducing carbon emissions: Michael Bloomberg,"Democratic presidential aspirant Bloomberg said that nobody is doing anything about India’s carbon emissions.

India poses a bigger problem than China when it comes to fighting climate change, particularly on reducing carbon emissions, Democratic presidential aspirant and former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg has said.

During his maiden appearance on a Democratic presidential primary debate in Las Vegas on Wednesday, Mr. Bloomberg said it was “ridiculous” of the Trump administration to take the U.S. out of the 2015 Paris climate agreement, as he outlined his approach to tackling climate change.

“In all fairness, the Chinese have slowed down. It is India that is an even bigger problem, but it is an enormous problem. Nobody is doing anything about it,” Mr. Bloomberg said in response to a question on climate change.

He was asked about his business which is heavily invested in China, the number one producer of carbon emissions in the world, and how far would he go to force Beijing to reduce those emissions and tackle the climate crisis.

“You’re not going to go to war with them. You have to negotiate with them and we have seen how well that works with tariffs that are hurting us. What you have to do is convince the Chinese that it is in their interest as well, their people are going to die just as our people are going to die and we will work together,” Mr. Bloomberg said in his response.

The billionaire and philanthropist, who announced his presidential run only this year, asserted that the U.S. was making a difference.

“We are closing the coal-fired power plants. If we and for some of the rules on fracking so that they don’t release methane into the air and into the water you will make a big difference but we are not going to get rid of fracking for a while and we frac incidentally not just natural gas, you frac oil as well,” he said.

The United States has already closed 304 out of the 530 coal fired power plants and 80 of them have been closed in Europe, he said.

“Let’s start at the beginning. If you’re President, the first thing you do the first day is you rejoin the Paris agreement. This is just ridiculous for us to drop out,” Mr. Bloomberg said, adding that America’s responsibility is to be the leader in the world.

“And, if we don’t, we are going to be the ones that get hurt just as much as anybody else and that’s why I don’t want to have us cut off all relationships with China because you will never solve this problem without China and India, western Europe and America,” he said.

Former Vice President Joe Biden accused China of spreading pollution across the world.

“The idea of China and their Belt and Road proposal is they are taking the dirtiest coal in the world mostly out of Mongolia and spreading it around the world,” he said.

“It is clear they make it clear when you call them to Washington in the first 100 days if you continue you will suffer severe consequences because the rest of the world will impose terror of sand on everything you are selling because you are undercutting the entire economy,” Mr. Biden said.

In June 2107, U.S. President Donald Trump today declared that the U.S. will withdraw from the Paris climate accord, saying the “draconian” deal unfairly punished America but benefited countries like India and China.

“It is time to exit the Paris Accord and time to pursue a new deal that protects the environment, our companies, our citizens, and our country,” Mr. Trump had said, dampening global efforts to curb global warming.

“India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions and billions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries. There are many other examples. But the bottom line is that the Paris accord is very unfair, at the highest level, to the United States,” Mr. Trump said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/qmcmdf/article30867781.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THNAKUSA-ELECTIONBLOOMBERG-TAX,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/india-bigger-problem-than-china-on-reducing-carbon-emissions-michael-bloomberg/article30867782.ece
29,2020/02/20,‘We are running against a billionaire': Democrats attack Bloomberg in U.S. presidential debate,"The top six candidates competing for the Democratic nomination to take on U.S. President Donald Trump in November elections participated in the ninth presidential debate

The top six candidates competing for the Democratic nomination to take on U.S. President Donald Trump in November participated in the ninth presidential debate on Wednesday, with one quickly becoming the focus: Michael Bloomberg.

Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York mayor making his first debate appearance in the race, faced criticism from all his rivals on the stage in Las Vegas:

Elizabeth Warren

“Were running against a billionaire who calls women fat broads and horse-faced lesbians. And no, I’m not talking about Donald Trump, I’m talking about Mayor Bloomberg. Democrats are not going to win if we have a nominee who has a history of hiding his tax returns, of harassing women and of supporting racist policies like redlining and stop-and-frisk,” said Elizabeth Warren.

Warren, a senator from Massachusetts, also criticised Bloomberg for reports that his namesake media company mistreated women employees. She called on him to release women who sued his company from non-disclosure agreements.

“I hope you heard what his defense was: I've been nice to some women. That just doesn't cut it. The mayor has to stand on his record and what we need to know is what's lurking out there,” said Warren.

“This is not just a question of the mayor's character. This is also a question about electability. We are not going to beat Donald Trump with a man who has who knows how many non-disclosure agreements and the drip, drip, drip of stories of women saying they have been harassed and discriminated against,” she added.

Pete Buttigieg

The former South Bend, Indiana, mayor went after both Bloomberg and U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders.

“Most Americans don’t see where they fit if they have to choose between a socialist who thinks money is the root of all evil and a billionaire who thinks that money ought to be the root of all power. Let's put forward somebody who actually lives and works in the middle class neighbourhood in an industrial Midwestern city. Let's put forward somebody who's actually a Democrat,” said Pete Buttigieg.

“We shouldn’t have to choose between one candidate who wants to burn this party down and another candidate who wants to buy this party out. We can do better,” he added.

Joe Biden

The former vice president assailed Bloomberg over the stop-and-frisk policing policy in New York City that was criticised for ensnaring disproportionate numbers of blacks and Latinos.

“The fact of the matter is he has not managed his city very well when he was there. He didn't get a whole lot done. He had stop-and-frisk — throwing close to 5 million young black men up against the wall — and when we came along in our administration, President Obama and I said we're going to send a mediator to stop it, he said that's unnecessary,” said Joe Biden.

Biden said that the Obama administration worked to put an end to the policy.

“Let's get the facts straight. Let's get the order straight. It's not whether you apologise or not, it's the policy. The policy was abhorrent. And it was in fact a violation of every right people have,” he said.

Amy Klobuchar

“I actually welcomed Mayor Bloomberg to the stage. I thought that he shouldn't be hiding behind his TV ads, and so I was all ready for this big day,” said Amy Klobuchar.

The Minnesota senator then responded to a Bloomberg campaign memo that said the other moderates should drop out to let him fight the liberal Sanders.

“I have been told as a woman, as someone that maybe no one thought was still going to be standing up on this stage, but I am because of pure grit ... I've been told many times to wait my turn and to step aside, and I’m not going to do that now ... I think we need something different than Donald Trump. I don't think you look at Donald Trump and say we need someone richer in the White House,” she said.

Bernie Sanders

“We are giving a voice to people who would say we are sick and tired of billionaires, like Mr. Bloomberg, seeing huge expansions of their wealth, while a half a million people sleep out on the street tonight ... Maybe it's time for the working class in this country to get a little bit of power in Washington, rather than your billionaire campaign,” said Bernie Sanders.

Sanders added later: “Maybe we can talk about a billionaire saying that we should not raise the minimum wage, or that we should cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. If that's a way to beat Donald Trump, wow, I would be very surprised.”

Micheal Bloomberg

“I’m a philanthropist who didn’t inherit his money, but made his money. I’m spending that money to get rid of Donald Trump, the worst president we’ve ever had. And if I can get that done, it will be a great contribution to America and to my kids,” said Micheal Bloomberg.

Bloomberg said he had not mistreated women employees but defended his decision not to release those he settled with from non-disclosure agreements, saying they were made “consensually.”

“We have a very few non-disclosure agreements. None of them accuse me of anything ... maybe they didn't like the jokes I told,” he said.

Bloomberg criticised his opponents, particularly Sanders, for advocating higher taxes on corporations and forcing unions onto boards.

“I cant think of a better way that would make it easier for Donald Trump to get re-elected than listening to this conversation. We’re not gonna throw out capitalism. We tried that, other countries tried that, it was called communism and it just didn’t work,” he said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/22kdvr/article30867589.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ELECTION2020DEBATETHNAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/we-are-running-against-a-billionaire-democrats-attack-bloomberg-in-us-presidential-debate/article30867591.ece
30,2020/02/20,Australia to hold wide-ranging enquiry into disastrous bushfires,"Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said a six-month Royal Commission would investigate preparedness for future bushfires

Australia will hold a wide-ranging enquiry into the causes of recent bushfires that killed 33 people and razed an area the size of South Korea, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Thursday.

Australia has for months been battling hundreds of blazes that began in September - an unusually prolonged summer wildfire season that was fuelled by three years of drought, which experts have attributed to climate change.

Also read: State of emergency declared as bushfire threatens Australian capital

With firefighters now able to contain the several dozen fires still alight, Mr. Morrison said a six-month Royal Commission would investigate preparedness for future bushfires and the need for any changes to the law to clarify who is responsible for overseeing emergency authorities.

“This Royal Commission is looking at the practical things that must be done to keep Australians safe and safer for longer in hot dry summers - conditions in which Australians will live into the future,” Mr. Morrison told reporters in Sydney.

Mr. Morrison has stoked public anger by refusing to directly link the bushfires to climate change, insisting removing flammable vegetation is “just as important, if not more”.

His management of the fires was already under the microscope after he was forced into a rare public apology for taking a holiday to Hawaii in November.

Mr. Morrison in January deployed 6,500 military reservists to support state authorities - which he said created a “constitutional grey zone”.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/8ehsaj/article30535814.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11TH-FIRE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/australia-to-hold-wide-ranging-enquiry-into-disastrous-bushfires/article30867296.ece
31,2020/02/20,Brazilian Senator shot amid tumult of striking police force,"Gomes attempted to ram the backhoe through the barricade and was hit by two bullets

A Brazilian senator was shot Wednesday as he tried to intervene in a strike by military police demanding higher salaries in the northeastern state of Ceara.

Sen. Cid Gomes, a former governor of the state, received a shot in the chest and was taken to a nearby hospital. A statement from the hospital released in the evening said the senator was in stable condition and breathing without medical help.

A video circulating on television showed Gomes trying to drive a backhoe through a barricade of balaclava-clad police officers and the vehicle’s windows being shot out. It wasn’t immediately clear where the gunfire came from.

Shortly before heading to the protest, Gomes had posted a video on Twitter sharing his anger and calling for people to help him end the strike.

At the protest, Gomes was seen with a bullhorn. “You have five minutes to leave. Not one more,” he warned from behind the metal barricade that separated his group from the masked officers.

One man standing amid the protesters could be heard yelling at him - “You don’t have the authority to do this!” before a brief physical altercation.

Minutes later, Gomes attempted to ram the backhoe through the barricade and was hit by two bullets.

Acts of vandalism

An unknown number of officers began a strike Tuesday, dissatisfied with the negotiations with the state to raise their pay. In Brazil, the military police are in charge of patrolling the streets, among other duties, and it is illegal for them to strike.

Throughout the day, small acts of vandalism have occurred across the state. Masked men invaded several police barracks, smashing police window-shields and puncturing tires. In one instance, men drove off with patrol cars and parked them in line blocking nearby streets.

In the city of Sobral, where the 56-year-old former governor was injured, men wearing balaclavas on-board police vehicles forced businesses to shut their doors for the day, online news portal G1 reported.

The Public Security Secretary said in a press conference around mid-day, hours before Sen. Gomes was shot, that authorities would not tolerate the illegal strike. Some 260 officers were already under investigation, and that any striking policeman would be banned from receiving its salary and possibly fired.

Gov. Camilo Santana on Wednesday asked the Justice and Public Ministry to deploy federal forces to help maintain order. The ministry said that it was monitoring the situation and that federal police and federal highway police had been sent to Sobral to ensure the security of Gomes.

In 2017, hundreds of police went on strike in Brazil’s Espirito Santo state and were indicted. The standoff produced a wave of violence, looting and burning of buses. Schools were closed, and medical services and public transportation interrupted. To stem the tumult, the federal government deployed more than 3,000 troops from the military and the national guard.

In 2011, during the last Ceara police protests, many were also arrested. “If they show their faces, they’re fired or arrested,” said Manuela Barroso, a spokesperson for a military police association. ""Today the situation is different,” Barroso said, voicing fears that the strike could lead to looting and clashes in an already violent state. “Back then, the city was not as dangerous as it is today.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/dihzrr/article30867233.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/0001P48UK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/brazilian-senator-shot-amid-tumult-of-striking-police-force/article30867234.ece
32,2020/02/20,Donald Trump names supporter Richard Grenell to top intelligence post,"U.S. ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell has been adamantly loyal to President Donald Trump at a time when the Republican President remains skeptical about the intelligence community.

President Donald Trump on Wednesday named U.S. ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell, a strong supporter of his policies, to be acting director of national intelligence.

“Rick has represented our Country exceedingly well and I look forward to working with him,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter.

He also thanked Joseph Maguire “for the wonderful job he has done” as acting director of national intelligence since August.

Mr. Grenell, who has a reputation for sometimes being abrasive, has been adamantly loyal to Mr. Trump at a time when the Republican President remains skeptical about the intelligence community.

Mr. Trump had a strained relationship with Dan Coats, who stepped down as director of national intelligence in August. Mr. Coats endorsed the U.S. intelligence community's assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election with the objective of promoting Mr. Trump over his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton.

Mr. Trump also has objected to U.S. intelligence community analyses of major issues — from Iran's nuclear program to North Korea — that have clashed with his own assessments.

Mr. Grenell, who is openly gay, advised several prominent Republicans before serving as the U.S. spokesman at the United Nations under the administration of George W. Bush.

He has been a lightning rod for controversy since his arrival in Germany in 2018, with an unorthodox style of diplomacy that surprised many German lawmakers and government officials.

One German lawmaker told Reuters this month that Mr. Grenell was less concerned about building closer ties with Germany than trying to please Mr. Trump.

His actions have an audience of one: the U.S. president, the lawmaker said.

In 2018, Germany asked the U.S. government to clarify remarks by Mr. Grenell after he told a right-wing website he wanted to empower other conservatives in Europe.

In August Mr. Grenell told Germany's dpa news agency that Germany's reluctance to spend more on defense and its continued reliance on U.S. troops for protection was “offensive.”

The post of director of national intelligence, which was created after the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States, oversees the 17 U.S. civilian and military intelligence agencies including the CIA.

Mr. Grenell's appointment as an acting director, unlike a choice for a permanent director, does not need confirmation by the Senate.

Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Mr. Trump's move was apparently “an effort to sidestep the Senates constitutional authority to advise and consent on such critical national security positions.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pcdj74/article30866905.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SERBIAUSTHNAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/donald-trump-names-supporter-richard-grenell-to-top-intelligence-post/article30866906.ece

The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 2,112 on Thursday after 108 more people died in Hubei province, the hard-hit epicentre of the outbreak.

Most of the deaths were in the provincial capital Wuhan, where the virus first emerged in December, according to the daily update from the Hubei health commission.

More than 74,500 people have now been infected with the new coronavirus nationwide.

Hubei health officials said there had been 615 new cases in Wuhan and 13 more elsewhere in the province.

However, the Hubei health commission said it was reducing the number of previously reported cases in a number of cities in the province by 279.

The adjustment meant a net increase on Thursday of 349 new cases across the province.

Even without the adjustment, the number of new cases was sharply lower than the daily updates of recent weeks. On Wednesday, there were 1,693 new cases reported in the province.

34,2020/02/20,"Shooter kills nine in German bar, cafe","Officials see ‘xenophobic’ motive.

A shooter with suspected far-right beliefs killed nine people at a shisha bar and a cafe in the German city of Hanau, the police said on Thursday, before apparently killing himself and his mother. Federal counter-terror prosecutors said they were investigating the case, which showed “signs of a xenophobic motive”.

The gunman was identified as 43-year-old German Tobias R. Around 10 p.m. on Wednesday, he rang the doorbell at the shisha bar and shot at people in the smoking section, killing five, mass-market daily Bild said.

He then fled by car before opening fire at the Arena Bar & Cafe, killing three people outside. One of the injured persons died later.

The gunman left behind online material that suggested a terror attack motivated by “a hostile attitude to foreigners”, said Peter Beuth, the Interior Minister of the state of Hesse.

Among the dead were “several victims of Kurdish origin”, the Kon-Med association of Kurds in Germany said in a statement, adding that it was “furious” that authorities were not doing more to combat rightwing extremism.

Alarm has been growing about an increasingly emboldened far-right movement in Germany, following a deadly anti-Semitic attack in Halle and the murder of a pro-migrant politician last year.

35,2020/02/20,Trump ousts top defense official who certified Ukraine aid,"John Rood resigned on Wednesday, saying he was leaving at Mr. Trump’s request.

President Donald Trump has ousted the Pentagon’s top policy official who had certified last year that Ukraine had made enough anti-corruption progress to justify the Trump administration’s release of congressionally authorised aid to Kyiv in its conflict against Russian-backed separatists.

John Rood resigned on Wednesday, saying he was leaving at Mr. Trump’s request.

The Trump administration’s delay in releasing the aid to Ukraine was central to the president’s impeachment by the House on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.

The Senate voted to acquit the president. But in the wake of the Senate trial, an emboldened Mr. Trump has gone after officials he has perceived as being disloyal.

Mr. Rood is the latest official to be purged. His forced resignation comes as Democrats on the Hill express concerns that Mr. Trump is on a vendetta in the wake of his acquittal.

Just days after the Senate vote, the White House reassigned an Army officer, Lt. Col. Alex Vindman, a key witness in the impeachment inquiry, from the National Security Council, and pushed his twin brother, an NSC lawyer, out with him.

Gordon Sondland, Mr. Trump’s ambassador to the European Union who also was a key witness before House investigators, was recalled from his post.

Mr. Trump tweeted on Wednesday that he wanted to “thank John Rood for his service to our Country, and wish him well in his future endeavors!” Rood, in his letter to Trump, did not mention Ukraine.

“It’s my understanding from Secretary (Mark) Esper that you requested my resignation,” Rood said. Mr. Rood said he will step down as of February 28.

Mr. Rood wrote in a May 23 letter to Congress that the Pentagon had made a thorough assessment of Ukraine’s anti-corruption actions and other reforms.

And he said that, “I have certified that the government of Ukraine has taken substantial actions to make defense institutional reforms for the purpose of decreasing corruption” and making other improvements.”

Mr. Rood wrote that his certification, legally required before the aid could be released, was based on insights gained in “persistent U.S. engagement” with Ukraine, including meetings between the U.S. defense secretary and his Ukrainian counterpart.

Pentagon

Asked about Mr. Rood’s resignation, chief Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman declined to speculate on the reason for Mr. Trump’s decision.

The president has the opportunity and the ability to have the team that he wants to have in policy positions, Hoffman said at news conference.

He said Mr. Rood’s resignation letter spoke for itself.

Mr. Rood last year told reporters that, in the weeks after signing the certification I did become aware that the aid had been held. I never received a very clear explanation other than there were concerns about corruption in Ukraine.

He also spoke in favour of releasing the aid, suggesting that withholding it would hurt America’s defense priorities.

Pentagon press secretary Alyssa Farah said James Anderson, who is currently serving as the deputy for policy, will take over the job until a permanent replacement is appointed by the President and confirmed.

Mr. Esper said Mr. Rood played “a critical role” on issues such as nuclear deterrence, NATO, missile defense and the National Defense Strategy.

Mr. Rood has served as undersecretary for policy since January 2018, but also had worked in various government agencies including the State Department, the CIA and the NSC for more than 20 years.

He held senior policy jobs mainly during Republican administrations and also served as a senior policy adviser to Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz.

Mr. Rood also was a senior vice president at Lockheed Martin International.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/jbxs0j/article30866217.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ROODKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trump-ousts-top-defense-official-who-certified-ukraine-aid/article30866218.ece
36,2020/02/20,Judge Sri Srinivasan becomes first Indian-American to lead powerful federal circuit court,"Chandigarh-born Srinivasan was appointed to the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in May 2013

Sri Srinivasan, a prominent Indian-American judge, has created history by becoming the first person of South Asian descent to lead a powerful federal circuit court, considered next only to the US Supreme Court.

Judge Srinivasan, 52, became the Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit.

An Obama appointee who has already been considered for a Supreme Court seat twice, donned the mantle of the chief judge of the DC federal court circuit on February 12.

Judge Srinivasan succeeded Judge Merrick Garland, who has been a member of the DC Circuit since 1997 and Chief Judge since 2013. He will remain on the bench, a press release said.

Notably, Garland’s nomination to the Supreme Court by the then president Barack Obama was blocked by Senate Republicans in 2016.

Judge Srinivasan was appointed to the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in May 2013.

He was the first ever Indian-American to be appointed to the second most powerful court of the US.

Neomi Rao, nominated by President Donald Trump, is the second Indian American on this powerful judiciary bench.

“History being made on the DC Court of Appeals. Congratulations, Judge Srinivasan!” Senator Mark Warner said.

“Congratulations to Judge Sri Srinivasan on becoming the Chief Judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit! A milestone for the Indian-American/Kansan community (and yet another piece of evidence my family can use that I’m underachieving),” US Federal Communications Commission Chair Ajit Pai said.

According to The Washington Post, Mr. Srinivasan spoke recently about his path to the bench at an event celebrating women in the law, a field where men still dominate leadership positions.

“Everybody doubts their belonging and worthiness in some measure. I definitely did - and still do. This is just going to be a part of the thing when you’re looking out in the world in which everyone isn’t like you. It’s natural to doubt whether you belong and whether you’re worthy,” he said, “but you do belong and you are worthy.”

Origins

Born in Chandigarh, and raised in Lawrence, Kansas, he received a B.A. from Stanford University, a J.D. from Stanford Law School, and an M.B.A. from the Stanford Graduate School of Business.

Following graduation, he served as a law clerk to Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III of the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, as a Bristow Fellow in the Office of the US Solicitor General, and as a law clerk to US Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor.

From 2011 until his appointment to the US Court of Appeals, Judge Srinivasan served as the Principal Deputy Solicitor General of the United States.

He has argued 25 cases before the US Supreme Court. He has also taught appellate advocacy at Harvard Law School as well as a seminar on civil rights statutes and the Supreme Court at Georgetown University Law Center.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/2qtamf/article30865499.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SRIKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/judge-sri-srinivasan-becomes-first-indian-american-to-lead-powerful-federal-circuit-court/article30865500.ece
37,2020/02/20,‘Trump offered to pardon Assange if he denied Russia link to e-mail leak’: London court,"WikiLeaks published emails that hurt Hillary’s campaign in 2016

U.S. President Donald Trump offered to pardon WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange if he said that Russia had nothing to do with WikiLeaks’ publication of Democratic Party emails in 2016, a London court heard on Wednesday.

Mr. Assange appeared by videolink from prison as lawyers discussed the management of his hearing next week to decide whether he should be extradited to the U.S.

At Westminster Magistrates’ Court, Mr. Assange’s barrister, Edward Fitzgerald, referred to a witness statement by former U.S. Republican congressman Dana Rohrabacher, who had visited Mr. Assange in 2017, saying that he had been sent by the President to offer a pardon. The pardon would come on the condition that Mr. Assange complied with the U.S. by saying that the Russians were not involved in the email leak, which hurt Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign in 2016, Mr. Rohrabacher’s statement said.

Mr. Assange, 48, who spent seven years holed up in Ecuador’s embassy before he was dragged out last April, is wanted in the U.S. to face 18 counts, including conspiring to hack government computers and violating an espionage law. He could spend decades behind bars if convicted there.

Almost a decade after his WikiLeaks website enraged Washington by leaking secret U.S. documents, Woolwich Crown Court in London will begin hearings on Monday - with Assange present in person - to decide whether he should be sent to the United States.

At Wednesday’s hearing, Mr. Assange spoke only to confirm his name and date of birth.

He appeared relaxed and spent much of the hearing reading notes in his lap. He wore two pairs of glasses: one on top of his head and another which he took on and off and twiddled in his hands.

Australian-born Assange made global headlines in early 2010 when WikiLeaks published a classified U.S. military video showing a 2007 attack by Apache helicopters in Baghdad that killed a dozen people, including two Reuters news staff.

WikiLeaks later angered the United States by publishing caches of leaked military documents and diplomatic cables.

The full extradition hearing will be split in two parts, with the second half delayed until May.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/5ao42t/article30864869.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-Assange,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trump-offered-to-pardon-assange-if-he-denied-russia-link-to-e-mail-leak-london-court/article30864870.ece
38,2020/02/20,Dilip Varma’s story collective aims to keep the tradition of oral storytelling alive,"A story a day

Every day, for over five years, a story has been told, recorded and uploaded on Oritathoritath. This Facebook page, devoted to Malayalam stories, was started by a small group of ‘storyphiles’ to keep the tradition of oral story telling alive.

Dilip K Varma, the man behind Oritathoritath (which can be roughly translated as “once upon a time...”), says the idea struck when he was in Mumbai, working long, stressful hours, away from his family. He missed telling stories to his children. “I am not a professional story-teller and neither did I know many. But I used Google to look for stories and told them in my own way. The Internet didn’t really help, so I found myself looking for books in my father’s library,” he says. Soon, Dilip launched an audio-story platform for children in 2015.”

On returning to his home-town Aluva, a few years later, he kept up the pace, uploading a story every day. He found a couple of fellow storyphiles and they started work, searching for interesting tales, to record and compile. “I belong to a generation that grew up listening to stories our grandmothers or mothers told us. Most children today do not have that,” he says. The original idea was to find elderly women and men who could tell stories, which they would record and update on a the FB page. So, the team found a few grandmothers. “But, we could not sustain that. Some agreed, but got self-conscious when they learnt it was being recorded.

Nevertheless, the team cultivated a few contributors who would regularly record and send in content. Today, the five-year-oldpage has a collection of over 1,900 stories that span classics, epics, Panchathanthra and local fables in Malayalam. These are told by amateurs, who are passionate about story-telling. It slowly grew into a YouTube channel, which has a little over 1,000 subscriptions and in January 2019, Oritathoritath launched a free android app by the same name.

It is important to document this content, as much of it is being lost, says Dilip. Though the stories are for children, the initiative is actually aimed at parents who can use the app to engage with their children. “The way in which each story is told is interesting — intonation, emotion and expression varies from person to person.”

Dilip adds that story telling helps children develop their imagination and creative thinking. It enriches their memory and opens their minds to other cultures and life philosophies. Recently, snippets from the Thirukkural have also featured on the platform, with an interpretation in Malayalam.

The team welcomes anyone who might have a tale to contribute : you just need to record, and send it to them. It will undergo a screening and if found fit for children, will be uploaded on the site. A word of caution: keep it short. “Not more than 10 minutes. If it is too long, children lose interest,” says Dilip.

In the process, Dilip says children get a chance to learn Malayalam. Even those who are not learning it in school will learn to appreciate the language, understand its history and the richness of its expanse. “When the story-teller has used rhyme or poetic prose, for instance, children get to hear the beauty of the language and way it sounds,” says Dilip. It is also a way to stay in touch with home: many contributors include Malayalis living abroad.",society,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/an-online-story-telling-collective-for-children/article30870260.ece
39,2020/02/20,Eurolife draws up ₹500-crore capex plan,"Firm to tap regulated markets of Europe, U.S.

Eurolife Healthcare, a leading player in the production and distribution of intravenous infusions and other pharmaceutical products, plans to invest ₹500 crore over five years in India and Europe to expand capacity and tap Europe and the U.S. in ‘a big way’, a senior executive said.

While ₹100 crore will be invested in capacity expansion at the company’s four units in India this year, about ₹400 crore will be invested in Europe to acquire more companies there and expand its unit in Hungary, which was acquired by Eurolife last year.“We are already a significant player in India but we wanted to have a big presence in the regulated markets which areis Europe and U.S.. Over the next five years, we will invest €Euro 50 million in Europe,” said Sandeep Toshniwal, CEO and director, Eurolife Healthcare Pvt. Ltd., in an interview.

“Our plan basically is to target all the markets in Europe and the U.S. from our existing unit at Hungary which has a huge approved plant. We will be investing more in manufacturing there and to buy other companies. It could be a combination of both,” he added.

For the Indian operations, the ₹100 crore investment will be done this year and the company has already signed agreements to procure high-end machinery which will be installed at the company’s four units.This will double monthly capacity to about four million bottles.

The company will fund this expansion through internal accruals and equity dilution by the promoters.

“We are looking at the possibility of private equity investment further to fund the expansion,” he said.

In 2016, OrbiMed Advisors LLC, a healthcare-focused pharmaceuticals fund, invested in the company and currently holds 29% stake.

So far, the company has invested ₹300 crore to set up its two manufacturing units at Roorkee in Uttarkhand, acquiring two units of Baxter at Aurangabad and Chennai in 2017 and acquiring Teva’s infusion business in Europe with its production facility at Hungary in 2019, he said.

The company’s turnover, which was ₹250 crore in FY19, is expected to grow fourfold in five5 years after the expansion, Mr. Toshniwal said.

“Over the next five years, based on our investment in Europe and in India, we targeting close to ₹1,000 crore in revenue,” he added.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/eurolife-draws-up-500-crore-capex-plan/article30873674.ece

Private sector lender Axis Bank is exploring the possibility of increasing its stake in Analjit Singh-led Max Life Insurance and has signed an agreement with the insurer and its parent Max Financial Services for the same.

“Axis Bank, Max Financial Services Limited (MFS) and its subsidiary Max Life Insurance Company Limited (Max Life) today signed a confidentiality and exclusivity arrangement to explore the possibility of Axis Bank entering into a long-term strategic partnership with Max Life,” the bank said in a statement.

Max Financial Services now holds a 72.5% stake in Max Life while Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance and Axis Bank hold 25.5% and 2% stake, respectively.

Axis Bank and Max Life have had a bancassurance arrangement for almost ten years. The new premium generated through this arrangement had aggregated to more than ₹12,000 crore during the period.

“At the Bank, we constantly keep assessing various strategic opportunities and we see a potential for greater participation in the under-penetrated life insurance space,” Amitabh Chaudhry, MD and CEO, Axis Bank, said.

“We have had a long standing bancassurance relationship with Max Life and the on-going discussions are a step further to deepen and strengthen this strategic partnership. The successful completion of the proposed transaction is expected to create significant value for all stakeholders,” Mr. Chaudhry added.

Earlier in 2017, Max Life was in talks with HDFC Life to sell stake. However, the deal fell through after the insurance regulator rejected the proposed structure of the deal and an alternative structure could not be worked out. Incidentally, Mr. Chaudhry was the MD & CEO of HDFC Life when the deal with Max was contemplated.

“The Max Life-Axis Bank partnership is a natural,” said Analjit Singh, founder and chairman, Max Group.

“The strategic interest of Axis Bank in Max Life will lead to the much awaited permanence and allow both companies to work towards an enduring future for policyholders and other stakeholders. We also believe that the potential transaction will provide a fillip to the life insurance sector overall,” Mr. Singh added.

“The transaction will be subject to applicable regulatory approvals, satisfactory completion of due diligence, execution of definitive documentation and satisfaction of other conditions, including the necessary corporate approvals,” the statement said.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/ccmjwn/article30873657.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21THBUAXIS,https://www.thehindu.com/business/axis-bank-inks-pact-with-max-life-to-raise-stake/article30873659.ece

42,2020/02/20,"Economy needs more monetary stimulus, says Shaktikanta Das","Minutes of meeting show ‘accommodative’ stance favoured

Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Shaktikanta Das, stating he had observed certain ‘green shoots,’ also acknowledged that the economy needed a further monetary stimulus, thus indicating the central bank was open to cutting interest rates. These are the minutes of the monetary policy committee (MPC) meeting held early in February.

The six-member MPC unanimously voted for status quo at the February policy review on the back of an uptick in inflation. The MPC decided to continue with the ‘accommodative’ stance.

“While the macroeconomy needs further monetary stimulus, the inflation outlook continues to be uncertain,” said Mr. Das. The RBI had reduced interest rates by 135 basis points (bps) between February and October of 2019 before pressing the pause button in the next two policy reviews — in December and February 2020.

“Considering the overall evolving growth-inflation situation, it would be prudent to continue the focus on growth in the context of the expected moderation in inflation,” Mr. Das said, adding he was for maintaining ‘accommodative’ stance as long as necessary to revive growth.

Testing trade-offs

Deputy Governor Michael Debabrata Patra described the present situation as a tunnel of testing trade-offs and cautioned it may be a while before light was sighted. “.. the MPC has entered what I call the tunnel of testing trade-offs (TTT) and it may be a while before the light at the end of the tunnel is sighted,” Mr. Patra said.

Mr. Patra said he was for persevering with the accommodative stance till growth revived on a durable basis.

“Monetary policy will complement the fiscal impulse and boost it going forward,” he said.

Chetan Ghate, an external member of the MPC, highlighted the need for structural reforms as fiscal and monetary stimulus, so far, have been unable to revive economic growth.

“If growth hasn’t revived with a 135 bps cut in the policy rate, and a tax stimulus amounting to 1.2% of GDP, then the need of the hour is more structural reform,” Mr. Ghate said. Economic growth is estimated to slow to 5% for 2019-20.

He cautioned that fiscal deficit uncertainty may require the MPC to accept tighter-than-desired monetary conditions to ensure commitment to the medium-term inflation target.

Another external member Pami Dua cautioned on inflationary pressures due to disruptions in the supply of Chinese imports following the spread of COVID-19 which may exert pressure on prices of goods imported from that country.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/kkdw5b/article30873607.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21THBUDAS,https://www.thehindu.com/business/economy-needs-more-monetary-stimulus-says-das/article30873608.ece
43,2020/02/20,World’s second-biggest control centre for goods trains set to roll,"Will serve as nerve centre of 1,800-km Eastern corridor: MD

The world’s second-biggest Operation Control Centre for goods trains, built in India by the Dedicated Freight Corridor Corporation of India (DFCCIL) is ready to begin operations, and is likely to be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the end of this month, a senior company official said on Thursday.

The centre, built at Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh, will be the ‘nerve-centre’ of the over 1,800 km-long eastern dedicated freight corridor, the corporation’s MD Anurag Sachan said on Thursday.

The control centre has a theater which measures 1560 sq m, with a video wall of more than 90 m and will be used as a one-stop shop for controlling and monitoring rail systems, including train operations and the power supply system.

The Dedicated Freight Corridor, touted as one of the biggest infrastructure projects in the country, is a 3,360 km stretch consisting of the Eastern and Western corridors. The Eastern corridor, which is being funded by the World Bank, will run from Ludhiana in Punjab to Dankuni near Kolkata, traversing Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand.

Mr. Sachan said that the Western corridor will have a similar operation control system at Ahmedabad.

For the Eastern corridor, targeted to be completed by December 2021, The World Bank loan stands at about $1.86 billion.

The MD added that once operational, the freight corridor will help decongest the existing Indian Railway network, while also helping increase the average speed of goods trains to 70 kmph, from the existing 25 kmph.

‘It will connect the existing ports and industrial areas for faster movement of goods… and will help increase the rail share in freight transportation from the existing 30% to 45%,” Mr. Sachan said.

Landmark Group is expecting 40% of its total sales from its India operations to happen via omni channels by 2025, up from 4% currently.

Vasanth Kumar, managing director, Lifestyle International, told The Hindu, “We are developing a strong presence in omni channels. This will include our own portal... plus we have collaborations with marketplaces like Myntra for Lifestyle, and Amazon for Home Centre and Max Fashion. We want our omni channel sales volumes to become a ₹1,000 crore business in a few years.” Landmark Group, in association in with SBI Card, launched three variants — Lifestyle Home Centre SBI Card, Max SBI Card and Spar SBI Card — of credit cards here on Thursday.

Prior to the launch, Landmark Group, which has a customer base of 38 million in the country, had conducted a trial sale to gauge customer interest in such cards.

“We sold these cards in few select outlets of Lifestyle, Home Centre, Max and Spar and we have noticed an interesting traction.

47,2020/02/20,ICRA revises outlook on Indian pharma industry to ‘negative’,"Shift from ‘stable’ amid likely virus impact on China supplies

Credit rating agency ICRA has revised the outlook on the Indian pharmaceutical industry from ‘stable’ to ‘negative’ as it does not rule out the possibility of lockouts in parts of China — due to the outbreak of COVID-19 — impacting profitability of drugmakers in India.

ICRA said the industry was highly dependent on imports. Over 60% of its active pharmaceutical ingredients’ requirement are met through imports and in some specific Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) like cephalosporins, azithromycin and penicillin, the dependence is as high as 80-90%. Of the total imports of APIs and intermediates into India, China accounted for around 65-70%.

“The situation is more alarming in the case of intermediates of stages prior to APIs and key starting materials (KSMs) which are the building blocks for the drugs, wherein, in some cases, China is the exclusive supplier. Also, for some input materials, even if alternative sources are available, China remains the preferred source given the economical rates,” ICRA said.

The agency said “domestic API manufacturers have an inventory of 1-2 months, which should support their production till mid-March 2020. Continuation of the virus [impact] beyond mid-March may adversely impact production of these API manufacturers, possibly leading to a complete halt of production for some smaller players.”

For certain intermediates, they may source from other countries but at higher prices thus impacting their profitability as they may not be able to fully pass on the same to the formulations manufacturers. “While they can shift their source of supply of raw materials for exports to regulated markets like the US, it requires refiling the drug master file (DMF) with the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) for approval, which takes about six months,” ICRA said.

Stating that though majority of the pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities in China are located far away from the COVID-19 affected sites, there has been a disruption in the supply chain due to the lockouts, the statement pharmaceutical manufacturers in India have not seen any significant increase in raw material prices as of now. But expectations of disruption in supply beyond mid-March would result in an increase in the prices and impact their profitability.

The extent of impact of production shutdowns and increase in prices of raw materials on the profitability of the domestic pharmaceutical manufacturers would, however, vary depending on each company’s product and raw material sourcing mix and the quantum of inventory held.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/jqsuru/article30873543.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21THBUCHINA,https://www.thehindu.com/business/icra-revises-outlook-on-indian-pharma-industry-to-negative/article30873544.ece

Food delivery platform Swiggy on Wednesday said that it has raised $113 million as part of its Series I funding round.

The latest round is led by existing investor Prosus N.V. and includes participation from Meituan Dianping and Wellington Management Company.

49,2020/02/20,NEET applies for undergraduate courses in alternative medicine: Supreme Court,"Lack of minimum standards would result in half-baked doctors, it says

The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the validity of applying the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) for admission to under-graduate courses under the Union Ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, Sowa Rigpa and Homoeopathy (AYUSH).

A Bench of Justices L. Nageswara Rao agreed with the government that admissions to BAMS, BUMS, BSMS and BHMS would require candidates to score minimum qualifying marks for NEET.

The court declared this in a judgment challenging notifications issued by the Central Council of Indian Medicine and Central Council of Homoeopathy prescribing an-all India NEET for admission to the under-graduate courses (BAMS, BUMS, BSMS and BHMS) and minimum qualifying marks in the examination from the academic year 2019-2020.

“Doctors who are qualified in Ayurvedic, Unani and Homeopathy streams also treat patients and the lack of minimum standards of education would result in half-baked doctors being turned out of professional colleges. Non-availability of eligible candidates for admission to AYUSH under-graduate courses cannot be a reason to lower the standards prescribed by the Central Council for admission,” Justice Rao observed in the judgment.

The Central Council had introduced the Indian Medicine Central Council (Minimum Standards of Education in Indian Medicine) Amendment Regulations of 2018, which had amended the 1986 regulations.

“Prescribing a minimum percentile for admission to the under-graduate courses for 2019-2020 was vehemently defended by the Central Council and the Union of India by submitting that the minimum standards cannot be lowered even for AYUSH courses. We agree,” the court held.

However, as one-time measure and in view of the admission of a large number of students to the AYUSH, the court has permitted them to continue provided they were admitted prior to the last date of admission, i.e., October 15, 2019. The same direction is applicable to students admitted to the post-graduate courses before October 31, 2019.

“This is a one-time exercise permitted in view of the peculiar circumstances. This order shall not be treated as a precedent,” the court clarified.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/xq4do5/article30684791.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-unani-ayushjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/neet-applies-for-undergraduate-courses-in-alternative-medicine-sc/article30873915.ece
50,2020/02/20,Unknown group to host ‘Namaste Trump’ event in Ahmedabad,"Officials involved in preparations for the event unaware of newly formed Donald Trump Nagarik Abhivadan Samiti.

In a new twist to the mega event Namaste Trump to be held at the newly built cricket stadium in Ahmedabad, a newly formed Donald Trump Nagarik Abhivadan Samiti (Citizen Felicitation Committee for Donald Trump) is the organiser of the event.

Mysteriously, it is not known yet about persons who have formed the committee to felicitate U.S. President Donald Trump in a high-profile public event at the Motera Stadium in Ahmedabad on February 24.

On Thursday, MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar told media persons that the Donald Trump Nagarik Abhivadan Samiti is the organiser of the event.

However, the name became public only when the MEA spokesman had announced it. Even in Gujarat, officials and other agencies involved in the massive preparations for the Namaste Trump event are apparently unaware about any such committee.

“I don’t know about the committee. We are only concerned about the preparations and logistical support,” a top official told The Hindu.

Another official from Ahmedabad said “only today he learnt about existence of the committee”.

Even the MEA declined to give more details about the group that is hosting the event to bring the President and the Prime Minister to the latter’s home State.

The MEA’s silence on the group promoted the Congress party to ask about the committee and when it extended the invitations. “Dear PM, intriguing new from MEA. Pl state: who is the president of Donald Trump Abhinandan Samiti? When was the invitation extended to the U.S. President and accepted and why the President Trump is saying you have promised him a grand event with 7 million people,” tweeted party spokesman Randeep Surjewala.

Earlier, it was widely reported that the Gujarat Cricket Association (GCA), which has built the stadium, is organising the event because President Trump and PM Modi were supposed to inaugurate the world’s largest cricket stadium.

However, mysteriously, the inauguration of the stadium has been put off from the menu and now only Namaste Trump event is being held. Though no official reason has been given why the inauguration of the stadium has been put on hold but insiders said “apparently PMO is not keen for inauguration of the stadium along with the event”.

“The inauguration of the cricket stadium would naturally involve entire BCCI and GCA top brass since they funded the stadium and it was not advisable to involve top office bearers with Namaste Trump event, which is primarily for President Trump and PM Modi,” a source privy to the development said.

It must be noted that ex skipper Saurav Ganguly is the president while Jay Shah is the secretary of the BCCI, while Dhanraj Nathwani is the vice-president of the GCA, which remains headless since Amit Shah’s tenure as its chief ended last year.

The MEA said on Thursday there was nothing unusual in the large-scale preparations under way to welcome Mr. Trump and such detailed plans are part of normal logistical plans before any high-profile foreign visits.

Mr. Raveesh Kumar pointed at the support that the U.S. authorities had extended during last September’s Howdy Modi event in Houston and other countries make similar plans when Mr. Modi visits.

“We have to see any such visit in the context of protocol and security arrangements which have to be made. This is very reciprocal. When our Prime Minister visits abroad, we do expect such arrangements and facilitation by other countries as well. I really don’t understand the big deal here,” said Mr. Kumar answering a question on the expenses being incurred by the Government of India and the Gujarat government for the visit.

President Trump will arrive on February 24 and will visit Ahmedabad, Agra and Delhi during his two day visit. “A certain amount of preparation, from the logistics, protocol and security angle will have to be made when hosting a head of the state,” he said justifying the widespread arrangements.

Apart from beautification and construction of a wall in Ahmedabad, elaborate arrangements are being made also in Agra where President Trump and Melania Trump will pay a brief visit to the Taj Mahal.

The issue acquired political colour with Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala questioning the Gujarat government’s decision to spend ₹120 crore for the Namaste Trump event to be held at the Motera stadium. “Diplomacy is a serious government business and not a series of photo ops and event management tactics,” said Mr. Surjewala.

Both sides have made clear that a mega trade deal that India and the U.S. have been negotiating will not be sealed during the visit, but officials maintain that the visit will provide an opportunity to exchange views on regional and global issues.

“Overall, our global strategic partnership will be further strengthened,” said Mr. Kumar explaining the goals to be achieved by the high profile visit.

The official spokesperson hinted that civil nuclear collaboration, science and technology and defence related talks are part of the agenda during visit.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/6pc89r/article30874714.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Moterajpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/unknown-group-to-host-namaste-trump-in-ahmedabad-stadium/article30873703.ece
51,2020/02/20,Opinion | A preprint provides ammunition to conspiracy theories about SARS-CoV-2 origin,"In a preprint that was posted on Research Gate (but now available only in the Wayback Machine), two researchers — Botao Xiao and Lei Xiao —from Chinese institutions have claimed without attributing scientific evidence, that the “killer coronavirus probably originated from a laboratory in Wuhan”. The claim has provided much ammunition to the conspiracy theory that is already circulating on the Internet.

The authors are from South China University of Technology in Guangzhou and Wuhan University of Science and Technology in Wuhan.

The preprint entitled “The possible origins of 2019-nCoV coronavirus” has come to be criticised as a textbook case of “evidence” collected or presented to support confirmation bias of the researchers.

By definition, a preprint is one that is yet to be published in a scientific journal post peer-reviewing. Hence, any claims made in preprints should be considered with caution. But that has not stopped several newspapers from reporting the news four-five days ago based on claims made in the preprint.

Circumstantial evidence

While the two authors do not provide any evidence that the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was created in the lab, they build their case based on assumptions. They begin by saying that bats carrying the novel coronavirus are originally found in Yunnan or Zhejiang province, which is more than 900 km from the seafood market at the centre of the investigation on the source. Hence, the chances of bats “flying to the market” are slim.

The bats were never sold in the market either, based on several testimonials, they say. The authors then talk of an intermediate host but quickly add that “little proof has been reported” on this.

COVID-19 | China once again changes how new cases are counted in Hubei Province | South Korea reports 1st virus death | Two elderly passengers taken off cruise ship die in Japan | Death toll in China exceeds 2,100

Therefore, the only possible pathway for the virus is, according to them, the Wuhan Center for Disease Control & Prevention. This Center which is only about 280 metres from the market and is also adjacent to the Union Hospital - where the doctors who were first infected during the epidemic were working - is advanced as a possible source of the virus.

While they issue a fleeting caution that “solid proofs are needed in future study”, they quickly move on to question if the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which is located about 12 km from the wet market, was the source of the virus. The only reason they doubt this Institute, is the fact that the principal investigator had “participated in a project which generated a chimeric virus using the SARS-CoV reverse genetics system, and reported the potential for human emergence”.

An appeal by 27 scientists

Meanwhile, on February 19, a group of 27 public health scientists from eight countries have signed an open letter in The Lancet to “support scientists, public health and medical professionals of China combating COVID-19” and to condemn conspiracy theories surrounding the origin of the virus.

A petition has also been started on Change.org two days ago and over 2,100 have signed it already.

“We sign this statement in solidarity with all scientists and health professionals in China who continue to save lives and protect global health during the challenge of the COVID-19 outbreak. We are all in this together, with our Chinese counterparts in the forefront, against this new viral threat,” they write in the open letter.

“We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin. Scientists from multiple countries have published and analysed genomes of the causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and they overwhelmingly conclude that this coronavirus originated in wildlife,” they add.

They conclude by inviting others too to join them in supporting the scientists and professionals in China and sign the letter.

China slams media reports

On February 20, China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang slammed a media report that the novel coronavirus was created in the lab. Such unfounded claims at a time when China is pulling out all the stops to combat the virus are “either full of ignorance or bear hostile intentions” he said.

“What we need is science, rationality [and] cooperation to defeat ignorance with science and shatter rumours with truth, and to counter prejudice with cooperation,” he noted.

WHO’s stand on virus origin

On February 19, at a press briefing, Richard Brennan, regional emergency director for WHO's Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean said that there is little evidence that the novel coronavirus which causes COVID-19 disease was produced in a laboratory or as a biological weapon.

“COVID-19 is what’s called a coronavirus, it’s a class of viruses that are primarily what we call zoonotic, that they come from the animal kingdom,” he explained.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/r1oxsv/article30848450.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CORONAVIRUSOUTBREAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/opinion-sars-cov-2-a-preprint-provides-ammunition-to-conspiracy-theories-about-virus-origin/article30873615.ece
52,2020/02/20,"Bulk of Jharkhand’s deleted ration cards weren’t fake, study shows","18 died due to starvation in the past three years

Almost 90% of ration cards deemed fake and deleted by the Jharkhand government between 2016 and 2018 actually belonged to existing, valid households, according to a new study by economists affiliated to the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

The randomised control study found that almost 56% of these deleted ration cards were not linked with Aadhaar. Over the last three years, at least 18 starvation deaths have been reported in Jharkhand due to lack of access to subsidised food, mostly because beneficiaries’ ration cards were not linked to Aadhaar.

The results of the study assume greater urgency and importance as the newly elected Jharkhand government has expressed its intention to restart the drive to delete fake ration cards.

The Jharkhand government — then led by the BJP — had carried out an Aadhaar seeding drive in 2016 and 2017, pushing for ration cards to be connected to the biometric identity in order to improve efficiency and weed out fake or duplicate cards. It had declared April 5, 2017, as the date after which ration cards not linked to Aadhaar would become “null and void”. In September 2017, the State claimed that 11.6 lakh cards had been found to be fake, saving the government ₹225 crore. Later, it downgraded the number of deleted cards to 6.96 lakh.

Limited studies by activists and on ground investigation by journalists, including a Ground Zero report “Death by Digital Exclusion” in The Hindu, had found that many people in Jharkhand had been denied subsidised food due to wrongly deleted ration cards.

The J-PAL study published as a working paper by the U.S.-based National Bureau of Economic Research now confirms this reporting with analysis of an extensive randomised control trial. The paper, co-authored by economists Karthik Muralidharan, Paul Niehaus and Sandip Sukhtankar, analysed the effects of requiring biometric identity verification for the subsidised food programme in 10 randomly selected districts between 2016 and 2018.

Government data shows that 5.9% or 1.44 lakh ration cards were deleted out of a total 24.5 lakh cards in those districts. Using a sample of 3,901 cards, the study found that 213 cards or 5.5% had been deleted. Of the 213 deleted cards, 187 cards or 88%, were found to belong to valid beneficiary families. Only 26 cards were “ghosts” or fakes, belonging to families which could not be traced. Of the deleted cards, 115 were not linked to Aadhaar.

“Our results highlight that attempts to reduce corruption in welfare programs can also generate non-trivial costs in terms of exclusion and inconvenience to genuine beneficiaries,” wrote the study’s authors.

Despite the contentious results of the last drive to delete “fake” ration cards, the State government — now headed by the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha — may be set to repeat the effort. Earlier this month, the State’s Food Minister Rameshwar Oraon was quoted as having said that there were at least two lakh fake ration cards in the State, which would be cancelled.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/szhkr5/article29363066.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Jahangirpuri-ration-shop,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bulk-of-jharkhands-deleted-ration-cards-werent-fake-study-shows/article30873572.ece
53,2020/02/20,China has realised it cannot support Pak. all the time: Army Chief,"Pakistan is under the FATF’s glare and they must have factored in that to tone down their rhetoric, he says

China has realised that they cannot back their “so-called all-weather friend” all the time, Army Chief Gen. Manoj Naravane said on Thursday referring to Pakistan’s continued support to cross-border terrorism and the ongoing plenary of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).

“They [China] have taken a step back,” he said in a brief interaction with media. “There is all-round pressure on Pakistan regarding its support for cross-border terrorism and they may have to rethink their strategy”.

There was an “external dimension” to cross-border related incidents. Pakistan was under the glare of the FATF and they must have factored in that “to tone down their rhetoric.” The crucial FATF plenary was under way in Paris, which would decide if Pakistan moved out of the 'Grey List' or moved into the ‘Black List’, he said.

Incidents of terrorism and terror-related incidents in Kashmir have gone down, but the Line of Control (LoC) remained active and Cease Fire Violations (CFV) continued as attempts to cross the LoC were on everyday, including attempts by the Border Action Teams (BAT of Pakistan), he said.

Gen. Naravane asserted that the counter-infiltration grid had been strengthened. “No infiltration attempt has been successful.”

On the health condition of Hurriyat leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani and the fallout of it, he said the former’s health had been a matter of concern and security forces were prepared to take care of any situation.

Theatre commands

On the proposed establishment of theatre commands, he said they were in the “very preliminary” stages and there would be detailed discussions before anything is finalised.

Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) Gen. Bipin Rawat recently outlined one or two commands for the Northern Command and two theatres for the Western Command, with Jammu and Kashmir being a seperate one, hoped theaterisation would start by 2022.

“We are still at the ideation stage,” Gen. Naravane said, adding that they were bouncing off a few ideas to see how to find the best combination with the conventional and sub-conventional threats.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/rgulpa/article30873559.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH21NARVANE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/china-has-realised-it-cannot-support-pak-all-the-time-army-chief/article30873560.ece
54,2020/02/20,"After Delhi rout, rumblings rise in Congress","Shashi Tharoor endorses comments of Sandeep Dikshit; younger leaders too speak their mind

The Congress Working Committee (CWC) should hold leadership elections to “energise workers and inspire voters”, senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor said here on Thursday.

The MP endorsed the comments of party leader Sandeep Dikshit that the “leadership question” was the biggest challenge facing the party.

MP’s suggestion

“What Sandeep Dikshit said openly is what dozens of party leaders from across the country are saying privately, including many with responsible positions in the party. I renew my appeal to the CWC to hold leadership elections to energise workers and inspire voters,” Mr. Tharoor tweeted tagging a news report in which Mr. Dikshit had been critical of the leadership.

Mr. Dikshit had blamed senior leaders for inaction, saying they could not find a new party president after all these months because “they are scared who will bell the cat”.

Mr. Tharoor even suggested on the process, something that he had made soon after Rahul Gandhi had stepped down as party chief.

“Some have asked who should vote and for what. I was referring to my earlier call eight months ago for elections among the 10,000 party workers who constitute the ‘AICC plus PCC delegates’ list. These should be for the elected seats in the CWC as well as for the party presidency,” Mr. Tharoor said.

The leadership question has also been raised in the middle of speculation that Mr. Gandhi could be once again asked to take charge as the party in a few months as interim party chief Sonia Gandhi is reported to be not keen on continuing.

At the official party briefing, Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said he had not seen Mr. Tharoor’s tweet but added that it was the CWC that proposed Ms. Gandhi’s name.

‘Read resolution’

“If anyone has any misgiving, I would urge them to read the CWC resolution once, so that it can enlighten them before they make any statement,” he told presspersons without mentioning Mr. Tharoor’s name.

The Congress’s back-to-back rout in the Delhi polls has prompted several leaders to speak out, with younger leaders like Jyotiraditya Scindia, Manish Tewari and others calling for a new mindset of way of functioning. Leaders like Milind Deora and Ajay Maken have also engaged in an open spat over Mr. Deora praising Aam Admi Party (AAP). Mr. Dikshit joined the debate by questioning the seniors in the party.

Mr. Surjewala asked Mr. Dikshit “to reflect why each one of them, including him [Sandeep Dikshit], have lost recent elections and work to regain their supporters on the basis of their work”.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/tu47rt/article23890547.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Congress,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/after-delhi-rout-rumblings-rise-in-congress/article30873538.ece
55,2020/02/20,"Measure mental illness through IQ levels, says CBSE","Disability activists say many students with mental illness may have high IQ scores

A circular issued by the Central Board of Secondary Education on the eve of the Class 10 and 12 board examinations has asked for students with mental illnesses to provide medical certificates using their IQ scores to measure their disability level, in order to avail concessions in the examinations.

Disability activists and psychologists have pointed out that this is an inaccurate way to evaluate mental illness and also does not comply with the guidelines of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016.

“It is archaic to use IQ levels to measure even intellectual disability,” pointed out Vaishnavi Jayakumar, a member of the Disability Rights Alliance who has written to the CBSE asking for the February 14 circular to be corrected. “But many people with mental illness don’t have intellectual disabilities at all. You can have high IQ levels and still have serious psychosocial disabilities,” she added.

“There is a lot of confusion and panic among students and parents, especially as this has come at the last minute before examinations,” said Seema Lal, a Kochi-based psychologist. and co-founder of Together We Can., an advocacy group for parents and children with disabilities. “Clinical depression, personality disorders, specific learning disorders, autism — many of these will not show low IQ score, but children may still require examination support of various kinds,” said Seema Lal, a Kochi-based psychologist. She also noted that emotional and social skills and adaptive behaviour also needed to be taken into account.

When contacted, CBSE Controller of Examinations Sanyam Bhardwaj told The Hindu that the circular had been issued the day before examinations began because the Board had received a number of last minute requests from parents and students claiming learning disabilities, and demanding concessions.

“To avoid misuse of the concessions, we wanted to ensure that they give us certificates with the specific levels of disabilities, as stipulated by the Gazette notification issued by the Social Justice Ministry. Otherwise, there is a rush of people coming last minute with incomplete certificates claiming their child has dyslexia and demanding extra time,” said Dr. Bhardwaj. Regarding the use of IQ scores to evaluate mental illness, he admitted that the CBSE circular quoted only partially and selectively from the notified guidelines for disability evaluation, and clarified that the CBSE would be subject to the full guidelines.

The guidelines define mental illness as “a substantial disorder of thinking, mood, perception, orientation or memory that grossly impairs judgment, behaviour, capacity to recognise reality or ability to meet the ordinary demands of life, but does not include retardation which is a condition of arrested or incomplete development of mind of a person, specially characterised by subnormality of intelligence.”

It recommends clinical assessment as well as the administration of the Indian Disability Evaluation and Assessment Scale (IDEAS) to evaluate the disability. Only in cases where there is suspicion of intellectual deficits, standardised IQ tests may be administered, says the Act’s guidelines.

“Erroneously... leaving out the IDEAS element would negate the availability of reasonable accommodation to candidates living with psychosocial disability,” Ms. Jayakumar wrote in her letter to the CBSE.

Although Dr. Bhardwaj referred to students with dyslexia and other learning disorders, the CBSE circular only refers to intellectual disabilities and mental illnesses, leading to confusion among those with specific learning disorders.

Ashi Sachin, mother of a 15-year old with dysgraphia, says the circular has led to her son’s CBSE school demanding specific certification. “He has been diagnosed with dysgraphia and needs extra time to write the examination, as well as concessions with regards to internal marking for class notes and record books. I have the psychologist’s report, but now the school is not sure if they can give the concessions without a certificate on the specific level of disability,” says Ms. Sachin, who did not wish to name her son or his school. “His IQ score fluctuates around 100, but he still needs help,” she added, noting that several CBSE principals planned to raise the issue with the Board.

“There are issues with quantifying the level of disability in the case of learning disorders, and there is a problem with conflating such disorders with intellectual disability and mental illness. We are also writing to the CBSE about the problem,” said Muralidharan Vishwanath, general secretary of the National Platform for the Rights of the Disabled.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/3yz5hh/article30010796.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MENTAL-HEALTH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/measure-mental-illness-through-iq-levels-says-cbse/article30873530.ece
56,2020/02/20,Ram temple trustees invite Modi for ‘bhoomi poojan’,"Modi says he will consider attending the ‘bhoomi poojan’ for Ram temple

The new chairperson of the Ramjanmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra Trust, Mahant Nritya Gopal Das of the Ramjanmabhoomi Nyas, called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi at his residence here and invited him for the ground-breaking ceremony for the Ram temple in Ayodhya.

“We called on Prime Minister Modi and have extended an invitation for the ‘bhoomi poojan’. He said he would give it due consideration,” the Mahant said after the meeting.

The Trust’s general secretary, Champat Rai of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, and treasurer, Swami Govind Devji Maharaj of Pune, accompanied him.

Date not fixed

The date for the ground-breaking ceremony has not been finalised yet, though sources told The Hindu that it would be done at the Trust’s next meeting in Ayodhya on March 3 and 4.

At its first meeting, the trust elected office-bearers, determined a chartered accountancy firm based in Delhi for its auditing and accounts, and took decisions regarding opening of a bank account to solicit donations for the construction. It also decided that a temple construction committee would be formed with former Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister, Nripendra Mishra, heading it.

The Mahant has reportedly offered to turn over all funds collected by the Nyas for the construction of the temple at the height of the Ramjanmabhoomi movement to the Trust.

57,2020/02/20,SC passes interim order on Mahadayi tribunal’s award,"Implementation subject to final judgment in civil appeals by three States

The Supreme Court on Thursday passed an interim order allowing an application by the State of Karnataka to notify the Mahadayi Water Dispute Tribunal’s award.

The implementation of the award would, however, be subject to the final judgment of the Supreme Court in the civil appeals filed by Karnataka, Goa and Maharashtra, challenging the allocation of water from the Mahadayi river among them.

Don’t oppose

Neither of the two States — Goa and Maharashtra — opposed the plea made by Karnataka to publish the August 2018 tribunal award in the official gazette.

A Bench led by Justice D.Y. Chandrachud listed the petitions for final arguments in July.

Advocate General Prabhuling Navadgi, senior advocates Shyam Divan and Mohan Katarki, and advocates Nishanth Patil and V.N. Raghupathy represented the State of Karnataka.

The tribunal had allocated 13.42 TMC water (including 3.9 TMC for diversion into the depleted Malaprabha river basin) from the Mahadayi river basin to Karnataka.

Maharashtra was allotted 1.33 TMC water while Goa was given 24 TMC in the final decision of the tribunal. The United Progressive Alliance (UPA)-2 government had constituted the Mahadayi Water Disputes Tribunal in 2010.

The Karnataka government had petitioned the tribunal seeking the release of 7.56 TMC of water for the Kalasa-Banduri Nala project. The Kalasa-Banduri Nala (diversion) project, which will utilise 7.56 TMC of water from the inter-State Mahadayi river, is being undertaken by Karnataka to improve drinking water supply to the twin cities of Hubballi-Dharwad and the districts of Belagavi and Gadag.

It involves building barrages across Kalasa and Banduri, the tributaries of the Mahadayi river, to divert 7.56 TMC water to the Malaprabha river, which fulfils the drinking water needs of the twin cities.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/2nzf51/article30873424.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH20KRAMAHADAYIRIVER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-passes-interim-order-on-mahadayi-tribunals-award/article30873425.ece

India will deliver medical supplies to China to combat the novel coronavirus outbreak. An official of the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said on February 20 that India will send a large military transport aircraft to evacuate nationals in Wuhan.

“The government of India has decided to send a consignment of medical supplies in a relief flight to Wuhan. This is just a small way to express our support to China as it continues its fight against the COVID-19 epidemic. On its return flight, the aircraft will bring in Indian nationals who could not board the first two flights,” said Raveesh Kumar, official spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs, announcing that a heavy lift C-17 aircraft will be sent for the mission to Wuhan.

Indians in Wuhan had earlier been told that the special flight would arrive on Thursday but a member of the Indian community informed The Hindu that the Embassy of India has now asked the community to wait for a fresh date.

Officials here said that India is waiting for China’s permission to send the aircraft.

“We have asked Indian nationals to take precautions and follow the instruction of local authorities. Those interested in coming back have been asked to contact our Embassy. Subject to capacity limitations and other logistics, we will accommodate nationals of other countries as well,” said Mr. Kumar.

India evacuated some Maldivian nationals during a previous evacuation flight from Wuhan.

Suspension extended

Air India and IndiGo on February 20 extended the suspension period of their flights to China into June due to the COVID-19 outbreak.

In January, Air India cancelled its flights to Shanghai and Hong Kong until February 14, which has now been extended to June 30.

IndiGo had also announced that its flights to Chengdu, Guangzhou and Hong Kong were suspended until February 20. This has been extended until June 15, the airline spokesperson said. “We will review the decision depending on how the situation develops with respect to COVID-19,” added the spokesperson.

SpiceJet, which flies to Hong Kong, had cancelled its flights until Februay 29.

The decision by the two Indian carriers comes on a day that Egypt’s flag carrier, Egypt Air announced it would resume flights to China with effect from February 27.

However, Air India and IndiGo’s decision is in line with announcements made earlier this week by major global airlines to extend cancellations until April. American carriers such as United Airlines, American Airlines and Delta Airlines recently extended cancellations until the end of April. Many others, such as Lufthansa, British Airways, Qantas and KLM, have extended their cancellations until the end of March.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/k2fjuv/article30873348.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/C-17,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/covid-19-new-delhi-to-send-medical-supplies-to-wuhan-bring-back-remaining-indians-in-return-flight/article30873349.ece
59,2020/02/20,"Punjab police will now probe Bargari, Behbal Kalan incidents, says CM Amarinder Singh","Supreme Court had on Thursday rejected the CBI plea to investigate them: Amarinder

Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Thursday said the State’s special investigation team (SIT) would now investigate the “Behbal Kalan and Bargari sacrilege” cases of 2015 as the Supreme Court had rejected the CBI plea to investigate them.

He was making a statement during the Budget session of the Assembly here.

The Chief Minister informed the House that the Supreme Court had on Thursday allowed the State to carry on its investigation into the cases and the subsequent police firing, which were handed over to the CBI by the previous SAD-BJP regime.

“These cases will now be probed only by Punjab. The modalities will be announced later.” The government had announced in the House last year that the cases would be taken back from the Central agency and would be investigated by the State government.

Two persons were killed in the police firing in Behbal Kalan of Faridkot district in 2015, which followed the alleged sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib at Bargari.

Aam Aadmi Party MLA Aman Arora welcomed the decision and said the Punjab government should now ensure time-bound investigation so that the guilty could be punished.

Before the session started, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) members staged a protest outside the Assembly along with people who had received severely inflated power bills, and demanded an immediate roll back of the hike and an independent inquiry into the alleged power scam.

Legislative party leader Sharanjit Singh Dhillon and former Minister Bikram Singh Majithia said the Congress government should immediately reverse the hike and provide power to domestic and industrial consumers at ₹5 per unit as promised in its election manifesto. Dismissing the Chief Minister’s announcement of bringing out a white paper on the issue, the leaders said, “It is an excuse to divert the attention from the real problem. People are not interested in white papers. They want power at ₹5 per unit.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/punjab-police-will-now-probe-bargari-behbal-kalan-incidents-says-cm-amarinder-singh/article30873084.ece

61,2020/02/20,Babri demolition accused hold key posts in Ram temple trust,"Nritya Gopal Das and Champat Rai Bansal, chairman and general secretary of the trust addressed ‘kar sevaks’ before the mosque was demolished.

Nritya Gopal Das and Champat Rai Bansal, chairman and general secretary of the trust set up to oversee construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya, are both accused in the Babri Masjid demolition case.

Both Mr. Das and Mr. Bansal were on the dais from where several leaders had addressed ‘kar sevaks’ before the mosque was demolished, as per the CBI charge sheet in the case. Eight prominent leaders, including former Deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani, had also shared the dais.

Also read | Babri case: SC revives criminal conspiracy charges against Advani, others

On October 5, 1993, the CBI had filed a consolidated charge sheet against 48 persons, including Mr. Das and Mr. Bansal.

The agency had invoked Sections 120-B (criminal conspiracy), 153-A (promoting enmity on various grounds), 153-B (imputations, assertions prejudicial to national integration), 295 (injuring or defiling place of worship with intent to insult the religion of any class), 295-A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs) and 505 (statements conducing to public mischief) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

In September 1997, a special court found prima facie basis to charge the accused persons, including Mr. Bansal and Mr. Das, under Section 147 (rioting), 153-A, 153-B, 295-A and 505, read with Section 120-B, of the IPC.

On May 4, 2001, proceedings against 21 persons, including Mr. Bansal and Mr. Das, were dropped, as the court concerned took the view that there were two sets of accused — one, the ‘kar sewaks’ who demolished the mosque, and the others who were the alleged instigators.

The High Court subsequently upheld the judgment, after which the matter moved to the Supreme Court.

The Supreme Court, on April 19, 2017, ordered the sessions court to frame additional charges under Section 120-B (criminal conspiracy) against Mr. Advani and seven other prominent leaders. It also directed framing of additional charges under Section 120-B and other IPC provisions mentioned in the joint CBI charge sheet against others, which included Mr. Bansal and Mr. Das.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ticri7/article26163631.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02TH-THGRP-VHP-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/babri-demolition-accused-hold-key-posts-in-ram-temple-trust/article30873044.ece
62,2020/02/20,"SC judgment on women officers is very enabling, says Gen. Naravane","‘The same procedure that’s followed for male SSC officers will be followed in ensuring Permanent Commission for women’

The Supreme Court (SC) judgment granting Permanent Commission (PC) to women officers in the Army gives clarity on the issue, and a roadmap has been prepared for its implementation, Army Chief General Manoj Naravane said on Thursday.

“The judgment of the Supreme Court is a very enabling one. It gives a lot of clarity on how to move forward. There is equal opportunity for everyone and there is no gender discrimination,” Gen. Naravane said in a brief interaction with the media.

Elaborating, he said the first task at hand is to comply with the SC judgment to grant Permanent Commission. “We have drafted a plan. We will send out letters to everyone and ask for their choice,” he stated.

‘Same rule for all’

The same procedure that’s followed for male Short Service Commission (SSC) officers will be followed in ensuring Permanent Commission for women, Gen. Naravane clarified, adding, “It will be the same rule for everyone.”

On Monday, the apex court directed the government that women officers in the Army be granted Permanent Commission and command postings. Observing that the judgment was for those who have crossed a certain point in their career in the Army, he said the rules for young officers would not be applied to women officers with greater seniority. All these factors will be discussed in the training of the next batch of women officers, he stated.

Noting that the Army started inducting women officers since 1993, he added that the Army was the first service to employ women as jawans in the Corps of Military Police.

An anti-drone system developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) will be part of the foolproof security arrangements being made for the roadshow of U.S. President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi here on February 24, said officials.

Along with the local police, teams of the Rapid Action Force, the State Reserve Police Force, Chetak Commando and the Anti-Terrorist Squad would be deployed at strategic locations, said Special Commissioner of Police (crime branch) Ajay Tomar.

They will work closely with national agencies like the National Security Guard (NSG) and the Special Protection Group (SPG), he said.

Mr. Trump and Mr. Modi will take part in a 22km-long roadshow in Ahmedabad and jointly address a gathering at the newly-built cricket stadium in Motera.

Over 1,10,000 people are expected to attend the mega event that has been named “Namaste Trump”.

Editorial | Birds of a feather: On Trump-Modi chemistry

“We will be utilising an anti-drone system developed by the DRDO to secure the roadshow route. Apart from police personnel on ground, we will also deploy our men on the terraces of roadside houses. Some of the streets on the roadshow route and near Motera will remain closed for traffic on February 24,” said Mr. Tomar at a press conference.

The DRDO system is equipped to instantaneously detect and identify drone threats and terminate them. A drone or an unmanned aerial vehicle refer to an un-piloted aircraft or spacecraft.

Earlier, the police had said more than 10,000 police personnel, to be led by 25 senior IPS officers, will be deployed for the roadshow security.

While a majority of the residents near the stadium have been asked not to use the road unless absolutely necessary, Mr. Tomar said people would be allowed to move in and out of housing colonies in case of emergencies.

He said students appearing for exams can use the roads closed for traffic on Monday by showing their hall tickets.

Mr. Tomar said it is not yet known whether Mr. Modi and Mr. Trump will travel in the same car or in separate vehicles during the roadshow.

The IPS officer said it is most likely the dignitaries will not use an open vehicle during the show.

As per the route plan, Mr. Trump and Mr. Modi will first reach the Sabarmati Ashram, a place closely associated with Mahatma Gandhi, from the international airport.

From the Sabarmati Ashram, both the leaders would take the SP Ring Road via the Indira Bridge near the airport to reach the cricket stadium in Motera.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/cozszr/article30872680.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20THLTTRUMPROADSHOW,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/drdo-anti-drone-system-to-be-deployed-for-trump-modi-roadshow/article30872681.ece

A COVID-19 patient, according to the clinical protocol followed by the State, is considered ready for discharge if two consecutive test samples within a gap of 24 hours are negative for the virus and if the chest X-ray is clear.

The decision to discharge the patient was taken by the institutional Medical Board at Thrissur Govt MCH on February 20 morning and after conferring with the State Control Cell, the patient was allowed to go home.

She will however continue to remain home under surveillance for a few more days.

The forest cover in India is increasing, but is still lower than the targeted 33% of the total geographical area under the country’s forest policy, an official said here on Thursday.

Speaking on the sidelines of a regional training programme for institutionalising capacities on climate change, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) Additional Secretary Ravi S. Prasad said as per the India State of Forest Report (ISFR) 2019, the total forest and tree cover in the country is 8,07,276 square kilometres, which is 24.56% of the total geographical area.

He said the country’s forest policy targeted forest and tree cover for over 33% of the total geographical area, but added that it was aspirational.

The Forest Survey of India has been assessing the forest and tree resources of the country on a biennial basis since 1987. The results of the assessment are published in the ISFR.

As per ISFR 2017, the total forest and tree cover was at 24.39%, Mr. Prasad added.

The country’s forest cover is consistently on the rise. In 2017, it had registered an increase of 1% or 8,021 square km over 2015, he said.

66,2020/02/20,Govt. starts review of SC welfare plan as funds remain under-utilised,"Proposal to start a new fund spread over eight sectors mooted

As the funds allocated for the welfare of the Scheduled Castes by 37 Ministries, departments and Union Territories remain under-utilised, the Social Justice Ministry on Thursday started a Ministry-wise review of the Development Action Plan for SC (DAPSC), which it has proposed to replace with a new fund spread over eight sectors.

Under the DAPSC, all Ministries are required to allocate funds for the SCs in various schemes. In 2019-2010, against an allocation of ₹81,340.74 crore, 61.04% or ₹49,653.87 crore had been released as on Wednesday, the scheme’s website showed on Thursday. For 2018-2019, the release of funds with regard to allocation was 88.13%.

Social Justice and Empowerment Ministry Secretary R. Subrahmanyam said the Ministry would review the utilisation of funds for 2019-2020 as well as plans for utilisation for 2020-2021 along with the Ministries and the departments concerned, starting with agriculture, fisheries, animal husbandry and agriculture research. These reviews will go till March 12.

The Ministry has also proposed replacing the DAPSC with a fund administered by the Finance Ministry, along the lines of the Nirbhaya Fund, divided into eight sectors, including education, health, agriculture and urban infrastructure instead of 37 Ministries.

The proposed fund was likely be discussed at the NITI Aayog on March 4, he said, adding that the use of the fund would have to lead to direct, quantifiable and measurable impact.

The Secretary said the aim was to improve the utilisation of funds with the potential of bettering the lives of people. For example, though the Department of Telecommunications had allocated ₹1,823 crore for the DAPSC, there was the question of how it could provide direct benefit to the SCs.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/govt-starts-review-of-sc-welfare-plan-as-funds-remain-under-utilised/article30872389.ece
67,2020/02/20,SC questions trial courts’ haste to issue death warrants despite judgments to let convicts exhaust remedies,"The court referred to its May 2015 judgment, which had quoted a saying ascribed to Emperor Ashoka that the ‘state should not punish with vengeance’

Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde on Thursday expressed alarm about trial courts issuing death warrants in undue haste without offering condemned prisoners a chance to exhaust their efforts for commutation or clemency.

Heading a three-judge Bench, Justice Bobde sought to know from Solicitor General Tushar Mehta as to why ‘black warrants’ were being issued in a hurry despite judgments of the Supreme Court specifying that condemned men ought to be allowed the legal and administrative remedies available to them under the Constitution.

The court referred to its May 2015 judgment, which had quoted a saying ascribed to Emperor Ashoka that the ‘state should not punish with vengeance’.

“Despite reported judgments, how is it that such orders [issuance of ‘black warrants’] are passed? Judicial process cannot go on like this,” Justice Bobde addressed Mr. Mehta.

Mr. Mehta agreed that the punishment involved, death, was irreversible.

Thursday’s courtroom exchange is significant because the government has recently asked the apex court to frame “victim and society centric” guidelines to prevent delays in the execution of condemned prisoners. The plea for new guidelines referred to how the convicts in the Nirbhaya case have “misused” the maze-like legal process in death penalty cases to delay the execution of their death sentences.

On Thursday, the CJI’s observations came while staying the operation of a ‘black warrant’ issued by a Surat court against Anil Surendrasingh Yadav, who has been sentenced to death under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act for the rape and murder of a three-year-old at Surat in October 2018. The court has issued notice to the Gujarat government on the appeal filed by Yadav challenging the death sentence.

Senior advocate Aparajita Singh, for Yadav, submitted that the State High Court had rejected his appeal in December 2019. Shortly after, the Surat court had issued a death warrant for carrying out the execution in January 2020.

Ms. Singh said the death warrant was violative of the basic rights of the convict to appeal to the Supreme Court. The rules allow a convict 60 days to file his appeal before the final court. The death warrant orders his execution in 33 days. Ms. Singh argued that the death warrant was issued before the expiry of the period of limitation for filing an appeal in the Supreme Court.

In this context, Ms. Singh drew Justice Bobde’s attention to the case of Shabnam and Salim of Uttar Pradesh. In 2010, the trial court had found the duo guilty of murdering seven members of Shabnam’s family. The State High Court had confirmed their death sentence in 2015. Their appeal was dismissed by the apex court on May 15, 2015. Merely six days later, the trial court issued their death warrants without pausing to see if the convicts would file a review petition in the apex court.

Staying that death warrant, the Supreme Court had in a judgment, on May 25, 2015, stressed the importance of not acting in haste in death penalty cases as “once a death sentence is executed, that results in taking away the life of the convict. If it is found thereafter that such a sentence was not warranted, that would be of no use as the life of that person cannot be brought back”. The court had advised trial courts to follow due procedure rather than act in a manner which is “arbitrary, fanciful or oppressive”.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/w2uo0/article30854010.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH18SC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-questions-trial-courts-haste-to-issue-death-warrants-despite-judgments-to-let-convicts-exhaust-remedies/article30871505.ece
68,2020/02/20,Amit Shah allays fears in northeast about Article 371,"NDA govt. committed to preserving the unique cultures and traditions of the region, he says

Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Thursday allayed fears in the northeast about Article 371 meeting the same fate as Article 370 while addressing a public rally at the 34th Statehood Day celebrations in Itanagar.

His visit was marked by protests in Arunachal Pradesh and China, which claims the State as part of southern Tibet. Students of the Rajiv Gandhi University led the protest related to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 (CAA) at Mithun Gate, less than a kilometre from Itanagar’s Indira Gandhi Park where the Statehood Day was held.

Also read: A snapshot of Article 371

“Misinformation was spread after the abrogation of Article 370 that Article 371 will also be scrapped… It will never happen and nobody can do it,” Mr. Shah said, asserting that the NDA government was committed to preserving and protecting the unique cultures and traditions of the northeast inhabited by various ethnic groups.

While Article 370 had special provisions for Jammu and Kashmir, Articles 371-A to 371-J have certain provisions for Nagaland, Assam, Manipur, Andhra Pradesh, Sikkim, Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh besides Maharashtra, Gujarat, Goa and Karnataka.

Mr. Shah said the northeast was only geographically connected to the rest of India till 2014 when the BJP-led NDA government began to integrate the region emotionally.

“The region used to get importance earlier only on political grounds but Prime Minister Narendra Modi has changed the trend with efforts to unite it with the rest of the country,” he said, giving a count of the number of visits by the PM and the Central Ministers to the region to drive home his point.

“The Modi government wants the entire northeast to be free of militancy, inter-State boundary conflicts, law and order, drug menace and other problems. When we seek votes in 2024, the northeast will have been free from all problems,” the Home Minister said.

He cited the example of the Bodo Peace Accord, signed on January 27, to underline the Central government’s efforts to restoring peace in the region. He also reminded of the hike in funding for the northeast’s development from ₹83,000 crore in the past to ₹3,13,375 crore now.

Mr. Shah referred to major projects such as the 2,000-km Arunachal Frontier Highway while referring to the Centre’s attention on Arunachal Pradesh where road projects worth ₹50,000 crore were sanctioned within five years. He lauded Chief Minister Pema Khandu for his development initiatives and the war against corruption.

China had earlier objected to Mr. Shah’s visit saying his trip violated Beijing’s “territorial sovereignty and sabotaged political mutual trust”. Beijing routinely protests the visit of any Indian leader to Arunachal Pradesh to highlight its claim over the State.

Mr. Shah also faced protests in Itanagar, though security forces kept the protesters off the main route. “Many students and locals nevertheless gathered to voice their anger at the egocentric decision of implementing the CAA and violent crackdowns on anti-CAA protesters across universities,” Kumar Rai, general secretary of the Rajiv Gandhi University Students’ Union told The Hindu from the university at Doimukh near Itanagar.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/4rxwpo/article30870764.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDAMITSHAH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/amit-shah-allays-fears-in-northeast-about-article-371/article30870765.ece
69,2020/02/20,"Trump's India visit: Not 70 lakh, but one lakh to attend roadshow in Ahmedabad","The number is much less than what the U.S. President has been claiming

Nearly one lakh people are expected to line up along the 22-km route of the roadshow of U.S. President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Ahmedabad on February 24, officials said on February 20.

The number is much less than what the U.S. President has been claiming.

In a recent video, Mr. Trump said, “7 million [70 lakh]” people will be there on the roadshow route.

Notably, the total population of Ahmedabad is estimated to be around 70 to 80 lakh.

Ahmedabad Municipal Commissioner Vijay Nehra on February 19 said the number of those expected to be present at the roadshow will be “around one lakh”.

In a tweet a few days back, Mr. Nehra estimated the same figure.

“MaruAmdavad says #NamasteTrump #IndiaRoadShow is getting bigger & bigger. More than 1 lakh participants already confirmed for the 22 km roadshow. Great opportunity for #Ahmedabad to present Indian Culture to the World. Keep following @AmdavadAMC for more details,” he said in a tweet on February 16.

As per the roadshow route plan, Mr. Trump and Mr. Modi will first reach the Sabarmati Ashram, a place closely associated with Mahatma Gandhi, from the Ahmedabad international airport.

From the Sabarmati Ashram, both the leaders would take the SP Ring Road via Indira Bridge near the airport to reach the newly-built cricket stadium in Motera area of the city.

Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani had earlier posted a video on his Twitter account, saying the “world’s oldest democracy would meet the world’s largest democracy on February 24” when Mr. Trump would address a large gathering at the cricket stadium along with Mr. Modi.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/drhba5/article30872758.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-TRUMP-VIJAYSONEJI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/not-70-lakh-but-one-lakh-to-attend-trump-roadshow/article30870556.ece
70,2020/02/20,LPG prices may come down next month: Pradhan,"The prices rose due to the international market, says Union Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas

Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Thursday said LPG prices may come down next month.

The Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas, and Steel, who is on a two-day visit to Chhattisgarh, was talking to reporters on his arrival at the Swami Vivekananda Airport.

Replying to a query about the constant rise in LPG prices, Mr. Pradhan said, “This is not true that the price (of LPG) is constantly increasing. This month it was hiked due to the international market. However, there are indications that the prices may come down next month.”

During the winters, LPG consumption increases, which creates a pressure on the sector. This month, the price increased while next month it will reduce, he said.

Last week, cooking gas LPG price hiked by a steep ₹144.5 per cylinder due to spurt in benchmark global rates of the fuel. However, to insulate the domestic users, the government almost doubled the subsidy it provides on the fuel to keep per cylinder outgo almost unchanged.

During his two-day tour, Mr. Pradhan will visit the Bhilai Steel Plant (BSP) located in Durg district of the state and hold meetings with the plant officials, union representatives and others.

He will also visit iron ore mines of the Bhilai Steel Plant in Dallirajhra town of neighbouring Balod district and lay the foundation of a beneficiation plant there.

“BSP holds an important place in our country’s steel industry, especially for Indian Railways as it meets 98 per cent of the requirement of rail...How we can further improve the production capacity of the plant will be discussed with its officials during my visit,” the Union minister said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/oxep4q/article30869904.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DHARMENDRAPRADHAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/lpg-prices-may-come-down-next-month-says-dharmendra-pradhan/article30869905.ece

Senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor on Thursday urged the Congress Working Committee (CWC) to hold leadership elections to “energise workers and inspire voters”.

Mr. Tharoor’s appeal came in support of his party colleague and former MP Sandeep Dikshit’s remarks that the the biggest challenge the party faces is the “leadership question”.

Mr. Dikshit has accused senior leaders of failing to find a new president after all these months because they are “scared who will bell the cat”.

Reacting to the remarks, Mr. Tharoor tweeted, “What Sandeep Dikshit said openly is what dozens of party leaders from across the country are saying privately, including many with responsible positions in the party. I renew my appeal to CWC to hold leadership elections to energise workers and inspire voters.”

“Some have asked who should vote and for what. I was referring to my earlier call eight months ago for elections among the 10,000 party workers who constitute the ‘AICC plus PCC delegates’ list. These should be for the elected seats in the CWC as well as for the party presidency,” Mr. Tharoor said.

In an interview to PTI last year, Mr. Tharoor had said the way forward for the party could be opening up all key posts, including the CWC membership, to fresh elections which would help legitimise the incoming set of leaders.

73,2020/02/20,Nirbhaya case convict Vinay Sharma claims mental illness,"Vinay injured himself by banging his head against a wall of his cell in Tihar Jail, according to prison officials

A Delhi court on Thursday sought response from Tihar jail authorities on a plea by one of the four death row convicts in the Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case, seeking better treatment for his claimed mental illness, schizophrenia and head and arm injuries.

Additional Session Judge Dharmender Rana directed the prison authorities to file its reply on the plea by Vinay Kumar Sharma on Saturday.

Vinay injured himself by banging his head against a wall of his cell in Tihar Jail, according to prison officials.

The incident happened in jail number 3 on Sunday afternoon, they said, adding that he got some minor injuries and was treated inside the prison premises.

During the hearing, the prosecution opposed the plea saying it was not maintainable.

Counsel for Vinay told the court that he was refusing to recognise people, including his mother.

The plea claimed that when Sharma’s counsel visited him in the prison on the request of his family members, he found that he had sustained grievous head injury, fracture in his right arm with plaster and was suffering from “insanity”, “mental illness” and “schizophrenia“.

Vinay could not identify his counsel and his mother in jail, it said.

The petition further claimed that he was having “decreased sleep” for a long time and was referred to senior psychiatrist in view of drug dependence.

The court had on February 17 issued fresh death warrants for March 3 at 6 am against the four death row convicts in the Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case.

A senior prison official said Vinay Sharma hit his head once and the security officials who were outside the cell immediately went inside preventing him from doing it for the second time. Sharma did not get injured in the incident, he added.

Sources said the convict was “perhaps trying to create a medical record to present before the court”.

PTI adds:

The court was informed that Vinay was on hunger strike in Tihar jail but he later broke the strike. It directed the jail superintendent to take appropriate care of Vinay as per law.

Vinay’s lawyer had told the court that the convict was assaulted in jail and has head injuries, adding that he was suffering from acute mental illness and hence the death sentence cannot be carried out.

The court rejected the ground of “mental illness”, saying that the issues was raised before the apex court and it rejected the plea on the basis of the report submitted by the doctors, who said the convict was “psychologically well adjusted” and the “general condition of the petitioner is stable”.

According to sources, with the date of execution approaching, the mental health of the four convicts are being regularly checked by doctors.

75,2020/02/20,Citizenship Amendment Act will cause Muslims to face exclusion: U.S. panel on religions,"“CAA is a done deal. It’s not going to change. The Prime Minister has also made it clear that India will not budge an inch on this issue,” said an official source in response to the USCIRF’s comments on the CAA and the NRC.

Days before U.S. President Donald Trump is due in India, the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) released a fact sheet on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

“There are serious concerns that the CAA serves as a protective measure for non-Muslims in case of exclusion from a nationwide National Register of Citizens (NRC),” the USCIRF says. “This purpose is evident from BJP politicians’ rhetoric. With the CAA in place, Muslims would primarily bear the punitive consequences of exclusion from the NRC which could include ‘statelessness, deportation, or prolonged detention,’ according to three United Nations Special Rapporteurs.”

Also read | Citizenship Amendment Act may leave Muslims stateless, says U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres

However, official sources in New Delhi said the new citizenship law was an internal matter that would stay. “CAA is a done deal. It’s not going to change. The Prime Minister has also made it clear that India will not budge an inch on this issue,” said the source in response to USCIRF’s comments on the CAA and the NRC.

On the possibilities that Mr. Trump might raise uncomfortable issues like mediation during visit, an official spokesperson said, “On all these issues our position is well known to the U.S. side. Time and again we have communicated with them — the State Department, the White House and the Congress — about our sensitivities. Our position is well known and we hope that things will go on smoothly during the visit. And, we don’t see any such problem.”

The USCIRF report raised serious concerns about comments from various BJP leaders about the party’s intention to create a new, exclusively Hindu country in India.

The report also highlighted comments from various members of the BJP who expressed plans to exclude Muslims from India.

“Hindutva political rhetoric questions the legitimacy of Muslims’ Indian citizenship and perpetuates the further marginalisation of this faith community. The BJP Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh Yogi Adityanath, for example, promised in 2005 to cleanse India of other religions, calling this the ‘century of Hindutva’,” said the USCIRF.

The document also cited extensively from concerns expressed by the UN reports and observations that have described the controversial CAA as biased against the minority Muslim community of India.

A Wednesday tweet from the USCIRF— which is an independent bi-partisan commission established by the U.S. Congress — calls the CAA “a significant downward turn in religious freedom” in India.

The fact sheet says of the CAA: “The law’s passage sparked large-scale protests across the country that provoked a harsh and deadly crackdown by police forces.”

“A wide variety of political parties, non-governmental organisations, and religious groups also submitted petitions to the Supreme Court challenging the CAA’s constitutionality, arguing that it, in particular, violates Section 14 (equality before the law) of the Indian Constitution… Alongside the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), the United Nations (UN) High Commissioner for Human Rights, the U.S. Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom, and the House Foreign Affairs Committee similarly expressed their concern about the law,” the fact sheet says. There is also a reference to Home Minister Amit Shah’s comments. He is quoted as saying the government would “selectively throw out all infiltrators.”

On Friday morning, USCIRF tweeted out a fact sheet on religious freedom in China, saying, “USCIRF’s new fact sheet on China’s regulation of religious groups provides a brief overview of the new regulation and explains why it marks a significant escalation in the Chinese government’s ongoing crackdown on religious freedom.”

India is a Tier 2 country in terms of religious freedom (the second poorest ranking group) and China is a Tier 1 ‘Country of Particular Concern’ (the category that fares poorest in terms of religious freedoms) as per current USCIRF rankings.

79,2020/02/20,"India ranks 77th on sustainability, 131st in child flourishing index rankings: UN report","The report commissioned by the WHO, UNICEF and the Lancet assess the capacity of 180 countries on the issue

India ranked 77th on a sustainability index that takes into account per capita carbon emissions and ability of children in a nation to live healthy lives and secures 131st spot on a flourishing ranking that measures the best chance at survival and well-being for children, according to a UN-backed report.

The report was released on Wednesday by a commission of over 40 child and adolescent health experts from around the world. It was commissioned by the World Health Organization (WHO), UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and The Lancet medical journal.

In the report assessing the capacity of 180 countries to ensure that their youngsters can survive and thrive, India ranks 77th on the Sustainability Index and 131 on the Flourishing Index, it said.

Flourishing is the geometric mean of Surviving and Thriving. For Surviving, the authors selected maternal survival, survival in children younger than 5 years old, suicide, access to maternal and child health services, basic hygiene and sanitation, and lack of extreme poverty.

For Thriving, the domains were educational achievement, growth and nutrition, reproductive freedom, and protection from violence.

Under the Sustainability Index, the authors noted that promoting today’s national conditions for children to survive and thrive must not come at the cost of eroding future global conditions for children’s ability to flourish.

The Sustainability Index ranks countries on excess carbon emissions compared with the 2030 target. This provides a convenient and available proxy for a country’s contribution to sustainability in future.

The report noted that under realistic assumptions about possible trajectories towards sustainable greenhouse gas emissions, models predict that global carbon emissions need to be reduced from 39·7 giga tonnes to 22·8 gigatonnes per year by 2030 to maintain even a 66% chance of keeping global warming below 1·5degrees C.

It said that the world’s survival depended on children being able to flourish, but no country is doing enough to give them a sustainable future.

“No country in the world is currently providing the conditions we need to support every child to grow up and have a healthy future,” said Anthony Costello, Professor of Global Health and Sustainability at University College London, one of the lead authors of the report.

“Especially, they’re under immediate threat from climate change and from commercial marketing, which has grown hugely in the last decade,” said Costello — former WHO Director of Mother, Child and Adolescent health.

Norway leads the table for survival, health, education and nutrition rates - followed by South Korea and the Netherlands. Central African Republic, Chad and Somalia come at the bottom.

However, when taking into account per capita CO2 emissions, these top countries trail behind, with Norway 156th, the Republic of Korea 166th and the Netherlands 160th.

Each of the three emits 210 per cent more CO2 per capita than their 2030 target, the data shows, while the U.S., Australia, and Saudi Arabia are among the 10 worst emitters. The lowest emitters are Burundi, Chad and Somalia.

According to the report, the only countries on track to beat CO2 emission per capita targets by 2030, while also performing fairly — within the top 70 — on child flourishing measures are: Albania, Armenia, Grenada, Jordan, Moldova, Sri Lanka, Tunisia, Uruguay and Vietnam.

“More than 2 billion people live in countries where development is hampered by humanitarian crises, conflicts, and natural disasters, problems increasingly linked with climate change,” said Minister Awa Coll-Seck from Senegal, Co-Chair of the commission.

The report also highlights the distinct threat posed to children from harmful marketing.

Evidence suggests that children in some countries see as many as 30,000 advertisements on television alone in a single year, while youth exposure to vaping (e-cigarettes) advertisements increased by more than 250% in the U.S. over two years, reaching more than 24 million young people.

Studies in Australia, Canada, Mexico, New Zealand and the U.S. — among many others — have shown that self-regulation has not hampered commercial ability to advertise to children.

Children’s exposure to commercial marketing of junk food and sugary beverages is associated with purchase of unhealthy foods and overweight and obesity, linking predatory marketing to the alarming rise in childhood obesity, it said.

The number of obese children and adolescents increased from 11 million in 1975 to 124 million in 2016 — an 11-fold increase, with dire individual and societal costs, the report said.

To protect children, the authors call for a new global movement driven by and for children.

Specific recommendations include stopping CO2 emissions with the utmost urgency, to ensure children have a future on this planet; placing children and adolescents at the centre of global efforts to achieve sustainable development, the report said.

80,2020/02/20,Uphaar tragedy: no further jail term for Ansal brothers,"Supreme Court dismisses curative plea by victims; The apex court had in August 2015 allowed the Ansals to walk free and asked them to pay a fine of ₹30 crore each

The Supreme Court has dismissed a curative petition filed by the victims of the Uphaar theatre fire tragedy against Sushil and Gopal Ansal for negligence which led to the death of 59 people in 1997.

A three-judge Bench of Chief Justice S.A. Bobde, Justices N.V. Ramana and Arun Mishra found no merit in the curative plea filed by the Association of Victims of Uphaar Tragedy. The petition was decided in the chambers. The order is dated February 13 and published on Thursday (February 20).

In 2017, in a majority judgment of 2:1, the court had partially reviewed its original judgment of 2015 and decided to send real estate baron Gopal Ansal back to jail for a year while sparing his elder brother Sushil from serving time behind bars due to his advanced age.

The majority decision had come on separate review petitions filed by the CBI against the 2015 judgment of the Supreme Court which had allowed the Ansals to walk free after directing them to pay a total compensation of ₹60 crore.

In its judgment on the review petitions, the court had noted that Gopal Ansal had already spent four months and 20 days in prison. It had set off this period from his jail term and ordered him to serve the rest of the prison sentence.

Deciding the review the court had further taken into consideration the fact that Sushil Ansal had already served over five months in jail and granted remission. The court had found that for a man of his age — Sushil is in his late 70s — and physical ailments, the punishment would suffice.

The court had upheld the 2015 judgment’s direction to the Ansals to pay a total compensation of ₹60 crore, saying it was not excessive.

The upcoming visit of the U.S President Donald Trump is bringing into sharper focus growing military ties between New Delhi and Washington to bolster India’s heft in the Indo-Pacific, and substantiate joint operations by the Army, Navy and the Indian Air Force (IAF).

India’s decision ahead of Mr. Trump’s visit to India, which begins on February 24, to clear the purchase of 24 MH-60R helicopters is part on an exercise to dial up the Navy’s credence in the Indo-Pacific. The new choppers, which can be launched from a variety of warships, including frigates and destroyers, will beef up capacity to hunt submarines using advanced airborne low-frequency sonar (ALFS) for detection, and torpedoes for destruction. The Hellfire missiles carried by these helicopters can also strike land targets. The MH-60Rs will replace the seventies vintage Sea King anti-submarine helicopters.

But the Navy’s acquisition of the eight U.S. built P8I planes has been a game changer in scanning and exercising dominance in parts of the Indo-Pacific. These powerful maritime patrol planes, which are based in Arakkonam, to counter surface and submarine threats, are digitally co-linked with the P8A aircraft with the U.S. navy. This collaboration which was possible after New Delhi and Washington signed the Communications, Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA) in September 2018, has sharpened the Navy’s awareness of the Indo-Pacific to a new level. An additional six P8Is are pending approval by the Cabinet Committee of Security (CCS).

The induction of U.S. weapons in the maritime domain is expected to feed into the impending formation of the Indian Ocean centred Peninsular Theatre Command, which could be formed with the merger of the Eastern and Western naval commands. During a press conference on Monday, Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat stressed that the navy should look at the “big picture,” pointing out that the “Indian Ocean Region is one entity.”

Apache helicopters

The Indo-U.S. military collaboration is also adding more teeth along the land borders with Pakistan and China. The IAF operates 22 U.S.-built Apache attack helicopters — a platform which, accompanying strike corps, is especially useful for carrying out offensive low-level air strikes against armoured columns in the Thar desert area. The Apaches can also be connected with AWACS — the eyes in the sky — to sharpen monitoring, and quicken decision-making, in a highly fluid battle zone.

Ahead of the Mr. Trump’s visit, the CCS is considering clearing the induction of six more Apache helicopters which are likely to be deployed by the Army. “Eventually the government is inclined to establish a common tri-service pool of assets, which can be deployed by theatre commanders for joint operations as required,” a highly placed government source said.

India has already contracted from the U.S., 15 Chinook heavy lift helicopters, which can carry 9.6 tonnes of load. These helicopters — a replacement for the Russian Mi-26 choppers — can sling M777 Ultra-Light Howitzers, which have been inducted recently into the Indian Army, playing an especially useful role along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), where the Indian road and communication network is weak.

The IAF already operates the C-17 strategic heavy lift planes, sourced from the U.S. for transporting large number of personnel and equipment. Besides, the IAF’s fleet of C-130 planes with India is especially useful in the eastern sector for inducting special forces, because of its ability to take off and land from short and unprepared airstrips.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/va2w8h/article29487090.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Modi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/analysis-donald-trumps-upcoming-visit-sharpens-focus-on-indo-pacific-military-ties/article30867169.ece

83,2020/02/20,Jaishankar holds ‘very good meeting’ with German counterpart; discusses counter-terrorism,"The External Affairs Minister, who also inaugurated the Indian pavilion at the Berlin International Film Festival, thanked the German Foreign Minister for his country’s “strong support” for the expanded India-EU cooperation.

External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar on Wednesday held a “very good meeting” with his German counterpart Heiko Maas, and discussed a range of bilateral and global issues including counter-terrorism, climate change, multilateralism, connectivity and technology among others.

Mr. Jaishankar, who also inaugurated the Indian pavilion at the Berlin International Film Festival, thanked the German Foreign Minister for his country’s “strong support” for the expanded India-EU cooperation.

In his interaction with reporters, he said: “We have had a very good discussion this afternoon. I think if my memory serves me right, this is the fifth time in the last six months we are meeting, in New York, in Paris, in India, in Munich and now out here“.

Speaking about the Munich Security Conference earlier in the week, Mr. Jaishankar said it was the first time that an Indian foreign minister participated.

“Today we had an opportunity really to sit down and review our bilateral relations, regional issues, global issues.

“And apart from the meeting today, yesterday I also had a meeting with the Minister of Defence, Kramp-Karrenbauer, and with the minister of the Economy and Energy Minister Altmaier and a lot of these discussions are about taking forward our strategic partnership and building on the discussions which our Prime Minister (Narendra Modi) and (German) Chancellor (Angela) Merkel had at the fifth India-Germany intergovernmental consultations in India last year,” he said.

Mr. Jaishankar said India and Germany have a very broad based relationships, more than 30 mechanisms between the two countries and these are mechanisms not only between governments but also there are aspects of it which impact students, professionals, economy, business, people to people, civil society.

“Where the foreign policy is concerned, what I do want to emphasize today is that as liberal democracies our common values to help us in achieving the convergences, in terms of how we evaluate global challenges and opportunities and we certainly do discuss shared concerns like terrorism, extremism, I think on many of these we have common evaluations and clearly a stronger working relationship,” he said.

According to Mr. Jaishankar, most of their discussions focused on bilateral and global issues, some of them included multilateralism, connectivity, climate change, technology issues, counter-terrorism issues.

“We also spent a little time discussing India and the EU, a relationship in which we greatly value the role and influence of Germany.

“We had a discussion on what we call the Indo-Pacific, where I shared our perspectives on Afghanistan, on the Middle East and the Gulf. And we discussed our working together in the Alliance for Multilateralism. I conveyed our strong support to the Minister,” the External Affairs Minister said.

He said that in India, “we are very proud of our traditions and confident of our future, and we do believe that future is an internationalist future”.

India appreciates the Alliance for Multilateralism because multilateralism is under threat, under stress from both nationalism and mercantilism, and it believes in the centrality of the UN, in the relevance of the WTO to international trade, Jaishankar said, adding that the country believes multilateralism should be recognised, preserved and protected.

“Now, as liberal democracies we also share with Germany our belief that adherence to international law is critical. If regimes and institutions are to be credible, they must also be contemporary and we therefore also discussed how to expedite the reforms of the United Nations including the UN Security Council.

“I was very gratified to hear from the minister the support for two initiatives that India has taken, multilateral initiatives, the International Solar Alliance and the Coalition For Disaster Resilient Infrastructure. I will certainly welcome greater German interest and participation,” he added.

On Tuesday in Brussels, he met top leaders of the European Union and held wide-ranging talks on key issues such as combating terrorism, climate change and enhancing economic cooperation, that would “benefit both India and the EU”.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kwh11m/article30865089.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/JAI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/jaishankar-holds-very-good-meeting-with-german-counterpart-discusses-counter-terrorism/article30865090.ece

IndiGo’s Delhi-Jeddah flight was forced to turn back just before takeoff after a passenger attempted to open one of the doors, according to a DGCA official.

The incident happened on Tuesday when the flight was taxiing for take-off. The passenger tried to open the door demanding that two of his co-passengers denied boarding for not possessing the boarding pass be allowed on the plane, according to the official.

“The captain of the flight decided to return to bay and offload the passenger and his accomplice for their unruly behaviour,” according to the source.

“A group of 110 passengers of the connecting flight from Srinagar were travelling on this flight. Two of them were offloaded at the boarding gate as they had lost their boarding pass,” he said.

A Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) official, however, said the two passengers had failed to show up at the boarding gate on time. Thereafter, three more women passengers accompanying these men were allowed to deboard.

85,2020/02/20,Only ‘Namaste Trump’ do for U.S. President in Ahmedabad,"To fit in a Taj Mahal visit, he may leave the city early.

‘Namaste Trump’, a mega event at Motera cricket stadium, seems to be the only engagement U.S. President Donald Trump will have in Ahmedabad on February 24.

Earlier, Sabarmati Ashram and then a high-profile event at the motor stadium, besides inauguration of the world’s largest cricket stadium, were on the itinerary during the President’s visit to Ahmedabad.

Inauguration put off

However, the inauguration of the stadium built by the Gujarat Cricket Association, once headed by Narendra Modi when he was the Chief Minister and subsequently by Amit Shah, has been postponed. Now, only the ‘Namaste Trump’ event is slated at the stadium, while its inauguration will be held later.

Moreover, the visit to the Sabarmati Ashram has also apparently disappeared from the President’s itinerary. According to sources, Mr. Trump and the First Lady will pay tributes to Mahatma Gandhi at Raj Ghat in New Delhi on February 25.

“It appears that since the President and the First Lady want to see Taj Mahal at Agra, they will leave early from Ahmedabad,” a top government official involved in the preparations for the visit told The Hindu.

86,2020/02/20,U.S. Congressmen concerned over Kashmir,"Ami Bera and George Holding discuss contentious issues with the Indian government

Days before President Donald Trump’s visit to India, two senior U.S. Congressmen have expressed their concerns to the government over the situation in Kashmir and protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act.

Representative Ami Bera, who is the Chairman of the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Sub-Committee on Asia-Pacific, and Representative George Holding, who is a co-chair of the India Caucus in the House, were part of a bipartisan delegation visiting the region, and said they had discussed both contentious issues with the Indian government, and the U.S.’s plans for Afghanistan and maritime security in the Indo-Pacific.

“It is our desire and interest to see a resolution [to the Kashmir issue] and a return to normalcy. We did convey that [to the government] and I expressed my concerns over the continued detention of political prisoners in Kashmir,” Mr. Bera, who belongs to the Democratic Party, told a small group of journalists during their visit to Delhi.

Mr. Holding, a Republican Congressman, said he shared Mr. Bera’s assessment and concerns, but added that he was “heartened” by the description given by government officials of the economic redevelopment plans for Jammu and Kashmir.

The statements by the Congressmen are significant not just because they were made on the eve of Mr. Trump’s visit to India, but because they were made after they had been briefed by the U.S. embassy officials on the situation in Jammu and Kashmir after the amendments to Article 370 last August.

Last month, U.S. Ambassador Kenneth Juster had been part of a delegation of envoys that were taken to Srinagar and Jammu to assess the levels of “normalcy” on the ground. The Congressmen said they also would like to take a Congressional delegation to J&K at the earliest.

Normalcy steps

However, a government source said that during their meetings with the government, the two congressmen had acknowledged that the situation in J&K was very different from last year, and had been told about various initiatives to restore normalcy in the Union Territory. On Tuesday, the Ministry of External Affairs tweeted that Mr. Bera and Mr. Holding had met Foreign Secretary Harsh Shringla and “discussed strengthening ties & regional developments,” but didn’t give any further details.

Speaking to journalists, Mr. Bera said they had also spoken about the protests against the CAA and the “pushback against it”. “It was important to speak to senior Indian officials to get their assessment of the reasons for the decision. As an Indian-American, my pride comes from India’s founding as a secular democracy,” Mr. Bera said, adding that as the largest democracy and the oldest democracy, India and the U.S. shared the understanding that “protecting minorities is important”.

The U.S. Congressional delegation, which had visited Colombo prior to Delhi and is travelling to Kathmandu next, is also studying some of the “common challenges” India and the U.S. face, said Mr. Holding, including “similar challenges from China, fighting terrorism around the world, and the radicalisation in religions, particularly Islamic radicalism.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/liwnum/article30865112.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/behra-Holding,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/us-congressmen-concerned-over-kashmir/article30865113.ece

88,2020/02/20,MPs panel grills officials on Kashmir,"They were asked how development could reach the region when ‘peace is elusive’.

Members of the parliamentary panel on Home Affairs have posed some tough questions to Home Ministry officials on their claims of getting big-ticket investments in Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.

Opposition MPs asked how could development reach J&K when “peace was elusive”.

J&K is under severe restrictions, including a communication blockade, since August 5.

Union Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla, Additional Secretary Gyanesh Kumar and Jammu and Kashmir Chief Secretary B.V.R. Subrahmanyam briefed the MPs on Wednesday.

The panel, headed by Congress leader Anand Sharma, met to discuss the demands for grants of the Ministry pertaining to the Union Territories. Its final report will be tabled after the Budget session resumes in March.

An MP who attended the meeting said, “The Home Minister had made big announcements on inviting industries and entrepreneurs to J&K. We asked the Ministry officials, ‘Is J&K peaceful now?’. We asked them to ensure peace before making grand plans.”

A day ago, the bypolls to over 12,000 panchayat seats were deferred following “credible inputs from the law enforcement agencies”.

Plans for the future

Other Opposition MPs asked what was the government’s road map for J&K.

“The Ministry officials were asked if they have infrastructure in place? Do they have a planning Board to oversee investments. They replied it was a work in progress... All the assurances were for the future not the present,” another MP said.

He added that laggard infrastructure in Ladakh was also discussed.

The J&K administration is planning a three-day Global Investors’ Summit in Srinagar and Jammu in April to highlight investment opportunities in 14 sectors to boost manufacturing and generate employment.

Senior officials have fanned out to various parts of the country to organise roadshows and meetings to convince the business community to invest in the Union Territory.

Company’s head of commercial vehicle business Saju Nair also inaugurated the first of its kind Ape’ Electric Experience Centre at Seetharamapuram here on Thursday.

Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Saju Nair said Vijayawada being one of the rapidly growing commercial hubs in the State was a strategic market for Piaggio and Ape’ E-City offers the best value in the class.

“Considering the State government’s focus on promoting sustainable mobility, Ape E-City is the right choice for Vijayawada where three-wheelers are one of the primary modes of last-mile transportation,” he said.

“To ensure customer convenience, we have already installed two swappable charging stations in Vijayawada and are planning to install three more shortly,” he said.

The PVPL team later met Transport Commissioner P. Seetharamanjaneyulu who launched the E-City at his office.

90,2020/02/20,Srikalahasteeswara temple decked up for Sivaratri,"Arrangements in place for smooth darshan for devotees

Srikalahasteeswara temple in Srikalahasti town, which is famous as ‘Dakshina Kasi’, was abuzz with hectic activity on Thursday on the eve of Maha Sivaratri.

The temple was tastefully decorated with a variety of exotic flowers and rich fruits. Colourful ‘rangolis’ on the temple floor offered a visual treat to the visiting crowd. The eye-catching illumination all over the temple and the installation of divine images and cut-outs depicting mythological episodes in the form of serial lighting added to the festive grandeur.

Biyyapu Madhusudhan Reddy, MLA, held a meeting with the officials of the temple, police, municipality, and revenue and inspected the arrangements such as medical facilities, queue lines and barricades in view of the heavy rush expected to congregate at the shrine. He also personally monitored the child tagging process taken up by the Police Department to keep track of toddlers and safeguard them from child-lifters. Anticipating heavy turnout, the temple management got ‘laddus’ prepared in large quantities, to be distributed to devotees.

At Srinivasa Mangapuram, the celestial deities -- the Sun and the Moon -- came down as Surya Prabha and Chandra Prabha processions were observed in the morning and evening respectively, as part of the ongoing annual Brahmotsavams here.

Significance

The special feature of Surya Prabha procession was the decoration of the deity of Sri Kalyana Venkateswara as ‘Dhanvantari’, the god of health in Hindu mythology.

As Sun is also considered bestower of health and wisdom, it is believed by the devout that taking a glimpse of this procession would augur well for the society.

Similarly, the Moon spreading cool light is considered to calm down the mind and offer soothing relief. Hence Chandra Prabha is depicted in the form of a silvery halo behind the deity. Between the two processions, ‘Snapana Tirumanjanam’ (celestial bath) was performed with milk, curd, ghee, sandal, turmeric, and coconut water to the deities of Kalyana Venkateswara and His consorts Sridevi and Bhudevi.

At Sri Kapileswara temple, the seventh day of the annual Brahmotsavam, saw the deity being taken on Kalpa Vriksha Vahanam, resembling the wish-fulfilling tree. The procession started at Kapila Theertham and passed via Anna Rao Circle, Hare Krishna Road, Alipiri Road, to return to the temple. The deity was taken on ‘Aswa Vahanam’ (horse) in the evening, which turned a symbol of valour and majesty.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/pcarlg/article30873670.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21ONGSRIKALAHASTI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/srikalahasteeswara-temple-decked-up-for-sivaratri/article30873671.ece

92,2020/02/20,Roja faces wrath of Amaravati protesters,"Mob surrounds her car at SRM University, demands that she support their demand against shifting of capital

Andhra Pradesh Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (APIIC) chairperson R.K. Roja on Thursday faced the wrath of protesters outside the SRM University at Neerukonda village in Thullur mandal. Ms. Roja was returning from the University after attending an industry-academia meeting at the university.

A large of number of protesters, including women, gathered outside the university and surrounded Ms. Roja’s car demanding that she express her support to the agitation for retaining Amaravati as the Capital.

Taken aback by the sheer number of protesters, Ms. Roja sat in the car. Additional police forces were rushed but it took an hour for the police to reach the village.

Later, speaking to reporters at the party central party office, Ms. Roja alleged that the attack was orchestrated by the “cronies” of TDP chief N. Chandrababu Naidu.

Stating that Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy was committed to the welfare of the farmers in Amaravati region and hence increased the annuity from ₹2,500 to ₹5,000 and extended it to 15 years, she said there was no question of neglecting Amaravati as it would be the legislative capital of the State.

“Farmers should question the TDP leaders and former ministers Prathipati Pulla Rao, Narayana and Lokesh for betraying them with false promises. In all the five years of TDP rule, Naidu showed graphics to the public and constructed temporary buildings. If the protests continue, no investor will come forward to set up an institution in Amaravati. The public should remain calm and maintain peace,” she said.

She alleged that Mr. Naidu left the State with a debt of about ₹3 lakh crore. “It is evident that TDP leaders had grabbed over 4,000 acres of land in Amaravati alone. In the last five years, Mr. Naidu built only temporary offices with hundreds of crores and he is confined to 29 villages. Keeping all this in mind, the Chief Minister took up decentralisation to develop all 13 districts equally,” she said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/h5f6b/article30872192.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21VJROJA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/roja-faces-wrath-of-amaravati-protesters/article30872193.ece
93,2020/02/20,Jewellery theft probe unearths bigger gold racket in Anantapur,"Eight held, 2.5 kg of gold seized; police alert I-T Dept. on another 2.5 kg of unaccounted for gold with two traders

Anantapur district police personnel cracked the gold theft case of Tadipatri town by arresting eight persons involved in it and recovered 2.5 kg of gold jewellery, six two-wheelers and nine cellular phones on Thursday. The value of the recovered material was more than ₹1 crore, Superintendent of Police B. Satya Yesu Babu told reporters here.

Tadipatri police personnel led by Deputy Superintendent of Police A. Srinivasulu not only cracked the theft case but also busted illegal gold jewellery trade running in the district. They coordinated with the Income Tax officials and provided them information regarding unaccounted for gold jewellery weighing more than 5 kg, which is valued at more than ₹2 crore.

Three persons on a two-wheeler snatched a bag containing 3 kg of gold jewellery from businessmen Shafi and Abdul Rahim hailing from Nellore, in Tadipatri on January 28 in broad daylight. The traders immediately lodged a complaint with the local police leading to this recovery in three weeks, the SP said.

Meticulous plan

The businessmen were in Tadipatri to sell gold ornaments to different outlets on January 27 and 28, and they were among many such agents who supply gold and gold ornaments to local retailers. The key accused and leader of the eight-member gang, Nasiruddin Shabbir, was an accountant in Meda Jewellers in Tadipatri town and he knew people who sold gold without proper documents. He planned to rob such gold from the two brothers (businessmen) from Nellore as he thought they could not complain to the police, the DSP said.

Mr. Shabbir along with his friends Talari Sudhir Kumar and Mohammed Maqdoom, who were all in need of quick money to finance their vices and luxuries, came together to hatch the meticulous theft plan proposed by Shabbir and roped in five others to execute it. They formed into three teams and the first one was a pick-up party, the second one information party and the third set took care of coordination and monitoring.

While the information party members Manjula Anjaneyulu, 24, and Singamaneni Harikrishna, 24, kept a watch on the movement of the businessmen duo, coordination team members T. Sudhir Kumar, 24, Shabbir, 33, and Maqdoom, 33, watched the surroundings of the path the duo took while going to a hotel for lunch and passed on the information to pick-up team members Gooty Mallikarjun, 26, Koppulakrishna Mohan Reddy, 24, and Mallayyagari Muniswamy, 23.

After snatching the bag, the three fled to Kasapuram village and got themselves tonsured there at a temple to change their look. However, the police noticed the movement of Shabbir and two other gang members to and fro several times at one of the gold shops in CCTV cameras where the theft had taken place and cracked the mystery.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/jewellery-theft-probe-unearths-bigger-gold-racket-in-anantapur/article30872027.ece

96,2020/02/20,Ensure water from Veligonda by August: Jagan tells officials,"Go for reverse tendering to avoid delays, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister tells officials

Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has directed officials and contractors concerned to speedily execute the first phase of the Pula Subbaiah Veligonda project and release water to people during the coming kharif season.

Chairing a review meeting to assess the progress of works at the project site in Prakasam district on Thursday, the Chief Minister assured them of releasing the required funds. “Water for drinking and irrigation needs should flow from Nallamallasagar by August at any cost,” he said.

Mr. Jagan noted that drilling of tunnel I had been completed up to a distance of 1.4 km in the last 8 months as against 600 metres done during the previous Telugu Desam Party regime, leaving another 1 km of the total 18.820 km tunnel to be completed.

Reason for delay

As the officials explained the reasons for the delay in carrying out head regulator works in view of the high water level in Srisailam reservoir, the Chief Minister wanted them to take up the works during March/April and complete them on a war-footing.

Making it clear that any delay in execution of different works, including pending stretch of feeder channels would not be tolerated, Mr. Jagan wanted the officials to go for reverse tendering, if needed, to avoid delays. Officials gave an indication that drilling of tunnel I would be completed during June/July.

Ayacut

The Chief Minister gave his nod for creating an ayacut of 11,500 acres in Pulalacheruvu in Yerragondapalem Assembly segment represented by Education Minister A. Suresh for lifting of water for lands in Papinenipalli as sought by Giddalur YSRCP MLA Anna Ram Babu.

YSR Congress Party MLA from Kandukur M. Mahidhar Reddy wanted the Chief Minister to stablise the ayacut by arranging water from Veligonda project to Ralapadu reservoir, while party MLA from Darsi M. Venugopala Rao pleaded for allocation of water from Veligonda for orchards in Donakonda region.

The Jagan Mohan Reddy government was keen on speedily completing Veligonda, one of the prestigious projects taken up by the former Chief Minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy under ‘Jalayaganam’ to drought-proof the district, Mr. Suresh said after the meeting.

The first phase of the project had been designed to irrigate 1.19 lakh acres and provide drinking water to four lakh people by drawing 10 tmcft of water from the foreshore of Srisailam reservoir at an estimated cost of ₹1234.49 crore. Phase I works were divided into four engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) packages, and all the works were in different stages of execution, the officials explained.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/fxtty2/article30871416.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21VJVELIGONDA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ensure-water-from-veligonda-by-august-jagan-tells-officials/article30871417.ece
97,2020/02/20,"Release White Paper on sale plan of thermal plants, demands A.P. Power Employees’ JAC","Previous governments’ policies have hit AP-Genco’s thermal plants, the APERC did not fix the tariffs on a ‘Cost- to-Serve’ basis, and the managements gave a wrong projection of revenue requirement by appointing KPMG as a consultant, they allege.

The Andhra Pradesh Power Employees’ Joint Action Committee (APPEJAC) demanded the government release a White Paper on its plans to sell off Rayalaseema Thermal Power Plant (RTPP) and Sri Damodaram Sanjeevaiah Thermal Power Station (SDSTPS) to private players on the pretext that they are unviable. Also, on solar power plants of 10,000 MW proposed to be constructed by AP Green Energy Corporation Limited (APGECL).

In a letter to Energy Secretary N. Srikant, APPEJAC Chairman P. Chandrasekhar and Convener M. Vedavyasa Rao said the policies of the previous governments have adversely affected AP-Genco’s thermal plants, the AP Electricity Regulatory Commission did not fix the tariffs on a ‘Cost- to-Serve’ basis, and the managements gave a wrong projection of revenue requirement by appointing KPMG as a consultant.

‘Unsustainable’ ruse

The power sector has since been shown as unsustainable and RTPP and SDSTPS were contemplated to be given away to private parties or other PSUs.

The APPEJAC said AP-Genco was unable to arrange adequate quantities of good quality coal and by insisting that the Letter of Credit (LoC) payments can be made only to the Central PSUs, Independent Power Producers (IPPs) and renewable energy generators, the Government of India contributed to the overall poor performance of AP-Genco plants.

Power play

Consequently, AP-Genco plants did not have money to fend for themselves. A combination of factors pushed the power sector into a major crisis creating panic among nearly 85,000 families (serving permanent employees, pensioners and outsourced employees).

The JAC further stated that Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy appeared to be misled on the cost of 10,000-MW solar energy capacity to be created by APGECL as the unit cost was projected as ₹ 3, whereas the actual cost-to-serve would be up to ₹ 9 by the time the power reaches the consumer as transmission cost, wheeling charges, distribution cost, losses, PGCIL and grid balancỉng charges, stranded PPAs cost etc. are added to it. The AP-Genco should, therefore, carefully plan and steer the sector clear of the problems faced by it, the JAC appealed.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/release-white-paper-of-sale-plan-of-thermal-plants-demand-appejac/article30869244.ece
98,2020/02/20,Jagan asks Discoms to scout for low-cost power,"Focus should be on hydro reverse pumping projects, he says

Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy directed the power distribution companies (Discoms) to reduce their expenditure through all possible means, especially by buying power from companies offering low unit costs. By doing so, they could mitigate the losses, he said, suggesting that the concentration should be on hydro reverse pumping projects.

He pointed out that the cost of power purchased during the TDP regime pushed the Genco and Discoms into the red, and called for efforts to achieve a turnaround in five years.

Speaking at a review meeting on the functioning of the Energy Department on Wednesday at his camp office on Wednesday, Mr. Jagan said the focus should be on solar power plants of 10,000 MW capacity proposed to be set up by the government and that solar and wind power companies offering power at lesser cost should be encouraged so that the pressure on Discoms could be eased.

He instructed the officials to ensure that quality coal was supplied to the thermal power plants of Genco by getting the quality of the coal certified periodically by a third party.

Skill development

The Chief Minister said training should be given to the power sector staff in top class training centres to equip them with the skills which were required for improving operational efficiencies of the power plants and wanted steps for speedy execution of the new thermal units at Krishnapatnam and Dr. Narla Tatarao Thermal Power Station.

The A.P. power utilities should be in a position to sell power in other States, for which a policy needs to be framed and necessary steps taken, he said and added that there should be no scope for corruption.

The Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (APSRTC) is planning to increase the connectivity between Amaravati and Visakhapatnam, the proposed legislative and executive capitals respectively, by operating Volvo buses under the brand name “Dolphin Cruise”.

About 16 such services would be operated, said its Vice-Chairman and Managing Director (VC&MD) Madireddy Pratap.

“The corporation is introducing 22 new Volvo buses of which 16 are Dolphin Cruise buses,” Mr. Pratap said on Wednesday. The RTC is planning to paint its buses with Araku themes, Konaseema coconut orchards, Kuchipudi and Dhimsa dances, noted fabrics, the Prakasam Barrage, Tirupati Lord Venkateswara and the Kanakadurga temples and other paintings depicting the tradition and the culture of the State.

“We have about 600 moving billboards. The corporation is planning to have a tie-up with small firms and artistes. Very soon, passengers can see buses with the themes,” he said.

The corporation would have a tie-up with The Hindu and use the best paintings of students sketched for its supplement. The paintings would be displayed on buses for one year with the name of the student and the educational institution.

Discussions with the representatives of the newspaper were held recently, Mr. Pratap said. The RTC is proposing to purchase 1,000 buses to strengthen the public transport system.

“After discussing the matter with the Transport Minister, the buses will be procured and operated. The fleet strength will then go up to 13,000,” he said, adding the RTC was ferrying 65 lakh passengers every day covering a whopping 44 lakh km.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/qdi1xm/article30866842.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20VJRTCPAINTINGS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/amaravati-vizag-passengers-can-now-cruise-in-comfort/article30866843.ece
100,2020/02/20,Creating comfy zones for street vendors of Machilipatnam,"Masula civic body maps out the initiative with a win-win formula in mind

The Machilipatnam Municipal Corporation (MMC) has mapped urban street vendors, ensuring them protection from eviction apart from guaranteeing their rights as per the Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Act, 2014.

By early February, the civic body had registered as many as 716 street vendors during the field-level survey carried out under the Mission for Elimination of Poverty in Municipal Areas (MEPMA).

According to the MEPMA City Mission data, of the total 716 street vendors, 232 are female. A total of 100 street vendors are engaged in the marketing of fruits, while 33 are selling vegetables which are procured directly from small farmers in the nearby villages.

However, 26 vendors have been found selling handicrafts. At least 19 vendors are selling flowers, mostly jasmine grown in the sandy soils in the Machilipatnam rural area.

MEPMA City Mission Manager (MMC) A. Satyavathi told The Hindu that about 170 more applications had been received from street vendors for registration.

""There are nearly 35-40 street vendors who have migrated from various States. All the registered street vendors will be formed into Common Interest Groups to obtain financial assistance from banks,"" she added.

A suitable location is being identified to relocate some of the street vendors, she said.

The municipal corporation has also constituted Town Vending Committees that would specifically prepare an action plan to help out street vendors engaged in the trade of seafood.

ID cards

""We have started issuing identity cards to registered vendors. Talks are on with banks to provide loans under the Differential Rate of Interest Scheme (DRIS) meant for lower-income families,"" said MMC Commissioner S. Siva Rama Krishna.

The civic body has declared three categories of ""vending zones"" — green, red and amber — as per vehicular movements, administrative locations and various requirements of urban planning.

Port road, three-pillar centre, Azad Road, Chilakalapudi, and Government Hospital centre fall in the ""amber zone"" in which trade is allowed from early hours up to 10 a.m., and from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. every day.

In the green zone covering Koneru Centre, Rythu Bazar, and Z.P. Centre, trade is allowed till late night without any restrictions. However, officially no trading activity is allowed in the red zone — Collector Office Road.

The Street Vendors Act 2014 provides many guarantees, primarily the right to seek a new location in case of rehabilitation. Streamlining of street vending would help the civic body utilise the available space properly.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/7mm90u/article30867690.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MACHILIPATNAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/creating-comfy-zones-for-street-vendors/article30864642.ece
101,2020/02/20,Govt. stifling A.P. development: Tulasi Reddy,"It is deliberately sidestepping the issue of SCS, says AP Congress Committee working president

The Bharatiya Janata Party government at the Centre is holding back the legitimate funds due to Andhra Pradesh, said State Congress Committee working president Narreddy Tulasi Reddy at a press conference at Hindupur on Wednesday.

Taking exception to the BJP government’s lack of concern for the promises made as part of A.P. Reorganisation Act in 2014, Mr. Tulasi Reddy said the State was supposed to get ₹5 lakh crore under 108 different aspects, but in the past six years, the State had been given only ₹16,500 crore.

Continuing his attack on the BJP government, he said while it had conveniently forgotten its promise made to the people of Andhra Pradesh in 2014 to get Special Category Status(SCS), it was now “deliberately” avoiding sanction of the status.

He criticized Telugu Desam Party saying the party did not commensurate sanction of funds for industrialisation or other development activities. Mr. Reddy then accused YSR Congress Party of remaining silent for political convenience after making tall claims to get the status. Mr. Reddy alleged that both TDP and YSRCP were back-stabbing the people of Andhra by bowing down to the BJP bosses in Delhi.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/rho160/article30864623.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20VJTULAIS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/govt-stifling-ap-development-tulasi-reddy/article30864624.ece
102,2020/02/20,A mood of celebration over apex court’s direction,"Pending demand is finally fulfilled: Pralhad Joshi

With the Supreme Court directing the Union government to issue a gazette notification on the verdict of the Mahadayi Water Disputes Tribunal (MWDT) on water allocation for the three riparian states of Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Goa, there was a mood of celebration among the activists, farmers, and leaders of the region.

They distributed sweets in Nargund, Navalgund, and in Hubballi, which have witnessed series of protests extending to several years.

Union Minister of Praliamentary Affairs, Coal and Mines Pralhad Joshi, Water Resources Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi, Industries Minister and district in charge Jagadish Shettar, former Minister and JD(S) leader Basavaraj Horatti, and others expressed happiness over the development, and said that it would pave the way for Karnataka initiating works to get its share of water.

Mr. Joshi has said that the pending demand of the people of the region had been finally fulfilled now and also thanked everyone who had fought for the cause. He has said that he had requested the Union Jal Shakti Minister for initiating necessary steps for issuing notification.

“We welcome the Supreme Court’s direction to the State government as it helps us complete irrigation projects in this region within a short time,” Water Resources Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi said in Belagavi on Thursday.

“Once the permits from the appropriate authorities are obtained, we will take the next step of releasing water into the Malaprabha. Of the 13.42 tmcft available to Karnataka, 8.02 tmcft will be utilised to produce hydro power. After power generation, the water will be released back to the river. As much as 2.18 tmcft will be released from Bandora canal and 1.72 tmcft of water will be released from Kalasa canal into the Malaprabha. As much as 1.5 tmcft will be used to fill the tanks and lakes in the Mahadayi river basin,” he said.

The State will produce additional documents before the court on July 15, to stake claim for the due share of the water from the Mahadayi river, he added.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/f4g9le/article30874119.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21BGCELEBRATIIONS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/a-mood-of-celebration-over-apex-courts-direction/article30874120.ece
103,2020/02/20,‘Modi govt. using religion to divide India’,"Activists say country being pushed to the brink of civil war

Socialist thinkers and activists from various States held a meeting in Belagavi on Thursday as part of a nationwide tour to establish a network of like-minded activists.

They paid their respects at the Gandhi memorial built at Veera Soudha, the venue of the All-India Congress session in 1924. They later held a meeting in the Circuit House.

Leader Arun Kumar Srivatsava, who addressed the media, said that there was a urgent need to organise all socialist, secular and democratic forces around the country as the BJP-led NDA government was pushing India to the brink of a civil war.

“The Modi government is taking several unilateral decisions that can have dangerous consequences. It is using religion to divide the country. There is an urgent need to educate the youth about such nefarious designs of the rulers. The youth have given up protesting in the last few decades and the government no longer cares about the needs of the people. There is a need to create awareness among them about the need for non violent struggle,” he said. M. Suneelam, activist from Madhya Pradesh, said that the ₹47,000-crore trade pact that the BJP government was contemplating to sign with the U.S.A could lead to millions of job losses in the country. Nearly 15 crore people depend on dairy and poultry.

“They will all be left in the streets if the U.S.A. succeeds in forcing India to sign the trade deal. This is the main reason behind the visit of President Donald Trump to India. We should all oppose this,” he said.

He urged the people not to participate in the NPR exercise that is expected to start in Karnataka, and some other States from April 1.

“The Centre has weakened the MGNREGA scheme that would have stabilised the rural economy, given jobs to the poor, and reduced migration to cities. But the government is not doing that. It is spending ₹70,000 crore on NPR, which could have been spent effectively on MGNREGA. This is a dangerous development,” Mr. Suneelam said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/i54m7e/article30874099.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21BGSOCILAIST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/modi-govt-using-religion-to-divide-india/article30874100.ece
104,2020/02/20,‘JD(S) will not bring down State govt.’,"Deve Gowda says the party is now focusing on strengthening it from the grassroot level

The Janata Dal (Secular) will not conspire to bring down the State BJP government, party president H.D. Deve Gowda said here on Wednesday. “A strong regional party is essential for the all-round development of the State. That is why we are focused on building the JD(S) from the grassroot level now. We will need some time for that. We will let the BJP government complete its term. It is in our own interest that it completes its term. If the government falls now and we have to get ready for an election, we will not be able to reorganise our party in such a short time,” he said.

“But the B.S. Yediyurappa government is not functioning properly. The CM himself has admitted that there is rampant corruption in the government. This is not a good sign for the State,” he said.

But he did not support the demand for a White Paper on the State’s finances from the government. “The House has competent leaders like H.D. Kumaraswamy and Siddaramaiah. I am sure they will present all the facts before the House,” he said.

He said that he believed Mr. Siddaramaiah was the reason for the fall of the JDS-Congress coalition government.

“The MLAs who quit the Congress and the JD(S) to join the BJP have admitted that they left for Mumbai only to see that I faced a political defeat. It is clear to see who is behind the fall of the government,” he said.

“We are very happy with the success of the Aam Admi Party in Delhi. We will try to learn some lessons from their political activities including campaigning. But we have no illusions that we will get the number of seats it got,” he said.

“No political leader or party has the capacity to destroy another party. The media, however, has the power to make or mar a leader or a party. The BJP leaders used the CAG report to highlight the failures of the UPA – 2 government. They promoted Narendra Modi saying he had led Gujarat successfully for 12 years. The media, both national and regional, supported the BJP. I hold no grudge against the media. But the situation was like that then,” he said.

“After the victory of the NDA government, we tried to build an alliance of non-BJP parties by bringing together six Chief Ministers and 15 other leaders. But our coalition government did not last. There is no need to go into the details,” he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/hxhwad/article30874091.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21BGHDD1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/jds-will-not-bring-down-state-govt/article30874092.ece

Shouting slogans, members staged a dharna in the well of House before lunch break and continued it after the House proceedings resumed. The members, led by Opposition Leader in the Council S.R.

Amid the din, Home Minister S.R. Bommai submitted his reply to the the discussion on the CAA, the NRC, and sedition. “You cannot dictate the affidavit to the government. This is not the first time a case has been slapped against a teacher. We understand your sentiments, but we cannot withdraw the case now as the matter is before the court,” he said.

Stating that further discussion on the subject would be sub judice, the Home Minister said, “We cannot interfere once the investigation starts. The case has been posted to March 9 and let the court decide on it. We will abide by the court order.”

106,2020/02/20,About ‘shishyas’ and ‘pitamahas’,"The Legislative Assembly on Thursday witnessed a light-hearted discussion on loyalists of the former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah who are now in the BJP, and on the role of Revenue Minister R. Ashok and Congress member Ramalinga Reddy in Bengaluru’s politics.

During the debate on the Governor’s address, some BJP members said despite the existence of the BJP government, Mr. Siddaramaiah “is still a powerful leader” and the reason was that many of his “shishyas (loyalists)” are in the Cabinet headed by Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa.

When Mr. Reddy, in the course of a debate, taunted Deputy Chief Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan for approaching Srinivas Gowda (JD-S) for poaching the latter, Mr. Siddaramaiah, in an aside, described the Congress leader the “pitamaha” of Bengaluru. He had connections with all legislators, irrespective of parties, he said. Cooperation Minister S.T. Somashekhar interjected and said, “On our side, Mr. Ashok is the pitamaha of Bengaluru.”

As the discussion meandered, some BJP members told Mr. Siddaramaiah he was still “very powerful” as many of his “shishyas” were in the Cabinet. Ministers Jagadish Shettar and C.C. Patil complimented Mr. Siddaramaiah for the remark made by BJP members. In fact, the BJP government secured a majority in the Assembly following defection of Mr. Siddaramaiah’s loyalists to the saffron party, they said.

107,2020/02/20,Siddaramaiah says cut in Central funds is impeding development of Karnataka,"‘As against ₹17,249 cr., State received ₹8,815 cr. as GST compensation in 2019–20’

Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Assembly and former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Thursday criticised the Narendra Modi-led government for reducing Karnataka’s share in the devolution of taxes and said the Centre had been perpetrating injustice to the State which ranked third in collection of taxes in the country after Maharashtra and Delhi.

In 2019–20, Karnataka was expected to receive ₹17,249 crore as Goods and Services Tax (GST) compensation, but the State received only ₹8,815 crore, said the Congress leader.

Speaking on the motion of thanks to the Governor’s address in the Assembly, Mr. Siddaramaiah said the Centre’s funds to the State would reduce by over ₹11,000 crore in 2020–21 as per the 15th Finance Commission’s allocation.

“In 2019–20, Karnataka received devolution from the Centre amounting to ₹39,591 crore. For the 2020–21 fiscal, Karnataka is receiving ₹28,598 crore. If this continues, then in the next five years, we will lose close to ₹60,000 crore. How do you develop the State then? Instead of increasing, the amount is decreasing every year. How will Karnataka see a balanced development then?” Mr. Siddaramaiah said.

‘No political will’

The former Chief Minister accused the Yediyurappa-led government of lack of political will to oppose the Centre’s decisions. He said States such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Gujarat would be be receiving more funds when compared with their contribution to the Centre’s pool. “We are not getting back what we are giving. Where do we stand? All Ministers in the government must know this. Is this not injustice for our State? We have not fought for our rights politically and this lack of political will has brought us to this state,” he said.

108,2020/02/20,Kumaraswamy govt. sanctioned projects without funds: Karjol,"CM says JD(S) leaders’ segments got a lion’s share of funds during previous regime

The State government on Thursday told the Legislative Assembly that the erstwhile coalition government headed by H.D. Kumaraswamy had discriminated against MLAs in releasing development funds and randomly sanctioned projects without the approval of the Finance Department. This had left the government with no other option but to put some of the projects on hold.

The sanctioned costs of projects in the Public Works Department (PWD) was six times higher than the funds set aside in the State Budgets presented by the coalition government, it said.

Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa said constituencies of 105 members of the BJP received ₹2,985 crore during 2018–20 as against ₹2,974 crore by segments represented by 34 members of the JD(S). The constituencies of Congress’ 79 members received ₹3,834 crore. This came in response to the allegation of Congress and JD(S) members that the government had been discriminating against members of the Opposition in release of funds.

Deputy Chief Minister Govind M. Karjol, who also holds the Public Works portfolio, said works amounting to ₹59,112 crore were sanctioned under the PWD during 2018–20 though the available funds in the State Budgets were only ₹9,450 crore. Works amounting to ₹36,000 crore had been taken up though the Finance Department had not approved them, he said.

Under the Central Road Fund (amount collected by levying cess on petrol and diesel), the Kumaraswamy government sanctioned works estimated at ₹5,700 crore though the amount available was only ₹500 crore.

Mr. Karjol said many works taken up without the Finance Department’s approval had been stopped owing to non-availability of funds. “Do you call this financial discipline?” Mr. Karjol asked Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah, who has presented 14 State Budgets.

Mr. Siddaramaiah said the then Public Works Minister H.D. Revanna could have sanctioned the projects without the approval of the Finance Department. However, the Congress leader said he had not indulged in any financial indiscipline during his tenure as the Chief Minister. When some BJP members said the government had sanctioned works amounting ₹600 crore to Badami constituency represented by Mr. Siddaramaiah, the Congress leader shot back and said, “Withdraw the money if am not entitled as an MLA.”

Kumaraswamy demands White Paper on funds for north Karnataka

Janata Dal (Secular) leader and former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy on Thursday urged the government to bring out a White Paper on financial allocations made by various dispensations for the development of the backward region of north Karnataka.

This would not only set the records straight, but also expose those who claim to be harbingers of development of north Karnataka, but in reality had done little for its development, he said in the Assembly.

Mr. Kumaraswamy made the demand when BJP member Basanagouda Patil Yatnal took exception to the former Chief Minister defending allocation of more funds for development of several southern constituencies, including Channapatna, represented by him. Mr. Kumaraswamy said there was a need to release more funds to some of these constituencies as they lacked infrastructure development for more than a decade.

However, when Mr. Yatnal took exception to this and wondered if these funds could have not been released for north Karnataka which too is backward, Mr. Kumaraswamy shot back by saying that his government had released sufficient funds for north Karnataka too. He demanded a White Paper on the allocation to north Karnataka to help the public understand which party had actually stood with them.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/iwplao/article30873785.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21BGBSY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/kumaraswamy-govt-sanctioned-projects-without-funds-karjol/article30873786.ece

A Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad Bobde froze the warrants after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta and advocate Shubhranshu Padhi appeared for the State and requested an urgent hearing. The High Court had ordered the warrants to be executed through the State Home Secretary. The warrants were issued on February 18 against Mr. Sood, the DG and IGP, citing “lack of assistance from the department” in a service case before the HC.

The High Court was hearing a petition filed by Deputy Superintendent of Police S.S. Kashi, who had challenged a Karnataka State Administrative Tribunal order refusing to stay his transfer to the Crime Branch.

110,2020/02/20,Mysuru airport expansion: Land acquisition to begin soon,"Mysuru MP Pratap Simha meets Chief Minister for funds

Blaming the previous coalition government for the delay in acquiring land for the expansion of Mysuru airport, Mysuru MP Pratap Simha said he had met Chief Minister B.S. Yeddiyurappa for sanction of funds to complete the land acquisition process.

Responding to queries from reporters on the delay in the airport expansion project, Mr. Simha said former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy, who had assured former Union Civil Aviation Minister Suresh Prabhu of completing the land acquisition process soon, had instead tried to shift the Indian Air Force’s (IAF) helicopter division to Mysuru airport.

Now, with the Centre dropping the proposal to shift IAF’s helicopter division to Mysuru and retain the airport as a civilian airport, Mr. Simha said he had sought release of ₹200 crore in the coming Budget as the first instalment. “For the time being, this is enough for acquiring 114 acres of land for which final notification has been issued.”

A total of 240 acres of land is required for the project, which envisages extending the runway from 1.7 km to 2.8 km, besides construction of an under-pass for the national highway perpendicular to the airport. The extension of the runway is necessary to facilitate landing and taking off of large Boeings.

Already, it has been decided to pay the land-losers ₹1.4 crore to ₹1.5 crore.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/2kf7j2/article30873525.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20MYSFLIGHT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mysuru-airport-expansion-land-acquisition-to-begin-soon/article30873526.ece
111,2020/02/20,"No veiled agenda, says Cariappa","The controversy over his recent remarks against Tipu Sultan and his alleged disrespecting comments against Mysureans put Rangayana Director Addanda C. Cariappa on a sticky wicket during a press conference called by him here on Thursday to share details of Bahuroopi’s success.

Facing a volley of questions, Mr. Cariappa defended his position and reiterated that the views he had expressed were his own and not as the director. “I have not come to Rangayana to promote any ideology. I have no veiled agenda and my sole wish is to see Rangayana prosper. I have not said anything disrespectful to the people of Mysuru in connection with comments on Tipu Sultan. I might have spoken with anguish but I am committed to Rangayana and its success,” he replied.

On socialist Pa. Mallesh’s boycott of Bahuroopi over the comments, Mr. Cariappa said, “I have to respect his decision as it was his freedom to stay away though I went to his house and invited him. I will continue to respect him.”",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/pzvnz8/article30873516.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20MYSCARIAPPA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/no-veiled-agenda-says-cariappa/article30873517.ece
112,2020/02/20,Bahuroopi saw over one lakh visitors in six days,"A day after the Bahuroopi National Theatre Festival concluded at Rangayana here, the organisers on Thursday said the festival was a big success with footfall of over one lakh in a span of six days, the highest in recent years.

As many as 21 plays were staged and almost all of them saw packed audience. The repertory raised ₹6.30 lakh by selling tickets which is more than last year’s ticket collection.

At a press conference here on Thursday, Rangayana Director Addanda C. Cariappa said the people of Mysuru are responsible for Bahuroopi’s success. “All of us worked like a hockey team to put up a successful show. It turned out to be a grand show with the people fostering different ideologies taking part in the festival.”

The Mysuru district administration and the Mysuru ZP supported the Rangayana for putting up the show which was themed on Mahatma Gandhi – Gandhi Patha.

“If I have done anything wrong, criticise and correct me. I have no hidden agenda and I have come here for the sake of Rangayana. Those criticising me are my friends and the doors of Rangayana are always open to them. I may have a different ideology but I don’t have to agree to the ideology nurtured by them and they too need not concur with mine. We need to respect everyone’s views in a democracy,” Mr. Cariappa said in an apparent reply to the controversy surrounding him over his recent remarks against Tipu Sultan.

Rangayana Joint Director Mallikarjunaswamy said Bahuroopi, which drew around 65,000 people last year, attracted more than one lakh this year.

“We could not meet the demand since our auditoriums were small and people had turned up in big numbers to watch the plays. The response was magnanimous and the support was very generous.”

The first day of the festival saw about 15,000 persons and the number went up to 25,000 on the second and third day respectively. On the concluding day, thousands of people thronged the repertory till 11 p.m. “We got new audiences this year and enthusiasm among the youth was remarkable,” he added.

Among the plays staged, “Mukhyamantri”, the Kannada play with “Mukhyamantri” Chandru in the lead, saw the maximum audience at Kalamandira. Other Kannada plays and multilingual plays also saw packed houses as there was variety and quality, he said.

Mr. Cariappa said “Mahadev Bai”, “Mahatma” and “Gandhi Vs Gandhi” were among the plays appreciated by the audience besides Yakshagana. “It was a complete show for everyone.”

On the festival being organised in February instead of January, Mr. Mallikarjunaswamy said the people, especially senior citizens, have liked the timing because of chill weather in January. “We are looking forward to other programmes lined up for the coming months with Chinnara Mela in summer.”",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/iykgqd/article30873511.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20MYSBAHUROOPI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/bahuroopi-saw-over-one-lakh-visitors-in-six-days/article30873512.ece
113,2020/02/20,Death of bees: ZP told to stop use of chemicals in arecanut,"In the wake of the death of a large number of honeybees after sucking nectar from inflorescence treated with chemicals in arecanut plantations in Tirthahalli and Hosanagar taluks, the Karnataka Biodiversity Board has directed the Shivamogga Zilla Panchayat to stop the usage of harmful chemicals for insect and fungal management in arecanut crop.

Earlier, caterpillar and inflorescence dieback infestations were reported in arecanut crop cultivated on more than 1,000 hectares of land in the district since the first week of January. Yogesh H.R., deputy director, Department of Horticulture, told The Hindu that temperature variation experienced by the Malnad region this winter triggered the infestations. While cold conditions prevailed at night and in the morning, the temperature at noon was scorchingly hot. This was ideal for the growth of fungus and pests, he said.

The department had suggested that farmers treat these infestations with chlorpyrifos and other chemicals. Ramesh, a farmer from Agumbe who is involved in arecanut cultivation and apiculture, said the honeybees died after sucking nectar from the inflorescence of arecanut palms treated with the chemicals.

The death of honeybees has been reported from Agumbe, Basavani, Kannangi, Bidaragodu Gram Panchayat limits. Mr. Ramesh said that as flowers with nectar are less in the forest during winter, the honeybees inevitably feed on the arecanut inflorescence.

Ananth Hegde Ashisara, chairman, Karnataka Biodiversity Board, said that the ZP has been asked to stop the usage of chemicals to control infestations. Farmers should be apprised of natural means of insect and fungal control through awareness programmes and on-field demonstrations, he said.

Mr. Yogesh said the department has suggested that farmers use neem oil to control infestations. This does not harm the bees, he said, adding that for at least three days after spraying of neem oil, the honeybee should be confined to the boxes and fed sugar syrup.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/death-of-bees-shivamogga-zp-told-to-stop-use-of-chemicals-in-arecanut/article30873469.ece

Former Rangayana director and theatre personality H. Janardhan (Janni) on Thursday claimed that Addanda C. Cariappa’s name for the post of director of Rangayana was not recommended by the Ranga Samaja and described his selection as a “political appointment”.

Ranga Samaj, which is the sole authority to recommend names for the post, was sidestepped and Mr. Cariappa appointed bypassing the Samaj since his name was not there among the three names recommended by it. “He was appointed improperly and illegally. The government has insulted the Samaj and he should be removed from the post,” Mr. Janni demanded at a press conference here.

Progressive thinkers, writers and some activists had been demanding the resignation of Mr. Cariappa over the controversy surrounding his remarks against Tipu Sultan. They had described as unwarranted the remarks by him as director of Rangayana, an autonomous institution. Protests had been staged seeking his removal.

Mr. Janni accused Mr. Cariappa of attacking him personally and denigrating his family members after his outburst.

“The criticism against him (Mr. Cariappa) is not politically motivated for having been appointed by the BJP government. It was because of the way he had been appointed and his agenda of infusing his ideology into Rangayana, which had remained non-political since its inception.”

Mr. Janni sought a probe into Mr. Cariappa’s past and demanded that the Rangayana should be saved. “I must say the Chief Minister must have been misled about Mr. Cariappa. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been appointed.”

Backward Classes leader Shivaramu sought an apology from Mr. Cariappa for his alleged “personal attack” on Mr. Janni and warned of taking legal recourse for “defaming” him.

He said their demand for Mr. Cariappa’s removal will be pursued and also challenged him for a debate on Tipu Sultan.

Consequent to the report, with an aim of ascertaining the extent of encroachment, tahsildar Nagesh has sought a detailed survey of the area.

Chandrashekar, commonly known as ‘Amaravathi’ Chandrashekar, is facing charges of encroachment of land of Visvesvaraya Canal near Ummadahalli on the outskirts of the town to construct his hotel, which is attached to the Bengaluru-Mysuru highway.

The issue was brought to the notice of district administration recently by a social activist. Subsequently, the Irrigation and Revenue departments were asked to submit preliminary reports, said Mr. Nagesh.

Detailed Survey

The Tahsildar said he has decided to form a team to conduct surveys to ascertain the extent of encroachment. Once the surveys were conducted, he would submit a report to Deputy Commissioner M.V. Venkatesh.

The Revenue department would initiate stringent action, including demolishing the building and imposing penalty to rectify the damages to government properties from the hotelier, under the Karnataka Land Revenue Act, said another senior revenue official.

In a tweet on Thursday, Mr. Guha said: “The Home Minister of Karnataka has claimed on the floor of the State Assembly that he apologised to me by phone for the manhandling by the Bengaluru police on 19th December 2019. This is false. I received no such call or apology.”

In another tweet, he said: “Even if such an apology had been offered, I would have rejected it. The imposition of Section 144 was illegal [as the Karnataka High Court has since held] and I was proud to be one of thousands of peaceful protesters who defied the State’s arbitrary action on that day.”

118,2020/02/20,Lingayat mutt in Gadag set to appoint Muslim as its seer,"Diwan Sharief (33) is all set to become the seer of Murugharajendra Koraneshwara Shantidhama in Asuti village of Gadag district.

Following the footsteps of 12th century social reformer Basavanna, who advocated and practised the principle of equality in all spheres of life, a Lingayat mutt in Gadag district of Karnataka is all set to appoint a Muslim as its 'peetadhipati' (seer).

Diwan Sharief (33) is all set to become the seer of Murugharajendra Koraneshwara Shantidhama in Asuti village of Gadag district.

Sri Murugharajendra Koraneshwar Shivayogi, the seer of Koraneshwara Sansthan mutt in Khajuri village in Kalaburagi, is the man behind the revolutionary move. He said he drew inspiration from Jagadguru Murugharajendra Brihan Mutt of Chitradurga, which practises Basava philosophy to which his mutt is affiliated.

Diwan Sharief was reportedly drawn to the teachings of Basavanna since childhood and has been following the same since then, despite a few from his community objecting to it.

The Lingayat mutts have always stood for equality and are open to people of all faiths. Both Sharief and his late father Rahimansab Mulla had taken 'Linga Deeksha' (a ritual to initiate one into Lingayatism).

Influenced by discourses of Sri Murugharajendra Koraneshwar Shivayogi, Rahimansab Mulla had taken 'Linga Deeksha' long back and after his demise his family has donated two acres of land to the Falahara Shivayogi mutt in Asuti in which Shantidhama has come up now. After being initiated into the religion, Sharief was given further training.

A father of three daughters and a son, Sharief used to run flour mill in a neighbouring village and used to speak on Basavanna and Vachanas of Sharanas. “Basavanna was never against a married person becoming a seer. So now after making arrangements for livelihood of his family we have taken him into our fold and he will head the Shantidhama. The village residents have welcomed the decision,” Sri Murugharajendra Koraneshwar Shivayogi told The Hindu.

The naming of Diwan Sharief as head of Shantidhama would coincide with jatra mahotsava and mass marriage at the village on February 26.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/wp1hlf/article30868396.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/diwan,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/lingayat-mutt-in-gadag-set-to-appoint-muslim-as-its-seer/article30868397.ece
119,2020/02/20,Give police protection to advocates who want to represent arrested Kashmiri students: HC,"Plea had pointed out that no lawyer was able to represent students owing to ‘illegal’ resolution passed by Bar Association Hubballi

The High Court of Karnataka on Thursday directed the Hubballi-Dharwad Police Commissioner to provide police protection to advocates who want to represent the three Kashmiri students arrested on the charges of allegedly raising pro-Pakistan slogans.

The court said that police protection should be provided to the advocates from their entry into Hubballi for allowing them entry to the court of the Judicial Magistrate First Class, meeting the accused to take their signatures for representing them before the JMFC to seek release on bail, and to argue the case on behalf of the accused students.

A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Hemant Chandangoudar passed the interim order on a PIL petition filed by a group of 24 Bengaluru-based advocates led by B.T. Venkatesh.

It was pointed out in the petition that no lawyer was able to represent the three students when they were produced before the magistrate in view of an “illegal” resolution passed by Bar Association Hubballi (BAH) asking its members not to represent the accused for their anti-national conduct.

All the petitioner-advocates filed affidavits before the High Court stating that they are prepared to represent the accused students but expressed need for protection in view of the violence reported on the magistrate court premises in Hubballi when the accused were produced.

The police should give protection even for advocates from BAH if they chose to represent the accused students, the Bench said.

Stating that it is the duty of the police to give protection to the lawyers to ensure that the accused are not deprived of the service of a lawyer as it would amount to violation of fundamental rights guaranteed to the accused persons under the Constitution, the Bench said that it is open to the petitioners to approach the High Court if adequate protection is not provided by the police.

Contrary SC dictum

While observing that the resolution of the BAH is ex-facie contrary to the verdicts of the apex court, which had declared such resolutions passed by various bar associations as wholly illegal and against traditions of the Bar, the Bench directed the petitioners to request BAH to reconsider its resolution by sending copies of the apex court’s verdicts in A.S. Mohammed Rafi Vs State of Tamil Nadu, ex-captain Harish Uppal Vs. Union of India and other cases.

The Bench also said that it hopes that BAH would take necessary steps as a association of advocates is bound by constitutional mandate and the rules framed by the Bar Council of India.

Stating that it will have to examine whether resolution of BAH amounts to interference in administration of justice and contempt of court proceedings required to initiated against office-bearers of the BAH, the Bench said that if the BAH refuses to reconsider the resolution then the court would consider such a conduct during the next hearing.

123,2020/02/20,‘Many State governments do not want single entrance test for engineering admissions’,"“Several State governments do not want a single entrance test for admissions to engineering colleges, which is delaying the process,” said Anil Sahasrabudhe, chairman, All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), here on Wednesday.

He was speaking on the sidelines of the International Conclave on Learning Ecosystem organised by IFIM Business School and added that the council for the last two years had been pitching several advantages that students would face if one common entrance test was held. He said that many State governments were not keen as the curriculum needed to be changed and all of them needed to follow a common curriculum prescribed by the Central Board of Secondary Education. (CBSE).

“It should be one common entrance test held at least two or three times a year. This will help students from poor backgrounds as they do not have to travel to multiple cities to appear for different tests,” he said. But as education was on the concurrent list, there was a need for them to have State governments on board to implement this idea. “The proposal for this is not closed down, but it is not on for the coming academic year,” Prof. Sahasrabudhe said, and added that AICTE would engage in a dialogue and discussion with the State governments and ensure that it came into force.

After the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) was introduced for medical and dental seats across the country, several coaching classes over the past year had tweaked their teaching methodology and had begun training for students for a common entrance test for engineering courses which they thought would be conducted across the nation. They also provided coaching for the CET held by Karnataka Examinations Authority.

“The chairman’s comment now makes it clear that there is no proposal of the common test for engineering admissions in the near future, so will stop training students for the same,” said an official of a city-based coaching institute.

No new colleges

The chairman also said that the restriction of opening new institutes for the next two years is applicable to engineering colleges as well as pharmacy colleges.

He however added that the council would grant permission for new government colleges in aspirational districts if there was no other government college there.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/many-state-governments-do-not-want-single-entrance-test-for-engineering-admissions/article30864928.ece

125,2020/02/20,Police were not in uniform while questioning Bidar students: Govt.,"‘Deputy Superintendent of Police was in uniform when he conducted spot mahazar’

The State government on Wednesday told the High Court of Karnataka that police investigation team was not in uniform when counselling/questioning the students of Shaheen School in Bidar in connection with a sedition case registered against the school management for allegedly enacting a play, using schoolchildren, to incite people to oppose the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and to give negative opinion on laws enacted by Parliament.

A statement in this regard was filed before a Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Hemant Chandangoudar during the hearing of a PIL petition, filed by city-based advocate Nayana Jyothi Jhawar and the South India Cell For Human Rights Education and Monitoring, an NGO.

The statement was in response the query made by the court during a previous hearing that whether the police were in uniform when they had questioned the students in connection with the case.

The government also stated that the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Bidar, was in uniform when he conducted spot mahazar and other investigation process on the school premises but he was in plain clothes when he counselled/questioned 17 students — seven who had participated in the play and 10 who had watched the play.

The district child protection officer and the special juvenile justice unit member, a few staff members of the school, and a parent were present when the students were counselled/questioned in the visiting room on the school premises as the school management declined to send the students for counselling/questioning outside the school, the government stated while pointing out that police videographer, who was in uniform initially on the first day of counselling/questioning of students, was asked to change the clothes.

Advocate-General Prabhuling K. Navadgi, to a query by the Bench, said the investigation officer was not proposing to counsel/question any more students of the school. The A-G also informed the court that petitioners’ claim about the police questioning students in uniform appears to be based on newspaper reports while stating that the investigation was carried out by following the police manual and the provisions of the Juvenile Justice Act and the Rules.

126,2020/02/20,Research paper points to lithium reserves in Mandya district,"Reserves of the rare metal lithium, a key component needed to build batteries for electric vehicles, have been found in Allapatna–Marlagalla sector in Srirangapatna taluk of Mandya district in Karnataka. These findings by researchers from the Atomic Minerals Directorate for Exploration and Research (AMD) will be published in the peer reviewed journal, Current Science.

“The recent core drilling in a small area of 30 m X 440 m at Marlagalla has led to an estimated 1,600 t of Li with an average grade of 0.246 wt%,” said the researchers in their paper.

DC’s visit

Following this, on Wednesday, Mandya Deputy Commissioner M.V. Venkatesh visited Allapatna. He also sought a report from the Department of Mines and Geology. Deputy Director, Mines and Geology, Pushpa said that the exercise to trace reserves of minerals such as lithium demands many critical steps such as core drilling.

In the yet-to-be published paper in Current Science, the researchers explain that it was a maiden attempt of subsurface exploration (core drilling) by the AMD during 2013 over a small area which has helped unravel vital information and the type and extent of rare metal mineralisation. In this paper, the researchers underscore the potential of lithium in the area based on data obtained from subsurface explorations, and chemical analyses of substantial number of samples carried out since 2013.

India depends on imports to meet its lithium needs and it is yet to be determined whether these findings will help ease the burden. The researchers concluded that Karnataka holds a large potential of lithium resource in the country.

The presence of lithium has not come as a surprise as the the AMD, Department of Atomic Energy, had found spodumene (a source of lithium) in 1989. “Subsequent mineral exploration carried out by the AMD over four decades has established the pegmatite terrain of the Allapatna–Marlagalla sector as the single largest rare-metal source,” said the researchers in the paper.

Not new

According to a senior expert at the AMD, Southern Region, at Nagarbhavi in Bengaluru, Lithium reserves, in minute quantities, have been traced in a good number of places across the country. The quantity as per the the findings by AMD researchers is also very tiny. However, the detailed study and exploration could give new leads to the survey findings.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/2tja4m/article30864652.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19BGMANDYA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/research-paper-points-to-lithium-reserves-in-mandya-district/article30864653.ece
127,2020/02/20,Tiruppur accident | Survivors in shock,"They say local people came to their rescue immediately

Charishma K. woke up on hearing a loud thud and found that the right side of the bus in which she was travelling was completely open.

A passenger in the Garuda Volvo bus of the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation that met with a major tragedy at Avinashi on the Coimbatore-Salem highway early on Thursday, she boarded the bus from Bengaluru and was on the way to her cousin’s house in Ernakulam.

“My seat number was 3 and it was on the left side of the bus. I found that the right side of the bus was completely damaged when I suddenly woke up. It was all over in flash. I am still under a state of shock,” she told The Hindu over the phone.

Charishma said she then heard the voices of local residents, who rushed to the accident spot immediately. “We could not get out through the main exit door as it got jammed owing to the impact of the accident. Those who came to help us later broke the glasspanes of windows and rescued us,” she said.

Charishma, a bank employee in Bengaluru and a resident of Kannur, said she was not injured. “However, I am feeling pain in my legs and it may be due to the impact. I am now travelling to my cousin’s house in Ernakulam in a bus,” she said.

The images of bodies lying on the road refuse to leave Sreelakshmi Menon, who was seated in the first row of the bus on the left side. “I was asleep and woke up after experiencing a huge jerk. I still do not know how I got out as the exit door was stuck. It was only after watching the news later that I realised that a trailer had rammed into our bus as I could not spot it after coming out,” she said.

An employee with an e-commerce firm in Bengaluru, Sreelakshmi was en route to her residence near Amala Hospital in Thrissur. “I was taken in an ambulance along with a few others to Revathi Medical Centre in Tirupur, where I was administered first aid. An X-ray was also taken and doctors advised that I could leave as there were no major injuries and had suffered only a few bruises,” she said.

Sreelakshmi was lucky enough to recollect that her college-mate’s residence was at Tirupur. “Incidentally, her house was close to the accident spot and I was there till my parents came from Thrissur. We are now on our way to Thrissur,” she said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/febpdw/article30877424.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH20KRAKERALABUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/survivors-in-shock/article30874078.ece
128,2020/02/20,Tiruppur accident | Did an amendment to Central Motor Vehicles Rules play villain?,"Provision for two drivers was annulled in 2018

Did an amendment to the Central Motor Vehicles Rules governing long-distance heavy vehicles operating under the national permit two years back inadvertently contribute to the accident near Coimbatore?

The Motor Vehicles Department (MVD) feels that such a possibility could not be ruled out though several theories are being bandied around as to how the speeding container truck hit the KSRTC bus. The truck was bound for Bengaluru from Kochi while the KSRTC bus carrying 48 passengers was headed in the opposite direction when the truck jumped the median, and rammed the bus.

Initially, there were reports that a tyre burst led to the accident. But MVD officials say it has all the makings of an accident when a driver dozes off at the wheel. “In such cases, the driver steps on the gas and lose control over the steering wheel,” a senior official said.

Previously, Rule 90 of the Central Motor Vehicle Rules, 1989, stipulated that heavy vehicles with national permit “shall have a minimum of two drivers and shall be provided with a seat across the full width behind the driver’s seat providing facility for the spare driver to sleep”.

However, an amendment to the rules in November 2018 did away with the provision of two drivers enabling national permit vehicles to operate with a single driver. “It was a needless amendment as two drivers are absolutely essential for vehicles engaged in long-distance operations. Since the driver works with a stiff target they risk driving despite being sleepy,” said the official.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/tku4k5/article30877932.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21TVBUSACCIDENT4,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/tiruppur-accident-did-an-amendment-to-central-motor-vehicles-rules-play-villain/article30874072.ece
129,2020/02/20,Mohanlal set to get relief in ivory case,"Kerala government to withdraw case against actor under Wildlife (Protection) Act

The Kerala government has issued a no objection certificate to withdrawing the wildlife crime case registered against actor Mohanlal for illegally procuring and stocking elephant tusks, a Schedule One wild animal.

Mr. Mohanlal is the first accused in the case. P.N. Krishnakumar of Olloor, Thrissur; K. Krishnakumar of Eroor, Thripunithura; and Nailini Radhakrishnan of Chennai are the other accused in the case.

Requests by actor

The actor has been charged under various Sections of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, which deals with the prohibition of trade or commerce in trophies and animal articles derived from certain animals.

It was after considering the two requests made by Mr. Mohanlal on January 31, 2016 and another one, three years later on September 20, 2019 that the State government took the decision to issue the NOC. The government also considered a letter written by the Chief Wildlife Warden on August 14 last year and another letter from the Director General of Prosecution on December 4, 2019, in this regard before arriving at the decision.

The Additional Chief Secretary wrote a letter to the Ernakulam District Collector on February 7 this year, stating that the State government had no objection to withdrawing the criminal case registered against the actor with the consent of the court. The government has also asked the District Collector to issue directives to the Public Prosecutor/Assistant Public Prosecutor in this regard.

Incidentally, the The Forest Department had been conducting the criminal case against the actor at the judicial first class magistrate court, Perumbavoor. The case was registered by the Kodanad Forest Range officer. After the initial proceedings, the court posted the case in March.

It was by invoking the Section 321 of Criminal Procedure Code, which empowers public prosecutors to withdraw the case after obtaining a written permission from the State government, that the Kerala government made the controversial move.

The Forest officials had seized two tusks and a mirror stand with another two tusks fixed on both sides of the mirror from his house in 2011. The offences charged against Mr. Mohanlal attract imprisonment for a term not less than three years and may extend to seven years and fine not less than ₹10,000.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/5vfbom/article30877480.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH20KRAMOHANLAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kerala-govt-issues-noc-in-mohanlals-ivory-case/article30873944.ece
130,2020/02/20,Onattukara to witness sesame cultivation again,"Thamarakulam revives farming after 12 years

The Onattukara region was once known for its sesame cultivation and production. However, over the years, the farmers shelved the practice owing to low yield and a lack of support.

Now, after a gap of 12 years, sesame plants are about to be raised again in the fields of Onattukara. In a bid to bring back the lost tradition, the Thamarakulam grama panchayat has joined hands with farmers to revive sesame farming in the region.

Around 50 farmers under Thenginal Vayal Nellulpadaka Samithi and Kannanakuzhi Arya Nellulpadhana Samithi have undertaken sesame farming in 23 acres. While farmers under the Thenginal samithi have sown seeds in 13 acres, the Kannanakuzhi samithi is carrying out sesame farming in 10 acres of land.

Third crop

“We are conducting sesame cultivation as a third crop. When the local body and Agriculture Department decided to revive the cultivation in the region, it brought a fresh sense of enthusiasm to farmers in the region. We are already planning to expand it to more areas,” said Anjana S., Thamarakulam Krishi Bhavan officer.

Ms. Anjana said there was high demand for sesame in the market. “The harvest will begin in May. We are expecting a good yield, which will help farmers fetch good money,” she said.

The farmers engaged in sesame farming will receive ₹7,000 per hectare as financial aid from the panchayat. In addition to it, the State Agriculture Department will provide farmers ₹5,000 per hectare. Earlier, the farmers were given seeds free of cost from the Krishi Bhavan. Fertilizers were being given on subsidised rates, officials said.

The fields were made ready for farming with the support of Onattukara Karshika Sevana Kendram. The farming was recently launched by grama panchayat president V. Geetha by sowing seeds.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/26ax1g/article30873907.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21tval1-sesame,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/onattukara-to-witness-sesame-cultivation-again/article30873908.ece

135,2020/02/20,Clearing garbage from tricky territory,"Tribespeople from Valayar forest settlement have been working at Elappara

One side of the Kottayam-Kattappana State Highway here is quite steep and it has become a dumping yard for garbage, including biodegradable waste generated in the entire town, over the years.

It created a health issue as the waste reached the Elappara river, a tributary of the Periyar, the main source of drinking water for the High Range.

Now, the scenario has seen a positive change with tribespeople collecting waste from the deep gorge after descending there using ropes. They were working here for three days after cleaning the Elappara river and Mathayikokka, the other areas where waste is dumped.

Tribespeople from the Valayar forest settlement are experts in negotiating steep areas. They have collected waste in five districts over the past two years under a non-governmental organisation of ex-servicemen. Tonnes of waste collected are segregated and moved to treatment plants. “Everything is sold at a price and the waste is collected under government-approved norms,” said Varghese Thomas, an ex-serviceman.

He said the work at the grama panchayat was under the Elappara Green Grass Project and they were now concentrating in Pathanamthitta and Idukki districts.

The government plans to expand the project in the entire State. In five districts, the waste was collected under the Vazhiyoram scheme. Garbage in the forests on the Neryamangalam-Munnar stretch was also cleared.

60 members

Nearly 60 members of the Muthuvan community, including women, from Valara are engaged in the initiative. Omana, Moly, Vilasini, Deepa, and Thankamma are the women. They devise their own strategies and are provided masks, gloves, and shoes. Radhakrishnan, a member of the group, said they collected honey and other forest items when there was no work.

P.J. Melvin, who had taken up the garbage menace with government departments, said it was an enormous task to clear the area. Steps to prevent further dumping of waste should be taken, he added.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/v9fmg5/article30873804.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21tvid-waste,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/clearing-garbage-from-tricky-territory/article30873805.ece

The plans by the Kottayam port to become an export-oriented unit has received a shot in the arm with one more shipping line opening its empty container yard here.

According to port officials, container shipping major MSC will be the second global shipping line after MAERSK to recognise the Kottayam port as the staking point. The new move will help exporters and importers cut down on time and cost. Owing to non-acceptance of the Kottayam port by some shipping lines, containers that were transshipped here are now being cleared in Kochi and this force many clients to stop operations here.

Export-oriented unit

Confirming the development, Abraham Varghese, Managing Director, Kottayam Port, said discussions were progressing with several shipping companies on promoting cargo transport through inland waterways while also offering services in Kochi. “The export of LCL containers will start in a couple of days. In the meantime, we have also approached the Customs Department seeking permission to open an export-oriented unit here and hope to begin the export of LCL containers as soon as possible,” he said.

An application by the port authority seeking a licence to operate as a minor port under Section 7 of the Customs Act had been under active consideration of the Central Board of Indirect Tax and Customs (CBIC).

137,2020/02/20,Greens oppose sand-mining,"‘Extracting sand deposits will do more harm than good to Pampa’

Pampa Purarjani, an eco group that stands for rejuvenation of the Pampa river and its tributaries, have taken strong exception towards the reported government move to auction off the sand deposited in the Pampa during floods.

M.N. Radhakrishnan, Pampa Punarjani president and former technical expert attached to the Union Ministry of Water Resources, told The Hindu that the river and its tributaries, Achencoil and Manimala, were regarded as the lifelines of the Central Travancore region and the backwaters of Kuttanad.

Various studies carried out by the National Centre for Earth Science Studies (NCESS) and the Central Water Commission had found that indiscriminate sand extraction from the Pampa and its tributaries had led to the lowering of the respective riverbeds by five to six m over three decades.

Water scarcity

These river basins had also been experiencing acute water scarcity during the non-monsoon period owing to sand-mining-induced drastic depletion of the groundwater table in the locality.

Caving-in of the river banks too had been a major problem facing the Pampa river owing to the wanton destruction of the natural protective vegetation along its banks.

Deluge

Mr. Radhakrishnan said the deluge of August, 2018, and the series of floods in 2019 had brought in huge deposits of sand that could help rejuvenate the river system through a natural process in the years to come.

Extracting these sand deposits would do more harm than good to the river system and the environment.

He said unscientific sand-mining was one of the many human interventions that had put the State in the shadow of ecological repercussions. The impacts were not restricted to the aquatic environment but extended to terrestrial environment as well.

A NCESS study had found the population of insects such as may fly, dragon fly, chironomids, caddisflies, and other insects of the order Diptera declining fast owing to indiscriminate sand extraction from the river basins and related aquatic environments.

The Union government had included the Pampa river in the National River Conservation Plan (NRCP) way back in 2003-04.

The State’s failure to implement this Centrally sponsored project had already exposed the lackadaisical attitude of the authorities concerned towards conservation of environment and freshwater sources in the State, he alleged.

According to him, the State should set up a nodal agency for effective protection of the Pampa river and its tributaries, instead of permitting any more extraction of sand from the riverbed.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/e5lqz7/article30873773.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21tvpt-sanddeposit1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/greens-oppose-sand-mining/article30873774.ece

which they cleared the proceedings after the tragedy,” said Mr. Balamurali.

Agriculture Minister V.S. Sunil Kumar, Transport Minister A.K. Sasindran,

V.K. Sreekandan and Ramya Haridas, MP, and Shafi Parambil, MLA, soon joined the officials to ensure that the bodies of the

victims were taken to their homes by evening.

The belongings of the victims were removed and kept at the Thirumuruganpoondi police station near Tirupur. The victims’ families

can claim the belongings by contacting the sub-inspector at 83000 44804 or 94981 77908.

₹10-lakh compensation

Mr. Sasindran said a compensation of ₹10 lakh would be given to the family of the victims. Of this, ₹2 lakh would be released immediately, he said. The remaining amount would be given in a month.

Mr. Sunil Kumar, after discussions with the transport authorities of Tamil Nadu, said that the accident was precipitated as the truck

driver fell asleep. The truck hauling the container trailer careened off the road and crossed the road divider and collided with the

speeding Volvo bus on the opposite lane.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/palakkad-officials-act-in-time-to-help-victims/article30873759.ece

The State government rose to the occasion to coordinate relief operations, provide medical aid to those injured and bring back the bodies of the 19 Keralites killed in the KSRTC bus-truck collision at Avinashi in Tiruppur district of Tamil Nadu on Thursday.

Soon after the news of the accident reached here, Chief Minster Pinarayi Vijayan directed two of his ministerial colleagues to rush to the neighbouring State to coordinate relief operations. Chief Secretary Tom Jose was asked to coordinate the relief operations from the capital.

Transport Minister A.K. Saseendran and Agriculture Minister V.S. Sunil Kumar rushed to accident spot. The Palakkad District Collector was asked to take necessary steps to provide medical aid to the injured and bring back the bodies.

The KSRTC launched helpline number 94950 99910 to provide details of the bus passengers. The Chief Minister’s Office was in regular touch with the Tirupur administration.

State Police Chief Loknath Behera spoke to his Tamil Nadu counterpart and Coimbatore City Police Commissioner to speed up the post mortem procedures. District Police Chief of Palakkad G. Siva Vikram was one of the first from the State to reach Avinashi .

Chairman and Managing Director of KSRTC M.P. Dinesh, who was asked to inquire into the accident, also reached the spot. The Motor Vehicles Department also rushed the enforcement team headed by the Enformement RTO in Palakkad.

Palakkad MP V.K. Sreekandan, and Alathur MP Ramya Haridas besides legislators from Kerala and revenue officials also reached to console the relatives and lend a helping hand in relief operations.

The despatch of 20 ambulances, including 10 of the Kanivu 108, to Avinashi by Health Minister K.K. Shyalaja came in handy to the authorities to shift the injured and bring back the bodies immediately after the post mortem.

Compensation

After visiting the hospitals, Mr. Saseendran said the KSRTC would provide a compensation of ₹10 lakh each to the deceased, of which ₹2 lakh would be released immediately. The families of the KSRTC employees would be given ₹30 lakh each under the insurance scheme.

140,2020/02/20,Split in KC(Jacob) imminent,"Nellore faction wants merger with P.J. Joseph-lead KC(M)

Close on the heels of a vertical split in the Kerala Congress (M), another splinter group of the regional party Kerala Congress (Jacob) too has plunged into crisis with two of its key leaders locked up in a fierce battle.

The infighting within the party touched its boiling point on Thursday with party chairman Johnny Nellore publicly accusing its lone legislator Anoop Jacob of attempting to split and destroy the organisation. The statement came even as the two leaders called for separate meetings of the KC(Jacob) State committee in Kottayam on Friday.

According to party sources, Mr. Jacob is convening a meeting at the party State committee office to report a decision by the party high power committee to dismiss its proposed merger with the KC(M) group led by P.J. Joseph. Mr. Nellore, on the other hand, will be convening a high power committee meeting followed by a State committee, to push ahead with the merger plans.

“The meeting convened by Mr. Jacob is in direct violation of the provisions in the party constitution. His intention is to destroy the party and we are not ready to pay up for his selfish deeds,’’ Mr. Nellore said. He further added that the KC(Jacob) would be forced to initiate disciplinary action against Mr. Jacob in case of him organising a parallel meeting.

On the occasion, he claimed that majority of party workers were with him, especially in Ernakulam and Alappuzha districts where the KC(Jacob) enjoys popular support. “Two of the three vice presidents, the office-in-charge general secretary and eight district committees are with me. Ten out of the 12 Assembly committee presidents of the Ernakulam district committee too have extended their support, besides a majority of Alappuzha district committee members,” he said.

Earlier, Mr. Jacob had claimed the support of 11 district committees and majority of State leaders.

Special Correspondent writes from Kochi: The Kerala Youth Front (Jacob) has said it supported the move by KC(Jacob) to merge with the P.J. Joseph faction of KC(M).

The executive committee members of the United Democratic Youth Front, the youth wing of the United Democratic Front, Joemon Kunnumpuram, Stelin Pullumkodum, Mathew Pullyattel Tharakan and the majority of the members of the State committee of the Youth Front supported the merger, a press release by Mr. Joemon and Stelin said here on Thursday.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/split-in-kcjacob-imminent/article30872989.ece
141,2020/02/20,Missing rifles: HC calls for action taken report,"Court admits PIL seeking CBI probe into CAG findings

A Division Bench of the Kerala High Court on Thursday directed the State government and the State Police Chief (SPC) to file an affidavit explaining the action taken on the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) regarding the missing of 25 rifles and 12,061 live cartridges from the Special Armed Police Battalion (SAPB).

The Bench comprising Chief Justice M. Manikumar and Justice Shaji P. Chali issued the directive while admitting a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking a probe by the CBI or NIA into the missing of rifles and live cartridges from the custody of the State police.

In his petition, P.R. Ramachandra Kaimal of Changanassery said the CAG had found that 25 rifles stated to have been issued by the SAPB were neither entered in the stock register nor in the records maintained by the Armoury Inspector at the camp. The CAG had, therefore, recommended that the government take urgent steps to trace the missing cartridges. The CAG also recommended stock taking of arms and ammunition of the entire police force.

When the petition came up for hearing, senior Government Pleader Suman Chakravarthy submitted that no rifles were found missing during the physical verification done by the DIG, Armed Police Battalion, and Director of the Crime Branch. Besides, an investigation into the missing of the bullets were on. The senior Pleader further submitted that it had become an issue because the CAG team refused to account the 25 rifles transferred temporarily from the SAP to Thiruvanathapuram city in 2011 despite showing them the records.

He pointed out that the CAG report had been tabled before the Assembly and it was for the Public Accounts Committee to act. The court asked the State and the SPC to file the affidavits in one week.

The petitioner said the incident was a serious security breach and involved the security of the nation, especially in the context of the fact that the nation was under serious threat of terrorist, including Maoists and Islamic State (IS).",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/missing-rifles-hc-calls-for-action-taken-report/article30872369.ece

The commission is learnt to have objected against the intervention of the High Court in its cardinal functioning of preparing voters’ list which is key to conducting the local body elections. The commission had insisted on using the electoral roll prepared by it in 2015 with the concurrence of the Central Election Commission since it comprised ward wise details.

The electoral roll of 2019 had only booth wise details, which was felt to be too inadequate for the local body polls. For, each booth comprises more than one ward and sifting the details of voters in each ward on the basis of the list was pointed out as a Herculean task. It demands substantial manpower and would incur an additional expenditure of ₹10 crore and hence the commission insisted on using the 2015 list.

Since the commission was keen on ensuring the maximum enrolment of voters, it had opposed the United Democratic Front’s argument that using the 2015 list would deprive voting right for a large number of persons. It clarified that the decision would not impinge on the fundamental or civic rights of the people.

143,2020/02/20,Vigilance raids residence of V.S. Sivakumar,"Amassment of wealth case slapped on him; Congress says it is a political witch hunt

The Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB) on Thursday raided the residence of former Health Minister and Congress legislator V.S. Sivakumar.

The agency has indicted him for illegal amassment of wealth. It has also accused him of having squirrelled away the ill-gotten wealth in the name of benamis during his period in office between 2011-16.

The raid came days after Governor Arif Mohammad Khan gave the nod to prosecute Mr. Sivakumar on the charge of ‘enriching himself’ illicitly. The inspections also simultaneously targeted the houses of four of Mr. Sivakumar's ‘close associates.’

The VACB had accused them of having acquired prime real estate using improperly accumulated wealth, fronting themselves for Mr. Sivakumar.

‘To divert attention’

The Congress has termed the ""intrusive examination"" a political witch hunt. It said the government wanted to divert public attention from the high-level police corruption flagged by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) in his report tabled in the Assembly recently in the run-up to the local body elections.

Mr. Sivakumar said the VACB had verified the allegations in 2016 and found them to be false. However, beset by corruption charges, the government had resurrected the false accusations against him. Mr. Sivakumar is now the third Minister in the Oommen Chandy government to face anti-corruption inquiry under the current disposition.

The VACB had earlier charge-sheeted former Excise Minister K. Babu in an amassment of wealth case. The agency had last Saturday questioned former PWD Minister and IUML legislator V.K. Ebrahim Kunju on the charge of financially favouring the firm responsible for the shoddy construction of the now decommissioned flyover at Palarivattom in Kochi.

A parallel investigation is on by the Crime Branch against a galaxy of top Congress leaders in Kerala on the charge of seeking sexual favours from the woman accused of cheating in the solar scam case that rocked the Chandy government in 2013.

Meanwhile, the Enforcement Directorate is examining whether there is a money-laundering angle in the ongoing anti-corruption probes.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/dmbtdt/article30877446.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21TVVSSIVAKUMAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/vigilance-raids-residence-of-sivakumar/article30871583.ece

Sleep-deprived drivers remain responsible for about 40% of the road accidents, according to enforcement officers patrolling the highways and major roads here.

“This is particularly applicable to fatigued drivers, who doze off at the wheels between midnight and 5 am on our highways,” said B. Shefiq, Joint Regional Transport Officer, Perumbavur.

Stating that they usually ascertain the cause of accident owing to sleep deprivation by analysing the tyre markings, Mr. Shefiq said that there will be no signs of the driver applying the brakes near the accident spot as he would have got up only after ramming into another vehicle.

K. Manoj, Joint Regional Transport Officer, Ernakulam, pointed out that on an average 10 to 12 cases are lodged against container trucks plying in the district for various violations under the Motor Vehicles Act. “The impact of accidents involving container trucks is often huge as such vehicles carry a load of 35,000 to 40,000 kg,” he said.

“Other violations involving container trucks include shortcomings in the inter-State permit; unauthorised parking; and reckless driving. We have come across several incidents where container trucks had rammed into two-wheelers and light motor vehicles in Ernakulam,” he said.

B. G. Sreedevi, Chief Scientist at the National Transportation Planning and Research Centre (Natpac) under the Kerala State Council for Science, Technology and Environment, said that only professional drivers ensure that they have proper sleep before going on trips during the night hours. “Take the example of accidents in the night involving drivers, who had undertaken assignments to the airports. Most of the drivers riding to the airports lack the experience to drive during night hours and doze off on the wheels leading to tragic accidents,” she said.

James Sebastian, a senior general physician, said that a driver undertaking night trips should get at least eight hours of sleep in the daytime. “Fatigue is the main reason for dozing off on the wheels. They should take breaks in between the long journey by staying hydrated,” he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/32rnil/article30867170.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/tiruppur-bus-accident,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/sleep-deprived-drivers-responsible-for-40-of-road-accidents-say-transport-officials/article30868895.ece

The Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB), Kerala, on Thursday raided the residence of former Health and Devaswom Minister and Congress legislator V.S. Sivakumar here.

The agency booked him on Monday on the charge of having amassed wealth illegally and squirrelled it away in the name of his close associates during his period in the office between 2011-16.

The early morning inspection came days after Kerala Governor Arif Mohammad Khan gave the State Government sanction to prosecute Mr. Sivakumar on the charge of “enriching himself” illicitly.

The raids also targeted the houses of four of Mr. Sivakumar’s “close partners”, including that of his chauffeur.

The VACB had accused the “benamis” of having acquired prime real estate using ill-gotten wealth.

‘Political witch-hunt’

Mr. Sivakumar has termed the “intrusive examination” a “political witch-hunt” ordered by the Pinarayi Vijayan government to divert public attention from the high-level police corruption flagged by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) in his report tabled in the Kerala Legislative Assembly recently.

He said the VACB had verified the allegations in 2016 and found them to be false.

However, beset by corruption charges, the government had resurrected the accusations against him based on a “fake complaint authored by a fictitious person” in a “vile” attempt to turn public opinion against the Congress in the run-up to the local body elections.

Mr. Sivakumar is now the third Minister in the Oommen Chandy government to face an anti-corruption enquiry under the current disposition.

The VACB had earlier charge-sheeted former Excise Minister K. Babu in an amassment of wealth case.

The agency had last Saturday questioned former PWD Minister and IUML legislator V. K. Ibrahim Kunju on the charge of financially favouring the firm responsible for the shoddy construction of the now decommissioned flyover at Palarivattom in Kochi.

Parallelly, the Crime Branch is investigating a galaxy of top Congress leaders, including former Ministers, MPs and MLAs, on the charge of rape based on a complaint filed by the woman suspect in the Solar Investment Fraud case that rocked the Chandy government in 2013.

Money laundering angle

Meanwhile, officials said the Enforcement Directorate has sought “third party information” from the VACB on whether there was a money laundering angle to the ongoing anti-corruption probe against the former United Democratic Front (UDF) Ministers.

In a court filing here on Monday, the VACB said a preliminary enquiry against Mr. Sivakumar in 2016 had yielded no evidence of illegal amassment of wealth initially.

However, a subsequent re-verification found that three persons close to Mr. Sivakumar had invested hugely in pricey real estate and acquired stakes in at least one private multi-speciality hospital.

A VACB investigator said the agency was pursuing the money trail in the case. It had based its case against Mr. Sivakumar on the statements of over 100 persons and nearly 105 incriminating documents.

The charges against Mr. Sivakumar and his “benamies” include conspiracy to accumulate wealth by abusing his constitutional office, corruption and shared intention under the relevant provisions of the Indian Penal Code and the Prevention of Corruption Act, 2018.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/k277eg/article30834051.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15tvgad01-sivakGBJ74ERFB5jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/vigilance-raids-house-of-former-kerala-health-minister-vs-sivakumar/article30868778.ece

Gireesh, the driver of the KSRTC bus involved in the tragic accident near Coimbatore, last spoke to his wife Smitha before leaving Bangalore on Wednesday evening.

He was to turn up at his house at Panachikkadu in ward 12 of Vengola panchayat near Perumbavur by Thursday around 7 a.m. Instead, it was the news of his tragic death that reached his beloved wife Smitha and the only daughter Devika, a Plus Two student.

Gireesh, 44, was one of the victims of the accident that claimed over 20 lives.

“He used to ring up his wife before the start of the service and he has been operating on the Bangalore route for years,” said Soman, a relative and an immediate neighbour.

Gireesh had bought a five cent-plot and moved in with his family just about two years ago and had not lived enough of his life in that house, the fruit of his labour, when death put an abrupt end to it.

For Ajith Vengola, the fact that his long-time friend and neighbour at Panachikkadu in ward 12 of Vengola panchayat is no more is yet to sink in.

The news reached him a bit late in the day as he was preoccupied with other things in the morning and could not watch the news channels though his wife and ward member was alerted about the tragedy by then.

“He was such a pleasant guy who always had a smile on his face. I knew him for more than a decade even before he shifted to his new house some two years ago. He always wished me no matter where we met,” recollected Ajith, a retired tourism department employee and an author.

Gireesh used to be the driver of a tourist bus operating on the Bangalore route before he joined KSRTC about a decade back. No wonder, he used to be assigned the Bangalore route considering his thorough knowledge of it.

“He used to be our go-to man for all things related to travel.

Charishma K. woke up from her deep sleep after hearing a loud thud and found that the right side of the bus in which she was travelling was completely open.

A passenger in the Garuda Volvo bus of the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation that met with a major tragedy at Avinashi on the Coimbatore-Salem early on Thursday, she had boarded the bus from Bangalore and was on the way to her cousin’s house in Ernakulam.

“My seat number was 3 and it was on the left side of the bus. I found that the right side of the bus was completely damaged when I suddenly woke up. It was all over in flash. I am still under a state of shock,” she told The Hindu over telephone.

Charishma said that she then heard the voices of the local residents, who had rushed to the accident spot immediately. “We could not get out through the main exit door as it got jammed owing to the impact of the accident. Those who came to help us later broke the glass panes of the windows and rescued us,” she said.

Charishma, a bank employee in Bangalore and a resident of Kannur, said she was not injured. “However, I am feeling pain in my legs and it may be due to the impact. I am now travelling to my cousin’s house in Ernakulam in a bus,” she said.

Saranya, the 23-year-old woman accused of killing her 18-month-old son, Viyan, was taken to the crime scene here on Wednesday for collection of evidence.

The City police took Saranya to her house and the crime scene on the Thayyil beach around 10 a.m. The police had a difficult time managing the people gathered there.

They hurled abuses and turned aggressive as the accused walked back with the police after evidence collection. The police had to whisk her away from the scene as people started flooding the area.

Father’s reaction

Saranya showed no remorse as she narrated the incidents to the police. When she was taken to her house, Saranya’s father Valsaraj demanded that she be hanged for the crime.

“I would be happy if my daughter is hanged for what she did. No one should go through such a situation,” said an emotional Valsaraj, who was very close to the child.

Kannur City Circle inspector P.R. Satheesh said they had arrested Saranya after she confessed to the crime. She said she killed the child to live with her paramour, who is also a close friend of her husband.

Post-mortem result

Saranya took the child out in the early hours of Monday (February 17) and threw him on the sea wall. A post-mortem examination report reveals that head injuries were the cause of the child’s death. The police got clues of her involvement in the murder after the forensic report found evidence of seawater, salt, and sand from her clothes.

151,2020/02/20,Bandipur: Kerala opposes alternative route,"In SC, the State says the ban on night traffic is not on the basis of any study

The Kerala government has opposed in the Supreme Court an alternative route proposed by Karnataka to bypass the night-time traffic ban on the National Highway 212 through the Bandipur National Park.

In an affidavit, Kerala submitted that the alternative route goes through the Nagarhole Tiger Reserve in Karnataka and Tholpetty wildlife sanctuary in Kerala “where wild animals are wandering freely in heavy numbers and it will take more time for the land acquisition for developing the route.” Further, clearance from the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change is mandatory.

The Kerala government indicated that it would be better to open NH 212 (presently NH 766) for night time travel.

“The present NH is being used from time immemorial,” the State said.

“The ban on night traffic through NH 212 issued by the District Magistrate was without any study or preparation. Mudumalai, Bandipur Tiger Reserves and Wayanad Wildlife sanctuary make one contiguous tiger territory and tigers move freely within this area. It is illogical and inappropriate to impose enhanced level of restriction only in one part of this tiger territory to protect tigers. It will not yield the desired result,” Kerala argued in the Supreme Court.

Moreover, the State contended that the ban on night traffic on NH 212 from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. is not on the basis of any study or sound scientific findings.

Arterial road

On the other hand, the highway is the arterial road connecting the metro city of Kozhikode and Wayanad with Mysuru and Bengaluru.

The State dismissed the argument raised in the apex court that “by now the wildlife has adapted itself to the night-time restriction on traffic.” It said the argument owes itself more to a reluctance withdraw the ban.

The NH 212 connects not only major cities like Bengaluru and Cochin but also smaller ones like Vythiri, Chundel, Kalpetta, Muttil, Meenangadi, Sulthan Bathery, Gundelpett, Begur and Nanjangud towns. It is a vital economic link and the easiest route between the two States, Kerala argued.

For uniform curbs

152,2020/02/20,"12,000 public toilets along highways soon","Local bodies told to identify land

The government has decided to construct 12,000 public toilets along the sides of national and State highways. The Cabinet which met here on Wednesday directed local bodies to identify three cents each at suitable locations.

An official pressnote issued by the Chief Minister’s Office said the absence of toilet facilities posed difficulties for road users, especially women and children. Many petrol pumps preferred to let only customers use their toilets.

It was in this context that the government decided to take up the construction of 12,000 public toilets for the convenience of travellers. The note said the government would enlist the support of agencies willing to cooperate with the project.

Land in the possession of the government, public sector enterprises, and cooperative institutions would be used for the purpose. The government would also explore the possibility of opening retail shops and cafes wherever possible as part of the project.

The local bodies would be required to foot the cost of constructing the facilities.

A mechanism would be evolved for the hygienic maintenance of the toilets.

Tie-up for technologies

The Cabinet gave the go-ahead for the International Centre for Free and Open Source Software (ICFOSS) to collaborate with the Netherlands Organisation of Applied Scientific Research in new age technologies such as Internet of Things, Machine Learning, and Big Data. ICFOSS will ink an agreement with the Dutch agency for the purpose.

Water supply scheme

The meeting accorded administrative sanction for the second phase of the Jalagram water supply scheme. The ₹69-crore scheme will ensure water supply for Kozhinjampara, Vadakarpathy, and Eruthembathy panchayats in Palakkad district.

New posts

As many 18 posts will be created for the Institute of Advanced Virology, an autonomous institution set up under the Kerala State Council for Science, Technology and Environment.

153,2020/02/20,A ringside view of Kerala’s social history and more,"In his autobiography, ‘Ormapadikal’, economist M.A.Oommen dwells on influences that shaped his life

What do Mahatma Ayyankali and Amartya Sen have in common? Both professed an inextinguishable urge for bettering the lot of the indigent.

Sen’s social development concept was founded on freedom and Ayyankali propounded a capabilities doctrine as the regimen for social amelioration.

Ormapadikal, autobiography of octogenarian economist M.A.Oommen, draws such interesting parallels and reflects on the political and social movements that shaped the destiny of the State from the pre-Independence era unto the present.

Popularly referred to as a ‘Christian socialist’ and born into a conservative Christian family, Dr. Oommen seeks to explain his predominant Left and progressive moorings. He goes on to critically evaluate the major demarches such as the land reforms and People’s Plan Campaign that catalysed social and economic changes in the State in his characteristic ‘bohemian style’.

The profound influence of his father, M.O. Abraham, a schoolteacher, and most importantly M.M.Thomas, the unsung hero with whom Dr.Oommen shared a warm camaraderie, were all instrumental in shaping his critical thinking and acumen. Dr.Oommen fondly remembers his father asking him to send a money order to an ailing poet Chengampuzha Krishna Pillai out of sheer admiration for the latter, as also his lead in educating backward class students and many such other incidents.

At a time when Syrian Christians loathed communism, M.M.Thomas had taken to propagation of Marxism. Dr.Oommen also rues how the advent of neo-liberalism has deprived space for meaningful discussions on issues concerning human development and agriculture, among others.

The book also passionately narrates the freedom movement, the moment when India broke the shackles of the British regime and attained Independence, the tyrannical regime of C.P.Ramaswamy, an abortive attempt on his life, and such others.

Association with CMs

His association with the former Chief Ministers E.M.S.Namoodiripad and E.K.Nayanar and how the late K.M.Mani reacted to his critical appraisal of his Budget, are quite interesting.

Age is only just a number for Dr.Oommen. While continuing his academic pursuits, he steadfastly holds on to his principle: Live life to fight single-handedly, and not stoop for worldly gains.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/4bp2ie/article30864633.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20tvbook001,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/a-ringside-view-of-states-social-history-and-more/article30864630.ece
154,2020/02/20,"‘Trance’ movie review: A half-baked attempt, despite a sensational Fahadh Faasil","Anwar Rasheed's film is a tale of two halves, that loses its plot in trying to be a commentary on everything from depression to drug addiction

The irony of spiritual leaders who preach a ‘higher’ life, free from worldly pleasures, while revelling in a high flying life complete with private islands and supercars themselves, is often lost on their legion of followers. Entranced by their shallow preachings, targeted at the myriad vulnerabilities of the listeners, many blindly fall into the trap.

Trance, directed by Anwar Rasheed, is about the careful corporate strategies that goes into the making of one such god figure — Pastor Joshua Carlton (Fahadh Faasil), an atheist who happens to be full of vulnerabilities, that are exploited by two shadowy businessmen (Gautham Menon and Chemban Vinod). Before being catapulted into the spotlight in this new avatar, the Pastor used to be Viju Prasad, an aspiring motivational speaker struggling to make his way up, even while coping with personal tragedies.

Beyond the surface, the film is also about his mental journey, which oscillates from emotional troughs to drug-induced highs and to manic extremes, similar to what the Pastor’s naive followers are often caught in. At some points, the atheist Pastor seems to be himself convinced about his healing powers.

Trance Direction: Anwar Rasheed

Cast: Fahadh Faasil, Nazriya Nazim, Dileesh Pothen, Gautham Menon

The first half of the film, which captures this transformation is gripping, owing much to Fahadh’s performance, which convinces even the otherwise sceptic viewer who looks down upon such charlatans, to partly root for him. The film attains its high by the interval point, almost having the viewer in a trance. That moment was pregnant with possibilities, enough to hold the audience in a rapture till the end.

Unfortunately, from there, the script goes downhill. One gets to see the writer taking the easy way out at crucial points, bumping off-key characters in a tame manner and depending on the usual television newsbreaks to untangle tricky situations. It was almost as if after more than two hours of slowly building the foundation, of creating a spiritual empire from scratch, they did not know how to end it, so evident in the rushed climax.

It loses its plot in trying to say too many things: on everything from mental depression to drug addiction. Though juxtaposing all this opens the doors to some more intriguing possibilities, it only serves to drag down the plot here. The long sequences of faith-healing also looses its charm in the latter parts. The Pastor’s sequences with his new secretary Esther Lopez (Nazriya Nazim) only adds to the runtime.

Trance might still manage to ruffle quite a lot of feathers across various religious cults among their wide fanbase, but as a serious critique of corporate spirituality and as a piece of cinema, it is a half-baked attempt. Having experienced its potency at half-bake, one can only wonder what they would have achieved with a little more patience and ingenuity.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/rr63ji/article30873399.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Trance,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/trance-movie-review-a-half-baked-attempt-despite-a-sensational-fahadh-faasil/article30873400.ece
155,2020/02/20,Netflix's 'Yeh Ballet': The extraordinary tale of two ballerinos from Maximum City,"The film is the sophomore directorial feature of Padma Shri awardee Sooni Taraporevala, who made 'Little Zizou' in 2009

The sun had set, and the orange lanterns and strung lights bobbed on the salty, sticky summer breeze at Worli Koliwada. Dancers in bright festive wear made their way through the serpentine lanes of the urban village to reach the sets of the Netflix original film Yeh Ballet – bedecked to shoot a Diwali celebration.

“This is a new perspective of the sea link from this side. It hasn’t been seen much on screen,” remarked producer Siddharth Roy Kapur, nodding towards the bridge over the glittering sea. His company, Roy Kapur Films is backing the project, the sophomore directorial feature of Padma Shri awardee Sooni Taraporevala, after their collaboration on The Namesake (2006) – a Mira Nair film built on Taraporevala’s screenplay. Yeh Ballet, inspired by a true story, charts the journey of two young men named Nishu (Manish Chauhan) and the rebellious Asif (Achintya Bose) with Mumbai working class backgrounds pirouetting their way into international ballet schools under the guidance of an the ageing and eccentric Israeli-American ballet teacher – Saul (Julian Sands).

Incongruent elements

As the music blared over the speakers, the director stayed rather quiet while choreographer Shiamak Davar took the reins and guided actors Achintya and Mekhola Bose as they spiritedly danced across the set with the camera focused on them, with hordes of people cheering them on. On the sidelines, Sands and Chauhan laughed and moved to the music.

“This is the Diwali celebration that the boys take their teacher to, and for the first time he’s dancing Bollywood,” shared writer-director Taraporevala, before pointing to Mekhola and adding without giving much away, “Her character is an enigma. She and Asif have a bond that’s based on dance.”Outside of ballet and Bollywood, the film pulls in elements from a number of dance-styles, “Because the real boys come from a hip-hop [and b-boying] background, and Bollywood is all around us. [So] the film has got a full palette of very incongruous dances and music,” said Taraporevala.

The director has offered a glimpse into this story before – in her 2017 14-minute documentary of the same name. “Dance is a rich person’s indulgence,” said Chauhan in the short (who plays himself in the Netflix film), over footage of him and young dancer Amiruddin Shah practicing their moves on a local train. The director picked Chauhan, Shah and their ballet master Yehuda Ma’or’s story to translate into a short Virtual Reality documentary, shot in 360-degrees, for filmmaker Anand Gandhi’s VR Lab.

“It totally fascinated me to read and hear about their stories – [seeing] what they achieved. [Ballet] is a very elite and niche world, [and] no boys dance ballet. [Yet] kids who never heard classical music [became] so good in two years that they got a scholarship to [London’s] The Royal Ballet [and the American Oregon Ballet Theatre] is just a phenomenal thing,” said the director, before continuing, “The documentary short film [was] a completely different beast from writing [and directing] a feature film. [With the feature] you take a kernel of truth and kind of blow it up.”

Fact meets fiction

A beaming Chauhan sits on the intersection between fact and fiction – essaying the character based on his story. When asked about his fairytale-like journey, Chauhan admitted, “I never wanted to become a dancer. I would hide in the school bathroom [when we had to dance]. But as a teenage boy I was introduced to power moves, and backflips seemed cool.” Later, he saved up money, joined Ashley Lobo’s Danceworx Academy, and met Ma’or who saw the spark in his student. “I don’t know what he saw,” laughed Chauhan, “I didn’t know ballet, my English was bad, and all the [ballet] terminologies are in French. Everything he said [went over my head]!” Ma’or once saw Chauhan practicing after class in front of the mirrors, said Chauhan, “So he stayed after class with me the next day, saying ‘I’ll teach you, because you’re doing it all wrong!’”

Achintya stepped in to play Asif (who is based on Shah) since Shah was (and is) training at the Royal Ballet School. “The research,” said Achintya, taking a second to think about the work that went into essaying his character, “was partially done. If there is an example that needs to be given [in a Danceworx class], it’s either Manish, or Amir, or both of them.” Taraporevala revealed that Achintya trained in ballet for about six months under Cindy Jourdain, and also learnt b-boying for the role. His background, however, is in contemporary and jazz. Achintya also added that Asif is significantly different from the quiet, focused Shah.

For Sands (A Room with a View, 1985, and Leaving Las Vegas, 1995), Saul’s story (based on Ma’or’s) carried a delightful sense of destiny. “[The film] is about a pattern revealing itself as the carpet is unrolled – there is an inevitability to [the] journey if you follow your dream. Saul is seeking fulfilment and strikes gold [here].” He found that thread of inevitability in his story too – from being enchanted by Laurence Olivier’s performance in Richard III (1955) as an eight-year-old to joining London’s Central School of Speech and Drama around a decade later. The film, Taraporevala shared, has around 55 speaking roles, and the cast includes Jim Sarbh, Danish Husain, and Vijay Maurya.

156,2020/02/20,‘Baaram’ movie review: A melancholic narration that loses grip and shape,"Despite winning the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Tamil, by the time it winds down, inefficient scripting comes to the fore in this effort

Spoilers ahead

Very few films are capable of translating the weight of its narrative onto the viewer.

Some require us, the audience, to relate to the subject’s relevance; some films demand such a level of intelligence off its audience that principles of existentialism may seem less complicated to comprehend while some other films inflict, using various cinematic tools at a filmmaker’s disposal, the underlying emotion upon an unsuspecting audience thus nudging or pushing us over a ledge and force our conscience to be in sync with what the director intends to showcase on screen.

Baaram does none of these, and is still an example of how to get the job done.

I must tread with caution. The film does leave you wanting towards the end. Perhaps Priya Krishnaswamy could have refrained from following through with the documentary style exposition of ‘Thalaikoothal’. It does suck the energy out of the film, at least what was built up during an impressive, immersive story telling session until the interval.

Baaram delves into the prevalent but oft-shushed criminal practice of Thalaikoothal.

The cast is a mix of inexperienced and untrained artistes, and the cog among them is Karuppasamy (played by R Raju), a man who struggles to hide the disappointment of having turned into a burden for an ungrateful and unconscionable son, Senthil (Su Pa Muthukumar).

The backdrop of Baaram somehow lends itself to make the viewer reminisce about the places where Bharathiraja’s films from the late 1970s was shot. The dialogues are a crucial factor for generating this feeling; they sounded refreshing and authentic — something that was lacking in the much celebrated rural commercial entertainers of the recent past in Tamil cinema.

Karuppasamy is a man of many regrets. He spends his time at his sister’s house with his three nephews; he seems to be more attached to his second nephew Veera (Sugumar Shanmugam) and the feeling seems mutual.

Karuppasamy’s son is estranged from him but we do not know the actual reason for certain. He works as a security guard though Veera prefers he not do that considering his age. But Karuppasamy is spirited — this dialogue captures it beautifully: “Vittil poochi than vedakku nu veezhum. Naan Minmini poochi da” (I’m not a moth to stop existing all of a sudden. I’m a firefly)

Baaram Director: Priya Krishnaswamy

Cast: R Raju, Sugumar Shanmugam, Su Pa Muthukumar, Jayalakshmi, Stella Gobi

Storyline: The criminally unholy practice of Thalaikoothal costs an elderly gentleman his life. Will there be repercussions on those who committed it?

But it all happens suddenly for Karuppasamy. He fractures his hip in a road accident.

The shot here: a slow motion angle showing Karuppasamy’s right hand fall as if with the weight of the world bearing down on it is where the director chooses to insert her title card. Quite poignant. The worst, though, is yet to come. What follows is torment and pain, not just for Karuppasamy but also for the audience.

The elderly gent’s son, Senthil, inserts himself onto the scene. He is affected by how society perceives him but his cold heart would not budge for his father’s wails and cries for help. He is unmoved when he learns of the accident but is quite content arm-twisting his nephews (who seem partially okay with passing the buck over) into letting him take charge of his father’s well being.

Karuppasamy’s anguish at having to pretend that he is fine though he cannot move around, when his affectionate sister, Menmoli, comes visiting, is a moving scene. He shushes her, asks her not to raise her voice because the son is overhearing their conversation.

Another particularly endearing scene involves Karuppasamy’s granddaughter; the shot showing the little girl sticking close to the corner of a wall as her parents argue over who takes care of Karuppasamy. We see her face on the right end of the frame, and the lifeless, absolutely motionless, lower half of Karuppasamy’s torso filling out the left side of the frame, as her eyes wander across in bewilderment, fear, anguish and a range of other “feeling helpless” emotions. When Senthil pays a maid to help clean up his father, Karuppasamy’s emotions are quite clear. He need not be in the situation if not for his son; his eyes and wails letting us know in no uncertain terms how he feels to be robbed of his right to life and dignity.

Then one day Karuppasamy dies. At the funeral, the nephews and Senthil clash as the former catch wind that he may have been murdered by the practice of Thalaikoothal.

As a scriptwriter, this is a situation that is now perfectly poised. Post interval, as a viewer who has been completely spellbound by the happenings so far, it is quite natural to expect things to boil over, a frenetic finish that may involve pursuit, the failure and/or triumph of justice, or if it establishes the fact that deeper, and more darker, evils usually prevail over truth and liberty in a society.

Except, the second half takes its own course. At some point, it turns into a VICE video, or an awareness film, for want of better words. There is no more tension, no more anticipation. The burden seems lifted, and that is deflating from the perspective of a viewer. By the time the film winds down, inefficient scripting comes to the fore.

Baaram could have been so much more as a film. An efficient example in how to engross the viewer in its narrative technique — weaving simple cinematic shots, exploiting the most basic of film-making and cinematography principles to present a compelling tale that jolts your conscience. I wouldn’t dare say that it crumbles under the burden of heightened expectations from a viewer’s point of view, what with it being a National Award winner.

It just could have let the burden stay on me.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/lcqn4s/article30870893.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Veera-threatens-Senthilfuneral,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/baaram-movie-review-a-melancholic-narration-that-loses-grip-and-shape/article30870894.ece
157,2020/02/20,"‘Ayyappanum Koshiyum’ was a learning curve for me, says cinematographer Sudeep Elamon","By avoiding the clichéd scenic shots, the ace cameraman caught the action in the film without filters or fancy equipment

Real and raw. That was film director and writer Sachy’s mandate for cinematographer Sudeep Elamon when he approached the lensman to join the team of Ayyappanum Koshiyum. Thanks to his work as a wildlife photographer and filmmaker, Sudeep has had plenty of experience shooting raw and real footage of the creatures of the jungles. It was one such documentary that Sachy saw that made him choose the 26-year-old to shoot the film.

“He told me that he wanted me to shoot a ‘wild film’. That had me hooked. It was a learning curve for me,” says the three-film-old director of photography as he discusses the shooting of the film that has hit the bullseye with its fast-paced narrative of an ego tussle between the two protagonists, Ayyappan Nair and Koshi, essayed by Biju Menon and Prithviraj Sukumaran respectively.

Sudeep Elamon

Shot mostly in Attappady and suburbs of Palakkad, the film veers away from all the usual scenic scenes one has seen of the landscape. Sudeep says both he and Sachy were keen on avoiding such visuals and slow-motion frames that have now become a regular feature of several Malayalam films.

In addition, there was no use of crane, track, jib or any such equipment. “Most of the movie was filmed with a hand-held camera and many a time, I was in the thick of action. It was amazing to see the dedication of the lead actors. For me, the final confrontation between the two was the most exciting and challenging to film. The director had decided not to use duplicates, as is usually done, for the the fight sequences. Both Raju ettan (Prithviraj) and Biju ettan were game for the sequence choreographed by fight master Rajasekharan. Usually, such fight scenes are shot using two or three cameras and stunt artistes slip in to do the tough scenes. But in this film, everything that we see on screen was done by the actors themselves and I was right there, beside their elbow or near their feet to capture the action. And each scene was shot in the midst of a crowd of 400 to 500 people,” says Sudeep, his words tumbling out, one after the other, as he recounts that swift action scene towards the end of the film.

He continues: “One of the scenes required Raju ettan to lift up Biju ettan and slam him on the ground. Both the actors were game and though they made light of it, they told us not to ask them for a retake. When Raju ettan really did it, we were all dumbstruck.”

To get the protagonist’s view during the face-off between Ayyappan and Koshi, Sudeep fixed a camera to a helmet and got up close to capture the feel of the battle between the two. “That was really interesting. In some of the scenes, Ayyappan and Koshi were tripping over my legs or directing their blows at my hands. Since, it was so close, Prithviraj told me to move aside quickly while he hit out at my hand. But my focus was on the shot and I got hit. I saw stars for a while! Similarly in one scene, Biju ettan had to twist my foot. He warned me that if I did not move my body along it, I would end up with a sprained foot. But every hardship was worth it. All those scenes have come out so well,” says Sudeep.

Sudeep Elamon and Prithviraj on the sets of ‘Ayyappanum Koshiyum’ | Photo Credit: Special arrangement

Sudeep asserts that each of the three feature films he has worked on has been a hands-on experience to see at close quarters how the entire film is visualised and narrated. A graduate of visual communications from Asan Memorial College of Arts and Science in Chennai, Sudeep was able to work as an assistant cameraman during the filming of a one-year series Life Force 2 for Animal Planet in 2013. Once that was over, he moved on to do advertisements. “My friend Goutham Soorya and I approached S Kumar, one of the senior-most cinematographers of Malayalam cinema, to do the shooting of the ad. He mentored me during the work and that became a turning point for me. Even today, I turn to him for advice and he has been a guiding light for me,” says Sudeep.

In the meantime, along with Goutham, he decided to direct a film. Film editor Appu Bhattathiri gave them some tips to fund the movie and with the money pooled in by friends and family members, they made Sleeplessly Yours, which won a place in the Malayalam Cinema Now section of the 24th edition of the International Film Festival of Kerala.

In his blood Cinema is in Sudeep’s genes. His grandfather, Krishna Elamon, was one of the pioneering technically-qualified sound recordists in Indian cinema. Sudeep’s father, Suresh Elamon, is a multi-award-winning wildlife photographer with an enviable repertoire.

So when is he helming a film again? He laughs with embarrassment and says: “When I look back now, I understand how we were lucky that the film went places. In all the three films I worked in, the directors were the scenarists and writers too and I saw the thought that went into each scene, each word and each sequence. For instance, once I asked Sachy ettan if Koshi would speak in a certain way. He explained at length how and why he would. I am in no hurry to direct another one. I would like to learn more,” says Sudeep. He says it was the same learning curve in the case of Finals and Pathinettam Padi as well. “While working with the directors, one understands how far I have to go.”

Although he is thrilled that Ayyappanum Koshiyum is ticking all the right boxes with viewers, Sudeep is already at work on a recce mission to finalise the locations for Jude Anthany Joseph’s new film 2403 Ft, starring Tovino Thomas, Asif Ali, Jayasurya and Kunchacko Boban. The film is based on the flood that ravaged Kerala in 2018. “It is the height of the Idukki dam and the movie is being shot on a huge canvas. Even as I got offers for some assignments, I had to turn them down to focus on this film. It reflects on the challenges, suffering and endurance of our people and we will have to work hard to do justice to the theme. It is going to be extremely challenging,” says Sudeep.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/2v22ed/article30870122.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21tvmsudeep1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/cinematographer-sudeep-elamon-on-his-work-in-ayyappanum-koshiyum/article30870129.ece

159,2020/02/20,Comfortable in her skin: Costume designer-actor Dolly Ahluwalia on reliving the 'Doordarashan' era,"Best known for her performance in 'Vicky Donor', the actor is coming back on the big screen with Gagan Puri’s 'Doordarshan'

A reluctant actor, Dolly Ahluwalia, best known for her performance in Vicky Donor, is coming back on the big screen with Gagan Puri’s Doordarshan. An alumna of National School of Drama, Ahluwalia is playing the role of a woman who wakes up from coma after 25-30 years and finds the world around her has changed from Doordarshan to Netflix. “When I got a call from Gagan, he seemed a little hesitant. All he told me was that he had a script ready with him and there was a character in it for which he had me in mind. When I read the script, I loved it for being honest. I told him that I could see some scope for improvisation and he immediately assured me that I was free to improvise,” says Ahluwalia

She is a good performer, but, for many, she is a celebrated costume designer. For her very first film (Bandit Queen), Ahluwalia bagged the National Award for the Best Costume Design. Around two decades later she won it again; this time for Vishal Bhardwaj’s Haider. She has also been awarded the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award for costume design.

Edited excerpts:

Tell us about your part in the film. How did you prepare for it?

The character that I play is that of an elderly lady who has been in coma for the last 25-30 years. One day, she suddenly regains consciousness. That’s when the comedy kicks in as the doctors warn the family that she is not in a position to take in so much of change that has happened over the decades. So the only way out is to take her back to the era in which she was before entering coma. Now, I really liked the character and could actually see myself playing it from the word go. I felt the character had a great scope and that’s what got me started. In order to get a hold of the character, I personally did a lot of research as I wanted to be sure that a person can actually stay in coma for so long. Once I got my answers, I was completely geared up to play it.

It was very important to be in absolute control of the character at all times as otherwise one can drift into the zone of slapstick comedy or caricature. Whenever I felt that I went a little over the top, I used to ask Gagan to go for an extra take. It was mentally and physically quite a strenuous role for me but I had a great time on the sets. The nostalgia of reliving the golden era of Doordarshan that gave us shows like Buniyaad, Hum Log, Ramayan, and Mahabharat made it even more special.

You have been very picky when it comes to acting. Do you ever regret being underutilised as an actor?

It makes me little jittery and upset when I get calls for roles from big banners that are on the lines of Vicky Donor. I really am not interested in doing the same thing over and over again. I like to challenge myself as an actor. If I can be good in comedy then I can be good in tragedy also. I have to get pregnant with the project and the role so that I am able to deliver one of the most beautiful babies! That’s my life’s aspiration.

You have been a leading costume designer in the country. How do you usually approach a project?

I feel that Hollywood pays a lot of importance to costume designing. But, sadly in our country, it’s still not there. Costume designing, for me, is the skin of any character as costumes are a great way to understand the characters. A costume designer has to have faith of the actors. Then only it can come together. Let me give you the example of Saif Ali Khan’s character Langda Tyagi in Omkara. When I had to go to Saif for a meeting he was totally expecting a Shakespearean touch with his costumes. Now, he is a very emotional and a sincere actor and so when he learnt that he will be wearing a gamchha and khadi kurta he got a big shock. But I had really gone prepared with my sketches and swatches of fabrics and so I explained him everything to the last detail. Gradually, I saw him getting transformed into the character. So, by carefully choosing the right costumes for him, I was able to give him the confidence needed to build the character. Of course, he made the most of it.

You are an acting graduate from the NSD. How did you get associated with costume designing?

Although I am a gold medallist in acting from National School of Drama, I have always had a thing for costumes. I haven’t had any formal training but my guru, Ebrahim Alkazi, just observed me and said that I had an eye for costume designing and that I should concentrate on it. I think this came from my family. My aunt was very conscious about dressing up and I used to observe her a lot. Also, I observe a lot in nature. It’s the best source to give you the understanding of textures, colours, and movements. You see, different trees have different movements. So you can pick up all these details from nature and translate that into your work.

From the time you started as a costume designer on Bandit Queen, how has the scene changed?

Bandit Queen was a wonderful learning experience for me. Shekhar Kapur gave me the confidence to come up with the most authentic set of costumes for the characters. The idea was to keep things as realistic as possible. And I still miss Ashok Mehta, the cinematographer. He literally taught me how to use colours and make costume designing cinematic. He would take me along with him in his crane and show me things from up there. Now, over the years, there have been a lot of positive changes. There is greater awareness about costume designing. Also, the budgets are bigger. Earlier, it used to be very difficult to manage things in the absence of a decent budget. But at the end of the day you have to be honest in your work. Also, it’s important to have that level of passion. If you don’t have the hunger to outdo yourself each time, you have very little hope to taste success.

Today, VFX has become so advanced that the technology allows artists to work on costumes in post production. How has that affected your work as a costume designer?

Well, to be honest, that’s one of the reasons why I am withdrawing myself. With the new changes I am not able to be honest with my profession and my creativity. If someone hires me, it is because of the faith that person has in my craft. And it’s my duty to reciprocate it. Now, I am not saying that it’s wrong to use technology. But it just doesn’t work for me. That’s why these days I have grown very choosy even with the kind of costume designing assignments I take up.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/edarma/article30870563.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21DFRDOLLYAHLUWALIA,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/comfortable-in-her-skin-costume-designer-actor-dolly-ahluwalia-on-reliving-the-doordarashan-era/article30870564.ece
160,2020/02/20,"Malayalam film and media celebrities come together to form a league, Celebrity Cricket Fraternity to play cricket","TV and media celebrities ignore meetings, dust and heat to take each other on in a cricket tournament in Kochi

Film director Saji Surendran roars with laughter when I ask if matches of the Celebrity Cricket Fraternity (CCF) teams are being played. It is almost 12 noon, temperatures soar and the sun is bright and blinding. The games are part of a cricket tournament being organised by Online Fight Riders, a CCF team, at Rajagiri cricket field in Kakkanad. “As long as it doesn’t rain, we will play,” he says, adding “Heat and sweat don’t matter, only the game does.”

This league which began in 2011 with four teams, now has 20 teams, made up of film, media, and television industry professionals. It includes film actors, directors, assistant directors, musicians, producers, choreographers, television actors, mimicry artistes, and media professionals. Professional cricketers are not permitted unless they are over 40 years of age and have not played formally for at least five years.

Some teams such as Media Strikers Kerala, Cochin Music Challengers or Kerala Director’s XI are homogeneous — made up of players from one profession, there are others such as Cochin Super Kings and Millennium Stars which are a mix of actors, directors, mimicry artistes and assistant directors. Each team has around 20 players including the playing 11. About 10 tournaments are played though the year, depending on the availability of a ground. All the grounds where the teams cuurently play are maintained by the Kerala State Cricket Association (KSCA).

While the league began out of a love for cricket, over the the last nine years it grown into something for which “some of us push back work,” jokes Saji Surendran, who is secretary of CCF. Since his team is playing in the ongoing tournament, he has postponed a meeting. Similarly Saju Navodaya (Pashanam Shaji), an avid cricketer and captain of the Mimicry Artists Association Fighter (MAA Fighters), was to travel to Chennai to participate in Bigg Boss. However, since MAA Fighters was organising the tournament, in December, he left only after it was done. “This sport is a passion for us and more than that a great stress buster, a way to relax,” says singer Prakash Babu, captain of Cochin Music Challengers (CMC).

In search of a Ground Saji Surendran says conducting tournaments gets expensive. To keep them within budget more matches are packed into a day: Four 15 over games for initial matches and 20 over games for semis and the finals. These matches start at 7.30 am and go on till 6.30 pm.

Renting the grounds costs between ₹ 20,000 – 30,000 per day, so a five-day tournament will cost organisers more than a lakh rupees.

Therefore the hunt is on for a permanent playing field, “We could lease a playground. We would then spend the money on our own ground. Last year alone we paid close to ₹22 lakh for a ground. If we have our own ground we have a permanent location, which we are aiming at,” says Mahesh.



Surendran adds the ground can be used by other teams as well.

For others, being part of CCF gave them new opportunities cricket-wise like playing with the stitched ball. “When most of us were kids, we played with rubber balls. But with the formation of CCF as it was called, we got the real deal,” says Saji Krishna, vice captain of MAA Fighters. While CCF began as an informal group, where teams got together to play casually, in May 2019 it was formalised as an association. “That brought about a certain degree of discipline on the ground. It became systematic when it came to organisation,” says Saji Surendran.

Though some teams have coaches, most don’t. MAA Fighters, in its initial days, had a coach for a couple of months to ready them for the league but they have been on their own after. “Anyway our patterns are set when it comes to how we play. Nothing much can be changed, only minor corrections which we work on amongst ourselves,” says Saji Krishna, adding that Kapil Dev is his cricketing icon. “I even mimic his bowling action,” he jokes.

Most teams practise as and when they get time, some like Saji Surendran hit the nets (indoor) daily.

A majority of these teams have sponsors, while some like MAA Fighters do not: Saju pays the entire expenses of the team. A team has expenses right from registration with the association to travel. Then there are the costs incurred during a playing season, which lasts eight months minus the time it rains.

Besides there is the cost of renting a ground and conducting tournaments. The funds for these come from the entry fee each team pays to play in a tournament, the registration fee that they pay to join CCF and of course, from the sponsorships.

Physical fitness, an inevitable outcome of playing any sport. The biggest payoff, however, has been the camaraderie that playing sport has generated, says media professional Mahesh Poloor of Media Strikers Kerala.

Saji Surendran says new projects have gone live because of it. The Mammootty-starrer Pullikkaaran Staraa was one. The director of the film Shyamdhar got to meet the superstar, through George, his secretary, who captains Cochin Super Kings.

“This is a great networking opportunity and over and above, this is one place where everybody irrespective of what they do — act or direct or assist or choreograph — comes together on one ground sans hierarchy or protocol. We are all friends here,” he adds.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/cx17y9/article30870450.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/kimpcricketjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/tv-film-and-media-celebrities-have-got-together-to-form-the-celebrity-cricket-fraternity-and-bond-over-cricket/article30870451.ece
161,2020/02/20,Netflix India’s Srishti Arya on the non-English content the country loves to watch,"For International Mother Language Day (February 21), Netflix India’s Director of International Originals also gives us the inside scoop on what’s slated for 2020

In an exclusive interview with MetroPlus Srishti Arya, Netflix India’s Director of International Originals, recalls a group of women in south Delhi who got so hooked on a wave of Korean film and television, that they started learning to speak Korean and even the cuisine. This little anecdote reminds her of “the ultimate truth of how stories transcend language and borders,” especially in these polarising times. As of October 2019, Netflix globally released 100 seasons of local language, original scripted series from 17 countries and have plans for over 130 seasons more in 2020.

Netflix broke into the Indian market just three years ago and the ripple effect is remarkable. According to the streaming giant, Spanish, Korean and Japanese drove the highest viewing in India as they were released, after English and local Indian languages. Popular Spanish titles included La Casa de Papel (which was watched across 44 million households globally, making it Netflix’s most-watched international series in a non-English language) and horror movie Veronica. Japanese titles included The Naked Director and Ultraman, while Korean titles included Boys Over Flowers and Something in the Rain.

Of course, there is the business side of filmmaking; filming in other parts of the world is also less expensive while also tapping into more diverse talent pools. That said, this year will see the OTT platform tap into more cultures, affirms Srishti. She adds,” One of coolest line-ups has to be the slate from African countries; and its incredible to see the representation. We also release our content globally at the same time [unlike theatrical releases]. When we are working on anything in any region, we work for that region first but we are also working for the world.”

Across the industry The evolution is not just OTT-specific; Oscar-winning Parasite is the first Korean film that received a theatrical release in India, emphasising there is a niche but growing market for small-scale and plot-driven foreign films in India as around the world. Japanese film Shoplifters (which is on Netflix) achieved over 90% occupancy in its first run itself in cities like Chennai and also 95% occupancy in markets such as Ahmedabad and Chandigarh that otherwise witness an occupancy of 60 to 70% over weekends.

Srishti agrees that OTT platforms have essentially proven that Hollywood can no longer be officially labelled ‘an international institution’ and she finds this reckoning “liberating, because this is the Golden Age for content creators. We are examining the democratisation of content, and the access is there for you to dip into any culture you want. I think it keeps us, as creators, on our toes to make sure that it is about authenticity and that fact that great stories can come from anywhere and they go everywhere.”

Part data, part human

Much of Netflix’s innovation relies on its mammoth databases and evolving algorithms of people’s watching patterns. “We are looking at dubbing our own content from India into roughly 30 languages between dubs and subs. We also find that people are not being so ‘sticky’ about the language of origin as long as it is a compelling story. The data also shows us the areas in which we can improve.”

Series such as Spanish-spoken Hache have taken on different languages as part of the narrative which often shifts in location, which reflects how language is still an integral anthropological element for such content. “This year, we have a Hindi film coming out but the characters are Maharashtrians but the kids grew up with the family in Kerala, so when the kids want to hide something from their parents, they speak in Malayalam, but the parents speak Marathi. And when the kids go to school where they speak English. In meetings with the filmmaker, he was open to changing the language to keep it uniform, but we said, ‘no.’ This is the power of being where you are right now and you keep it honest and true. Your mother tongue is something you find comfort in and invites feelings of security. That advantage is for the storyteller and with dubbing and subbing, there is no reason why nobody else can enjoy it.”

Srishti adds that the innovation teams at Netflix’s Los Gatos office make sure that content releases are staggered, so as not to overwhelm audiences and so that great content is not lost in the woodwork, but elaborates, “We serve our content not by language, but by what we believe you would like to see and what would be meaningful to you, based on what you’re watching. And we’ve seen this interest since Sacred Games, which has subtitles in 30 languages, and was dubbed in English, Spanish, Portuguese (Brazilian), and Turkish. People are curious about how other people live. We are working on Telugu, Tamil, Marathi, Bengali content. We would not say no to even tribal dialects if they serve the story best.”

Then there’s licensing, which the streaming giant takes seriously. Netflix continually expands its library by collaborating with local and international studios. - If we are talking about the ‘mega regional films,’ there is the Vijay-starrer Sarkar and Rajinikanth-starrer Petta. The library also extends to non-English films which have done well on the awards circuit.

It is interesting, Srishti concludes, that 15 years ago, only a handful would have thought the creative and the empirical datasets go hand-in-hand, but with the way streaming has evolved, the two mediums are symbiotic.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/3cjqx/article30870194.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy21-lacasadepapel,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/international-mother-language-day-2020-srishti-arya-netflix-india-director-of-international-originals-about-non-english-content-popularity-in-india/article30870196.ece
162,2020/02/20,'Bhoot Part One: The Haunted Ship': Just Vicky Kaushal and the 'silence',"Discussing the making of the horror movie, along with debut director Bhanu Pratap Singh, actor Vicky Kaushal weighs in on his method and the journey so far

Both director Bhanu Pratap Singh and actor Vicky Kaushal are poring over their mobile phones. The former has pre-release issues to handle before his first film, Bhoot - Part one: The Haunted Ship, opens across the country. And the actor is selecting a photograph from his visit to the Charminar earlier in the day, to post on social media. “During promotional tours I end up posting pictures only towards the evening; I’m trying to change that today,” he says, before we get talking during his brief visit to Hyderabad.

Bhoot is a horror film from Dharma Productions with a fictionalised story Bhanu had written, intrigued by a 2011 incident of a ship that was stationed in Mumbai for 21 days without a crew. In the film, Vicky is the only character on the ship, which happens to be haunted.

“It’s just him and the silence,” says Bhanu, referring to considerable portions of the film where Vicky is the only actor. The work process was new for the actor and the crew. The silence has to draw the audience into the situation the character faces. While working on those scenes, Vicky decided he had to give in to the moment and not over-think his part. “I took one scene at a time, understanding the character, his grief and mindset, and played it with utmost honesty,” he says.

Bhanu pitches in, discussing the actor’s method, “If we were shooting, say, page 23 from the script, he would read only till that page so that he stays in that emotional zone. He had read the script initially while agreeing to do the film, but he wouldn’t read more than what was required for the day’s shoot. It was a smart way of staying in the moment.”

View from Charminar: Vicky recalls his visit to Hyderabad a few years ago to perform a children’s play: “We performed to an audience of around 1000 children; they were a naughty bunch,” he remembers. Returning to the city now, as a Bollywood star-actor who makes heads turns in the Charminar, he’s eager to explore the city further, “I wish I had the time to climb up the Charminar and view the city.”

Conquering hydrophobia: For Bhoot, Vicky trained for a week with scuba divers. “I can swim, but I feared water. I could barely stay under water, I would panic and come up when we shot an underwater scene on day one. Even if I did the shot, the fear would show on my face,” he recalls. For the next few days, he would go to the bottom of the six-feet pool in his building and spend more time, to get comfortable under water. “Then we made him jump into a 25-feet pool to get over his phobia,” laughs Bhanu.

The shots were designed in a manner that the audience travels with the actor to explore the ship. With no precedent for such situations in Indian films, they were confident they had something intriguing. “How many people can claim they’ve been on a dead freight ship with no one around? This is the experience we are bringing to the screens,” says Bhanu.

Filming on a real ship for the exteriors and a set for the interiors, the crew set up camera and lights in narrow spaces where it was tough for two people to walk shoulder to shoulder. “If you had to change the angle by 180 degrees, it would involve a 100 people having to change positions in those spaces. When we shot on the upper deck of the ship which is about 10 floors high, equipment had to be carried via steep staircases,” says Vicky.

As Vicky discusses the methods of the crew, we hark back to his days as an assistant director (AD) on the sets of Anurag Kashyap’s Gangs of Wasseypur. “Not a day goes by when I don’t value that experience,” he says, and goes on to explain, “Being an AD teaches you humility and how to work with about 200 others who come from different social backgrounds and temperaments. It disciplined me, and made me technically aware — to observe how other actors perform, and have a basic knowledge of the camera, lens and framing.”

Back then, he knew he wanted to be an actor but didn’t know what would be his next step. He cherishes his experience in theatre: “I worked with wonderful actors like Richa Chaddha, Manoj Bajpayee, Piyush Mishra and Nawazuddin Siddiqui who had done theatre. I realised theatre was my riyaaz.”

Vicky Kaushal

There was a fearlessness with which the actor did his initial projects. “Beggars can’t be choosers,” he jokes and adds on a serious note that he was blessed to be a part of films like Neeraj Ghaywan’s Masaan, which earned him credibility. Things didn’t come easy, Vicky mentions, “Manmarziyaan, Uri: The Surgical Strike and Bhoot are the only films for which I didn’t do a screen test or audition. Some films came to me by pure luck and now I’m in a position to choose,” he says. After a ₹300 crore box office winner like Uri, he’s acutely aware of the stakes involved, but says his creative decisions will not be clouded by the thought of box office prospects alone.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/9drgfu/article30869978.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Vicky-kaushal-2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/vicky-kaushal-and-director-bhanu-pratap-singh-discuss-the-making-of-bhoot-part-one-the-haunted-ship/article30869979.ece
163,2020/02/20,Steven Spielberg’s daughter Mikaela announces career in adult entertainment,"The 23-year-old was adopted by Spielberg and his wife Kate Capshaw when she was a baby

Filmmaker Steven Spielberg’s daughter Mikaela has said that she will be pursuing a career in the adult entertainment industry.

The 23-year-old, who was adopted by Spielberg and his wife Kate Capshaw when she was a baby, has started producing her own pornographic videos. She has also said would love to work in a strip club once she obtains her stripper license.

Mikaela has chosen Sugar Star as her stage name.

“I just launched my self-produced adult entertainment career. Safe, sane, consensual is the goal y’all. My body, my life, my income, my choice. I owe not a single person my autonomy or virtue just because of a name,” she wrote on Instagram.

Hoping to become financially independent from her parents, Mikaela said she “just got tired of working day to day in a way that wasn’t satisfying (her) soul.”

She told The Sun newspaper: “I feel like doing this kind of work, I’m able to ‘satisfy’ other people, but that feels good because it’s not in a way that makes me feel violated.”

Mikaela broke the news to her parents through Facetime. According to her, they are “intrigued” but “not upset.”

Her fiance Chuck Pankow, 47, supported her decision as well. Out of respect for Pankow, she said she will only do solo videos and won’t have sex with another person on camera.

Growing up, Mikaela said she was a rebellious child and was sent to a boarding school for troubled teens. “I came out of there worst than I was going in,” she said.

She also shared her battle with anxiety, depression, eating disorder, and drinking problems. “It’s not my parents’ fault. They couldn’t have known,” she said.

She also suffered from sexual abuse when she was young. She said she was groomed and abused by “predators.” She claimed those men were outsiders and not anyone from her family or their circle of friends. She was additionally “bullied viciously” in school because of her last name.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/6h4mj3/article30868696.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/steven-spielberg-mikaela-1200,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/steven-spielbergs-daughter-mikaela-announces-career-in-adult-entertainment/article30868697.ece

165,2020/02/20,Biju Menon on the success of 'Ayyappanum Koshiyum' and completing 25 years in the Malayalam film industry,"The actor, who turns 50 this year, says that it is is a character’s scope for performance that makes him on a role, and not the age or image

Biju Menon has that knack for evoking laughter even while maintaining a poker face. The actor, who has been in the industry for over 25 years, started off with serious roles and essayed several memorable villains before he turned to comedy with some unconventional roles.

In writer-director Sachy’s Ayyappanum Koshiyum, which is setting the cash registers ringing, Biju plays Ayyappan Nair, a sub-inspector on the verge of retirement. Although Biju insists he is not someone who pursues roles or films, that has not deterred him from coming up with well-appreciated characters at regular intervals.

Excerpts from the interview...

It is rare for both the heroes in the title role to receive equal footing in a film as in Ayyappanum Koshiyum...

The story of a tiny problem snowballing into a full-fledged ego tussle has been brilliantly presented in this movie. There is a balance achieved in character design, we didn’t add anything new to Sachy’s script. According to Sachy, this film is not the usual hero versus villain story. Both the leads have shades of grey. More than the screen space or the character’s heroism, what attracted me was the fact that the script gave me a chance to perform.

Sub-Inspector Ayyappan Nair keeps his emotions under lock and key. Was it challenging to play such a character?

The character and his spectrum of emotions were perfectly sketched in the script. As an actor, all I had to do was step into the character’s shoes and understand his thoughts and feelings. Sachy did such a fine job of moulding us that we actually felt we were in a real police station while shooting some of the scenes.

Do you carry the character back home with you?

Not really. I am not that intense an actor to carry a character beyond a point (laughs).

You have played characters that are older than you in several movies...

Even in my early days in the industry, my focus has always been to play characters with substance. I don’t check to see if my role is that of a hero or a person with negative shades. It’s the scope for performance that I look for and not the age or image of my characters.

But you are in a business where stardom matters. And there is always the risk of being typecast.

Getting typecast depends on the roles we choose, doesn’t it? When the same kind of characters are offered to you, you have the option of not doing them. I stopped accepting the roles of police officers when I realised I was doing many of those roles. I was beginning to get bored playing clichéd comic characters, which made me think about moving on to something new. However, that doesn’t mean that with the success of Ayyappanum Koshiyum, I will stop doing comedy.

You and Prithviraj Sukumaran were in Sachy’s directorial debut, Anarkali, as well. Are you at ease while working with friends?

Yes. When I am working in my comfort zone, I am more at ease while giving suggestions or inputs about a particular scene.

You opted out of Thuramukham and Malik...?

Both these offers came to me while I was busy with Ayyappanum Koshiyum. They did wait for me but I decided to opt out as I had to maintain the look of my character for Ayyappanum Koshiyum.

What is Madhu Warrier’s directorial debut, Lalitham Sundaram, about that you are doing next?

Lalitham Sundaram is a simple family movie that has a positive feel.

You are pairing up with Manju Warrier in Lalitham Sundaram for the first time after her comeback. How do you view her journey as an actor?

Manju proved that she is an extremely talented artiste even before she took the break. And after her comeback, she is doing so well, even in Tamil.

As you complete 25 years in the industry, how do you view your successes and failures as an actor?

See, the efforts taken for every movie is the same, regardless of their outcome. In my case, be it a success or failure, the highs or the lows remain for just a few days. By then, I would be involved in the next project.

Do you analyse what went wrong when your movies fail?

Actually, it’s either my wife, Samyuktha (Menon), or my friends who do such analyses. They are the ones who point out what worked and failed in a particular film. It’s difficult for me to judge a film as I am often more focussed on my role and performance on screen. I leave the analysing to them and accept their suggestions and criticisms as they relay what the viewers felt.

Since many of your comedies have clicked at the box office, is there some kind of a pressure on you to take up comic roles?

Nowadays, most of the roles that come my way have shades of humour in them. I enjoy doing comic roles that blend with the story. I am looking for cinema that is sensible and is entertaining and engaging, be it is comic or serious.

Were you affected by social media attacks after you campaigned for Suresh Gopi during the last Lok Sabha elections?

I have known Suresh ettan (Suresh Gopi) for years and went campaigning for him without looking into his political affiliations. And yes, I was upset when the discussions veered off course. But Suresh ettan is a good friend of mine and I will campaign for him in future too. Such controversies affect you only when you pay heed to those discussions. Once you learn to ignore them, everything will be over.

You are turning entering 50 this year. What does the milestone mean to you?

I feel I have a certain gravitas. Even my son wants me to be more serious now (laughs). Having said that, I don’t thing there will be any big change.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/xtaiaz/article30859023.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21tvfBiju2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/actor-biju-menon-on-how-he-picks-roles-and-his-journey-so-far/article30859024.ece
166,2020/02/20,Tamil Nadu Assembly introduces Bill to declare Cauvery delta a protected agricultural zone,"Any ongoing projects/industry function in the proposed zone however, will not be disturbed, one of the provisions of the Bill says

Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Thursday introduced a Bill in the Legislative Assembly seeking to declare the Cauvery delta region a Protected Special Agriculture Zone (PSAZ), a policy decision which he had announced recently. However, the Bill excluded from its ambit Tiruchi, Ariyalur and Karur districts, which geographically fall within the Delta region. Any ongoing projects / industry function in the proposed PSAZ would not be disturbed.

The Bill said, since certain non-farming activities were adversely affecting agriculture in the region, threatening the State’s food security, “to protect the agriculture in this region, it is proposed to prohibit certain activities in the region.”

The Bill also sought to establish a 30-member Tamil Nadu Protected Agricultural Zone Authority headed by the Chief Minister to advise the government on various measures to protect and improve farming activities to increase farm production and farm productivity to serve the interest of farmers.

Also read: Edappadi hints at ‘good news’ on hydrocarbon projects

The proposed PSAZ would comprise of Thanjavur, Tiruvarur and Nagapattinam districts and five blocks each in Cuddalore and Pudukkottai districts. These areas have been listed under the First Schedule of the Act, to which the government may add or omit any area in the future.

The government has identified zinc smelter, iron ore process plants, copper smelter, aluminium smelter, tannery, and ship breaking industries among others as industries that adversely affect agriculture developments in the PSAZ.

167,2020/02/20,Four cities to get competitive exams coaching centres,"The centres will be opened in Chennai, Coimbatore, Salem and Madurai cities

The Higher Education Department of Tamil Nadu has initiated steps to open four coaching centres to train students from economically weak backgrounds for competitive examinations.

The centres will be opened in Chennai, Coimbatore, Salem and Madurai cities. In a letter sent to all government arts and sciences colleges this week, C. Jothi Venkateswaran, Directorate of Collegiate Education (Full Additional Charge), has asked for a list of Assistant Professors who are eligible and willing to be moved to the posts of Assistant Professors to be created in these centres.

A senior official from the Higher Education Department said that these centres will help the students to train for competitive exams from an early stage and actively pursue government jobs as a career choice.

The State government already provides coaching for civil services examination through the centres run by All India Civil Service Coaching Centre, which is part of Anna Institute of Management.

Apart from this, IAS Coaching Centres are also run in Queen Mary’s College in Chennai and Sri Meenakshi Government Arts College for Women in Madurai. However, these two colleges do not have dedicated staff for the coaching centres, because of which sources in these colleges said that there was not adequate focus towards the centres.

“Moreover, all these existing centres focus on the civil services examination. In the new centres to be set up, the idea is to focus on other competitive examinations as well,” the official said.

Welcoming the move, S. Suresh, Joint Secretary (General), Tamil Nadu Government College Teachers’ Association, said that it will be a boon for students from rural areas, particularly in Coimbatore, Salem and Madurai districts.

“I hope the programme will be executed in such a way that students right from first year can undergo coaching,” he said. He added that gradually at least one such centre must be established in each district.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/four-cities-to-get-competitive-exams-coaching-centres/article30868747.ece
168,2020/02/20,44 government-sponsored aspirants in Chennai ace UPSC test,"The candidates from the All India Civil Service Coaching Centre have been called for the personality test for the civil services (Main) examination

As many as 65 candidates, including 44 full-time residents from the All India Civil Service Coaching Centre in the city have been called for the personality test for the civil services (Main) examination held in 2019.

The centre, wholly-funded by State government’s Department of Personnel and Administrative Reforms, accepts 225 candidates who have passed the prelims on a first-come-first-serve basis. The candidates come from varied backgrounds, with just one aim -- to clear the Mains and the subsequent interview.

“This year the infrastructure received a big shot in the arm with the Public Works Department carrying out extensive civil and electrical renovations to the tune of ₹65 lakh,” said M. Ravichandran, principal.

To equip the candidates, the centre conducted model personality tests a fortnight ago. All the qualified candidates underwent a rigorous session by six boards of experts that included senior or retired bureaucrats, young officers, a member representing the law and the public, a retired DGP besides academicians from the relevant discipline.

Each board has a psychologist to assess the competence, body language and the eye span of the candidates.

A board member said though it was only a model interview the candidates were grilled with thoroughness and feedback was given to them to enable them perform well.

As many as 180 lectures have been arranged for the current crop of aspirants for the prelims, Mr. Ravichandran said.

The UPSC’s personality test began on Monday and ends on April 3. Many of the candidates at the centre had attempted the civil services several times. There are also some who had qualified earlier but want to improve their performance.

The DPAR provides each candidate ₹2,000 to meet their incidental expenses en route to Delhi.

This year the State government has hiked the monthly food expense from ₹2,250 to ₹3,000 per candidate. The result is that the lunch is richer and more nutritive. The menu is designed by a team of dieticians and nutrition professors, Mr. Ravichandran said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/43-government-sponsored-aspirants-in-chennai-ace-upsc-test/article30868515.ece

Six pilgrims from Nepal died in a road accident near Omalur on the Salem- Bengaluru National Highway during the early hours of Thursday. About 18 persons are undergoing treatment at Government Mohan Kumaramangalam Medical College Hospital here.

According to police, a group of pilgrims from Nepal who were travelling towards Bengaluru after offering prayers at Kanniyakumari had planned to park their mini bus and take rest at a temple in Naripallam on the Salem-Bengaluru National Highway. Around midnight, while the mini bus was taking a U-turn, a private omni bus from Bengaluru crashed into the mini bus, police said.

According to police, six persons, including two women, died in the incident. Three of the deceased were identified as Gopal Tamang (56), who was brought dead to the hospital, Fhitasari Choudari (55) and Bishnu Dahal (60).

Superintendent of Police for Salem S.Deepa Ganiger visited the accident spot along with senior officials at midnight and conducted enquiries. Police have detained M.Murugeshwaran and S.Shamil, drivers, and are investigating.

170,2020/02/20,"Sasikala did involve in benami transactions, Income Tax Dept. asserts before Madras High Court","The petitioners had claimed that the transaction could, by no stretch of the imagination, be termed as benami since the reported purchaser had cancelled the deal after the signing of a memorandum of understanding and sought return of the money

The Income Tax Department on Wednesday asserted before the Madras High Court that it was perfectly right in initiating action under the Prohibition of Benami Properties Transaction (PBPT) Act of 1988 to attach all immovable properties that were reportedly purchased by former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa’s close aide V.K. Sasikala using demonetised currency notes to the tune of ₹1,674.50 crore between November 8 and December 30, 2016.

Also read | Sasikala’s benami transactions: I-T dept. initiates proceedings

Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax U.N. Dilip stated that failure to transfer ownership even after receiving the consideration would fall squarely under the definition of benami transaction. He made this submission in a counter affidavit filed before Justice Anita Sumanth who is seized of a batch of cases filed by the Puducherry-based Sri Lakshmi Jewellery group’s Bonjour Bonheur Private Limited, which owns the Ocean Spray Beach Resort supposedly sold to Sasikala for ₹168 crore.

After the senior standing counsel for income tax A.P. Srinivas submitted the counter affidavit in court, the judge granted time to the petitioner company and its shareholders to filed their rejoinder, if any, by March 13. The petitioners had claimed that the transaction could, by no stretch of the imagination, be termed as benami since the reported purchaser had cancelled the deal after the signing of a memorandum of understanding and sought return of the money.

Refuting the claim, the Deputy Commissioner said: “The arrangement is indeed a transaction wherein ₹148 crore (out of the total accepted sale consideration of ₹168 crore) was paid to Naveen Balaji and his family members by V.K. Sasikala for the purchase of Ocean Spray Resort and for the transfer of shares of Bonjour Bonheur Private Limited. As per the transaction, the shares ought to have been transferred to the name of V.K. Sasikala or her nominees.

“However, the same has not been done. This establishes the intention to hide the actual ownership of the company and the resort. The above transactions are evidenced by an MoU dated November 22, 2016 and the same has been signed by Naveen Balaji and his family members in the capacity of directors of the company... The original MoU and original share certificates were seized from premises covered under search operation in the case of V.K. Sasikala.

“This shows the intention of V.K. Sasikala to hide the above transactions and give a colour that Naveen Balaji and his family members are still the shareholders of the company and the resort. The above modus operandi establishes the intention that on a later date, V.K. Sasikala can get the shares/property transferred to her name or her nominee’s name for her future benefit,” the counter affidavit read.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/ukxjlk/article30384236.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24THSASIKALA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/sasikala-did-involve-in-benami-transactions-income-tax-dept-asserts-before-madras-high-court/article30867578.ece
171,2020/02/20,19 killed as container falls on Kerala-bound bus in Tamil Nadu’s Tiruppur,"25 passengers injured; police say truck driver fell asleep at the wheel.

Nineteen people on board a Kerala State Transport Corporation (KSRTC) bus were killed when a 30-tonne truck hit the central median of the National Highway and the container it was carrying fell on the bus on the outskirts of Tiruppur in Tamil Nadu early on Thursday.

The accident occurred near Avinashi on NH 544 connecting Salem and Kochi. Police said the bus was plying from Bengaluru to Ernakulam. Around 3.15 a.m., the truck carrying imported tiles from the Kochi port hit the central median, which was about a foot high, on the six-lane highway and entered the opposite lane.

The sudden jerk caused the detachment of the heavy container, which fell on the bus that was passing by, crushing one side of the passenger vehicle, according to the police.

The Tiruppur city police nabbed truck driver A. Hemaraj, 38, who fled the accident spot, near Perundurai in Erode district.

“He fell asleep while driving the truck,” Tiruppur Police Commissioner Sanjay Kumar told The Hindu.

The bus had a seating capacity of 48 passengers and two crew members, of whom 19, including driver Gireesh died, and 25 were injured. Among the 50 people (as per the KSRTC list), 46 have been accounted for and the status of four is yet to be confirmed, according to the police. They are trying to ascertain if the four had boarded the vehicle or had left the accident spot on their own having possibly sustained only minor injuries.

Tiruppur Collector K. Vijayakarthikeyan, the Police Commissioner and other district officials visited the accident site around 7 a.m.

Mr. Vijayakarthikeyan told The Hindu that 25 injured passengers had been shifted to multiple hospitals, including private hospitals in Tiruppur and Coimbatore.

173,2020/02/20,Movement against Central Vista redevelopment gains support,"Architecture foundation event held in city

Support for movement against the Centre’s grandiose plans to redevelop the Central Vista and the Parliament House in Delhi gained support in the city at an event organised by the Chennai Architecture Foundation (CAF) on Wednesday.

Madhav Raman, an architect based out of Delhi, said that it was vital that word is spread among people and support gathered against the proposal that would cause pollution and cutting of trees, planted several decades ago during its development by the British. It would also lead to a lack of public space — currently enjoyed by all kinds of people.

He said that a reason that the government had proposed redevelopment was the need to accommodate more members of Parliament, after the delimitation of constituencies.

“The space inside the Lok Sabha is luxurious by all standards. If you were to reduce a little bit of space, you can accommodate close to 700 members,” he said. Those wanting to support the movement can log onto www.lokpath.in, or follow them on social media.

N. Ram, chairman, THG Publishing Pvt. Ltd., said that no public consultation or real discussion was held in Parliament for a project of this scale. No budgetary allocation had been made too, he added. The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) must look at how the architecture firm got the contract, he said.

Carnatic musician T.M. Krishna said that public spaces were important in a democracy — especially their proximity to government buildings. Every city and panchayat needs public spaces where people can gather, listen and learn, he added. Mathangi Krishnamoorthy, anthropologist, discussed the politics of public space.

174,2020/02/20,Srirangam temple wins major legal battle in Supreme Court,"Authoritative pronouncement prevents sale of endowed properties

After having lost three successive legal battles before a sub court, followed by a district court and then the Madras High Court, the Idol of Sriranganathaswamy, represented by the Executive Officer of Srirangam temple in Tiruchi, has finally won a significant case before the Supreme Court on preventing sale of immovable properties by the descendants of those who had endowed them hundreds of years ago for specific performance of religious charities.

Justices Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud and Ajay Rastogi on Wednesday held that even if a property had not been specifically dedicated in the name of the deity of a temple, still, it would fall under the term ‘specific endowment’ and get covered by the provisions of the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR&CE) Act of 1959 if a reading of the settlement deed proves that the intention of the settlor was to create a public charity associated with a Hindu festival.

The judgment was delivered in connection with 25,000 square feet of land at Srirangam purchased by businessman P.K. Thoppulan Chettiar for ₹3,000 on June 2, 1887 for performing religious charity. He had constructed a mandapam on 4,135 square feet of the total extent of land for inviting the deity during special occasions and used to supply drinking water and millet porridge to the devotees on those days from Mahimai (God’s account) fund established from his granary business.

In 1901, he executed a deed of settlement prohibiting the sale or mortgage of the entire property and directing his descendants to continue the charitable activities, after his death, from their income. However, in April 1978, the property was leased out to a private firm which in turn sub-let it to various third parties. Meanwhile, about 2,500 square feet of the property also got encroached forcing PK Thoppulan Chettiar Ramanuja Koodam Anandhana Trust to file a suit for eviction.

The trust, in 2004, suddenly decided to sell away 20,865 square feet of the land, leaving aside the mandapam portion alone, in order to generate finances required for continuing the charitable activities. It filed a suit before a sub court seeking permission for the sale. However, the temple management intervened and claimed that the permission should be sought only from the Commissioner of HR&CE department and not from the court as per the provisions of the 1959 Act.

The objections raised by the temple management was turned down by three successive judicial forums on the ground that the trust in question was a private trust and not a public trust. Disagreeing with the view taken by those courts, the apex court ruled that if the beneficiaries of a trust were either the public at large or an amorphous and fluctuating body of persons incapable of being specifically identifiable, such a trust or charity would gain a public character. “In the present case, the Deed of Settlement states that the charity is to be carried for the benefit of the devotees who visit during certain Hindu religious festivals. The charity is one which benefits the public and the beneficial interest is created in an uncertain and fluctuating body of persons. The devotees as a class of beneficiaries are not definitive and therefore, the respondent trust is a public trust,” Justice Chandrachud wrote.

Claim rejected

He also rejected the claim of the trustees that theirs was a secular trust established for the public in general without any distinction on grounds of religion, caste or creed and that its charitable activities were not restricted only to Hindus.

“The activities of the first respondent trust have a connection with Chithirai Gajendra Moksham and Padi Eighteen festivals and the charity is to be carried on for the benefit of the devotees of Sri Ranganathaswamy sanctum.

“The festivals are Hindu religious festivals and the use of the expression ‘devotees’ indicates that there exists a direct nexus and association between the public charity described in the Deed of Settlement and the Hindu religious festivals. Reference to ‘devotees’ in the Deed of Settlement also indicates that the endowment is not of a secular nature. The charity which is described in the Deed of Settlement is a public charity associated with a Hindu religious festival,” he concluded.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/iwtho9/article30866981.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH20SUPREMECOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/srirangam-temple-wins-major-legal-battle-in-supreme-court/article30865208.ece
175,2020/02/20,Sixth phase of excavation at Keeladi begins,"Simultaneous excavations will be held at neighbouring villages

The sixth phase of archaeological excavation at Keeladi, covering three neighbouring villages, began on Wednesday with Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, formally inaugurating it through video-conferencing from Chennai.

The first three phases of the excavations were done by Archaeological Survey of India. The Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology (TNSDA), which conducted the fourth and fifth phase, will continue the sixth phase that would go on till September.

Sivaganga Collector J. Jayakanthan, who was present at the inaugural function at the site, said that the excavations here so far had unearthed that Keeladi was the cradle of one of the oldest urban civilisations that dated back to some 2,600 years. “The sixth phase of excavation is likely to throw more light that will further strengthen the findings so far,” he noted.

Keeladi cluster

TNSDA deputy director R. Sivanandam said the State government has allocated ₹40 lakh for the sixth phase. “This time the excavation will be simultaneously held at Keeladi and its neighbouring places like Konthagai, Agaram and Manalur,” he said.

The focus of the latest phase of excavation will be to find out — whether the two major findings of the excavations so far — brick-work structures of channels found at two places some 300 metres apart had any connectivity. The geomagnetic survey has also indicated about the continuity of the structure, he said.

TNSDA officials believe that several findings so far have indicated that Keeladi could have been a hub for industrial activity. “We believe that the Konthagai was the burial site, while Agaram and Manalur could have been the habitation sites,” he added. Madurai MP Su. Venkatesan, who visited the site, said that it was the first time in Tamil Nadu that permission has been granted for simultaneous excavations at four pockets in one site.

“Field visits have revealed that Konthagai, on the western side of Keeladi, was the burial site, so we presume that the habitations could be on the eastern side — Manalur and Agaram,” he said.

Mr. Venkatesan said that human bones are expected to come up in Konthagai. “We expect that DNA tests would reveal much more significant findings like the carbon dating done on materials found here that traced Tamil history back to 6th Century B.C.,” he said. “The sixth phase would reveal new identity and new meaning to the findings of all the excavations that have been conducted so far,” he said.

The Sivaganga Collector said the district administration was exploring the possibilities of laying an approach road from Keeladi to the excavation site amidst the coconut grooves for the benefit of visitors. “Besides, we are planning to operate bus services and provide drinking water and toilet facilities,” Mr. Jayakanthan said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/9cw8sf/article30866962.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20THKEELADIJAMES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/sixth-phase-of-excavation-at-keeladi-begins/article30865181.ece
176,2020/02/20,Govt. says it has dropped all proceedings against Velumani,"Court informed that DVAC gave Minister clean chit after a preliminary inquiry

The State government on Wednesday took the Madras High Court by surprise by claiming that it had on January 22 dropped all further proceedings against Municipal Administration Minister S. P. Velumani, on complaints of alleged irregularities in award of civil contracts by Chennai and Coimbatore Corporations, since the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption had given a clean chit to him after a preliminary inquiry.

The Public Department filed an affidavit before a Division Bench of Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and R. Hemalatha informing them about the government’s decision and urged the court to close a case filed in 2018 by Arappor Iyakkam, a non governmental organisation represented by its managing trustee Jayaram Venkatesan, seeking registration of a First Information Report against the Minister and the Corporation officials.

Government’s affidavit stated that the court appointed investigating officer R. Ponni, Superintendent of Police, DVAC had conducted the preliminary inquiry and filed a report to the DVAC Director Vijay Kumar on December 18, 2019 stating that no cognisable offence had been made out in the complaint warranting registration of a FIR. The report was approved by the Director and forwarded to Vigilance Commissioner on January 13.

After going through the entire report carefully, the Vigilance Commissioner endorsed the report on January 18 and forwarded it to the government for necessary action. The government, after examining the report, took a decision to drop all further proceedings, the court was told. Surprised at the developments, the senior judge in the Bench wondered how could the DVAC forward the report to the government without court’s approval.

He also asked why did the government not inform the court about its decision when the case filed by the NGO was taken up for hearing on January 23. In response, Advocate General Vijay Narayan urged the court to close pending writ petition since it had become infructuous. He said, the complainant would have to now challenge the government’s decision in the manner known to law and that the present case need not be kept pending.

However, advocate V. Suresh, representing the NGO, took strong exception to it and obtained time till March 13 for filing a counter affidavit to the government’s plea to close the case. Stating that it had been his consistent argument that the Minister, Corporation officials as well as the DVAC seluths had colluded with each other, he insisted that only a court monitored probe by a special investigation team would cull out the truth.

On his part, senior counsel C.S. Vaidyanathan, representing Chennai Corporation, accused the NGO of having filed the case with a political motive. “It is not a public interest litigation, it is a political war being fought through the court,” he said. State Public Prosecutor A. Natarajan too said, the writ petitioner could not be allowed to cast aspersions on an investigating officer appointed by the court by alleging collusion with the Minister.

After hearing all of them, the judges directed the DVAC as well as the State government to submit on March 13 all files related to the decisions taken by the Vigilance Commissioner as well as the government with regard to the issue on hand. They also permitted the government and the Minister, in his individual capacity, to file their counter affidavits to an additional affidavit submitted by the NGO alleging harassment of a whistle blower in the case.

The NGO alleged that H. Chandrabose, a registered contractor with Chennai Corporation, was subjected to continuous threats and victimisation for having exposed the irregularities. It urged the court to order police protection to him.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/x9qi3b/article30866993.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH20VELUMANI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/govt-says-it-has-dropped-all-proceedings-against-velumani/article30865154.ece
177,2020/02/20,Tension after police conduct checks on vehicles of devotees,"Scuffle between police and party worker

Tension prevailed in some areas in Ambur, after members of the Hindu Munnani and workers of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) assembled in large numbers in front of the office of the Deputy Superintendent of Police in Ambur on Wednesday.

A Hindu Munnani functionary said, “There was a wordy-tussle between Ambur Taluk Inspector of Police Gokulraj and Hindu Munnani divisional secretary M. Deenadayalan over the former carrying out checks on vehicles of devotees attending the temple festival. The police action irritated several devotees, who protested against the checks, since they had come to visit the temple for the Masi Karaga Thiruvizha in Periyankuppam village.”

The quarrel led to a scuffle between them, and party workers were seeking DSP Sachinantham’s intervention.

On assurance from the DSP that action would be initiated against the those at fault, the party workers dispersed.

The Ambur police nabbed four persons, including two women, for cheating an elderly woman in Minnur, near Ambur, on Monday. Police sources said that Gnanasoundari, 70, was on her way to ESI Hospital in Ambur, when two women approached her. The duo convinced the old woman to remove her gold chain and tag it to her saree.

Upon returning home, Gnanasoundari found a stone instead of the chain. She reported the matter to the Ambur Town police. The police identified the women after scrutinising CCTV camera footage.

180,2020/02/20,Districts respond to State-wide call for anti-CAA protests,"People gather in front of Collectorates, raise slogans against BJP, AIADMK

There is no stopping the protests that have erupted in Vellore, Tirupattur, Ranipet and Tiruvannamalai against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC).

Several Muslim outfits had called for a State-wide agitation and a siege on the Chennai Secretariat on Wednesday.

In the districts, protesters gathered in front of their respective Collectorates and raised slogans against the BJP and the AIADMK for creating a sense of insecurity among the minorities. More than 700 people gathered on the service road on the Chennai-Bengaluru Highway. Their protest went on for over an hour.

There was heavy police deployment near the Collectorate and the roads adjoining the Collector’s office. Traffic was diverted on service roads and the Arcot Road for a while, due to the protest.

Several leaders from the Jamath addressed the participants, and talked of the need for such peaceful protests to address the issue. The CAA and the NRC would not just affect the minorities in India, but also the Tamils in Sri Lanka who have been living here for the past three decades, they pointed out. They urged the participants not to provide details to officials when approached for updation of records, as part of NRC.

Security stepped up

A similar protest was organised from the Collector’s office in Tiruvannamalai, and over 400 people participated in the agitation. Some 900 policemen were stationed at important junctions in Tiruvannamalai.

More than 250 policemen put up barricades in front of the Collectorate in Vengikal, preventing the protesters from barging in. Collectorate staff were allowed inside on showing identity cards, and those who visited the office were screened by the police.

In Tirupattur, over 800 participants took part in the agitation, and in Ranipet, 500 took part.

181,2020/02/20,Residents hold protest against construction of wall by BHEL,"Wall is being built along road connecting several villages

Residents of over 10 villages in and around Lalapet and traders organised a protest against the construction of a wall by BHEL in Lalapet.

Several traders participated in the protest, organised at Savadi Thidal in Lalapet, and many shops remained shut in support of the agitation against the BHEL administration.

They charged that the BHEL administration had started constructing a wall along the road, connecting villages like Mukundarayapuram, Thakkarpalayam, Ekambaranallur, Seekarajapuram, Kandharikuppam, Marudhampakkam, Kondakuppam, Palleri and Vasur.

Roads, including the Lalapet-Mukundarayapuram Road and the Seekarajapuram-Thiruvalam Link Road, have been affected by the construction, they added. The roads have been in use for decades, said L.C. Mani, one of the protesters.

“We have highlighted our grievances to the BHEL administration and the District Collector. The BHEL management is carrying out the construction as they own the road. We organised the demonstration to draw the attention of the BHEL management and the district administration to the issue. If they do not stop their plan, we would have no option but to intensify our protests,” said Mr. Mani.

The police arrested about 60 persons and lodged them in a marriage hall. They were let off in the evening.

182,2020/02/20,"Duraimurugan flags high debt, falling growth","Budget is like a well-ballooned cotton candy that shrinks when touched: DMK leader

Deputy Leader of the Opposition Duraimurugan on Wednesday criticised the Tamil Nadu government over the rising debt and falling growth in the State and asked the AIADMK government to “fight with the Centre” to secure the State’s dues.

After congratulating Deputy Chief Minister and Finance Minister O. Panneerselvam for presenting his 10th Budget, Mr. Duraimurugan took a jibe at him, saying, “I am complimenting the Finance Minister but not his Budget.” He added that the Budget was like a “well-ballooned cotton candy that shrinks the moment one touches it”.

CM’s retort

“The State now has a debt of over ₹4.5 lakh crore. I am worried as to how my leader, Stalin, is going to manage this huge debt that you have created when he forms the government,” he said. To this, the Chief Minister said, “Do not worry. Such a situation will not arise.”

The DMK leader said that in 2009-10, under the DMK rule, the growth rate was 8.96% and was estimated at 10% in 2010-11. “But in 2013-14, it was only 4.6%, and in 2019-20, it is projected at 7.2%,” he added.

Mr. Panneerselvam said the State’s growth rate was higher than the national growth rate of 5%.

Mr. Duraimurugan said that while many CMs had opposed the manner in which the State’s share of finances was being calculated, the State government seemed to be uninterested in it. “Because of that, we have lost out on funds. The Centre is duty-bound to compensate the States,” he said.

He suggested that the government “fight with the Centre” to get the funds. “Why don’t you fight with the Centre? We will support you. You can point the finger at the DMK and fight with them,” he said.

Mr. Panneerselvam replied that the State government had been regularly updating the Centre on the decrease in the State’s share, and that some changes had been made to the compensation structure.

Citing the Minimum Support Price being offered by other States to farmers, he requested the T.N. government to increase the MSP.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/dmz8x9/article30866924.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH20DURAIMURUGAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/duraimurugan-flags-high-debt-falling-growth/article30864787.ece
183,2020/02/20,Edappadi hints at ‘good news’ on hydrocarbon projects,"We are consulting legal experts. Palaniswami tells Assembly

Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Wednesday said “a good news to make the farmers happy” will soon be announced on the issue of hydrocarbon projects in the Cauvery delta.

“We are consulting legal experts. The decision will be to your liking,” he said in the Assembly while responding to Opposition leader and DMK president M.K. Stalin, who urged the government to cancel the hydrocarbon projects for which permission had already been granted.

Mr. Stalin demanded the adoption of a resolution for cancelling hydrocarbon projects in the current session of the Assembly. “We will support the government. Already, our MPs in both Houses of Parliament are pressing the issue,” he said. The Chief Minister said work on according the Protected Special Agricultural Zone status to the Cauvery delta had begun immediately after he made the announcement in this regard. “But we have to make the correct decision. There are some problems, and the government has sought the opinion of legal experts. A decision will be announced in the Assembly, and it will match your expectations,” he said.

The State Cabinet, which met for over 30 minutes later in the day, gave its nod for a Bill to declare the Cauvery delta a Protected Special Agricultural Zone. The Bill is expected to be presented in the Assembly on Thursday — the last day of the current round of sittings.

Inaugurates projects

The Chief Minister inaugurated a slew of projects through video-conferencing on Wednesday.

He inaugurated projects worth ₹573.33 crore executed by the Housing and Urban Development department, including housing complexes, administrative buildings and Amma Marriage Halls.

Mr. Palaniswami also inaugurated projects worth ₹33 crore for the Fisheries department. These include buildings in the Tamil Nadu Dr. J. Jayalalithaa Fisheries University, constructed at a cost of ₹27.65 crore, and deep sea fishing boats for fishermen at a cost of ₹6.40 crore.

Declaring that February 24, which marks the birth anniversary of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, will be observed as the ‘State Girl Child Protection Day’, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Wednesday announced five schemes for children living in government-run homes.

Making a suo motu statement in the Assembly, he said that when the orphaned girls living in government-run homes complete 21 years of age, the government will deposit ₹2 lakh in the bank in their name. “It will help them establish a life in society after they leave the government homes,” he said.

Further, a scheme was announced for girls who face problems after leaving government-run homes on completion of 18 years of age. “A special grant will be given to ensure their social and financial safety. It will include assistance for higher education, skill development, job opportunities and self-employment. The assistance will continue to be provided till they complete 50 years of age,” the CM said. Mr. Palaniswami said the monthly amount paid to the foster parents of the girls will be increased from ₹2,000 to ₹4,000.

Noting that the cradle baby scheme introduced by Jayalalithaa had reduced cases of female infanticide, the CM said the female sex ratio was still less than the average in many districts. “The district administrations that make efforts to improve the female sex ratio will get medals,” he said.

The CM said priority will be accorded to inmates of homes run by the Social Welfare department in appointments to ‘C’ and ‘D’ category jobs in the department as well as the Integrated Child Protection Scheme, which were not covered by the TNPSC.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/jayas-birth-anniversary-to-be-observed-as-girl-child-protection-day/article30864703.ece

Legislators of the DMK on Wednesday staged a walkout from the Assembly after Speaker P. Dhanapal denied them permission to move a privilege motion against Minister for Tamil Official Language and Tamil Culture Ma Foi K. Pandiarajan. The privilege issue was raised by former Minister and DMK MLA Thangam Thennarasu.

“When I raised a privilege issue against the Minister in connection with the subject of dual citizenship to Sri Lankan Tamils, he made some observations. There is a basis for moving a privilege motion against the Minister once again,” Mr. Thennarasu said.

The Speaker said the Minister had given a clarification and that he had delivered his verdict based on what Mr. Pandiarajan had said. “You cannot raise the issue again,” he said.

When DMK Deputy Floor Leader Duraimurugan reiterated the issue, Mr. Dhanapal said it would amount to interfering with the verdict of the Chair.

Following this, members of the DMK walked out of the House.

186,2020/02/20,"Hopeful of good decision on Perarivalan, says CM","‘Govt. has given its recommendation to the Governor’

Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Wednesday told the Assembly that everyone was hoping that the Governor will take a ‘good decision’ on the release of the seven life convicts in former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi’s assassination case.

Replying to DMK Deputy Floor Leader Duraimurugan, who sought the release of Perarivalan and the other convicts, Mr. Palaniswami said the AIADMK government was clear that they should be released.

The State government had sent its recommendation to the Governor, he said.

“We are expecting, like everyone else, that they will be released. It is because we have an interest in releasing them that we have undertaken this step. We also gave them (Nalini and Perarivalan) parole. We are very clear that they should be released, and have sent our recommendation to the Governor,” he said.

Mr. Duraimurugan appealed to the government to release them on humanitarian grounds and “put pressure” on the Governor.

“For 28 years, they have been in prison. The Chief Minister should use his influence and power, meet the Governor and urge him to release them,” he said.

Law Minister C.Ve. Shanmugam said there was “no other opinion” in the government than that the convicts should be freed.

“Whatever powers are given to the State government under the Constitution, we have exercised that, and have passed a resolution and given it to the Governor,” he said.

Mr. Duraimurugan compared the case with that of the Dharmapuri bus burning incident, in which three life convicts were released prematurely by the government.

However, Mr. Shanmugam countered his argument, saying there was no hidden agenda behind their (Dharmapuri convicts’) release and that they had served more than 10 years in prison and were released on the occasion of the birth centenary of former Chief Minister M.G. Ramachandran.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hopeful-of-good-decision-on-perarivalan-says-cm/article30864678.ece
187,2020/02/20,Two TV channels face breach of privilege charge,"Issue pertains to reporting on liquor consumption

Assembly Speaker P. Dhanapal on Wednesday referred to the House Privileges Committee a charge of breach of privilege levelled against Tamil television channels News 18 Tamil Nadu and Puthiya Thalaimurai by Electricity and Prohibition Minister P. Thangamani.

No precedent

“As there seems to be a privilege [issue], I am referring the same to the privileges committee as per Rule 226 of the Assembly Rules,” Mr. Dhanapal said. This is the first time that proceedings for breach of privilege have been initiated against television news channels in Tamil Nadu.

According to Mr. Thangamani, who moved a privilege motion under Rule 219 of the Assembly Rules, all he had said while responding to a DMK MLA’s query pertaining to the revenue generated by Tasmac was that the increase in the price of liquor had resulted in more revenue.

“I said it had happened during the [erstwhile] DMK regime as well. But the TV channels reported that revenue had increased as more and more people were drinking,” he claimed.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/two-tv-channels-face-breach-of-privilege-charge/article30864675.ece
188,2020/02/20,300 MW private power project mooted at Suryapet,"Conceived with two units of 150 MW each, it is estimated to cost ₹ 2,160 crore

A 300 MW private thermal power project, the biggest in the private sector in Telangana, is proposed to be set up by Mecwel Power Private Limited at Vellataru village of Chintalapalem mandal in Suryapet district.

The project, which is conceived with two units of 150 MW each, is estimated at ₹ 2,160 crore on 332 acres, according to the detailed project report which has been submitted to the State-level environment impact assessment authority, which in turn referred it to the Central government for environmental clearance.

A senior power official told The Hindu that, as of now, the Telangana State transmission corporation has no intention to float tenders for long-term purchase of power from the new generator as the corporation is focussed on trying to meet the the power demand of the State from its own generating stations. He said The Electricity Act, 2003, provides setting up of power projects in private sector anywhere in the country.

The DPR envisages evacuation of power generated by the company to Telangana Power Generation Corporation’s 220 kv substation at Pulichintala hydel dam project. The first unit shall be commissioned in 27 months from the Notice to Proceed, and the second unit after an interval of three months.

The project is proposed to be executed by twelve engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contracts. It was planned at a time when the capacity addition assumption was based on projected growth in power demand of 6% annually till 2022 in Telangana. There will be an additional demand due to the effect of electric mobility in the coming years. The proposal of Mecwel Power Private Limited is “timely and very essential” for meeting the power requirement of Telangana, the DPR said.

The annual coal consumption for the 300 MW power station is estimated at 2.01 million tonnes per annum with purchases both from the Singareni Collieries and international traders. A dedicated rail track will be laid up to the coal handling area of the plant from Mellacheruvu railway station when the coal was brought by rail from Singareni Collieries. The cost of power generation per kWh at the station for the first year of commercial operation worked out to ₹ 4.82 per kWh. The annual fixed operation and maintenance cost was considered at ₹ 3.20 crore per MW of generation based on 2017-18 as first year of operation and escalated at the rate of 6% per annum as per the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission norms.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/300-mw-private-power-project-mooted-at-suryapet/article30873879.ece

The case was booked at the Kanchan Bagh police station in 2018. It was then re-registered at the Central Crime Station later the same year.

As per the FIR, Khan allegedly helped Nazrul Islam and Parveen, both Myanmarese and residents of Balapur, to obtain fake voter ID cards and Aadhaar cards after which they applied for and were issued Indian passports.

Avinash Mohanty, Joint Commissioner of Police and in-charge of the CCS confirmed that a case was booked against Sattar. “Yes, the case was registered against Sattar. It has also been charge-sheeted,” he said.

On the other hand, Muzaffar Ullah Khan, the lawyer who is representing Sattar, said that the latter made no Aadhaar card. “No official has been booked for issuing the Aadhaar card to the Rohingya.

191,2020/02/20,COVID-19 scare: Chinese universities offer to conduct online classes,"Students asked to stay in home-country and wait for further information

The COVID-19 might have gripped everyone with anxiety and made people stick to their home country, putting on hold plans, including academic. However, universities in China are trying not to let the situation postpone academics or waste time.

Though students from Telangana, who are pursuing MBBS in various universities in China, were asked not to return to the universities, they were informed that the universities were going to conduct online classes.

In China, medical students are granted summer and winter vacations of 40 days or more each. This year, the date on which vacation started varied between January 1 and 15. But it ends on February 28 for every one, and classes resume in March first week. While some have returned to home-town in Telangana, some stayed back.

To avoid possible spread of COVID-2019, the universities have asked them not to be in a hurry to return to universities. Raja Ram, managing partner of Medico Abroad Consultancy, who facilitates pursuit of MBBS in China by students from here, said that a university located in Liaoning province sent the communication to students on February 18.

“Citing direction from the Ministry of Education there, Jinzhou Medical University has stated that the classes would be conducted online. There are over 200 students from Telangana studying in the university,” Mr Ram said. Further communication stated that students were required to stay in their country or city, and wait for further information.

However, internship as part of MBBS course or practical courses cannot be offered online. A final year student from the university, who is pursuing internship, said they were supposed to graduate in June this year. “Since the internship cannot be offered online, graduation will be postponed,” the student from Hyderabad who did not want name to be quoted said.

Paul Surya Teja, who is pursuing MBBS third year from Qiqihar Medical University located in Heilongjiang province, said they were informed that demo online classes would commence on February 5. If there were no hiccups, online courses would start. “We knew that the university in China will do something not to waste time,” Mr Teja, who lives in Hyderabad, said.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/58bhk/article30877276.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY21CHINA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/covid-19-scare-chinese-varsities-to-hold-online-classes/article30873435.ece
192,2020/02/20,KCR suppressing CAA protests at Owaisi’s instance: Shabbir Ali,"Chief Minister K. Chandrashekhar Rao has been suppressing all agitations against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in Hyderabad and other parts of Telangana and booking cases against people, alleged former minister and senior Congress leader Mohammed Ali Shabbir.

At a press conference here, he said the Telangana Police gave permission to RSS to hold a rally and meeting in Saroornagar. Various pro-CAA meetings were allowed, including a meeting at Quli Qutub Shah Stadium. But no meeting or protest was permitted against CAA.

In fact, the organisers were forced to seek High Court’s intervention to organise Million March and despite HC’s nod, Telangana Police is not permitting women to organise protest against CAA, he alleged. So far, more than 1,000 cases have been registered against those participated in anti-CAA protests. “People are able to protest in some BJP-ruled States, but KCR government is not allowing any kind of protest,” he alleged.

Electoral support

Mr. Shabbir Ali also accused MIM president Asaduddin Owaisi of acting as a shield to KCR’s dual stand on CAA. He said following nationwide protest against CAA, Asaduddin Owaisi took a delegation of Muslim religious leaders to KCR on December 25 just to give him some comfort for the local body elections.

The promised announcement against the CAA, NPR and NRC did not come, he said and appealed to the religious leaders who were part of the delegation to stage a dharna at Pragathi Bhavan against KCR who did not keep his promise.

‘Dual stand’

Mr. Shabbir Ali also slammed Mr. Owaisi for continuing his support to KCR and adopting a dual stand on anti-CAA protests. “While addressing rallies in different parts of the country, Asaduddin Owaisi is exhorting people to organise Shaheenbagh like protests. But he himself is not allowing any such protest in Hyderabad.”

He sought explanation from Mr. Owaisi for his silence on cases booked against anti-CAA protesters in Hyderabad and other parts of Telangana. Why isn’t a single MIM worker participating in the anti-CAA protests in Hyderabad? In fact, some local MIM workers are helping the police in identifying those who are regularly participating in the protests, he alleged.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/kcr-suppressing-caa-protests-at-owaisis-instance-shabbir-ali/article30873258.ece
193,2020/02/20,Twitter asked to take down posts of anti-CAA activists,"Received legal request to remove content from an authorised entity, claims Twitter

Activists and individuals who support the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act-National Register of Citizens-National Population Register protests said they got an email from Twitter Legal informing them that the micro-blogging giant has received a request that certain content be taken out.

One such activist, S Q Masood, claimed that Twitter informed him that they received a legal request asking them to remove a tweet posted from his account. The tweet in question is a video clip which purportedly shows Joint Commissioner of Police Avinash Mohanty disembarking from his official vehicle, pulling out a lathi, and using mild force against individuals on January 10 at the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen’s massive anti-CAA-NRC-NPR Tiranga Rally.

Mr Masood shared the email from Twitter Legal with The Hindu. An excerpt of the email, which he received on February 17, reads thus: “As Twitter strongly believes in defending and respecting the voice of users, it is our policy to notify our users if we receive a legal request from an authorised entity (such as law enforcement or a government agency) to remove content from their account.” The email specified that no action has been taken on the content which has been reported as Twitter believes in ‘defending and respecting the voice’ of its users.

Speaking to The Hindu, Mr Masood said, “The video clip went viral. I have not posted anything objectionable or hateful and reporting the tweet to Twitter is strange.”

Another Twitter user Mohammed Faheem, also vocal against the CAA-NRC-NPR combine, claimed to have received a similar email from Twitter Legal. While, in his case, no specific tweet has been mentioned as reported, but it is his handle which ‘violates the law(s) of India’.

Like Mr Masood, Mr Faheem too expressed surprise at the email. “Twitter did not take action against my handle and it is surprising for the authorities to even suggest that I have violated any law,” he said. He has tweeted a screenshot of the email.

A third recipient Syed Abdahu Kashaf too received a similar email. “I posted a video appealing people to join the anti- CAA-NRC- NPR Million March in Hyderabad and dismissed the rumours of permission getting cancelled. The video got seven lakh views on Twitter and hence it was reported,” he claimed and added that the video has been ‘deleted’.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/rrxk3h/article30867413.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07NETTWITTERNEW,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/twitter-notice-to-anti-caa-npr-activists/article30873222.ece

Telangana State BJP president K. Laxman on Thursday flayed Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao for “always making tall promises to people before elections and forgetting it after winning the elections”.

Talking to pressersons at the party office, he charged that whether it was byelections, municipal elections or any other election, KCR mislead the people by his promises but never kept his word after the elections. In this context, he specifically raised the issue of Pay Revision Commission (PRC) for government employees and claimed that the unions are being threatened for raising the issue.

The Tahasildars have already been warned that the system would be scrapped when they demanded promotions as deputy collectors and there are 120 deputy Tahasildar posts laying vacant, he said. The TRS government has totally failed the youth and student community by recruiting just 20,000 in the last five years whereas 50,000 employees had retired in the same period.

Mr. Laxman said the State had become bankrupt has been unable to make payments to pensioners and social welfare schemes like ‘Kalyanlakshmi, Shadi Mubarak’ and ‘Rythu Bandhu’ due to non-availability of funds. The government also failed to keep its promises of the unemployed getting allowances, he added. General secretary Chinta Sambamurthy, former minister M..Narasimhulu and spokesperson N. V.

195,2020/02/20,Telangana has doubled its power generation capacity: Vinod Kumar,"All steps to realise K. Chandrasekhar Rao’s vision, says Planning Board Vice Chairman

Telangana government, which has more than doubled its power generation since the formation of the State in 2014, is now geared to generate 28,400 MW in the next four to five years, Vice-Chairman State Planning Board B.Vinod Kumar said here on Thursday.

The total generation of power in 2014 was 7,780 MW and it now crossed 16,500 MW. For the proposed new power projects, all permissions had been secured and financial closure achieved.

Telangana has constructed major lift irrigation projects Kaleswaram and Palamur-Rangareddy Lift irrigation projects on Godavari and Krishhna which are not perennial rivers. Though some critics said that State was spending huge amounts on lift irrigation projects, he said that Telangana being in Deccan plateau had no other option but to lift water from both the rivers to cultivate one crore acres of land. It was the vision of Chief Minister K.Chandrasekhar Rao for the State, Mr. Vinod Kumar said.

Bank loans

The government had already spent ₹70,000 crore raised through loans from public sector banks on Kaleswaram project and loans could be easily repaid with the outcome of sustainable irrigation facility to cultivate one crore acres. State would require power to lift water from both the rivers and provide irrigation to one crore acres and to engage 60% of population that was dependent on agriculture.

Mr.Vinod Kumar was the chief guest at the valedictory of the two-day all-India seminar on ‘Policies of Governments, Paradigms, Challenges and Opportunities for Sustainable Electrical Power in India’ organised by the Institution of Engineers (India), Telangana State Centre here on Thursday.

Vice-Chairman and Managing Director of Telangana State Renewable Energy Development Corporation Janaiah said now people would not even tolerate 10 to 15 minute power cuts and thus the focus was on quality power. State achieved 100 MW of rooftop solar power generation and permission was given to generate up to 1 MW of rooftop solar power.

Electric vehicles

On promotion of infrastructure for electrical vehicles, he said 120 electric vehicle charging stations were planned in Hyderabad and another 19 in the smart cities of Karimnagar and Warangal with the emphasis on reducing pollution. Sites were identified for charging stations and feasibility study done and they would come up in two months.

Chairman of the Telangana Chapter of the Institution of Engineers (India) G.Rameshwar Rao, said State Chapter of IEI was playing an important role in dissemination of knowledge and latest developments in electrical engineering and other technology to budding engineers and engineering fraternity

Seminar recommendations

Chairman G.Tulasi Ram Das presented the seminar draft recommendations:

Train the staff of department concerned to promote awareness on rooftop solar power and extend the subsidies to masses for more adoption for household installations in tune with rising demand for power generation in view of urbanisation and industrialisation in the State.

For high rise buildings, it should be made mandatory to provide LED lighting along with rooftop solar power installation at the permission stage itself to reduce power consumption from the distribution companies.

Use of IoT practices extensively in services and also to initiate process of adopting smart technologies in the transmission and distribution network to minimise power theft for proper billing, operations and maintenance and replacing electrical equipment from time to time.

196,2020/02/20,Murder accused sent in judicial remand,"Police present murder accused before media

Gajwel police have presented the murder accused before the media on Thursday.

According to in-charge Commissioner of Police N. Swetha, S. Venkatesh Goud murdered N. Divya, an employee of Andhra Pradesh Grameena Vikasa Bank, on Tuesday night and father of the victim Lakshmi Rajyam had pointed a finger of suspicion at Venkatesh. Police had formed five teams to nab the accused.

On Wednesday night he was taken into custody at Vemulawada by Siddipet police. The accused admitted to committing the crime. Both the victim and the accused had studied together in high school and had become close during higher studies.

Venkatesh started proposing to Divya for marriage after she became bank employee five months ago. He developed a grudge against Divya as her marriage was fixed with some other person and he decided to eliminate her. On the fateful day, Venkatesh followed her and stabbed her. Later he went to Secunderabad, then to Vijayawada, Warangal and Vemulawada, the Police Commissioner said.

“Venkatesh was arrested and sent in judicial remand. We will take all steps to see that the accused get punishment for the crime,” said Ms. Swetha.

204,2020/02/20,Kaleshwaram water dilutes milk production in Karimnagar,"With abundant water, farmers shun dairy units, return to agriculture in the hope of raising two crops

It’s a strange irony. The ambitious Kaleshwaram Lift Irrigation Project (KLIP) has rekindled hopes among farmers to take up agricultural activities for two crop seasons. But it has also caused collateral damage: dairy units have been hit with a steady decline in milk production.

Thanks to the abundant availability of water everywhere in the integrated Karimnagar district, the number of dairy farmers is steadily declining. Even farmers of upland drought-prone areas of Sircilla, Husnabad, Chigurumamidi, and other regions are going for green farming, thanks to water from KLIP.

Procurement slump

So much so, the Karimnagar Milk Producer Company, aka Karimnagar Dairy has seen a decline in milk procurement by 60,000 litres a day forcing dairy officials to purchase milk from neighbouring Karnataka, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. This has hiked production cost, and the dairy is planning to increase its sales prices.

In fact, the figures are revealing. In December 2019, milk procurement was 1.8 lakh litres per day. But it started declining from the first week of January onwards from 1.44 lakh litres per day to the present 1.23 lakh litres. On the other hand, the sales had touched 2 lakh litres per day.

Fall in milk yield

The decline in the procurement of milk had been attributed to the farmers shunning the dairy units and taking up cultivation of paddy. Besides, milk yield too has reduced from the milch animals by at least 50 per cent following disease attacks such as lice, poor feed, and lack of adequate fodder.

To exacerabte, the State government too had failed to add new milch animals to increase milk production. While the government had announced distribution of two lakh buffaloes at the rate of one buffalo to each cooperative sector farmer, authorities could distribute only 50,000 buffaloes in 2018-19. And, there was no addition of animals in 2019-20.

Enticing farmers

Expressing concern over the decline of milk procurement, Karimnagar Dairy Managing Director P. Shankar Reddy told The Hindu: “We were forced to purchase milk from neighbouring districts. However, we are taking all measures to increase milk procurement by encouraging farmers to take up dairy units by distributing milch animals, specially designed feed to increase yield, and increasing milk procurement price.”

Further, Mr. Reddy said the dairy officials have formed into special teams and touring the bulk cooling units (BCU) to interact with the farmers and motivating them to take up dairy units. “We are also planning special veterinary medical camps for the treatment of animals, and artificial insemination programmes,” he explained.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/11ymvj/article30877294.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY21KRNDAIRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/kaleshwaram-water-dilutes-milk-production-in-karimnagar/article30871023.ece
205,2020/02/20,Walkie-talkies for Forest Beat Officers in Kawal Tiger Reserve in Telangana,"Improved communication will make patrolling and wild life protection in the reserve core area more effective

Protection of wild animals as well as the forest is going to be more effective, thanks to a tech boost. The Kawal Tiger Reserve (KTR) management will soon start using wireless communication sets in the core area in Jannaram Division.

Communication has been an issue since long in areas lying eight to 10 km deep inside the forest, especially in beats like Kishtapur and Kothurpalli in the Division.

Radio chatter soon

“In 15 to 20 days we will have the wireless communication sets to be given to Beat Officers. This will help them communicate with us urgently whenever needed,” disclosed Jannaram Forest Divisional Officer (FDO) S. Madhav Rao.

A visit to the core area of KTR reveal the improvements in management of the place - both in terms of infrastructure for facilitation of wild animals, and the department’s intervention. For example, there are 68 water bodies in Indanpally, Jannaram and Tadlapet ranges in Jannaram Division being maintained by the department. Besides, there are well-equipped living quarters for Beat Officers at the concerned base camp.

24x7 surveillance

“As the Beat Officers are stationed in their respective beats with their staff, the forest gets round-the- clock surveillance. The team stationed at the base camp will act as a quick response team when needed,” Mr. Madhav Rao explained.

One of the strongest methods of protection in KTR comes from the M-STrIPES foot patrolling by Beat Officers or Monitoring System for Tigers - Intensive Protection and Ecological Status, a software-based monitoring system of given areas. Jannaram Division has 40 beats in the three Ranges encompassing a total of 273 sq km of core area of KTR.

Long, foot patrols

“In January, our Beat Officers patrolled a cumulative 5,000 km within the Ranges on foot. The best effort came from M. Prasad Kothurpally, a Beat Officer, who logged in over 330 km,” the FDO revealed.

While patrolling on foot gives officers better scope for direct sighting of wildlife and also their protection in respective jurisdictional areas, the department is also aided by the fact that it has younger officers now who do not lack in enthusiasm. Among other improvements is the induction of Pressure Impression Pads at 126 places in the forest to lift foot imprints of wild animals on a day-to-day basis.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/gqxx20/article30872672.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY21ADB-RADIO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/walkie-talkies-for-foresst-beat-officers-in-kawal-tiger-reserve/article30868109.ece

As Teerthala village, the abode of Lord Sangameswara Swamy, in Khammam rural mandal is all set to host the five-day annual Mahasivaratri Jatara from Thursday midnight, the official machinery has made all necessary arrangements to make the jatara a hassle-free event.

The annual mega religious fair is expected to draw a large number of devotees from different corners of the State.

The historic Sangameswara Swamy temple, situated on the banks of Akeru river in Teerthala, has been spruced up for the occasion.

New look

The structures surrounding the shrine have been given a fresh coat of paint enlivening the ambience of the famous pilgrimage spot.

A special ‘abishekam’ will be performed to the presiding deity with milk at around 11 p.m. on Thursday marking the formal commencement of the five-day jatara, temple sources said.

Kalyanam of the presiding deity will be performed around midnight on Friday.

Khammam rural police have made elaborate arrangements for parking of vehicles to avoid traffic congestion on all roads leading to the jatara site.

Special attention has been laid on traffic regulation in view of the previous bitter experiences of long traffic jams in and around Teerthala during jatara celebrations in the past.

208,2020/02/20,Scribes enlightened on KTR core area,"Jannaram Forest Division of reserve holds awareness programme for journalists

The fairly large group of journalists from Mancherial, Dandepalli and Jannaram mandals in Mancherial district and Kadem and Dasturabad mandals in Nirmal district, which was the audience at the focussed awareness programme on wildlife, especially the tiger, conducted by Jannaram Forest Division of Kawal Tiger Reserve (KTR) on Wednesday returned home a happy lot, thanks to the enhancement of their knowledge.

The journalists even thanked the officials in the division for organising such a programme that not only improved their knowledge on environment and wildlife but gave them an opportunity to familiarise themselves with the core area of KTR and also interact with forest officials.

Heading the team of officials was Jannaram Forest Divisional Officer (FDO) S. Madhav Rao, who appealed to the reporters from electronic and print medium not to sensationalise news about wildlife, more so about tiger movement or related activities. His appeal was based on the facts about tiger behaviour in the wild about which he spoke at length.

The FDO also spoke about the work that the forest officials and staff put in every day to make the place conducive for tigers to exist. He answered pointed questions with regard to tiger behaviour by putting forward explanations based on his experience about the big cats in other tiger reserves in the country.

This is the first-of-its-kind programme organised for reporters who were also taken for a walk in the core area of KTR to give them a first hand knowledge of the forest and local ecology.

209,2020/02/20,‘Remove Minorities Finance Corporation chairman’,"MIM tells TRS high command; Akbar Hussain accused of corrupt practices

The MIM Karimnagar town unit has demanded that the TRS party high command remove Minorities Finance Corporation chairman Akbar Hussain for his anti-party activities and for indulging in corrupt practices while launching welfare schemes to the beneficiaries. Talking to newsmen here on Wednesday, MIM senior leader and former deputy Mayor Md Abbas Sami, MIM Karimnagar town general secretary Syed Barkat Ali alleged that Mr Akbar Hussain had betrayed the TRS party, which had nominated him to the Minorities Finance Corporation.

‘Supported Cong., BJP’

They alleged that Mr. Hussain supported the Congress in Karimnagar Assembly elections and the BJP in Parliament elections and was responsible for the defeat of TRS candidate B Vinod Kumar from Karimnagar parliamentary constituency.

Alleging that Mr Akbar Hussain had collected money from old Jama Masjid Imam by providing him with best Imam award from the State government, they also charged that Mr Akbar had recruited his own people in the Minorities Finance Corporation and provided loans and cars to the beneficiaries by collecting huge amount.

Public debate

They also dared Mr. Hussain to participate in a public debate on the allegations and prove his sincerity. The MIM leaders wanted him to fix date and venue and that they would participate in the debate and expose his irregularities. They also clarified that they contested only from 10 municipal wards in Karimnagar as part of friendly relations with TRS, besides winning from six divisions.

210,2020/02/20,Awareness on tiger movement to be taken up in villages,"Twenty villages to be the focus of awareness initiative; villagers to be informed of dos and dont’s

The Forest Department will soon launch a vigorous awareness campaign on tiger movement issues in villages lying along the banks of Penganga river on the border that Adilabad district’s Bheempur mandal shares with Yavatmal district of Maharashtra.

All the villages which fall in the corridor area will be subjected to the awareness programme once the tigress moving near Tamsi (K) village in the mandal either progresses further down towards Kawal Tiger Reserve (KTR) ahead or retreats to the Tipeshwar Wildlife Sanctuary (WLS) from where it has come.

“We have identified three points on the river on the inter-State border which the big cats from Tipeshwar WLS use to cross over into Bheempur mandal. There are about 20 villages which will be the focus of our awareness initiative,” revealed Field Director, KTR, C.P. Vinod, as he talked about initiation of permanent measures to protect incoming tigers in the corridor.

“A special team consisting of two forest officials and four multilingual animal trackers to converse with people even in tribal dialects will be in place soon. This team will quickly reach the place from where a tiger sighting gets reported to make preliminary investigations after which it will launch the awareness programme,” he added.

The nitty gritty of creating awareness will include telling the villagers how to react on seeing a tiger. The dos and dont's that the villagers will be told will help cut down on the chances of a conflict between humans and the ferocious animal once they come this side after crossing Penganga.

Life in Tamsi (K) village seemed normal on Wednesday after the scare that the Tipeshwar tigress had spread in the area during the last few days. The presence of forest officials in the village and in base camps surrounding it seemed to have infused confidence among them. It was this normalcy which gave authorities time to concentrate upon protection of the tigress as well as on the issue of permanent measures to protect tigers migrating from the rather small Tipeshwar WLS. According to sources, there is a chance of a few more big cats sauntering into Bheempur in the coming months as the Sanctuary across the border, which is just over 143 sq km of area, and located about 10 km from Tamsi (K) village as the crow flies, is overcrowded with tigers.

In previous instances, a tiger had come to the same area in December 2016, and two in monsoon last year. One of the two tigers, C1, had entered Bheempur mandal in June-July last year and returned only to create a record by waking over 1,300 km to reach Dnyanganga WLS in Buldhana district of Maharashtra while another, C3, had stayed here for a few days before returning to Tipeshwar in June-July last year.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/g6erty/article30864586.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY20TIGER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/awareness-on-tiger-movement-to-be-taken-up-in-villages/article30864588.ece

212,2020/02/20,The shape of water,"Manisha Parekh’s show, examines the aesthetics of creation and transformation says Pooja Savansukha

Water conjures images surrounding dissolution, diffusion, flow, and inundation. In A River Inside, Manisha Parekh’s second solo exhibition at Jhaveri Contemporary, the artist, “Uses liquid and its shimmering movements as metaphors for apprehending experience and describing desire,” states Zeenat Nagree in her catalogue essay. Continuing her instinctual and process-oriented approach, Parekh takes advantage of her materials to create delicate works, that expand on questions concerning the formation of lines, scale, figuration, and abstraction. “The sensuousness of water, its tendency to yield, and its forceful ability to overcome, serve to highlight acts of creation and living,” Nagree elaborates. Parekh balances geometric and organic imagery to animate abstract forms through explorations of rhythmic textures and scientific structures. Her poetic titles provide thoughtful entry points into her works that construct a dialogue around material, form, and the creative process.

Parekh’s series entitled ‘The Sound of Water’ demonstrates a layering of graphite on paper. The artist begins by pouring glue on board and waits for it to harden. “I like to physically record the impact from these textures,” Parekh shares in a gallery walkthrough. The artist renders intricate markings with graphite upon the structures provided by these chance droppings. Every variation produced in this series compels a different form of viewership. The works beg the question, “Are we looking above from a great height or peering into microscopic depths?” asks Nagree.

Exploring the medium

Parekh’s use of graphite and emphasis on the line and space resonate with her training under Nasreen Mohamedi at the Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda in the mid-1980s. Mohamedi’s practice was anomalous in Baroda where the narrative or figurative styles were predominant. Parekh follows her trajectory, celebrating the complexity of the line and its associations with boundaries and patterns. Her series ‘Ripple’ exhibited on a wall opposite her graphite drawings features punched and perforated holes on paper that resemble the action of bookworms. The two series raise questions about how marks act upon surfaces to produce possibilities of beauty. In this case, “graphite or lead can do what punching holes in a surface cannot,” Parekh explains while suggesting it is a form of exploring the limits and possibilities of her media. While her intricate works unravel microscopic or amoebic forms, their titles suggest that we are looking at something larger, forcing viewers to actively move between scales and orientations. For the artist, the works also demonstrate a dissolution of figuration and abstraction.

Parekh’s series ‘Relic’ and ‘Totem’ engage with colour and opacity, employing organic shades of watercolour and ink. Both series suggest bodies that have been preserved for posterity or piety, through their titles. In these works however, the artist dismantles notions of stability by exploring how colour bleeds into paper, and creating swirls infused with a sense of fluidity. Parekh notes how the abstraction found in music informs her work. Music in its association with memories also instils a sense of emotion to these works in their final outcomes, as well as in their process. Several of these works feature, “Tiny lifeforms that grow on the larger wholes, drawing energy and maintaining vitality,” observes Nagree. These forms that resonate with the allusion to bookworms in ‘Ripple’ suggest how parasitic forms need not be viewed with negativity as their destructive acts lead to aesthetic transformations. Violence here may be viewed as a necessary act in the process of creation.

In her wall-mounted sculptures, ‘Following You’ Parekh has worked with welders to create forms that represent frameworks of metal containers. Recognising the difference between working on paper and with metal, Parekh treats these works as “three-dimensional drawings”. For Parekh, shadows form the most important part of these works as they propose “an edge of encounter.” While they emerge from the objects, they also pose questions surrounding where the metal ends and the shadow begins, harking back to the artist’s exploration of the possibilities of lines and their ability to forge connections and boundaries within spaces. Relying on light, these works submit to notions of chance in the way they unravel themselves, whilst addressing concepts surrounding porosity and rigidity that relate to the trope of water.

One perceives an exploration of rhythm, an acceptance of continuous transformation and evolution, and sensitive considerations of the boundaries between creation and destruction in Parekh’s works.

213,2020/02/20,The illusion of revenge,"In his latest play, director Lokesh Jain breathes new life into the character of the mythical Electra

Tapping into the energy and enthusiasm of amateur actors, noted director Lokesh Jain put on board a well-enacted Hindustani play “Saraab-E-Electra” (Electra’s Mirage), last week. Drawing actors from Anukriti, the Hindi dramatics society of Miranda House, the production was in association with Indo-Hellenic Friendship League, Embassy of Greece in memory of Aphrodite Krishnamurti.

Penned by Jain, the play, staged at the college auditorium, is based on the Greek classics, “Electra” by Sophocles and “Iphigenia In Aulis” by Euripides. The story revolves around Electra, who is adamant on avenging the murder of her father King Agamemnon by her mother, Queen Clytemnestra and the queen’s lover Aegisthus. Going beyond the obvious, the multi-layered play deals with themes like nationalism, patriotism, faith, the status of women, among others.

Complex character

Lokesh Jain

Jain says, “I read extensively about Electra before writing and found that behind her complex character there are several backstories and reasons. These included bad childhood memories and severely strained relationships with her mother, making her behave and act the way she did, including wishing her mother’s death and suffer from chronic depression. Just to focus on Electra, without delineating these stories and reasons, wouldn’t do justice to the character. So, I drew substantially from the two timeless Greek classics.”

What makes the play compelling is its contemporary nature. The dialogues and singing by the chorus of nine girls, dressed in uniform cloaks and hoods, and at times holding bamboo sticks, made it relatable. “Chorus was traditionally used in ancient Greek plays, especially tragedies. In the original plays, their role was minimal but I took the liberty of enhancing it considerably to bring in subaltern and common people’s voices to highlight issues like nationalism, dissent and justice, being faced globally, including India.”

Jain presents both sides of the coin by dividing the chorus into two groups, thereby allowing the expression of pros and cons of every issue. While one stresses on implicit belief in Gods, another asks as to why questioning is forbidden, when the Almighty gave us brains. “The aim of theatre is to bring issues to the fore and make viewers think. The chorus precisely does this,” points out Jain.

Electra and the mirage

Jain’s well-etched Electra provides a deep insight into her personality. “She personifies the duality of human nature, with both good and bad, cruel and humane, co-existing in us. Even though she loves her father and seeks revenge, when her mother dies, the initial joy gives way to sadness, as she says, ‘I hated you and I loved you too’. She represents the mental and emotional conflict in us,” avers Jain. Anveshika Sahi portrayed Electra well through her facial and eye movements. “I tried to understand Electra’s personality, identifying myself with her when on stage,” she says.

Adopting a novel idea, Jain has included Electra’s mirage in the play, enacted by Vani Yadav. “The mirage represents Electra’s inner conflict, the tussle between her hatred and love for Clytemnestra. Further, her desire for revenge is a mirage, because when fulfilled, it doesn’t make her happy,” he explains. Vani, in her deep and appealing voice, rendered songs written by Jain himself. Trained by Chhavi Jain, the play’s costume designer, and a trained dancer learning classical singing in Patiala gharana, Vani says, “I practised for weeks to get the notes right.”

Describing her songs as a lamentation, Jain says, “It is similar to the Hebrew and Indian traditions of rudali. Besides being cathartic, these songs are required as spoken words aren’t enough to express anguish and pain.”

The highlight of the play is the electrifying interaction between Electra and Clytemnestra (enacted by Anamika Sudhakar). Talking about their chemistry on stage, Anamika says, “We practised our dialogues continuously, and helped each other to make the exchange look authentic.” Clytemnestra, resplendent in red cloak and gown, looked every inch a queen, and the contradiction between her and Electra, in simple attire, is stark. So were their arguments and reasons. When accused of killing Agamemnon, Clytemnestra tells Electra that he was cruel and had killed her first husband Tantalus, sacrificed their first daughter, Iphigenia to Artemis, for power and popularity. “I added some new elements in this exchange. Like the status of women when Clytemnestra says while a married man’s multiple relationships are excused by society, it is not so for a woman. Likewise, by bringing in reference to Helen of Troy (who is Clytemnestra’s sister) in their exchange, I brought up the issue of extra-marital affair,” observes Jain.

Inventive approach

Marking the production with creativity, Jain has introduced refreshing aspects to the play. The entry of the processions of Clytemnestra and Iphigenia from the audience section created a buzz. Similarly, the appearance of images of Greek Gods like Apollo, Zeus, etc on the stage background, too was a nice touch. “The idea of the procession through the audience was to create the ambiance of it passing through public,” comments Jain. The banging of bamboo sticks by the chorus on the stage too had a telling effect along with the accompanying music, though at times its din drowned the dialogues.

Chhavi Jain’s costumes lent an authentic touch to the proceedings while Himanshu Joshi’s stage lighting enhanced the viewing experience of the play, which is definitely worth being put on board again.",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/an9v84/article30870511.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Electra9,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/the-illusion-of-revenge/article30870514.ece
214,2020/02/20,The triumph of a woman,"“Djyrybyna: The Warrior Woman”, staged at the 21st Bharat Rang Mahotsav, was a spectacle with a sensitive core

“Djyrybyna: The Warrior Woman” in Russian presented by the Olonkho Theatre at the Kamani Auditorium as a part of 21st Bharat Rang Mahotsav was a spectacular musical that mesmerised the audience. Transcending the language barrier, it is about thrilling music, heroic confrontations and assertion of human world over the world of evil spirits.

Based on the ancient Yakut legend, it is one of the finest productions of Olonkho Theatre which explores multi genre theatrical culture aiming at “preserving the mythology and ethical and aesthetical principles of Yakut people (of Russia)”. Written by Prokopiy Yadrikhinsky Bedjeele it moves around Djyrybyna, the warrior woman, who is young and beautiful. She is to marry a would be hero of the people, who is taken away by evil forces, the inhabitants of lower world by force. The human world is in turmoil.

The disappearance of the would be hero of the people sets off a chain of violent conflicts. Great fighter as she is, Djyrybyna wages war against the evil forces. After a great deal of heroic battle, the warrior woman inflicts defeat on evil forces. But this is not the end of a struggle. The dwellers of the upper world who are ancestors and good spirits stand in her way of liberating would be hero and her bridegroom.

Director Matrena Kornilova has elevated the legend to a piece of superb theatrical artistry. A straight forward narrative with happy ending is given an epic dimension which unfolds with dramatic sweep. The director's genius lies in the way she harmonised various theatrical devices into an artistic whole. The set design by Ekaterina Shaposhnikova transforms the acting space into a vast canvas where the inhabitants of three worlds and the woman warrior are locked into a fierce battle that gives the characters a larger than life dimension.

Large ropes, hanging vertically, impart a mysterious aura to the ambiance and are frequently used as characters. The main characters enter from the centre of stage standing on a raised platform.

Maria Tatarina's costumes greatly contribute to manifest characters a distinct class and social traits. Costumes of the warrior and the one used by the Chief of the evil forces deserve special mention. The costumes used by the humans, living in the middle world, are different from those of ancestors and good spirits who live in the upper world. The characters of upper world wear kimonos with a variety of headgears to indicate their ranks in social heirarchy.

One of the highlights of the production is the way performers sing, revealing the power of timbre, colours and emotional intensity. Orchestra is handled by a lone lady artist, softly playing a variety of instruments. Whenever the performers sing, the orchestra hardly accompanies them. In the sequences of heroic battles, diverse instruments are brilliantly played to heighten the dramatic impact of the scene. In romantic scenes, tender musical touch is given. The choreography and lighting effects impart the production an aura of magic.

The complex combination of action, music and colours offer breathtaking visual imagery. The play unfolds by a narrator in the costume of an elder Yakut. Though the production celebrates victory of a young woman, in a subtle way, it illustrates human world is richer, livelier and fulfilling than the upper and lower worlds.

Dressed as a valiant fighter, Lena Olemova gives a memorable performance. There are moments she is subjected to defeat but with her indomitable courage and help of friends, she rises to the top. The ensemble provides solid support.",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/pk74u5/article30870312.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DSCF4290---,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/the-triumph-of-a-woman/article30870313.ece
215,2020/02/20,This exhibition of artworks in the Kerala capital explores ‘tender’ shades of life,"‘Tenderness Goes a Long Long Way’, curated by Radha Gomaty and on till March 2 at Longtime art gallery in Thiruvananthapuram, brings together works in various media by eight artists

As you walk in, American singer and civil rights activist Sam Cooke’s ‘Tenderness’ softly lilts in the background. The soulful track on repeat, the lyrics of which goes ‘Tenderness goes a long long way...’, almost works like a lullaby, setting a tailor-made ambience for the artworks on show at Longtime art gallery in Jawahar Nagar. In fact, the exhibition of paintings by eight artists and in varied media itself borrows its title from the 1963 song from the album ‘3 Great Guys’.

Curated by Radha Gomaty of Kochi-based creative platform EkaRasa, ‘Tenderness Goes a Long Long Way’, which opened on February 17, brings together works in eclectic styles and methods from Madhu Venugopalan, Ranjith Raman, Hima Hariharan, Johns Mathew, Sunil Vallarpadam, Nandan PV, Asha Nandan and Jagesh Edakkad.

Perhaps, the title assumes its best symbolic expression in Jagesh’s series of 13 individual works under the rubric ‘Belongings of My Angel’ that depicts objects and accessories associated with a baby such as cloth cradle, medicine bottles and droppers, body lotions, leg warmers and so on. The evocative works in watercolour are set against shades of brown and sandwiched between glass frames.

Asha’s ‘Cat’ series comprises seven distinctive pieces in acrylic depicting felines. While the single-subject works zoom in on the furry friend in various playful settings, Ranjith’s “mixed media” experiments attempt to blur the borders between the craft of tailoring and art with hand-embroidered and patchwork pieces on cotton. His experimental work ‘Hidden’ employs meticulous hand-embroidery techniques on tissue and cotton.

Madhu’s ‘An Antique Piece of Love’ series shifts the focus on flower-strewn wedding beds as a symbol to de-construct the idea of nuptials and the concept of marriage, accomplished through minimal visual language. Johns’ three works on display touch upon the theme of nature and landscape through vivid strokes.

A highlight in the motley collection is an untitled series of 11 works depicting fish by Sunil. With thick and broad strokes, the lustrous paintings lend a three-dimensional effect. It’s as if the scales covering the marine creatures are chiselled on the surface, imbuing a tactile effect for the iridescent artworks.

Artist Nandan’s self-reflective works hold a mirror to the viewer, wherein he puts himself as the subjects. His ‘Sumo’ series captures the action and intensity of the full-contact East-Asian sport of Sumo wrestling, where we see Nandan pitted against himself in a vein of meta-humour. His more layered pieces such as ‘Last Supper’ and ‘Rebirth’ lend themselves to philosophical introspection. Hima’s works in diptych format, so as to “resemble a book”, takes up “tender” ordinary subjects such as flowers and leaves.

Radha says the curation happened at “breakneck speed” owing to the immediate impact the artworks had on her. “I felt that the works were all in some common dimension in a dream that I myself was a part of,” she says, explaining her choice of the title as “an epiphany.” “‘Tenderness Goes a Long Long Way’ was one song we used to play on the gramophone during my childhood days. During my show’s curation, the number popped up in my head out of the blue as if establishing some time-warped connection. I felt it fit perfectly,” she says.

About the selection of the pieces, Radha says “they were like invitations into our vulnerabilities, which put you in a position of tenderness.”

‘Tenderness Goes a Long Long Way’ will be on at Longtime art gallery, Jawahar Nagar, till March 2.

216,2020/02/20,The chisel meets the needle - through Kantha,"Meera Mukherjee’s romance with Kantha took the textile art to a different level

Kantha, the thrifty craft of women to recycle old saris into light quilts has had an extraordinary journey with the involvement of some of the most famous names in history, including Rabindranath Tagore and his family. The work of the late Meera Mukherjee — gifted sculptor, writer, painter — is relevant in this context. It is unbelievable, humbling that an artiste of her stature would work with village women to create such fine Kantha wall panels which could rival paintings.

Kolkata born Meera Mukherjee (1923-1998), led an unconventional life, studying in Kolkata and New Delhi. She then went on to study at Munich, where she learnt and worked under some of the best artistes of the world. It was here that Toni Stadler encouraged her transition from painter to sculptor. This eventually helped her create a paradigm of modernistic works using traditional Indian crafting techniques. This includes bell metal craftsmen from Bengal, Bastar and the South and potters from South India. Her book, In search of Viswakarma, can be called a culmination of her research and studies of traditional Indian arts and crafts.

Dolly Narang of The Village Gallery, says, “Each year, I would visit Kolkata and meet her. On one such visit in 1995, she showed me a collection of 21 Kanthas made by young village women at Elaichigram where Meera di would go to cast her sculptures. The Kanthas were all single layered and made purely for decorative purpose and to help to generate an income for these women. They were not for functional use as in the case of the traditional Kanthas. When I acquired them for my gallery, she gave titles for each, which makes viewing them meaningful and interesting and the names of the women who made them as well.”

Helping women

There are different theories as to when and how the initiation began. Siddhartha Tagore, founder of MATI says, “In all probability, I think she initiated the village children in Bastar and Elaichi village in early 1980s.” Adip Dutta, who has contributed to the book, Meera Mukherjee – Purity of Vision by Dr. Geeti Sen (published by Mapin in association with Akar Prakar, Emami Art) says, “I knew her closely since the mid- 1980s till her death in 1998. She was passionate about Kantha, which she knew would eventually generate income for the women. She would commission the piece, pay the women and then sell the works. The money earned was also given to the women. There were at one point of time 10 to 12 women who did this. They formed a cooperative with a bank account et al. The money funded the education of the younger girls among the others in the group. The daughter of one of the women lost her eyesight and this money was used for her rehabilitation. Meera had a cult status amongst the women who acknowledged her good intentions.”

Since she was associated with the women doing Kantha for nearly two decades, the obvious assumption is that there must be a large body of work. Tagore says, “She made over 800 to 1,000 pieces. I had also seen a couple from Bastar district in art historian Late Nikhil Sarkar's house in Kolkata. I am also aware that Abhishek Poddar in Bangalore has a few of these.”

Sizable collection

Dutta says: “This was started way back in the mid-1970s. The Kantha works were created for a long time and there exists a sizable body of work. Supriya Banerjee, founder Gallerie 88, Kolkata, has one of the finest collections I have seen. The Japanese Foundation, I am told, has a good collection as also several private individuals.”

Meera worked lifelong with children, encouraged their creativity and wrote books for them. “This development in community-based art started with encouraging children at Elaichi and Nolgarhat village to draw and paint, an outlet for their emotions and creativity. It spread to the women, who came to do her domestic work. Their knowledge of Kantha was honed and perfected to create these fascinating needlework paintings. Later some of these pieces were made into carpets by Abu Taher, a carpet weaver from North Bengal,” says Dutta.

“It is interesting to see the influence of her sculptures. Tree is a motif, which appears frequently in her sculptures and is seen in the Kanthas,” supplies Narang. “It is interesting to see the textures of tree trunks made with a variety of stitches and well-coordinated colours. Children at play are delightfully portrayed in most Kanthas in this collection. The fabric and threads were provided by Meeradi,” he adds.

What stands out is that each of the piece is different. The village scenes include the one depicting the process of palm juice collection and a circus scene, besides the rich flora. Several of these find expression in Meera’s work as well. Perhaps, she drew some of the Kantha pieces herself.",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/ujj4m6/article30868904.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21frKanthaDSC2410jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/the-chisel-meets-the-needle-through-kantha/article30868906.ece
217,2020/02/20,Private school manager held for urging students to ‘cheat’ in U.P. board exams,"A two-minute long video of Praveen Mall, manager of Harivansh Memorial Inter College, went viral on social media

A private school manager was arrested here on Thursday for allegedly giving “cheating tips” to students appearing in the U.P. Board examinations and advising them to slide in a ₹100 note along with answer sheets to get a good score, police said.

A two-minute long video of Praveen Mall, manager of Harivansh Memorial Inter College, went viral on social media in which he is seen giving the “tips” to students to get high marks in the U.P. Board of Secondary Education examinations.

The video clip was secretly filmed by one of the students and sent to the Chief Minister’s office, officials said.

“If a chit is found with you and even if you are slapped, fold your hand and be ready for one more (slap). Don’t argue and stand straight as the teacher can damage your future,” Mall is heard saying in the video.

“Don’t leave out any question. If you write questions and put a ₹100 note, the teacher will give you marks blindly. Even if you answer a four-mark question wrongly, they will give you three marks. No one sees (while checking copies),” he is heard saying.

The video is said to have been filmed in January during a farewell function in the school, police said.

218,2020/02/20,"Madhya Pradesh to table proposal against CAA, NRC, NPR in Assembly, says Digvijaya","Law was brought about to distract attention from deteriorating economy: Digvijaya

Congress MP and former Chief Minister Digvijaya Singh on Thursday said the Madhya Pradesh government would table a proposal against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the National Population Register (NPR) in the forthcoming Assembly session commencing on March 16.

Stating the law was brought about to distract public attention from the deteriorating economy and spiralling unemployment, Mr. Singh told reporters in Gwalior that he had spoken to Chief Minister Kamal Nath about the proposal.

“The Congress Working Committee has already opposed the CAA, the NRC and the NPR nationwide. That’s why even Madhya Pradesh is against it,” he said, while taking part in a rally against the law.

New questions

Moreover, he claimed new questions were added to the NPR update exercise, scheduled in the State from May. “For instance, the birthplace and date of birth of parents — whoever is unable to answer such questions will be deemed doubtful,” he said.

On February 5, the State government had passed a resolution calling upon the Centre to abrogate the law, and begin the NPR update only after withdrawing the proposal to add new queries.

However, when a December 9 notification issued by the State government scheduling the NPR update surfaced recently, Congress MLA Arif Masood threatened an agitation if the government went ahead with it.

Quelling apprehensions, Mr. Nath on Monday said the NPR would not be implemented in the State “at present”. “The notification being talked about was issued on December 9. After this, the Centre implemented the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. Therefore the NPR notification has not been issued under the CAA, 2019,” he had said, adding that, in any case, the notification was issued under Rule 3 of the 2003 Rules of the Citizenship Act, 1955, and not the new one.

‘Against Constitution’

Speaking at the rally, former MP and Janata Dal (United) leader Sharad Yadav said, “The Central government is going against the Constitution by implementing all the three. Not just Muslims, but Dalits, tribals and others from Backward communities are being targeted.”

Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said the protests were similar to the non-cooperation movement launched by Mahatma Gandhi against the British. “There is a misconception that the NPR is like the census. Those against whom D (doubtful) would be written, would be included in the NRC. Even the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government at the Centre failed at implementing it. That’s why 13 States have taken a stand against it now.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/l7wmsh/article29321067.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Digvijaya-Singh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/madhya-pradesh-to-table-proposal-against-caa-nrc-npr-in-assembly-says-digvijaya/article30873462.ece

Meenakshi Mishra, leader of the women’s wing of the BJD who had attempted self-immolation in front of the office of the Berhampur SP in Odisha on February 12, died at a private hospital in Bhubaneswar on Thursday. She sustained over 90% burns.

She is alleged to have taken this extreme step to protest against the arrest of her son Raja Mishra in relation to a case of group clash on January 28. At a press meet on February 10, she alleged that her son had been implicated and had threatened to commit self-immolation if the police did not provide justice to her.

On February 12, she had reached the Berhampur SP office to meet SP Pinak Mishra. As he was out of office, she had met the Addl. SP. Later she went out of the SP office and doused herself with kerosene that she had brought with her in a bottle and attempted self-immolation. The police personnel at the spot doused it. She was provided initial treatment at the MKCG medical college and hospital in Berhampur and shifted to the SCB medical college and hospital in Cuttack.

As her condition deteriorated, she was transferred to a private hospital in Bhubaneswar, where she had been put on the ventilator since the last two days. She was declared dead on Thursday.

According to police sources, Raja Mishra had criminal record. But she alleged that he had been arrested on false charges. On January 28, a violent clash had occurred between him and some youth over parking in front of a community hall here. He was injured as the group of youths attacked him with a cricket bat. Ms. Mishra also faced attack while trying to save her son.

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Thursday opposed the bail plea of Indrani Mukerjea, the prime accused in the Sheena Bora murder case, saying that the court cannot look into the “credibility or reliability” of the witnesses at this stage.

Indrani had moved the bail plea last month, claiming that the prosecution’s case was “inconsistent” and witnesses [examined so for] were not “reliable”.

Countering her claims, the CBI informed special judge J.C. Jagdale that the court can “only see if there is reasonable ground” while deciding her bail plea.

“It cannot look into the credibility or reliability of the case. At this stage, if the court considers that a witness is not reliable then the entire case would be vitiated,” special public prosecutor Manoj Chaladan said.

Indrani has also sought bail on the grounds of parity, as another accused Peter Mukerjea was granted the same by the high court. The investigating agency submitted to the court that Indrani’s role in the crime is different from that of Peter Mukherjea’s.

It is to be noted that Peter Mukerjea is still in jail, as the high court stayed the bail order for six weeks. This is Indrani’s fifth attempt at getting bail.

“Teachers who fail to comply with the directive for ending such an appalling practice must be punished befittingly,” ANTSA president Visato Koso said.

In his order, department’s Principal Director Shanavas C. ordered the teachers who employed proxies to immediately report to their respective schools.

Each of these teachers was also asked to send to the department’s official mail id two of his or her photographs — one in front of the school and the other while teaching in a classroom — every working day from their own email accounts registered with the department.

Failure to comply with the directive could lead to termination of service, the directive warned.

The order also said 438 teachers from different districts were found guilty of it during a verification drive in October-November 2019.

“Such activities by a few thoughtless teachers will reflect upon those who dedicate themselves to the noble profession,” the ANTSA said, asking the school management committees to be vigilant against the proxy culture.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/punish-those-who-hire-proxies-in-schools-nagaland-teachers-body/article30871401.ece
224,2020/02/20,Aaditya Thackeray relieves official of duties for misbehaving with soldiers,"The Maharashtra Protocol Minister has also asked the Border Security Force to suspend him and to initiate an inquiry against him.

Maharashtra Protocol Minister Aaditya Thackeray has relieved an official at the Maharashtra Sadan in New Delhi of his duties after a video footage emerged of him misbehaving with Army jawans.

Taking serious cognisance of the incident, the Minister has also asked the Border Security Force (BSF) that the official, who was on deputation from the organisation, be suspended and an inquiry initiated against him over the incident, an official release said.

The incident took place when the regimental band of the Gorkha regiment had come to Maharashtra Sadan as part of the birth anniversary celebrations of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj on Wednesday, the release said.

The jawans were having lunch at the Sadan’s executive dining hall, when Assistant Resident Commissioner (Protocol) Vijay Kayarkar, while asking them to sit in the public dining hall, allegedly misbehaved with the jawans. Following this, the organisers of the programme and the jawans left, an official said.

A purported video of the incident went viral on social media prompting Mr. Thackeray to relieve the official of his duties.

“The BSF has been asked to suspend Vijay Kayarkar and conduct a probe into the incident,” the release said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/kpujle/article30669784.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28BMAADITYATHACKERAY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/aaditya-thackeray-relieves-official-of-duties-for-misbehaving-with-soldiers/article30870666.ece
225,2020/02/20,Anti-CAA protests: 28 in Lucknow told to pay ₹64 lakh for damage to property,"Several vehicles, including a state bus and police motorcycles, were set on fire

Twenty-eight persons in Lucknow have been asked to pay around ₹64 lakh as recovery for damage to private and public property during the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act at the Parivartan Chowk on December 19.

Several vehicles, including a state bus and police motorcycles, were set on fire or damaged in the arson and vandalism.

Those served notices include retired IPS officer S.R Darapuri, lawyer and activist Mohammad Shoaib, Congress member Sadaf Jafar, teacher Robin Verma and cultural activist Deepak Kabir.

The order issued by K.P Singh, Additional District Magistrate (East), earlier this week asks the 28 persons to pay the amount within 30 days or face confiscation of their properties.

The ADM found them responsible for illegal assembly and fixed the damages under joint and several liability.

The accused are out on bail in the arson and vandalism case slapped against them.

The court of Additional District Magistrate in Lucknow had earlier this month issued notices to recover ₹21.76 lakh from 13 persons accused of damaging public and private property in the vandalism and arson that took place in the Khadra area of Lucknow on December 19.

Darapuri, Jafar likely to move court

Mr. Darapuri and Ms. Jafar said they intend to move court against the Uttar Pradesh government’s recovery notices.

Mr. Darapuri told PTI: “I am hearing news that I’ve been issued recovery notices by the district administration, though I have not received any such notice till now. I will challenge it in the High Court if I get any.”

Social activist Jafar, who is also a Congress leader, said if she receives any recovery notice she too will move court.

“The state government is sending recovery notices unconstitutionally to people. There is no proof against me of inciting violence but instead of arresting antisocial elements, they arrested and tortured me,” she said.

226,2020/02/20,"Nirogi Rajasthan, prosperous farmer top priorities for Rajasthan govt: Gehlot","This is the second budget of the Congress government, which came to power in the state in December 2018.

The Rajasthan budget is based on seven resolutions, including Nirogi Rajasthan and efforts are being made so that development is not interrupted in the state despite various challenges, Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said on Thursday.

Presenting the budget for FY2020-21 in the Rajasthan Assembly, Mr. Gehlot referred to the public welfare measures in the last budget, and said that his government has tried to present a concrete action plan in this budget also.

He levied no new tax proposals and announced to fill 53,151 new vacancies. He also announced rebate of ₹130 crore in different kinds of taxes.

This is the second budget of the Congress government, which came to power in the state in December 2018.

“For us the entire Rajasthan is like a family. For this family, I want to make seven resolutions as priorities of this budget,” Mr. Gehlot said.

These resolutions are healthy Rajasthan, prosperous farmers, welfare of women, children and elderly, capable labourers, youth-students, education, water power and roads, skills and technology, he added.

Chief Minister Gehlot who also holds finance portfolio said the Central government’s revenue has reduced due to its wrong economic policies and Rajasthan is also suffering due to this.

He said that state’s share in the central taxes has been reduced by ₹10,362 crore.

Mr. Gehlot said the financial condition of the states in the federal system depends on the policies and decisions of the central government to a large extent and noted that today most economic indicators indicate that the country’s economic condition has derailed.

“We have made efforts to make it an inclusive budget by keeping in mind the views and suggestions of farmers, cattle rearers, women, students, youth, industrial and business organisations and civil society,” Gehlot said.

He said, it is important to present the true picture of the economic situation of the country before giving details of far-reaching steps that are likely to be taken in the coming year by the state government to achieve the overall development of the state.

“The reason for mentioning the financial position of the states in our federal system depends on the policies and decisions of the Centre to a large extent. Today, most of the indices of the country’s economy indicate that the country’s economy is currently going through a bad phase,” he said.

The World Bank, IMF and ADB have slashed growth rate projections. According to the Economic Survey 2019-20 India’s GDP growth rate is estimated to be 5%, he added.

The Chief Minister said the central government raises funds in many ways such as by taking money from the Reserve Bank, disinvesting in Air India and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL), reducing the stake in LIC whereas the states have no such option.

He said that despite these challenges, we have tried that the road to development in this budget is not obstructed.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/a0lapo/article30868632.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PTI3192019000046B,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/nirogi-rajasthan-prosperous-farmer-top-priorities-for-rajasthan-govt-gehlot/article30868625.ece

230,2020/02/20,Poll strategist Prashant Kishor kicks off ‘Baat Bihar Ki’ campaign,"It aims to create a group of people who will help Bihar find its ‘rightful place among top 10 States of India in next 10-15 years’

Poll strategist Prashant Kishor on Thursday launched ‘Baat Bihar Ki’ campaign with an aim to create a group of like-minded people who would come together to help Bihar find its “rightful place among top 10 States of India in next 10-15 years”.

Those willing to join the campaign could register by clicking a website www.baatbiharki.in or, giving a missed call at a number 6900869008.

Earlier on Tuesday, Mr. Kishor attacked Chief Minister Nitish Kumar for making ideological compromises to stay in power. “Both the ideologies of Gandhi and Godse cannot go together,” said Mr. Kishor in a crowded presser.

Mr. Kumar’s party JD(U) is sharing power with the BJP in the State.

Till recently, Mr. Kishor was with Mr. Kumar as national vice-president of the JD(U), but he was expelled from the party after he raised objections over the party’s stand on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, the National Population Register and the proposed National Register of Citizens.

“Nitish-ji has always said that he cannot leave the ideals of Gandhi, JP and Lohiya...but at the same time, how can he be with the people who support the ideology of Godse. Both cannot go together. If you want to stay with the BJP, I don’t have any problem with it but, you cannot be on both sides”, said Mr. Kishor.

‘Poorest State’

While taking on Mr. Kumar’s model of development in last 15 years, the poll strategist said, “Bihar has been the poorest State in 2005 and continues to be so”.

Mr. Kishor had also called the Chief Minister a “Pichhlaggu (underling)” of the BJP for, “he has surrendered before them to remain in power without extracting any benefit for the State”.

Political businessman: BJP, JD(U)

The BJP and JD(U) leaders slammed Mr. Kishor for his comments on Mr. Kumar. “He is a political businessman…like a booth-looter of the 1990s era, who himself intends to become a public representative,” alleged State BJP president Sanjay Agrawal.

However, the Opposition party leaders welcomed Mr. Kishor’s remarks saying “whatever, Mr. Kishor had said about Bihar continuing at the bottom of development even after 15 years of NDA regime is a hard fact and in the name of development Nitish Kumar has also glued himself to power”.

Jan Adhikar Party leader and former MP from Madhepura Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav on Wednesday welcomed Mr. Kishor to work with him for the “development of Bihar”.

“Now people of Bihar have become fed-up with ruling and Opposition parties…I welcome Mr. Kishor, former JNUSU president Kanhaiya Kumar and other like-minded people to come together to work for the development of Bihar,” said Mr. Pappu Yadav.

However, Mr. Kishor said his aim was to “rope in 10 lakh youth with Baat Bihar ki campaign in the next 100 days”.

“And these youths would choose a leader to take Bihar among the top 10 States of the country in next 10-15 years,” said Mr. Kishor who has also made plans to tour across the State and meet the youth as part of his campaign in the coming days.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/7rhyyv/article30867858.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THNAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/poll-strategist-prashant-kishor-kicks-off-baat-bihar-ki-campaign/article30867859.ece
231,2020/02/20,"Two Dalits tortured in Rajasthan, 7 arrested","Several videos of the assault and torture went viral on social media, led to reactions and protests

Two Dalit youths were beaten up, stripped and tortured in Rajasthan’s Nagaur district on the suspicion of stealing money from the cash box of an automobile service agency. The police on Thursday arrested seven persons accused of committing the crime after several videos of the assault went viral on social media, leading to protests in the State Assembly and strong reactions from political leaders.

The videos of the assault showed a group of men thrashing the two youths, who are cousins, with rubber belts. They later allegedly dipped a piece of cloth wrapped on a screwdriver in petrol and inserted it in the private parts of one of them.

The incident at Nagaur district’s Karnu village reportedly took place on February 16. The victims, Bisa Ram, 24, and Panna Ram, 20, could be heard screaming and pleading in the video footage.

The youths lodged a complaint at Panchodi Police Station, after which a case under Sections 342 (wrongful confinement), 323 (causing hurt) and 143 (unlawful assembly) of the Indian Penal Code as well as the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act was registered.

Heinous crime unit

Director-General of Police Bhupendra Singh said the heinous crime monitoring unit would monitor the case and it would be taken up under the case officer scheme for speedy investigation. In addition to the seven accused arrested by the police, seven other were detained and their alleged role in the crime was being looked into.

Inspector General of Police (Human Rights) Bipin Kumar Pandey left here for Nagaur for a detailed probe, while the Pradesh Congress Committee and the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party formed committees to look into the incident.

Three legislators of the Opposition Rashtriya Loktantrik Party tried to disturb the Assembly proceedings when Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot was about to start reading out his Budget speech. As they entered the well of the House to protest against the incident, Speaker C. P. Joshi asked them to go back to their seats.

The three MLAs — Narayan Beniwal, Indira Devi and Pukhraj Garg — later staged a dharna on the stairs at the Assembly’s entrance gate. They were carrying placards condemning the incident and demanding removal of the Nagaur Superintendent of Police.

Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said immediate and effective action had been taken in the horrific incident and nobody would be spared. “The culprits will be punished according to the law and we will ensure that the victims get justice,” he tweeted.

Rahul reacts

Earlier in the day, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi reacted sharply to the incident and said the video of the two victims being tortured was “horrific and sickening”. He asked the State government to take immediate action to bring the perpetrators of the crime to justice.

Bahujan Samaj Party supremo Mayawati said the incident in the Congress-ruled State was a “painful reminder” of the 2016 Una flogging incident in Gujarat. “The torture and exploitation of Dalits continues unabated at all places...

232,2020/02/20,Floating casinos should not be shifted from Mandovi: minister,"Lobo springs a surprise by taking stand different from the govt.’s; says more off-shore casinos should be set up

Goa Ports Minister Michael Lobo has said the off-shore casinos should not be shifted out of Mandovi river, and suggested that more such vessels be introduced in other rivers of the State.

The Minister’s comment comes in stark contrast to the stand adopted by the BJP-led State government, which has assured to relocate off-shore casinos from the Mandovi after opposition from locals.

Mr. Lobo, who is also a BJP MLA, justified his statement claiming that the casino industry helps Goa’s economy and generates employment.

“I still remember our former chief minister Manohar Parrikar saying that the State is not dependent on the money collected (as taxes) from casinos. But I am saying opposite to it,” Mr. Lobo told reporters at Mapusa town near here.

He claimed the casino industry is “helping the State treasury”.

“We get revenue from the casinos after charging fee for annual renewal of their licence. In addition, we also get revenue in the form of GST from them. Every year the renewal fees is levied by departments like Excise, Food and Drugs Administration and others,” he said.

Six off-shore casinos are currently operating from the Mandovi river in Panaji.

The minister said every vessel has been employing over 400 people.

“It is generating employment for Indians. We need to understand that this industry cannot be just stopped overnight,” he said.

“I would say that more casinos should be introduced in other places like the Chapora river (in North Goa) and the Zuari river (in South Goa),” Mr. Lobo said.

He, however, noted that MLAs representing constituencies around those rivers have opposed the introduction of casinos, “as people are objecting to it”.

“Introducing casinos in these rivers will help revive the economy of the State. Casinos will come up in these rivers in the years to come. People will realise it is part of the industry. If you want to grow the industry, then you will have to allow it,” Mr. Lobo said.

He also said that he was not in favour of the plan to shift casinos from the Mandovi river to the upcoming international airport at Mopa in North Goa district.

“Mopa can be a different set up all together, we can have a live gaming zone there. But in my opinion, the casinos should continue in the Mandovi river,” he added.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/xcvorh/article30867268.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20BMFLOATINGCASINOS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/floating-casinos-should-not-be-shifted-from-mandovi-minister/article30867269.ece

236,2020/02/20,"MVA government could fall over Elgaar Parishad, Bhima Koregaon cases: Athawale","RPI chief says it is not appropriate for allies to argue publicly

Union Minister for Social Justice and Empowerment Ramdas Athawale said on Wednesday that the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government could fall any time over differences on the handling of the Bhima-Koregaon and Elgaar Parishad cases.

The Republican Party of India (RPI) chief said Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray should reconsider his decision to join the MVA and shake hands with the BJP-RPI coalition he was part of earlier.

“With repeated controversies and complications arising out of this issue [Bhima-Koregoan], it would be difficult for honourable Uddhavji to run the government. Now is the right time for him to abandon the support of Congress and NCP, and establish a government with the support of the BJP/RPI instead,” Mr. Athawale said.

The RPI chief had earlier this week hailed Mr. Thackeray for reportedly agreeing to hand over Bhima-Koregaon/Elgaar Parishad files to the National Investigation Agency (NIA). The difference of opinion on this issue between the three alliance parties — Shiv Sena, Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party — has caused a deep rift that cannot be repaired any longer, Mr. Athawale claimed.

A former coalition partner of the Shiv Sena, the Union Minister said the Centre has the authority to push the NIA to take over inquiry into the cases. However, NCP chief Sharad Pawar and Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge have publicly opposed the handing over of the cases to the NIA. But the final decision must be taken by the CM and it was not appropriate for the NCP and Congress leaders to publicly declare their opposition, Mr. Athawale said. “The MVA government should hold an internal meeting and deliberate its decisions. It is not appropriate to argue publicly. Public opposition by NCP and Congress over decision to give NIA inquiry of these cases, is not correct. If such disputes continue, it will be difficult for Uddhav Thackeray to run the government,” he said.

This is not the first time that the RPI chief has predicted a political ‘earthquake’ in the State following the formation of the MVA government. In December last year, he said the three-party government would collapse over differences on Veer Savarkar between Congress and the Sena.

Fellowship programme

Meanwhile, former Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, has in a letter to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, said the State government’s decision to scrap the Chief Minister’s Fellowship Programme has sent a wrong a message to the youth.

The Maharashtra government had in March 2018 issued a notification banning manufacture, sale and use of single-use plastic bags. It also banned an array of plastic products including cutlery, straws and containers. The ban imposes a penalty between ₹5,000 and ₹25,000 for those violating the rules.

The government had given people time till June 23 to dispose of their banned items, following which municipal corporations started drives to confiscate banned plastic and the MPCB conducted drives to ensure manufacturing units were shut down. However, after about a year, the drive lost momentum and single-use plastic is now freely available in the market. The ban was the brainchild of Sena leader Aaditya Thackeray, and was implemented by the then Environment Minister Ramdas Kadam.

After becoming Environment Minister himself, Mr. Thackeray conducted a review of the ban in January, and spoke to various stakeholders regarding hurdles faced in its implementation. He also held a meeting via video conference on February 5 with municipal commissioners, district collectors and divisional commissioners. He has now asked the civic bodies in the State to submit plans on how they will become single-use plastic free.

Following the meeting, MPCB has also planned several measures that can be undertaken.

E Ravendiran, member secretary of MPCB said, “We want organisations like offices, municipal councils, gram panchayats to come forward and give self-declaration on being plastic free. Their claims will then be verified and we are considering giving them incentives like certificates or prizes. We might even hold competitions for these prizes through the local body. Let us see how many come forward. Local bodies have been asked to submit their action plan. A draft proposal is ready, we will discuss it with the Minister and then declare it.” MPCB is hopeful that organisations will come forward to become single use plastic free.

Besides, MPCB is also encouraging municipal corporations to set up team of inspectors along the lines of BMC’s blue squads for confiscating banned plastic. District collectors are supposed to hold monthly review of the implementation of the ban. A State-wide meeting will be held in March and the department will kick off its awareness campaign. Students will be involved in the drive and various competitions will be held at school, college level to sensitise them.

Anil Diggikar, principal secretary, Environment Department, said, “Corporations can individually decide how to motivate all establishments. The department will do State-wide publicity while the local bodies will be responsible for the execution.”

Officers attributed the slowdown in the implementation of the ban to the two elections in 2019.

The other challenge for the department will be preventing import of single use plastic from other States.

“If you look at the larger impact, single use plastic has reduced by 50-60% in the State. But it is possible that it comes from other States. We are looking at ways to prevent that. By May 1, we hope to put an end to that also,” said an MPCB official.

Meanwhile, environmentalist Afroz Shah said, “Implementation of the notification is fine but there are two stages of plastic — pre-litter and post-litter. Pre-litter means counselling the consumer about avoiding a lifestyle that stresses on largescale plastic consumption, especially multi-layered plastic. It is the responsibility of both producers and consumers to avoid products that use non-recyclable plastic. If citizens can achieve that level of lifestyle changes, it could take care of a large part of the problem. We cannot say at this stage if people can or cannot do this, it depends on factors. Even post-litter, which means when plastic hits the streets, is important.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/grwxrz/article30865145.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20BMPLASTICBAGS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/maharashtra-takes-steps-to-end-single-use-plastic-by-may-1/article30865146.ece
240,2020/02/20,COVID-19 vaccine may be ready by 2022: SII,"In the next six months, Serum Institute of India (SII) in Pune may begin human trials for a probable vaccine for the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). Currently in the pre-clinical tests phase or the animal trial phase, SII’s vaccine candidate has been developed using a laboratory-made synthetic virus.

“Our vaccine-virus strain is identical to the original virus and can generate a robust immune response,” said Adar Poonawalla, chief executive officer of SII, in a press statement, adding that he hopes to be ready with the vaccine by early 2022.

Being developed by SII in partnership with American Biotechnology firm Codagenix, the costs of the project is upto ₹300 crore.

SII aims to secure external funding for the project through various global partners. “We are in talks with a number of firms across the globe for potential partnerships. We are also not excluding China as a potential site for our clinical trials. By August-end, we will have data on mice and primates to submit to regulatory authorities to enter into the human trials phase,” Mr. Poonawalla added.

Sanofi Pasteur, the vaccines global business unit of Sanofi, has also announced efforts to advance a vaccine for COVID-19 by leveraging previous development work for a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) vaccine.

“COVID-19 belongs to a family of coronaviruses that can cause respiratory disease. In late 2002, the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) coronavirus emerged and then largely disappeared by 2004.

242,2020/02/20,‘Thyaagaraaja Vaibhavam’ — Dhananjayan’s tribute to Tyagaraja,"V.P. Dhananjayan in his reprisal underlined the experience, which resulted in the composer’s outpourings

The saint bard Tyagaraja is so deeply entrenched in the minds of musicians and rasikas, that any attempt to present his musical compositions calls for a lot of effort, understanding and commitment to do justice.

To tackle this theme of the saint’s music as a dance production is no mean task. V. P. Dhananjayan’s effort in 1992 was a great success, the veteran presenting ‘Thyaagaraaja Vaibhavam’ 22 times. This Bharatha Kalanjali production was revisited by Dhananjayan and Shantha in December last, editing out the Harikatha component of the original. Recently, it was presented as a part of the Trinity festival by Kalakshetra Foundation.

“It was S. Viswanathan of Kala Mandir Trust who conceived of this idea as a fund-raiser for Thiagaraja Sangitha Vidwath Samajam,” says Dhananjayan tracing the origin. I was only too happy to work on it. The challenge was to select those songs which would do justice to his greatness and also lend themselves to a dance narrative. The work is not a biographical sketch, but an attempt to capture his thought process and emotions behind the creative outpourings and his metaphysical quest.”

Shanta Dhananjayan, who wielded the cymbals, was in control of the ensemble. Hariprasad with his melodious voice, captured the nuances of the songs with great emotional fervour. The musical team consisting of Ramesh Babu on the mridangam, K. P. Sunil Kumar on the flute, Anantanarayanan on the veena, Yogaraj on ganjira and other instruments, Karthika on the tambura played with total harmony. The musical support played a great role in breathing life into the dance sequences. Lighting design was by Satyajit and Aravind.

The curtains went up, to the rendering of the Sourashtram kriti, 'Sri Ganapatini,’ revealing a dancer depicting Lord Ganesa in seated posture. The sounds of a Bhajana group wafted in and the audience turned to find Tyagaraja entering with a group as a part of his daily Unchavrithi. Impressive entry indeed!

Poignant portrayal

As Tyagaraja is immersed in his worship, he hears a knock on the door. He opens the door and sees a vision of Rama standing there. His joy knows no bounds, tears flood his eyes, and when he opens his eyes, he realises that the vision was just a dream. The exhilaration and the dejection were poignantly portrayed by Dhananjayan for the Atana raga kriti, “Eala nee dayaradu.” The magnificent image of Lord Rama glowing with the dazzling earrings, the beautiful smile, and the majestic form adorned with finery, was depicted in detail. Tyagaraja’s puja vidis with songs such as ‘Tulasidala’ in raga Mayamalavagowla played in the background. His anguish came through evocatively for the popular kriti ‘Nagumomu’ (Abheri).

The choreography included a few segments of group dancing, perhaps for visual appeal. It worked very effectively in the song ‘Evarikkai,’ where significant moments from the Ramayana like the breaking of the bow, Maricha Vadam and Ravana Yuddham unfolded in the background as Tyagaraja visualised it in his music. Although the idea of Advaita philosophy did come through, in the song, ‘Venuganalolunikana’ (Yadukula Khambodi), the extended Raasleela, dancing of Krishna and the gopis was a trifle distracting.

‘Nidichala sukama’ (Kalyani), ‘Melukovaiyya Rama’ (Bowli), ‘Nenendue Veda Kudura’ (Karnataka Kapi) and ‘Kanukontini’ (Bilahari) came in succession underlining the fact that the compositions were not just flights of imagination and creativity, but an outpouring of deep emotion and experience.

Appealing details

The pinnacle of the presentation was the classic composition in Ritigowla, ‘Nannuvidachi’ — where music and abhinaya touched a new high in Rasanubhava. It made the rasikas realise that it is not easy to carry a larger-than-life image of Tyagaraja on one’s frail shoulder, but Dhananjayan was doing it with such dignity and sensitivity. Dhananjayan recalls that in 1998, after a performance in Hyderabad, an old man walked up to him and said, “Do you know M.D. Ramanathan, for I can see his presence in your rendering.” Says the veteran: “I was stunned for it is MDR, whom I had heard so often in Kalakshetra, was my inspiration for this song. Similarly it is Balamuralikrishna for ‘Nagumomu.’”

The final sequence was ‘Sita Kalyanam’ as visualised by Tyagaraja The Kurinji raga ‘Sitakalyana Vaibhogame,’ and the tableaux of the wedding ritual danced in detail were appealing. It also brought back to memory a sequence from his mentor’s Ramayana series, where the battle is visualised through the eyes of the celestial nymphs. The use of a blue fabric laid out to suggest a river from which the idol was retrieved was interesting, but the idol of Rama at the altar on the stage was too small to be visible.

A show heavily relying on classic kritis and a single dancer occupying the stage for the most part may not offer the typical dramatic elements an audience would generally expect. That ‘Thyaagaraaja Vaibhavam’ sustained the interest of rasikas spoke volumes of the fine amalgamation of music and dance of high standards. Twenty-eight years ago, Dhananjayan performed the role of Tyagaraja, but that evening (February 13), he lived the role, with the line between the character and the actor almost invisible.",dance,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/thyaagaraaja-vaibhavam-dhananjayans-tribute-to-tyagaraja/article30869226.ece
243,2020/02/20,Remembering Rukmini Devi,"Kalakshetra will host a five-day festival to celebrate the 126th birth anniversary of its founder

It’s a festival to pay tribute to a visionary, who established one-of-a-kind training institution for classical arts. Today, Kalakshetra is popular acorss the globe for its significant contribution to dance and music.

On the occasion of Rukmini Devi’s 126th birth anniversary a five-day festival has been organised from February 25 to 29 at Kalakshetra. This being a leap year, the festival takes significance as Rukmini Devi was born on February 29, 1904.

244,2020/02/20,Rajashree Warrier on reimagining and broadening the repertoire of Bharatanatyam,"The danseuse talks about how the dance form has evolved and some of her new productions

Rajashree Warrier has been exploring new idioms as an artiste for three decades now. She continues to bring in unconventional themes into the repertoire of Bharatanatyam, while experimenting with presentation, choreography and musicality. In an interview with FridayReview, she talks about her approach to the dance form and some of her recent productions.

“Bharatanatyam has undergone a lot of changes over several decades. What we see today is totally different from how it was earlier. Thankfully, a revival is happening in Bharatanatyam now. That is because, like many other dance forms, it also had become faceless, while trying to conform to the visual vocabulary of the current era. The focus was on aesthetic movements. Abhinaya fell behind, as the thrust was on nritham and nrithyam. However, we are slowly coming out of that phase and things are looking brighter now,” says Rajashree.

Talking about her penchant for taking up myriad themes, Rajashree observes that she has taken those subjects that can be given a contemporary interpretation, without diluting the intrinsic nature of Bharatanatyam.

“Also, not all my productions follow a conventional story-telling format. It is not necessary to conform to a pattern. You can make the viewers a part of it. They can come up with their own interpretation or at least I can give that push to their thought process,” she elaborates, making note of her production ‘Vatavriksha’ in this context.

“It is an abstract work, based around the concepts of time and space. A tree, here the banyan, grows and over a period of time creates a space of its own with its foliage and roots. This growth is in close communion with the ‘panchabhoothas’ or the five elements of nature — earth, water, fire, air and space. It stands for a cycle of life,” she explains. The production has been set to five talas of alarippu (the invocatory piece of Bharatanatyam) — chathursram, tisram, khandam, misra and sangeernam.

Then there is ‘Bhagothi Chindu’, which was inspired by an article on swamps that she had read several years ago. “It mentioned that the tribal community believed in a goddess, who, apparently, resided in the swamps. That concept stayed with me. I wrote it down as a play before bringing it into Bharatanatyam,” she says.

Versatile artistry Trained in classical dance and music from a young age, she is an empanelled artiste of ICCR and holds a doctorate in music for her research in varnas in dual forms. Founder-director of Uttarika Centre for Performing Arts, which focusses on research and training in Bharatanatyam, Carnatic music and experimental theatre, Rajashree is the author of Narthaki and Nruthakala.

Some of her productions are ‘Tess’, based on Thomas Hardy’s novel, Tess of the d'Urbervilles, ‘Great Indian Stories’, a video series based on The Panchathanthra and Jataka Tales, ‘Mira’, a theatrical work on the story of Mirabai, ‘Shades of Love’, a thematic work on the romantic journey of a woman, and ‘Shikhandi’, besides those based on compositions by M Balamurali Krishna, padams of Irayimman Thampi and varnams of the Tanjore quartet.

The piece has a rustic premise and earthy lyrics (predominantly Tamil) written by her. The incidents happen between a day and a dawn. A rumour spreads that someone is missing from the village. It turns out to be a woman. People from various walks of life gossip about her, who is the Bhagothy or the goddess herself. Eventually, she is found to be one with Nature.

“Bhagothy is a metaphor for Mother Nature and woman. She is not someone to be confined to the four walls of a place of worship. She is vibrant and radiant and is always on the move. Similarly, women should also be allowed to break free from all shackles and come out shining brightly on their own,” Rajashree says.

A highlight of the piece, she says, is the use of intrinsic rhythms of Kerala. The folk touch is complimented by the choreography in Devadasi tradition. “I have moved away from the idioms usually associated with Bharatanatyam in this production,” she avers.

Points of view

Adapting Tamil poet Perumal Murugan’s poem, ‘Nee mattume en nenjil’, has been another successful exercise. While the poet writes about long-lost love from a man’s point of view, the dancer looks at it from a woman’s point of view. “I didn’t use any percussion in this piece. It had just veena and vocal. It was composed by K Arun Prakash for TM Krishna. I took it into Bharatanatyam with their permission,” she says.

Meanwhile, she approached visionary poet Bharathiyar’s iconic verse, ‘Odi vilayadu paappa’, in a new light by connecting it with women empowerment. “The poet exhorts the child to study, play, dream, be courageous, kind and free. I have juxtaposed it with the current times when the girl child is exploited, abused and attacked in different ways. My piece exhorts girls to raise their voice against injustice,” Rajashree says.

Each production has its challenges as she pushes her boundaries as a performer, says the artiste. In ‘Bhagothi Chindu’, for example, she had to bring home all the activities in a village, be it occupation, games, market, household chores…. through abhinaya.

Another experiment was in ‘Vaaranam Ayiram’ from Naachiyar Thirumozhi of Andaal. “Andaal is dreaming about her paramour, Sree Ranganatha. So I performed the entire piece sitting on the stage with my eyes closed. It was not easy to emote with my eyes shut,” she adds.

A trained Carnatic musician, Rajashree points out that she owes a lot to her musicians.

“I apply my musical thoughts in my productions and I have a team that gives me the output I want. Manodharma is something impromptu and it is possible only because of them. We trust each other. Since there are no rehearsals for padams and javalis, it is interesting when we finally present them on stage. There is always a surprise element,” she adds.

246,2020/02/20,Thousands take part in anti-CAA rally in Coimbatore,"Traffic comes to standstill as protesters occupy stretch between Collectorate junction to Lanka Corner

Thousands of people took part in a long march organised by various Islamic organisations and Muslim-centric parties opposing the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), the National Population register (NPR) and the National Registry of Citizens (NRC) here on Wednesday.

Organisers of the march said that they wanted Tamil Nadu Government to pass a resolution against CAA in the Assembly.

Raja Hussain, one of the coordinators of the march, said that the organisations and parties that took part in march will continue agitation until CAA is revoked.

Abdul Rahim, president of Jamathul Ulama Sabai in Coimbatore, said that former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa always ensured to protect minorities in the State but the present Chief Minister was supporting the BJP-led Centre which brought in an amendment in a law that questions the citizenship of Muslims and Sri Lankan refugees.

The police had to close State Bank Road from 10 a.m. to 1.15 p.m. as protesters occupied the stretch between Collectorate junction to Lanka Corner. They were blocked around 50 metres away the from the Collectorate. Traffic movement to Coimbatore railway station was completely halted as the protesters occupied the road.

The protesters, including women and children held national flag and placards saying ‘No to CAA, NPR and NRC’. Apart from the police strength of nearly 2,000, around 300 members of the Rapid Action Force were also deployed to take care of the law and order situation.

The police kept water cannons and tear gas shell guns standby to deal with the protesters, if required. The police also used drone to get aerial surveillance of the march.

247,2020/02/20,Plan to develop two roads to Pollachi,"The State Highways Department plans to widen the road between Zamin Uthukuli and Aachipatti and develop an alternative road from Coimbatore to Pollachi.

Two-lane

The Zamin Uthukuli to Aachipatti road is a rural road and it will be widened into a two-lane, straight one with paved shoulders. This is part of a ring road for Pollachi, according to officials in the Department

Other project

The other project is a new road between Chettipalayam and Koilpalayam for nearly 25 km and it is said to be a two-lane bypass road.

According to sources, both the projects will involve acquisition of fertile agriculture lands.

“Roads should be developed only where there is a need and not in every place. However, that does not seem to be the agenda of the Government,” said P.R. Natarajan, Coimbatore MP.

Need-based projects

“The State Highways Department should look at need-based projects and finalise road development work only after discussing with the public. They should explain the details of a project and the type of lands that will be affected. Even the road users are kept in the dark for most projects.

Gandhipuram flyover

The Gandhipuram flyover was constructed without taking into consideration the suggestions of the public and now two ramps are planned. Is this not additional cost ?

“The existing road between Pollachi and Coimbatore is widened. If there is a need for an alternative road, why not develop alternative roads between Coimbatore and Erode and Coimbatore and Mettupalayam too?” asks K. Kathirmathiyon, secretary of Coimbatore Consumer Cause.

Petitions submitted

Nataraj, who will lose half an acre of agriculture land, says he had submitted petitions against the project to officials and elected representatives several times.

“They have not yet measured my land physically. But, it is said the survey is completed. There are many who are small-scale farmers and will lose substantial land to this project,” he said.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/plan-to-develop-two-roads-to-pollachi/article30864427.ece
248,2020/02/20,Ranji Trophy | Karnataka loses two quick wickets,"Only six overs of play was possible on a frustrating opening day

Only half an hour of play was possible on a frustrating day at the Gandhi Memorial Science College ground, and at the end of it, Karnataka had little to celebrate.

Jammu & Kashmir sent back two touring batsmen in the the six overs that were bowled, drawing huge cheers from a small but vocal crowd.

When play was called off due to bad light on the opening day of this Ranji Trophy quarterfinal, Karnataka was 14 for two, with R. Samarth and Devdutt Padikkal the batsmen dismissed.

Overcast skies

For a long time on Thursday, it seemed as if there would be no cricket played. The umpires were unimpressed with the overcast skies in the morning, and when it grew brighter after lunch, a light drizzle forced the covers back on.

Finally, the toss

The toss finally took place at 2.40 p.m., when Karun Nair elected to bat first. Karnataka made two changes, dropping Shreyas Gopal for the left-arm spin of J. Suchith and bringing Manish Pandey in for Pavan Deshpande.

J & K’s young new-ball pair struck early.

In the third over of the innings, Aquib Nabi had Samarth squaring up, and Rashid held the thick edge behind the wicket. Padikkal, whose form has tailed off, was then caught at second slip driving Mujtaba Yousuf.

K.V. Siddharth and Karun, who were at the crease when bad light forced the players to walk off at 3:35 p.m., have some rebuilding work to do on Friday.

The forecast for the rest of the week is better but in the unlikely event that both teams unable to complete their first innings in five days, J & K will go through by virtue of having posted more outright wins in the group stages.

The scores:

Karnataka — 1st innings: R. Samarth c Rashid b Nabi 5, Devdutt Padikkal c Pundir b Mujtaba 2, Karun Nair (batting) 4, K.V. Siddharth (batting) 0; Extras (b-1, lb-2): 3; Total (for two wkts. in six overs): 14.

249,2020/02/20,"Women’s T20 World Cup | Can’t rely on one or two players, says Harmanpreet","Youngsters are enjoying this moment, says the Indian Captain

Captain Harmanpreet Kaur on Thursday said India cannot just rely on one or two players to win a game and if it wants to win the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup, it needs to play as a group.

India has failed to reach the final in any of the six previous editions. It made the semifinals two years ago, only the third time the country reached the knockout stage.

“If you want to do well as a team, you need to come up together and do well for the side,” said Harmanpreet.

“Through past tournaments, we have learnt that you cannot depend on just one or two players to win the game for you. If you want to win a big tournament like the World Cup, you have to come up as a team and that’s what we’re looking to do.”

Winds of change

A lack of performance at key moments has usually been the cause of disappointment but the winds of change are blowing ahead of India’s opening match against Australia on Friday.

With youngsters aplenty in a squad that has an average age of 22.8, Harmanpreet has called on the players to step up against the defending champion.

“Young players are mentally very fresh, they don’t know what type of pressure they have to face. They love playing cricket, that’s why they are in this side and they are definitely enjoying this moment,” she said.

Harmanpreet, who has been part of all the T20 World Cups played till now, also called on her side to enjoy the moment — acknowledging just how far women’s cricket has come since the first edition in 2009.

“We’re really enjoying this, as a cricketer you miss these things when you don’t play,” she said. “When you’re playing at home you have more pressure. Australia may have that but they are a very good side, everyone is doing well.”

She added: “We all know that Indian fans love cricket and wherever it is happening, they love to go and watch. That’s what we are expecting in this game.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/bzxqzu/article30873739.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH21WOMEN,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/womens-t20-world-cup-cant-rely-on-one-or-two-players-says-harmanpreet/article30873740.ece
250,2020/02/20,"India vs New Zealand | India has quality batsmen and a world-class attack, says Williamson","But Williamson sees opportunity to bounce back from debacle

The grace and flow in his batting is hard to ignore. The man slices open attacks by easing into his strokes. A natural with the willow, Kane Williamson is an outstanding leader of men.

But then, even Williamson can go through a phase when tough questions are asked and he has no choice but to answer them.

Against the wall

The recent Kiwi debacle in Australia has meant the side, that prides on punching above its weight, has been pushed against the wall.

And the chances are that the injured Kiwis could come hard at the Indians. Williamson, “India is a quality side, it is leading the Test championship and there is a reason for it. They have so many quality batsmen and a world-class attack.”

Williamson conceded he personally wanted more runs in Australia. “More so because it would get the team in good positions.” Now, India represents an opportunity for him.

The Kiwi skipper conceded he would be missing paceman Neil Wagner — awaiting the birth of his child — in the first Test.

Williamson said, “You sort of don’t replace a guy like Neil. I think the qualities that he brings are quite unique. But you bring in I guess a guy who targets slightly different areas coming from a slightly different height as well. Very exciting opportunity for Kyle Jamieson.”

The Kiwi skipper said batting in New Zealand conditions could be demanding. “It does tend to provide a bit of movement and assistance for the fast bowlers. So leaving the ball well and knowing where your off-stump is important.” .

Asked whether the Indian batting could be vulnerable around the off-stump, Williamson said, “I think if you can execute your plans on a surface that’s going to provide some assistance, then it’s a challenge for anybody.”

Admiring Virat

On his bonding with Kohli, Williamson said, “We go quite a long way back really, to our under-19s, and played against each other in different competitions as well, the international arena and the IPL.

“And I’ve always admired Virat in a lot of ways for setting benchmarks in the international game.”

He added, “It was really interesting the other day to sit down and have a quiet chat on the outfield and share a lot of thoughts that we had and a lot of similar views on the game and slightly different approaches which was really refreshing and quite inspiring as well from a guy who’s leading the way with his tenacious and competitive attitude.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/k4uas/article30873722.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH21KANE,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/india-vs-new-zealand-india-has-quality-batsmen-and-a-world-class-attack-says-williamson/article30873723.ece
251,2020/02/20,"India vs New Zealand | Every condition for us is home condition, says Rahane","‘Still, I would say, New Zealand is the favourite’

Normally quiet and introspective in nature, Ajinkya Rahane lets his bat do the talking. He is short in stature, possesses rapier-like strokes, can be solid in defence and delivers when his team needs him to.

In India’s last Test at the Basin Reserve, in 2014, Rahane notched up a brilliant 118. Predictably, he has fond memories of the arena.

Special moment

He remembered that hundred. “That was a really special moment for me. I remember that my backlift was changing because of the wind and that was a challenge to control my backlift. There were times when I had to shorten my backlift.”

He added, “Sometimes you’ve got to play with low backlift and, maybe, you have got to change your guard and play accordingly.”

On pacemen having to bowl against the wind in Wellington, he said, “I don’t think any of the fast bowlers like to bowl against the wind but it’s about what your team wants. Wind is a big factor in Wellington.”

Play natural game

Rahane’s advice to the young Indian opening pair of Mayank Agarwal and Prithvi Shaw was to “go out there and play your natural game.”

Wickets in New Zealand ease out after the first couple of days, he said, and added the batsmen should consolidate. There would be opportunities for the spinners in the later stages of the Test, Rahane noted.

About Rishabh Pant, he said, “He bats at No. 6 or 7, so he has to keep visualising about it if he got an opportunity. Keep it simple, focus on the controllables.”

Rahane said expectations on foreign soil from this Indian team, particularly after the conquest in Australia, had grown. “Now every condition for us is home condition. Still, I would say, New Zealand is favourite in home conditions. But we will try our best.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/e8skt8/article30873698.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH21RAHANE,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/india-vs-new-zealand-every-condition-for-us-is-home-condition-says-rahane/article30873699.ece
252,2020/02/20,India vs. New Zealand | It could well be an engaging battle of attrition,"The India-New Zealand showdown may boil down to strategy and execution of plans; catching in the slips will be of great importance

You step into Basin Reserve and memories of another day flash before your eyes.

The year was 2002 and India was taking on New Zealand in the first Test of the series at this breathtaking ground flanked by hills.

Beautiful and brutal

In the middle, the duel between the gladiatorial Shane Bond, bowling with the wind, and the ice-cool Rahul Dravid, was both beautiful and brutal.

Bond — athletic, rhythmic and hostile — got the ball to climb viciously and Dravid, a combination of heart and technique, rose on his toes, took the weight off the bottom hand and kept the lifters down with skill and class.

It was a combat of searing intensity. Dravid’s 76 was worth more than a hundred but India eventually lost the Test.

That was also a Basin Reserve track that offered assistance to the seamers in both the innings.

Subsequently, the pitch here has changed in character. These days, much about dishing out winning cricket at the Basin is how a team performed in the second innings.

There is a covering of grass on the pitch for the forthcoming first Test and the two teams should be close to being bowled out in their first innings by day two.

It’s in the second innings as the surface eases out that the real game begins.

There is less deviation off the track for the seamers, the pitch becomes slower and runs flow off the blade.

Then it boils down to strategy and execution of plans. The strong wind, who bowls with and against it, could be critical to the outcome.

This said, the surface for the India-New Zealand game, a part of the World Test Championship, could be different in character.

The track might be harder underneath, offering bounce to the seamers even after the effect of the grass covering wears off following the first two days.

The host has announced its 12 for the Test, with Matt Henry missing the cut. Left-arm spinner Ajaz Patel should get the nod over Daryl Mitchell, a seam-bowling all-rounder.

The Mumbai-born Patel could keep one end locked up, bowling against the wind. There could be dip and drift for the spinners.

Value of starts

Both sides will realise the value of starts, particularly with the Kookaburra ball in operation. The Kookaburra’s seam is not as pronounced as that of Duke, and the ball tends to do less after the first 20 overs.

This is precisely why the Indian opening pair of Mayank Agarwal and Prithvi Shaw has to prevent the Kiwi pacemen from making early inroads.

The back-in-action Trent Bount and Tim Southee form a potent left-right combination of swing bowlers who can exploit chinks.

The Kiwis will miss Neil Wagner’s hustling ways but has, in Kyle Jamieson, a lanky seamer with pace, bounce and an off-stump line.

The Indians have the batting, led by skipper Virat Kohli, to combat the conditions and the attack, and a seam attack that can hurt.

Ishant Sharma, Jasprit Bumrah, and Mohammed Shami can open up the Kiwi line-up.

Much for the host hinges on skipper Kane Williamson’s innings-building skills and the 100-Test man Ross Taylor’s strokeplay. Tom Latham and Colin de Grandhomme could also prove audacious with their shots.

Catching in the slips will be of great importance for both sides. Again wind will be a factor.

253,2020/02/20,‘India has the team to go all the way’,"Reema Malhotra feels the spinners can get the job done

Reema Malhotra feels the women’s T20 World Cup, which opens at Sydney on Saturday, could be a game-changer for the sport.

“It is easily the most anticipated event in women’s cricket ever,” Reema, who has represented India in three T20 World Cups, told The Hindu. “Cricket Australia (CA) is doing a great job in promoting the event.”

CA is trying to fill the Melbourne Cricket Ground for the final on March 8, which also happens to be the International Women’s Day, and make it the biggest crowd ever for a women’s match (the ground could seat more than 100,000). “I think CA could succeed in its endeavour,” said Reema, who will be commentating on the World Cup matches.

She reckons Australia, India, England and New Zealand are the strongest contenders. “But India, Australia and New Zealand are grouped together, so one team will have to miss out from the semifinals,” says the former all-rounder who has played 41 ODIs and 22 T20Is. “India certainly has the team to go all the way.”

She feels the spinners could do the job for India. “The team has the best spin attack in the world,” she says. “Poonam Yadav, Radha Yadav, Deepti Sharma and Rajeshwari Gayakwad are all fine bowlers. I believe the spinners could play a vital role in T20, even on the Australian wickets.”

Reema adds India will also need runs from beyond its formidable top-order. “Somebody like Veda Krishnamurthy will have to come up with useful contributions,” she says. “India’s batting line-up, I feel, is as strong as any other team’s.”

Indeed Smriti Mandhana, Shafali Varma, Jemimah Rodrigues and captain Harmanpreet Kaur are all capable of taking the game away.

“I expect a lot from Shafali,” says Reema. “She may be just 16 but she has already become a star with her big hitting. I think this World Cup could turn her into a superstar.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/u2neva/article30872487.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH21POONAM,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/india-has-the-team-to-go-all-the-way/article30872489.ece
254,2020/02/20,Australia favourites but India no pushovers: Mithali Raj,"‘Both teams have exciting players, particular in the batting units, and it will be a case of whoever can score the runs that their country need on the day’

The seasoned Mithali Raj has declared Australia as favourites to win Friday’s Women’s T20 World Cup opener against India in what she expects to be a high-scoring and “very close” game.

“Australia go in as favourites, but India will be no pushover. They have some very talented players and I think it will be a very close, high-scoring game,” Mithali wrote in a column for ICC.

“Both teams have exciting players, particular in the batting units, and it will be a case of whoever can score the runs that their country need on the day.”

“I do think Australia have the advantage because of their T20 record and have a slightly better chance of winning the first game against India,” she added.

Female stars emerging as role models has been the “biggest change” in women’s cricket’s journey from near-anonymity to stardom, feels Mithali, who grew up idolising her male counterparts.

When Mithali started out in 1999, women’s cricket was almost an unknown entity, a far cry from what it is on the eve of the T20 World Cup in Australia where the opening contest between India and the hosts is expected to witness sellout crowds.

“Back in my day, we only had male players as inspiration because that’s all we used to see on the television. Today a young girl can have a role model in the form of a female cricketer and I think that’s the biggest change I have seen,” Mithali wrote.

She recalled the changes the women’s game has seen since she played her first ODI more than 20 years ago.

“The biggest difference is people are now aware of what’s going on with their national team. When I broke the world record for the highest individual Test score in 2002, people didn’t know about it unless they were going out to buy the newspapers.”

The veteran added, “We used to travel to different places all over the world to play but barely got any time to acclimatise.

“There was no travel or daily allowance, nor a physio or strength and conditioning trainer to look out for a fitness. We travelled to matches with just our head coach and manager and just didn’t have any form of cushioning.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/e0c3ar/article30869955.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MITHALIRAJ,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/australia-favourites-but-india-no-pushovers-mithali-raj/article30869956.ece
255,2020/02/20,‘Reserve’oir of Memories: Ravi Shastri back for another Test at the Basin,"Friday, the 21st does hold a very special place in India coach’s heart.

Ravi Shastri is not exactly an emotional man but even the “khadoos” Mumbaikar in him couldn’t help but become nostalgic as he entered the Basin Reserve ground where India will play a Test against New Zealand from Friday.

And why not? Friday, the 21st does hold a very special place in India coach’s heart.

Exactly 39 summers back, a wide-eyed 19-year-old teenager Shastri became India’s ‘Test Cap No 151’ at the Basin Reserve on a cold windy day when the gangly six-footer had to wear three old fashioned cable knit sweaters.

“It was 39 years. They say what goes around comes around. Tomorrow, Same day same ground same team same city I made my Test match debut 39 years ago. Unreal,” Shastri tweeted as he stood there looking at wooden benches and white grilled picket fence that have survived the test of time.

“The dressing room is still the same. No change,” the head coach was seen telling people.

Incidentally, Shastri was flown to New Zealand on SOS basis after Dilip Doshi had got injured during the tour of Australia.

The 19 year-old was playing the Ranji Trophy quarter-final in Kanpur and according to a report published in ‘Mid Day’ newspaper, Shastri got the news of his maiden national call-up from the gate-keeper of the guest house where the Mumbai team was put up.

For someone, whose experience of playing fast bowling at the domestic level was confined to military medium pace of Madan Lal, a gritty 19 coming in at No.10 wasn’t all that bad.

But it was his left-arm spin that impressed one and all on a seaming track as he ended with figures of 3/54 and 3 for 9.

India lost that Test match by 62 runs but net gain was a gritty all-rounder, who served the national team for the next 11 years across 80 Tests and 150 ODIs.

Sitting in that old Basin pavilion or taking a walk, the head coach would like his wards to change the script come Friday.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/l76568/article30868570.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RAVISHASTRI,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/reserveoir-of-memories-ravi-shastri-back-for-another-test-at-the-basin/article30868571.ece

257,2020/02/20,Pakistan Super League: star-studded T20 to begin today in Karachi,"After the deadly attack on the Sri Lankan Test team's bus in 2009, international sides had shunned the country

Cricket-crazy fans in Pakistan will be able to enjoy the whole of their Twenty20 league on home soil for the first time when the star-studded fifth edition begins Thursday in Karachi.

The month-long Pakistan Super League (PSL) will see top internationals such as Dale Steyn of South Africa, Shane Watson and Chris Lynn of Australia, West Indian Carlos Brathwaite and England's Alex Hales and Jason Roy among 36 overseas players in six teams.

Matches will be shared between Karachi, Rawalpindi, Multan and Lahore after security concerns had caused most games in previous years to be played in the United Arab Emirates, with only the final stages of the last three editions being held at home.

Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Ehsan Mani believes the willingness of overseas stars to sign up illustrates how security has improved in a country where the army has fought a militant insurgency for years.

""So many players touring Pakistan shows the confidence they have in playing in Pakistan,"" said Mani, who took over last year with the aim of bringing cricket home. ""For the fans, this will be a long-awaited opportunity to see their cricketing heroes live in action and reinforce their love for this great game after being left deprived.""

A generation of Pakistan's youth had not watched top-flight cricket at home since a deadly attack on the Sri Lankan Test team's bus in 2009 prompted international sides to shun the country.

'A good message'

Security improved enough by 2015 for limited-overs internationals to be hosted but Test cricket returned only in December after a decade's exile.

""It's important that it goes off well, for the future of Pakistan cricket,"" said former Australian batsman Dean Jones, who is the coach of Karachi Kings. ""All the big boys, who are here from overseas, must bring their countries here and play.""

Since hosting Zimbabwe in 2015, Pakistan has provided teams with security normally reserved for visiting heads of state, with hundreds of police guarding stadiums and hotels and the PSL is no different. Roads to stadiums will be blocked and fans will have to go through multiple security cordons.

Pakistan hosted only the tournament final in 2017, expanding to four matches in 2018 and eight a year ago.

""I am delighted to see the PSL fully staged in Pakistan,"" former Pakistan captain Sarfaraz Ahmed told AFP. ""I welcome all the foreign players and hope they take a good message .. so that in the coming years we have more international teams coming.""

Australia's limited overs leg-spinner Fawad Ahmed was born in Pakistan but fled to his adopted country in 2010 after Taliban threats. ""Hopefully it goes safe and sound to bring joys for the whole nation, and youngsters get inspired,"" said Ahmed, who will play for the Quetta Gladiators

Six teams — Islamabad United, Karachi Kings, Lahore Qalanders Lutan Sultans, Peshawar Zalmi and Quetta Gladiators — will play each other twice in a round-robin phase with the top four contesting play-offs beginning on March 17.

259,2020/02/20,Ranji Trophy | Bengal keen to continue the good run,"Resurgent Odisha determined to give the visitors a run for their money

Hardened by a gruelling pre-season under the guidance of an old-school teacher Arun Lal, Bengal has displayed some miraculous performances in Ranji Trophy group matches and hopes to continue its good run in the quarterfinal clash against Odisha, starting at the DRIEMS ground here on Thursday.

The Bengal story, which includes six debutants, rests on its self-belief and team work. The team has found several match-winners with the bat and the ball.

If Abhishek Raman stepped forward early in the season, Manoj Tiwary lived up to his reputation in crucial situations. The experienced Anustup Majumder chipped in with important knocks, while the big-hearted Shahbaz Ahmed performed with the bat and the ball.

Lesser-known pacers like Mukesh Kumar and Akash Deep bowled with responsibility. Ishan Porel, despite his limited availability, delivered his best and is ready to serve his state again.

Arun Lal, who scorned ‘mollycoddling’ and ‘load management,’ could see Bengal’s transformation and expected better things in future. “We have the best bowling side in the country,” He said, unperturbed by the uncertainty over Akash Deep.

For this match, he believed that his team — which last reached the quarters in 2017-18 — has the wherewithal to blunt Odisha’s challenge on a green and hard track.

Bengal will pray for impressive shows from its captain Abhimanyu Easwaran and top-order batsman Sudip Chatterjee.

Dreaming big

For Odisha, which previously played the quarterfinals in 2016-17, this season has been a leap of faith too. Coach Rashmi Ranjan Parida, who played for five states and lifted the Ranji Trophy with the Rajasthan team, convinced his players to dream big and got a good response.

“I told the boys that they don’t belong to Group-C. We have to stick to our strength, play fearless cricket and treat this one as another match,” said Parida, who witnessed the side earn four seven-pointers — including three here — in the season.

The biggest positive for Odisha — which has capable seamers like Basant Mohanty, Suryakant Pradhan and Debabrata Pradhan — has been its resurgence in batting. Batsmen like Shantanu Mishra, Debasish Samantray, Anurag Sarangi, Govinda Poddar and captain Subhanshu Senapati have gathered runs and confidence.

Even though one of its main weapons, speedster Rajesh Mohanty, was ruled out due to injury, Parida believed that others could do the job well enough.

The exhibition, titled ‘Historical Gastronomica: the Harappan Dining Experience’ and hosted by the National Museum, started on Wednesday and is scheduled to go on till February 25. A private company, One Station Million Stories (OSMS), had organised the exhibition and the tasting menu inspired by the food of the Indus Valley civilisation. While an “indicative menu” on the company’s website included meat dishes on the tasting menu and dinner menu, only vegetarian dishes would be served, National Museum Additional Director General Subrata Nath said on Thursday.

“It is our tradition to have only vegetarian dishes. We have visitors who come to see Buddhist works and other religious idols. Recently, we had an exhibition on Guru Nanak and the food stalls put up for it also served only vegetarian food. The company had made its own menu and we had not approved non-vegetarian dishes as it was not discussed with us. We had informed them a day before the exhibition started to serve vegetarian food only,” said Mr. Nath.

261,2020/02/20,AAP MLA to request Ram Janmabhoomi Trust to build Hanuman statue at Ayodhya,"The comments come days after Saurabh Bhardwaj announced that ‘Sundar Kand’ prayers will be recited on Tuesdays in different parts of his constituency in Greater Kailash.

AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj on Thursday said he will make a formal request to the Ram Janmabhoomi Trust to build a grand statue of Lord Hanuman at Ayodhya.

The comments come days after Mr. Bhardwaj announced that ‘Sundar Kand’ prayers will be recited on Tuesdays in different parts of his constituency in Greater Kailash to seek the blessings of Lord Hanuman.

Mr. Bhardwaj said he will request the Trust to build a “beautiful and grand” Hanuman statue in Ayodhya.

“I will seek time from the Trust and give a formal request for that too,” Mr. Bhardwaj told the PTI.

“Hanumanji is very dear to Lord Ram. It is seen wherever you have a Ram temple, there is Hanuman because every Ram temple always consists of a Ram Darbar which includes Ram, Lakshman, Sita and Hanuman,” he said.

Mr. Bhardwaj said a recitation of ‘Sundar Kand’, a chapter in Ramcharitmanas written by poet Tulsidas that talks about Hanuman’s visit to Lanka, will be held on the first Tuesday of every month in many areas of his constituency.

The ruling AAP was trolled by the BJP over Delhi Chief Minister and AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal’s frequent visits to the Hanuman Temple during his election campaign.

262,2020/02/20,"Guru Ravidas Temple: Former Congress MP moves Supreme Court, seeks contempt action against DDA and Delhi government","Ashok Tanwar moved the apex court claiming that none of the directions given by the court on October 21, November 25 (2019) have been implemented by the authorities.

Former Congress MP Ashok Tanwar moved the Supreme Court on Thursday seeking contempt proceedings against the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) and the Delhi government for allegedly, “wilfully and deliberately disobeying” its orders allowing construction of a permanent structure for the Guru Ravidas temple at Tughlaqabad in New Delhi.

The temple was demolished by the DDA following the apex court’s August 9 (last year) direction which had observed that “serious breach” was committed by Guru Ravidas Jayanti Samaroh Samiti by not vacating the forest area as earlier ordered by the top court.

Later, the top court had passed direction on November 25 last year allowing construction of a permanent structure for the temple in Tughlaqabad forest area instead of a wooden porta cabin as suggested by the Centre.

In October, it had accepted the Centre’s revised offer of 400sqmt land in Tughlaqabad forest area for construction of the temple and had directed the government to constitute within six weeks a committee for it.

Mr. Tanwar moved the apex court on Thursday claiming that none of the directions given by the court on October 21, November 25 (2019) have been implemented by the authorities.

“The delay in construction of Guru Ravidas Temple is causing a lot of anguish and hurting millions of people, not only in India but across the world. The followers of Guru Ravidas had expected justice which unfortunately has not been meted out to them despite the orders of this court,” the plea said.

The plea alleged that the committee, as mandated by the order of the court in the case, is “nowhere in sight”.

The plea said that the apex court, in its November 9, 2019 judgement in the Ayodhya case, had directed for formation of a trust and allocation of land for Mosque.

It said that trust has already been formed in terms of the judgment in the Ayodhya case but no committee has been constituted in the Guru Ravidas Temple matter despite the apex court’s directive.

“This in itself is patent discrimination and shows the neglect of the government towards the Scheduled Caste mostly who are ardent believers in Guru Ravidas,” the plea said, adding that the “matter pertains to fundamental right to worship and is of utmost religious importance”.

Mr. Tanwar said he had not approached the court earlier as Delhi Assembly elections were going on and “the issue could have gained political colour, which the petitioner wants to avoid at all costs”.

“The idol of Guru Ravidas is yet to be restored at the site,” the plea said, claiming that authorities concerned have “deliberately disobeyed” the court’s orders and are liable to be prosecuted for the same.

Mr. Tanwar had earlier filed a petition in the top court seeking right to pray, restoration of idols and construction of Guru Ravidas Temple at Tughlaqabad.

In its November 25 last year order, the top court had also allowed the plea seeking enclosure of the Guru Ravidas pond within the temple’s fence so that it becomes a part of its complex.

It also observed that devotees of Guru Ravidas will no longer face any problems and the agencies will cooperate in the construction of the temple.

The court had modified the October order which had mentioned construction of a wooden porta cabin temple.

The temple’s demolition had led to a series of protests in Delhi, Punjab and Haryana and the apex court had on August 19 last year directed the authorities in these areas to ensure that no violations of law and order take place for political benefits or otherwise.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/haryana-assembly/vbcim7/article29628014.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-ASHOKTANWAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/guru-ravidas-temple-former-congress-mp-moves-supreme-court-seeks-contempt-action-against-dda-and-delhi-government/article30870830.ece
263,2020/02/20,Mediators continue talks with Shaheen Bagh protesters,"Interlocutor Sadhana Ramachandran tells the gathering that the issue of their right to protest is also before the apex court

Supreme Court-appointed interlocutors Sanjay Hegde and Sadhana Ramachandran on Thursday continued for the second day dialogue with the women protesters of Shaheen Bagh, who have been on a sit-in against the CAA-NRC-NPR regime since December 16.

Ms. Ramachandran told them that multiple issues and questions had been raised over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and that had been placed before the apex court. ""They will be heard by the Supreme Court. But today, neither you nor us can tell what will happen to it. We do not know whether they will agree with you or the opposition, but the issue is before the court and all arguments will be heard,"" she said. The issue of their right to protest was also before the court. ""The court agrees that you have that right [to protest]. But the current petition for which we are here presently is about the closure of this road.""

She asked the women if a solution could be reached. ""Sanjay and I do not want you to get up from Shaheen Bagh. The protest will continue. But can we together come up with a solution that allows the demonstration to continue here in the same space, but while also allowing the public to use this road?""

This question was met with a negative response from the crowd.

A protester from the gathering questioned the delay in responding to the issue. ""The Supreme Court has been listening to all the issues of the government, including the Ayodhya issue and the question of triple 'talaq'. Many people are bothered by this, so why are they taking so long to listen to our problems? It's such a simple complaint.""

Ms. Ramachandran said that an environment of peace was needed to have a dialogue. She asked if women could come in groups to continue the conversation. ""Conversations are not able to take place. It will be very difficult to come again tomorrow if things continue like this. We are not able to speak with peace. Both our time is being wasted this way. We can't hear anyone's voice. You will need to tell us how to do this"".

Citing demonstrations like the Rath Yatra, the Jat and the Railway demonstrations that had taken a violent turn, the protesters said that they had been sitting at Shaheen Bagh peacefully and raising their demands. “Our protest here at Shaheen Bagh is a source of inspiration for similar protests across the country. We are not sitting here for our pleasure. We are here demand our right for citizenship,” a protester said.

“We were also questioned for bringing our children here,” another protester added. “But, we feel suffocated at our homes. We are scared and unsure about whether our citizenship will be taken away, whether we will be put in detention centres, whether we even have our papers,” the protester said.

Addressing the gathering, Sanjay Hegde said that there were lawyers from different religious backgrounds who were against this law and who would argue against it. “But a complaint was filed about this road and it is very easy for the court to direct the government to have this road cleared,"" he said. “The judge understands the fear here and your right to protest. If we can tell the Supreme Court that this issue [regarding the road] has been resolved peacefully, we can then raise bigger issues for them listen to us better,"" Mr. Hegde said. “You need to understand the value of time. If people sit on streets at different places, the country will not be able to run”.

Adding that Shaheen Bagh has has become an inspiration for several protesters in the country, Mr. Hegde asked what the effect would be if something bad was to happen here. “You are our inspiration and in a country where we listen to our women, this is the only way we move forward”, he said. “You are all your mothers, our daughters. You need to think and tell us how to move forward.”

‘Alternative routes’

Stating that they have been informed about alternative routes that can be opened, Ms Ramchandran said that the same will be examined. “We will go see the alternative routes. Do allow someone to come with us who can explain the geography of the area,” she said.

In response to this, a protester said that if they were made to go elsewhere, they would not be heard for another two years. “When the fight for independence took place, I'm sure roads were blocked. Due to the difficulties faced then and the mass movement that it led to, we are able to fight for our freedom today,” another protester added. “If people understand our issue, then they will understand our reasoning and instead of calling it an inconvenience, they will come and join us.”

Interlocutors then left the stage, informing the protesters alternative routes would be visited.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/oc4o7o/article30870829.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Shaheen-Bagh-interlocuters-,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/court-appointed-interlocutor-continue-to-speak-to-protesters-at-shaheen-bagh/article30870826.ece

Non-vegetarian food has been dropped from the menu of the National Museum’s week-long exhibition-cum-event on India’s culinary history, Historical Gastronomica, due to an “unwritten policy” based on “sentiments”, a senior official of the museum said on Thursday.

The organisers came under fire after the event’s menu comprising non-vegetarian dishes was put up on the museum’s website. Shortly afterwards, it was decided that only vegetarian food would be served at the exhibition which will be on till February 25.

The food event is being organised jointly by the National Museum, the Ministry of Culture, and One Station Million Stories (OSMS), a private firm.

The additional director general of the museum, Subrata Nath, told PTI that OSMS did not discuss in detail the non-vegetarian part of the menu with the museum officials.

“They (OSMS) got our approval but the non-vegetarian part of the menu was not discussed with us. We assumed that they would know that we do not serve non-veg food here given the policy of the institution. Just 10 days back, we had a Guru Nanak festival and we never had this controversy,” Nath said.

“It (non-veg food items) was on the site for a day and we withdrew it as soon as we realised the issue,” he added.

Nath, however, said that the “policy” of not serving non-vegetarian dishes was not a written one, but a “sentimental one“.

“The museum is full of idols of several gods and goddesses, we have to respect the sentiments of the people who visit us. We cannot serve non-vegetarian food here. It is an unwritten policy based on sentiments which we thought they (OSMS) knew,” he said.

When asked if this was straying from the culinary history of ancient India where non-vegetarian dishes were common, Nath said that visitors will just not be served the food, but will be briefed on them.

“We are not serving the non-vegetarian food, but we will brief visitors on the historical dietary practices of ancient India, so it is wrong to say that we are not giving a true picture of the food in ancient times,” he said.

Some of the non-vegetarian dishes on offer were fish in turmeric stew, quail/fowl/country chicken roasted in Saal leaf, offal’s pot, bati with dry fish, meat fat soup, lamb liver with chick-pea, dried fish and Mahua oil chutney.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/otumks/article30869990.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SAIRANATIONALMUSEUMDELHI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/national-museum-drops-non-veg-dishes-from-menu-of-food-event-due-to-sentimental-reasons/article30869991.ece

A Delhi court on Thursday granted time till May 4 to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to complete probe in the Aircel-Maxis matter against former Union Minister P. Chidambaram and his son Karti.

The ED told Special Judge Ajay Kumar Kuhar that Letters Rogatory (LRs) have been sent to four countries and their response were awaited in connection with the case.

LR are issued by courts on the request of an investigation agency when it wants information from another country.

The ED had on February 14 filed status reports of investigation in the cases and said active investigation into the matter was going on, while the CBI had stated that LR have been sent to Malaysia and the response is awaited.

The CBI status report had stated that LR have been sent to Malaysia and there were developments in the case.

270,2020/02/20,Govt. seeks IIT-Bombay’s help to build smog tower,"20-metre tower with air purifiers proposed

The Delhi government has written two letters this month to IIT-Bombay seeking assistance in building a ‘smog tower’ in Connaught Place to control air pollution.

After being asked by the Supreme Court to check the feasibility of the tower in November, a High-Level Committee (HLC), comprising experts and government officials, had submitted in December a proposal for a 20-metre ‘smog tower’ fitted with air purifiers to clean the air.

On January 13, it was approved by the top court and the court gave the Delhi government three months to install the tower in Connaught Place.

On the same day, the court also ordered a ‘smog tower’ to be installed in Anand Vihar by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).

“Would request you to impress upon Centre for Science and Environmental Engineering of IIT-Bombay to assist Government of NCT of Delhi for setting up the Smog Tower using the same formulation as has been done for the CPCB,” a letter dated February 7 from Special Secretary of Environment Department, Arun Mishra, to Director of IIT-Bombay read.

Later, a reminder was sent to IIT-Bombay on Tuesday requesting the institute to respond that would help the Delhi comply with the Supreme Court order and fight air pollution.

“Basically, we want to sign an MoU with IIT-Bombay for construction of the smog tower. They would be responsible for the complete work and we will monitor it,” a senior Delhi government official told The Hindu.

In the proposal submitted to the Supreme Court in December, the committee had said that 65% reduction in pollution could be achieved on an average up to 700 metres from the tower. The tower is also expected to influence air quality of more than 1 km in the downwind direction.

However, the committee had also said that smog towers, as per the current knowledge and experience, might not provide a “viable solution” to improve air quality on a “large scale”. Officials said that since there was a localised effect, they still wanted to try it.

The tower is expected to cost around ₹12-15 crore, but the Delhi government is yet to receive a concrete proposal from IIT-Bombay.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/govt-seeks-iit-bombays-help-to-build-smog-tower/article30865314.ece

The management of the Indian Institute of Mass Communication (IIMC), Delhi, on Wednesday met students who are on an indefinite hunger strike demanding that the institute make course fees for PG Diploma courses “affordable” for students.

The students have alleged that the institute has been increasing its course fee by 10% every year since 2010.

The students, on the second day of their strike, said that IIMC had agreed to form a committee to look into the matter but alleged that the institute was not serious as an earlier committee formed to look into the fee structure had not submitted any report and had not consulted the students. The students also demanded that suspension against eleven students for protesting against the fee hike issue earlier be revoked.

Responding to the students, IIMC on Wednesday said that in the light of the “indefinite hunger strike” since Tuesday, the management has been holding a series of meetings with class representatives, members of the students’ grievance committee and finally a general meeting with all students in the institute.

“While it has been explained to all students that the fee for the current academic year will stay as per the present rates, except for those eligible for 25% freeship, the last date for paying fees is being extended to March 31 from March 2 by when it is expected that the committee to look into the fees structure in its entirety will finalise its report/recommendations,” the administration said. It added that the report of the committee will be sent to the government after fulfilling all procedural formalities.

274,2020/02/20,"CPWD seeks environmental clearance for new Parliament building, proposes cutting 194 trees","Its application mentions no court cases, though pleas against land use change are in HC

The Central Public Works Department (CPWD) has sought environmental clearance to build a new Parliament building, which it estimates will cost ₹776 crore and take 12,700 workers 260 days to construct, and lead to the cutting down of 194 trees, according to the application filed with the Union Environment Ministry.

As part of the Centre’s proposed revamp of the Rajpath or Central Vista, the CPWD applied for environmental clearance for the construction of a triangular Parliament building next to the existing heritage structure on February 12. It wrote: “Government of India plans to renovate the existing Parliament building and construct a new Parliament building adjoining the existing Parliament”.

The benefit of the project would be “social”, according to the CPWD, which justified it, saying: “A larger Parliament building for the nation is needed for better functioning of the legislature. The project will also provide short-term and long-term employment opportunities.”

The CPWD has sought permission to increase the built-up area on the 8-acre plot from 44,940 square metres to 1,04,740 square metres. The application says the total project cost would be ₹776 crore, of which ₹2.2 crore will be allocated for environment management, and a total of 8,60,738 tonnes of raw material or fuel would be needed. The application gives zero as the value of air, water, soil and noise pollution at the site. However, whether these studies are required or if the project will be exempted from an environment impact assessment will be decided by the environment impact assessment authority.

The CPWD said the project would lead to the generation of 438 kilolitre/day of waste water, which it said would all be reused. A total of 4.75 tonnes of municipal solid waste was projected to be generated and sent to sanitary landfills.

Also Read Loss of land for general public in Central Vista revamp flagged

While the application proposes cutting down of 194 trees and clearing of “other vegetation growing” on the plot, it says 250 new trees would be planted. The application says there are no court cases pending against the project and/or the land. However, two petitions have been filed in the Delhi High Court against the Delhi Development Authority’s proposed land use change of several plots, including for the new Parliament. The plot had been earmarked for recreational use in the Masterplan of Delhi-2021, and the DDA proposed changing it to “Parliament House” on December 20, 2019.

The project is part of the Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry’s plan to build a new Parliament and a new Common Central Secretariat for all Ministries and redevelop Rajpath.

275,2020/02/20,Shaheen Bagh: Women stand their ground on not vacating protest site,"Protesters at Shaheen Bagh interact with two interlocutors

Women protesters at Shaheen Bagh on Wednesday interacted with two Supreme Court-appointed interlocutors while they stood their ground on not vacating the protest site until the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) was revoked by the Centre.

In a nearly two-hour-long interaction between advocates Sanjay Hegde, Sadhana Ramachandran and the protesters, several women, including students, the Shaheen Bagh dadis, voiced their concerns and reservations against the CAA, NPR and the NRC.

Bilkhis Banu, one of the Shaheen Bagh dadis, while addressing the interlocutors said: “We will not move an inch till the law is revoked. When we voted for you [Centre] we were not gaddars [traitors] but now suddenly we are. Don’t forget that we [citizens] managed to send the British away as well. Only a part of the road has been blocked by us while the police have blocked the rest of it. Why is that not being opened?”

Fatima, a student, told the interlocutors: “Is inconvenience being cause only to people who are stuck in traffic? What about us — the women, children and elderly protesters who have continued to sit on this road braving the rains and winters? Now you want us to move from here as well. Where do we raise our voices then?”

“If we move from here we will be letting down the previous generations which have fought for us and the future generations will have to prove that they are citizens of this country. Yes, people have the right to travel on roads but when it’s about saving democracy and the Constitution, it is important to come out on the streets,” said Ms. Fatima.

Prakash Devi, a resident of Karol Bagh, said, “We are saying this again. The road will be emptied in 30 minutes of the law being revoked by the government.”

Before the interlocutors reached the protest site, announcements were made that when a team met the two advocates near the barricades they were told that the protesters would not be addressed in the presence of media, an appeal which was also made later. Even as protesters in unison demanded talks to be held before the media, later they were asked to leave.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/sbh6q5/article30865302.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL20-SHAHEENBAGHPROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/women-stand-their-ground-on-not-vacating-protest-site/article30865303.ece

A 34-year-old criminal, who was allegedly out to kill another, was arrested in Dwarka, police said on Wednesday. The accused wanted to build his clout in the area and hence planned to eliminate his rival, they said.

DCP (Dwarka) Anto Alphonse said that the accused, Jitender alias Bittoo, is a resident of Bindapur.

Police said that on Monday, they received a tip-off that Jitender was roaming near Rajapuri in Dwarka after which a trap was laid and he was apprehended. A loaded countrymade pistol was recovered from his possession, they said.

During interrogation, Jitender confessed that he was on his way to murder one Pawan Gupta because of personal enmity, but the arrest spoiled his plan. On further investigation, it was found that a few months ago, Pawan and Jitender got into an argument during which the former abused the latter. “Jitender’s friends taunted him for being abused and he took it as a challenge to build his clout in the area. He decided to eliminate Pawan by shooting him,” Mr. Alphonse said.

Police said that a case under Section 25 of Arms Act was registered against him and he was arrested.

Jitender used to rent lights to vegetable vendors in the area but later got into bad company.

284,2020/02/20,Bar Association passes resolution condemning judge’s transfer,"DHCBA says it’s a rarest of rare case; to abstain from work today

The Delhi High Court Bar Association (DHCBA) has unanimously passed a resolution condemning the transfer of Justice S. Muralidhar, who was part of the Bench that decriminalised homosexuality in 2009, by the Supreme Court Collegium to Punjab and Haryana High Court.

“Unequivocally and in the strongest possible terms, the Delhi High Court Bar Association condemns the said transfers. Such transfers are not only detrimental to our noble institution but also tend to erode and dislodge the faith of the common litigant in the justice dispensation system,” DHCBA said in the resolution.

DHCBA has also resolved to request its members to abstain from work on Thursday as a token of protest claiming “the transfer is a rarest of rare case” due to which, “the majesty of our revered institution is at stake”.

Following a meeting on February 12, the Supreme Court Collegium headed by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde has recommended the transfer of Justice Muralidhar, who is third in the order of seniority in the Delhi High Court, to neighbouring Punjab and Haryana High Court.

The Collegium order was uploaded on the Supreme Court’s official website on Wednesday and as the news spread, the executive committee of the Delhi High Court Bar Association held an urgent meeting.

Expresses shock

“The Delhi High Court Bar Association expresses its shock, dismay and outrage at the transfer of one of the finest judges to have adorned the Bench – Dr. Justice S. Muralidhar – by the collegium of the Supreme Court,” the DHCBA said.

DHCBA president and senior advocate Mohit Mathur and secretary Abhijat have also sent a copy of the resolution to the Chief Justice of India.

“The Delhi High Court Bar Association sincerely hopes that the Collegium of the Supreme Court revisits the issue and recalls the move to transfer Justice Muralidhar,” the resolution stated.

Justice Muralidhar, who was elevated as a judge of the Delhi High Court in May 2006, has delivered many significant decisions. The judge, who had convicted politician Sajjan Kumar in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots case, had also revoked the transit remand of activist Gautam Navlakha in the Bhima Koregaon case.

Justice Muralidhar is also one of the few judges in the Delhi High Court who refuses to be addressed as ‘My Lord’ or ‘Your Lordship’ by lawyers and gives them prior notice not to do so in the causelist itself.

Reacting to the development, advocate Karuna Nundy tweeted, “The Delhi High Court Bar Association stands up against Justice Muralidhar's forced transfer.

Mr. Khan was earlier cleared of all charges by the court of an Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate in May 2018.

The magisterial court had also reprimanded the police for slow probe into the rescue of 15 child labourers from zari units in south Delhi’s Batla House, in a joint operation with a non-government organisation, stating that the time taken by them proved to be fatal to the case of prosecution.

The police had registered a first information report on November 1, 2010. Mr. Khan was accused of obstructing the rescue operation.

In 2016, they filed the chargesheet that was described as “choreographed” by the magisterial court.

286,2020/02/20,CM meets his Ministers to discuss ‘10 guarantees’,"‘Prepare road map to fulfil promises in Guarantee Card’

Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday held a high-level meeting with all Cabinet Ministers, Secretaries and Heads of Departments to discuss the 10 “guarantees” made by him during the recently concluded Assembly elections here.

This was followed by the first Cabinet meeting of the Aam Aadmi Party-led Delhi government’s second tenure.

Mr. Kejriwal, the Delhi government said in a statement, directed all HoDs to prepare a detailed road map to fulfil the promises in the ‘Guarantee Card’ within one week and provide an estimate for the budget required to implement the same.

“The new government has already started its processes following the oath ceremony without wasting much time. We have started working towards the development of Delhi, and I hope that we will work at a much faster pace than we had during our last tenure,” Mr. Kejriwal told reporters at a press conference.

“...I have been consistently asked why I did not take charge of any department. I did not take charge of anything except the Delhi Jal Board during my last tenure. It is much easier to monitor the functioning of all the departments than handling any one. I believe it is the responsibility of the Chief Minister to overlook the performance of all the Ministers and the operations of their departments,” he said further.

Mr. Kejriwal, the government said, also made clear in the meeting that all free schemes implemented during his previous tenure would continue for the next five years. These include free electricity up to 200 units, free water up to 20,000 litre, free ride for women on buses and a free pilgrimage scheme for senior citizens.

Mr. Kejriwal said the respective heads or the Secretaries of departments such as Education, Health, Security, Water, Electricity, Transport, Environment, had been instructed to formulate a plan for the smooth functioning of their departments.

“The plan will contain the timeline as well as the budget or monetary requirements for the fulfilment of the guarantees concerning their departments. The plan will also have set milestones of the execution of work, to assess the fulfilment of plans in the stipulated timelines,” he said.

“Separate meetings will be held a week later with each of these departments every week where they will hold presentations notifying their requirements. The budget allocation on these ‘guarantees’ will be announced during the announcement of the budget for this financial year in the Delhi Assembly,” he said further.

The Delhi Cabinet, Mr. Kejriwal added, had decided that the first Delhi Assembly session would be a three-day one and be held between February 24 and 26. The Chief Minister also issued an assurance related to 24-hour safe and clean tap water in the next five years.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/tmhj4j/article30865252.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL20-DELHICMPC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/cm-meets-his-ministers-to-discuss-10-guarantees/article30865253.ece
287,2020/02/20,STF set up to study minimum age of girls entering motherhood: Centre,"HC gives time to govt. to submit response on plea seeking uniform marriage age

The Centre has informed the Delhi High Court on Wednesday that a Special Task Force has been formed to study the issue of minimum age of girls entering motherhood.

The Centre’s submissions were made during the hearing of a petition seeking equality in legal age of marriage for men and women.

A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice C. Hari Shankar was informed about Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s recent speech while presenting the Budget in Parliament where she discussed the issue of age of girls entering motherhood.

Ms. Sitharaman had said: “Women’s age of marriage was increased from fifteen years to eighteen years in 1978, by amending erstwhile Sharda Act of 1929. As India progresses further, opportunities open up for women to pursue higher education and careers.”

“There are imperatives of lowering maternal mortality rate [MMR] as well as improvement of nutrition levels. Entire issue about age of a girl entering motherhood needs to be seen in this light. I propose to appoint a task force that will present its recommendations in six months’ time,” she had said.

Taking note of the submission, the High Court granted more time to the Centre to submit its response to the petition by BJP leader and advocate Ashwini Upadhyay.

The petition has claimed that the difference in minimum age of marriage for men and women was based on patriarchal stereotypes and has no scientific backing.

The plea has contended that limit of 18 years for a woman to get married amounts to “blatant discrimination” when men in India are permitted to wed at the age of 21.

Mr. Upadhyay argued that more than 125 countries in the world have a uniform age of marriage for men and women. Noting this fact, the National Human Rights Commission, pursuant to the National Conference on Child Marriage held in New Delhi in August 2018, recommended that India follow suit and bring uniformity in the minimum age limits, he said.

He contended that to protect women’s fundamental rights, it is imperative that the minimum age of marriage be equalised and fixed at 21 years.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/v1alkp/article30865178.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL20-HC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/stf-set-up-to-study-minimum-age-of-girls-entering-motherhood-centre/article30865179.ece
288,2020/02/20,Kishalay Bhattacharjee brings the Northeast to Delhi,"Kishalay Bhattacharjee on why and how he has curated his fourth exhibition that puts the spotlight on languages

Growing up in Shillong and subsequently reporting across the Northeast, Kishalay Bhattacharjee, an Associate Professor and Vice Dean, Jindal School of Journalism and Communications and Director New Imaginations,,O.P. Jindal Global University, had a first-hand- experience witnessing the trials and tribulations of the minorities and the marginlised. He's put his experiences into the nine day long exhibition ArtEast 2020: The Story of Telling. Collecting all the pieces from different regions of the Northeast has been a cathartic experience for him, he says. Kishalay, a former journalist with NDTV, where he covered Northeast for several years, will deliver the curatorial note at the fest that begins at IIC on February 21. .

Excerpts from a conversation.

What was the catalyst for curating this exhibition?

The catalyst for creating this was identity politics, which has become very intense in recent times. We felt that one of the drivers of identity politics is language. The assertion of your nationality is through language. Since this festival focusses on the Northeast, though taking the larger subcontinent in mind, I wanted to go back and see how language politics plays in that region vis a vis other parts of the country. Even within Assam the various ethnicities are divided by language and identity. Rather than homogenise, it is important to celebrate the diversity without the divisiveness.

Earlier, there were divisions within Assam like the Bodos, who have been demanding separate Statehood. Hundreds of thousands of people lost their lives to armed underground organisations. All this is due to the conflict over language.

Misuse of Citizenship (Amendment) Act, can best be seen in Assam. In that State, the Assamese has hegemony over other languages like Bodo, Karbi, Mishing. Now, the moot question is who is the real Assamese?

How have the anti-CAA protests been brought alive?

Shaheen Bagh has become a metaphor for a new India. We have put up on the wall multiple translations of Hum Dekhege, the anthem of a resurgent youth. The message comes across through Urdu, Metei, Kuki, Lepcha, Rohingya and other scripts. It is titled We Shall Bear Witness. Visitors will be encouraged to share their language with us. Then we have an installation titled Pehchan, where identity is conceived as enmeshed in language. It has been arranged by students of the NID, Haryana.

In the gallery, there will be a video installations of languages of persecuted communities by cinematographer Parasher Baruah. That will include Kashmiris, Adivasi tea tribes, Rohingyas and Tibetans.

So we will have the booming voice of theatre stalwart M. K. Raina speaking in Kashmiri. Qamar Dagar, noted calligrapher, has displayed works on Mizo and Manipuri scripts. A Naga boy will sing in his mother tongue. People in Delhi have never heard a member of the Lotha tribe. Palm leaf manuscripts from Majuli Braj will be on display.

How would you like people to perceive the Northeast?

There are two kind of perceptions. One is that the Northeast is a lively exotic place, with great scenery and enchanting music. Hence, it is a go to place. The second perception is the Northeast is extremist. These stereotypes exist among all communities. But through this festival every year we try to imagine the region through different lens in order to defy the stereotype. However, there is reverse racisim there as well and that must also be recongised and called out.

Art Gallery, Kamaladevi Complex, IIC, 11 a.m. - 7 p.m.

This exhibition talks about displacement and migration of people. How are you telling the story of this through your event?

Through stories of displaced people like Kashmiris, Rohingyas, Tibetans, Asivasis in Assam and Miyah. Miyah in Lucknow refers to a Muslim gentleman. In Assam, however, it is seen as a street slur: a Bangladeshi who has taken my land and job. The Bengali-speaking Muslims are trying to reclaim this word. How words and semantics matter will be shown in Witness Us - A Reading of Miyah Poetry Poets. Ashraful Hussain, Mirza Lutful Rahman, Kazi Neel, Rehna Sultana, Nozmul Ali and Marinal Pathak will recite poem and sing songs of homelessness, exile but a refusal to give in.

289,2020/02/20,Life here is not totally false,"Drama, as Life on earth is referred to, has Ultimate Reality as its nucleus

The world of Nama–Rupa (names/characters and sculptures/forms), Gita-Vadya (vocal singing and instruments), Bhava–Tala (expressions and rhythmic movement) and Sahitya-Kavita (prose and poetry) poses a question: Is Natya partially/completely false or is it actually true?

This is an important point in present times, especially when changes keep happening to the Arts. If we consider drama in the framework, then the world is not absolutely false. If the world were false, with the liberation of the first human being, the world would have been annihilated. However, the world continues to exist even if a human attains liberation. Natya has stood through ages and hence there is truth in it. Natya consolidates the position of good and righteousness as supreme and so it has to be also true.

On the other hand, one could study the impact of the ‘great sentences’ — Advaitic Mahavakyas, which are four in number with their variations as found in the Upanishads, on the above question. These sentences state the position of ultimate reality:

Prajnanam brahma (Brahman is Consciousness) - Aitareya Upanishad, Rig Veda

Aham Brahmasmi (I am Brahman) Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, Yajur Veda

Tattvamasi (That thou art) - Chhāndogya Upanishad, Sama Veda

Ayamātmā brahma (This Atman is Brahman) - Mandukya Upanishad, Atharva Veda

One also dreams when one is awake. The world is compared to this conscious dream. Natya spins a magical dream, depicting characters, sentiments and music and dancing, created for the purpose of aesthetic joy. How can a dream be considered as the truth?

Since the world is created and destroyed, it is not true. Truth is the thing which does not change. Since the world is changing, it is not true. Whatever is independent of space and time is true, and whatever has space and time in itself is untrue. Natya, as per its very definition, represents actions in this changing world. Thus, with the above argument, it would become false!

Can we brush off any great endeavour of man as a mere eyewash, especially when it is directed towards the highest realm of God? What would then happen to the experience of Brahman consciousness that has stood the test of time? Well, the magic, that is realised as the relish of aesthetic joy gives the didactic scope to annul any preposterous definition of drama. In fact, Rasa, the experience is itself that which is found above in all the ‘great sentences.’ Life in this world is like reflection (Pratibimbha) of Brahman or Supreme Self. Hence the representation of life in the world cannot be totally false. Drama which represents the relative reality of the world, aims to elevate to the absolute Truth, which is Brahman, which is Rasa! We can thus understand that drama is world related, materially unreal and projected as real but essentially has the firmament of Ultimate Reality. Natya magnifies the existence of the supreme, whose grace can be the only liberating force — Mukti. With this perception of world and truth, we have to integrate devotion and worship.

The scripture known as the Narada Bhakti Sutra, propounds eleven forms of Bhakti based on the different relationship to God that the devotee can assume. Prahlada, in Srimad Bhagavatam, enunciates nine expressions of Bhakti, which are Sravanam, Keertanam, Padasevanam, Smaranam, Archanam, Vandanam, Dasyam, Sakhyam and Atmanivedanam. These respectively mean, listening to the praise of the Lord, singing His glory, serving at the lotus feet, remembering Him all the time, offering oblations, propitiating with salutations, serving like an attendant, being a friend and surrendering Self completely.

Adi Sankara, in verse 61 of his Sivanandalahari lists five analogies of Bhakti as well. One can discover the many personalities in oneself and identify with each as one’s own expression.

290,2020/02/20,"Progress painfully slow at Sri Sundara Perumal Temple, Kumbakonam","The ancient temple, near Kumbakonam, has been lying in a state of disrepair for many years

The centuries old Sri Sundara Perumal temple, where the handsome moolavar deity is in a standing posture, has been in a state of disrepair for many years.

Administered by HR & CE Department, the temple has separate niches for Soundara Valli Thayar, Vishwaksenar, Yoga Narasimhar, Kannan, Anjaneyar and Azhwars. Residents, who had seen grand utsavams earlier, say that the Samprokshanam was last performed 80 years ago in 1939.

They recall how the agraharam once buzzed with life. They also reminisce the celebratory atmosphere during Garuda Sevai on Tamil New Year’s day, processions on Krishna Jayanthi, Kanu day in Thai and during Navaratri with horse vahana procession on Vijayadasami. Four-kala pujas, jasmine nandavanam and special alankarams have all been forgotten.

After the passing away, in 2014, of Sundararaja Bhattar, one of the longest serving priests, the condition of the temple further deteriorated. All the utsavams came to a halt and the processional deities were moved to Kumbakonam for ‘safe custody.’ Sundararaja Bhattar’s family was not keen to continue to serve the temple for an abysmally low salary.

Seven years ago, Balalayam was performed and repair works were started. However, it came to a halt with only a couple of Vimanams and the outer walls being painted. The Rajagopuram at the eastern entrance is in poor condition. The Nandavanam that had mango and coconut trees is almost non-existent now. Vahanams are in bad shape because of which processions have been stopped. The temple well needs to be desilted and repaired.

With no water in the premises, daily pujas are not being performed. The madapalli has been shut and no food is offered to the Lord.

It is hoped that the HR & CE Department will take immediate steps to restore the lost glory of the temple.

How to reach

Sundara Perumal Koil is located 10 km west of Kumbakonam on the Thanjavur highway near Papanasam. Buses playing between Kumbakonam and Thanjavur stop near the railway level crossing at Sundara Perumal Koil. There is also a Sundara Perumal Koil railway station.

The burden of proof lies on the accused since the PMLA is a special statute. Interfering with the case at this juncture either by quashing the case or staying further trial proceedings would be premature and unjust, they stated.

Mr. Srinivasan had to prove that he had not committed the crime of money laundering and that can be done only by examination of the evidences presented by the ED, the affidavit said.

292,2020/02/20,Women Alliance seeks resolution against NPR,"Women Alliance Against NPR, a women’s group protesting CAA, NRC and NPR, has urged the Chief Minister K.Chandrasekhar Rao to refuse data collection for National Population Register in the State, and to pass a resolution to that effect in the State Assembly.

Through a press conference on Thursday, members of the alliance also demanded that the police be stopped from interfering in peaceful protests against NPR anywhere in the State. They also sought withdrawal of ll cases filed so far with regard to the protests.

Speaking at the press conference, activists including M.Vimala, K.Sajaya, V.Sandhya, Rama Melkote, Sarah Mathews, Rafia Nausheen, and others called it extremely unfortunate that any expression of protest and dissent in Telangana are being suppressed with deliberate intent, despite the fact that Telangana State itself is a product of vibrant protests.

Prof. Rama Melkote wondered why protests against CAA were being stamped out, even while a resolution has been passed against it by the Assembly. “It reflected the Chief Minister’s intolerance against any voice other than his”.

NPR must be opposed as it is a prelude to NRC, and inability to provide citizenship documents can lead the enumerator to mark the Nationality as ‘doubtful’, said Ms.Sajaya.

Ms.Nausheen sought to question the intent behind Population Census a year before the schedule, and asked the Telangana government to measure up to its commitment to the people of Telangana by refusing NPR. Several states such as Kerala, West Bengal, and Punjab have already passed resolutions against NPR, and Telangana government should follow suit, she demanded.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/women-alliance-seeks-resolution-against-npr/article30873985.ece
293,2020/02/20,Conservation now assured for Thurpu cattle of Amrabad,"It is among 13 indigenous cattle breeds newly recognised by NBAGR

Recent recognition of ‘Poda Thurpu’ cattle as indigenous breed by the ICAR’s National Bureau of Animal Genetic Resources (NBAGR) has its origins in the hunch felt by an activist working in Telangana villages.

The gut feeling of Sabyasachi Das from Watershed Support Services and Activities Network (WASSAN) was shored to its reality through serious efforts by the Telangana State Biodiversity Board. The short and hardy animal typical with brown markings, found only in four mandals in Amrabad Tiger Reserve of Nagarkurnool district, is now one among the 13 indigenous cattle breeds newly recognised by NBAGR.

Also recognised is ‘Vanaraja’, a chicken breed developed by ICAR’s Directorate of Poultry Research.

“We were working with farming community in Doulatabad, Pargi and Bomraspet mandals of the then Rangareddy district, when we first noticed the bullocks. They preferred by the farmers as draught animals for their long endurance in both in black and wet soils,” recalled Mr. Das.

However, he could not find any trace of cows from the same breed. Further enquiries revealed that the farmers had not reared, but only purchased the bulls from Amrabad region where they were endemic.

“The animals are reared in hundreds by the Lambada, Golla and ST communities of Amrabad, Achampet, Lingala and Padra mandals. They are not stall-fed, and owe their strong hooves to grazing in forests and hillocks. Traditionally, the male cattle members are sold off before they mature,” Mr. Das said.

The nomenclature of ‘Poda Thurpu’ too has a history. The cattle is known as ‘Thurpu Bull’ where it was used for farming, indicating its origin on the Eastern side, and as ‘Poda Cattle’ in Amrabad owing to its body markings. After observing that the cattle survived on less fodder and water, Mr.Das has brought it to the notice of the Telangana State Biodiversity Board (TSBB).

Aided by WASSAN and another local NGO, Conservation of Nature through Rural Awakening (CONARE), TSBB launched the process for registration in February 2016. Physical characteristics of the cattle such as height, colour, hump, horn size and others were recorded with much effort. Other details, including traditional knowledge about the breed, were obtained from the local tribes, which were conserving the cattle for the past 400 years.

“It became difficult for them to protect the breed due to aggressive artificial insemination programmes by the Animal Husbandry department,” informed Shilpi Sharma, a scientist from the Board who had worked for the registration.

Requests were made by TSBB to the Animal Husbandry department for halting the programme in 20 villages of the district, home to more than 15,000 animals. Proposals for registration were submitted through the State government about three years ago. Approval came in January last week, and process for registration is on, which will result in conservation of animal through NBAGR’s gene repository.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/n2uz7w/article30873964.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY21PODATHURPUCATTLE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/conservation-now-assured-for-thurpu-cattle-of-amrabad/article30873963.ece

Spread across 4,100 sq ft area, the facility in Kondapur has been created to give a first-hand experience of the social workspace, Chief Operating Officer Anil Mathur said here on Thursday. While it has three Social Office experience centres across the country, there are plans to launch three more in the coming months.

Noting that the company was set to strengthen its presence in the office furniture segment in the southern region, he said Hyderabad and the southern zone market had a large working population. In the office furniture segment, Hyderabad contributed 45% of Godrej Interio’s southern market revenue.

On the concept of Social Office, he said workplaces had transformed into spaces that provide an enjoyable work life as well as the opportunity to socialise with their colleagues during and after work. Based on the insights gained from a recent GodrejInterio Workspace and Ergonomic Research Cell study, the company had developed the concept of Social Office. A social office motivates job satisfaction among employees, thereby improving their overall behaviour and performance, he said.

The market for Social Office, he said, was still at a nascent stage and pegged at ₹200 crore. With an expected growth rate of 12% CAGR, “we expect organisations to soon pick up the trend of Social office in the years to come. It has been a growth driver for us for the overall turnover of ₹1,500 crore in 2019-20 with an expected growth rate of 20% year on year,” he said in a release.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/experience-centre-for-social-office-opened/article30873746.ece

297,2020/02/20,Khammam becoming a hub of spurious seed racket?,"Clandestine operations in Gudimalla mandal expose lapses in surveillance: farmers’ leader

Khammam division, the major chilli-growing belt of Telangana, seems to be fast emerging a hub of well-entrenched inter-state spurious seed racket if the seizure of a huge quantity of spurious chilli seed from an unlicensed seed manufacturing unit at Gudimalla village in Khammam rural mandal by the task force police on Wednesday is any indication.

Acting on a tip-off, a joint team of task force sleuths and officials of the Agricultural department had raided a seed manufacturing unit at Gudimalla near here and confiscated a large number of bags containing “spurious chilli seed” ready for dispatch, sources said.

The team led by the task force wing ACP G Venkat Rao had detained a worker of the unit for questioning and launched a hunt to nab the owner of the unit, who is at large.

The task force personnel handed over the seized materials to the Khammam rural police for investigation.

The owner of the unlicensed unit was suspected to have links with members of some organised gangs involved in sale of spurious seed and adulterated chilli powder in Maharashtra and a few other States, sources said.

The incident comes less than three months after the task force team unearthed an illegal seed packaging unit at Gopalapuram in Tirumalayapalem mandal and seized a huge quantity of spurious seed and chemcial-laced bio-products.

There were other instances where the task force police confiscated adulterated chilli powder at Ayyagaripeta in Sattupalli mandal and at a border village in Madhira mandal in the last few years.

The clandestine operation of the unlicensed seed manufacturing unit at Gudimalla in Khammam Municipal Corporation limits exposed lapses in surveillance, said Telangana Rythu Sangham district secretary M Ramesh.

Chilli farmers bore the brunt of inter-state gangs involved in sale of spurious seed in the past, he said, alleging that spurious seed had taken a toll on several chilli farmers in Madhira and Konijerla mandals in the last season.

The Agriculture department should work in close coordination with law enforcement agencies to curb the spurious seed menace and invoke Preventive Detention (PD) Act against those involved in the illegal trade to save farmers from their nefarious designs, he said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/khammam-becoming-a-hub-of-spurious-seed-racket/article30872306.ece

300,2020/02/20,Rahul and Sonia will lose Indian citizenship soon: Swamy,"‘People taking the citizenship of another country while being an Indian citizen will automatically lose their Indian citizenship’

Former Union Minister and BJP MP Subramanian Swamy has claimed that AICC president Sonia Gandhi and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi will lose their citizenship soon.

“The file is on the Home Minister Amit Shah’s table and soon they will lose their citizenship,” he said while delivering a lecture on “CAA - a historical imperative beyond contemporary politics” at the University of Hyderabad, organised by the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP).

Quoting the Indian Constitution, he said people taking the citizenship of another country while being an Indian citizen will automatically lose their Indian citizenship. He claimed that Rahul Gandhi had opted for British citizenship for starting a business in England.

However, Mr. Gandhi can apply afresh for the citizenship as his father Rajiv Gandhi was an Indian. However, he can’t apply using the credentials of his mother Sonia Gandhi, who he claimed was not an Indian national.

On the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), he said the CAA was not understood properly and those opposing it had not read the Act itself. Indian Muslims are no way affected with this Act and it was ridiculous to argue that Muslims coming from Pakistan and Bangladesh should be considered for citizenship. Pakistan is not allowing Rohingya Muslims to enter their country and here some people want Pakistanis to come here, he commented.

He said minorities in Pakistan and Bangladesh have nowhere to go to escape religious persecution and their only alternative was India. If they are being given citizenship why should anyone have problems, he asked.

304,2020/02/20,Role of traditional food to meet nutritional requirements,"Micro nutrient deficiencies among children and adolescents discussed

The role of traditional food in meeting nutritional requirements was highlighted by Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan at the inauguration of the two-day “Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey: Regional Data Workshop” at the National Institute of Nutrition (NIN) on Wednesday.

Researchers, clinicians and public health professionals from southern states met at the workshop to analyse the data generated through a survey that assessed the magnitude of micro nutrient deficiencies among children and adolescents and risk factors associated with it.

Addressing researchers, Dr. Soundararajan spoke about malnourishment among women and children, misconceptions that lead people not to utilise government schemes to address issues like anaemia, and discrimination against girl child, among others.

Recalling her experience as a house surgeon, Dr. Soundarajan, who is a gynaecologist herself, said that some women threw away iron tablets (of dark colour) assuming that their children would be born dark.

“I used to tell them I am dark too and even if they have dark kids, they will be intelligent,” she said, adding that besides a scientific approach, social issues need to be identified and resolved.

The Governor spoke on malnourishment among children and women even in this era of development.

Explaining the scope and objective of the workshop, Robert Johnston from UNICEF, India, said that it was the time for Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey (CNNS) data that will contribute to policies. “Go through the data, and develop a good understanding of what it includes, its strengths and weaknesses,” he said.

He added that CNNS is cutting-edge research as no previous studies had collected states’ and national level representative data on micro nutrient deficiency from zero to 19 years age range.

Sessions on explaining the data, methods of analysing it, writing papers from CNNS data, how it can be used to find solutions to issues specific to states, and other aspects were organised at the workshop, supported by NIN, Population Council and UNICEF, India.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ti7a8s/article30864786.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYD-TAMILISAI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/role-of-traditional-food-to-meet-nutritional-requirements/article30864771.ece

The Indian government cannot be allowed to compromise with farmers interests, they said, and called upon farmers across the country to stay vigilant and protest against any deal with the US.

Those present included Vemulapalli Venkataramaiah of All India Kisan Mazdoor Sabha, Kiran Kumar Vissa of Rythy Swarajya Vedika, T. Sagar of Telangana Rythu Sangham and leaders of five other organisations.

Fears

They said reports indicated that the US government is pushing for increasing its export of dairy and poultry products into India and reduction of import tariffs on many agricultural products, including apples, almonds and its biggest crops -- maize, cotton, soyabean and wheat.

This would have an adverse impact on crores of farmer families in India who are dependent on them, they said.

They added that the Trump administration had already unilaterally taken a few key steps to the disadvantage of India like removal of Most Favoured Nation status and removal of India as a beneficiary developing nation under its Generalised System of Preference programme.

Irrespective of the rhetoric of the Indian government, the farmers and workers of India do not consider Trump as a friend of India.

So, they said that they are opposed to the red carpet laid out for him.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/farmers-oppose-trade-deal-with-us/article30864582.ece
309,2020/02/20,State govt. keen on engaging with medtech sector,"Common testing lab to come up at Sultanpur; curtain on three-day BioAsia conference

Telangana government is keen on engaging with the medtech sector and as part of this approach has decided to set up a common testing laboratory, in partnership with the industry, at the Medical Devices Park in Sultanpur, Industries and IT Minister K.T. Rama Rao said on Wednesday.

Spread on nearly 280 acres, the park, developed by the government, about 50-km. from Hyderabad, is the largest such in Asia. About 25 companies have signed up to set up units there.

Manufacturing soon

While six of them will be launching manufacturing operations in July, on the same day, stent maker Sahajanand Medical Technologies (SMT) will be commencing operations at what would be Asia’s largest such unit in December.

Besides the common testing facility, the State government has decided to set up an export promotion council for medtech sector in Hyderabad and also champion the causes of the sector, the Minister said after a meeting with the Medical Devices makers at BioAsia 2020.

In an interaction with media, he said among the challenges representatives of medtech sector raised were GST rates and inverted duty structure. One aspect they sought to highlight was, how in the light of the levies, it is cheaper to import than manufacture, something that goes against the concept of Make in India. The sector representatives also underscored the need for quality certification agency for medical devices. The Minister said he assured them that the State government will take up their causes before the Centre.

“I asked them to give me inputs so that I can take them up with relevant [Central] ministries, be it Commerce, Health or Pharma. We will continue to promote this sector by way engaging with them,” he said. On the land available for allotment in Sultanpur park, he said about 80 acres are left, but that should not be a limitation as the facility can be expanded. The objective behind extending support was to improve affordability, accessibility and availability of healthcare, he said.

Land allotment letters

Addressing the valedictory of BioAsia 2020, Mr. Rao said the convention, focused on life sciences sector and in its 17th edition, had grown in size, stature and value. Mr Rao also handed over land allotment letters to 5 MedTech companies who are setting up their units at MedTech Park in Hyderabad.

He also presented awards to five successful start-up companies that were selected from over 75 short-listed companies and over 350 applications received. As part of the start-up stage event, the top five start-ups -- Lycan 3D, Callzy, Oncosimis Biotech, Heamac Healthcare, Flexmotiv Technologies -- showcased their solutions.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/87sijl/article30864570.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY20BIOASIA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/state-govt-keen-on-engaging-with-medtech-sector/article30864571.ece
310,2020/02/20,"Notices to Home Secretary, DGP","PIL petition alleges police depriving people of right to protest

The Telangana High Court on Wednesday ordered notices to the Principal Home Secretary and the Director General of Police in a PIL petition which stated that police were depriving people of right to protest by not permitting demonstrations, public meetings and rallies.

A division bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A. Abhishek Reddy passed the direction after hearing a plea filed by a retired IAS officer and another person stating that police were imposing unreasonable restrictions on public meetings and deliberately delaying according permissions to public meetings.

The bench directed the Home Secretary and the Director General of Police to file a detailed counter affidavit on the matter in three weeks.

In a related development, Justice T. Vinod Kumar of the High Court on Wednesday asked the Principal Home Secretary and the DGP to frame guidelines over permitting public meetings, rallies and protest programmes.

While hearing a writ petition filed by Raza-E-Ilahi Foundation seeking direction to police to permit a Mushaira programme being organised by it protesting the Citizenship Amendment Act, the judge observed that of late several petitions seeking judicial intervention over permitting meetings are being filed.

Observation homes

The division bench issued notices to Chief Secretary, Principal Secretaries of Home and Women and Child Welfare, Director General of Prisons and others to place before it a report on the condition of observation homes in the State.

The bench passed the direction while hearing a PIL plea on the facilities and conditions of homes for children and observation homes in Karimnagar district.

The Karimnagar District Sessions Court Judge earlier wrote a letter on this matter. The letter was taken up as PIL petition by the bench. A senior lawyer brought to the notice of the bench that petitions with similar content were earlier heard by the High Court and that senior lawyer D. Prakash Reddy was appointed amicus curiae in those matters. The bench instructed the High Court registry to tag the PIL plea with those petitions. The matter was posted to April 15 for next hearing.

Lake construction works

Responding to a PIL plea on construction works undertaken in Full Tank Level areas of Hussainsagar, the division bench instructed the Chief Secretary, Principal Secretary of Municipal Administration, Commissioners of GHMC and HMDA to file a detailed counter affidavit on the matter.

The Pollution Control Board, HMWS&SB and Hyderabad District Collector were also made parties in the petition.

The High Court received a letter stating a road is being laid in the vicinity of Hussainsagar and that this would affect storm water drainage and other civic systems in the city.

The bench took up the letter as PIL petition and passed the direction. It appointed senior lawyer L. Ravi Chander as amicus curiae in the plea and asked him to physically verify the area and present a report.

311,2020/02/20,AI research centre formally launched,"An Applied AI Research Centre for Mobility and Healthcare, which is an initiative involving IIIT-Hyderabad, chipmaker Intel, Indian Institute of Public Health (IIPH) and Telangana government, was formally launched by Industries and IT Minister K.T.Rama Rao here on Wednesday.

The facility, already operational and set to be located at the IIIT-H campus, is likely to see an investment of around ₹500 crore over the next five years with a good chunk of that made by Intel.

Noting that the investment to be made in the facility were yet to be finalised, Ramesh Loganthan, Professor at IIIT-H, said the centre is a continuation of the work being undertaken by Intel in the area of mobility with the IIIT-H. The objective behind the new initiative is to extend the cooperation to the area of healthcare.

“Intel has been supporting some of the initiatives on the mobility side. They wanted to do something bigger,” he said, adding IIPH and government would play important role in the project. The underlying objectives were to look at different aspects of healthcare in terms of improving access of people, stressing on preventive healthcare and contributing to policy-making.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ai-research-centre-formally-launched/article30864543.ece
312,2020/02/20,Gully Boy and desi hip-hop,"About a year ago, the music world was agog with talk of how Indian hip-hop would rise from being an underground genre to a mainstream one. On February 15 2019, Zoya Akhtar’s film Gully Boy was released, and the songs ‘Apna Time Aayega’, ‘Mere Gully Mein’ and ‘Asli Hip-Hop’ stormed the charts. Based on the lives of Mumbai rappers Divine and Naezy, the film clicked, and the mass audience became aware of the intricacies of the hip-hop sub-culture. The buzz lasted a couple of months, but did it sustain itself? Today, a year later, is the genre actually a mainstream movement as one predicted?

Genre on the rise

To begin with, the film did succeed in increasing the audience for Indian hip-hop, especially gully rap, which evolved from slums or small neighbourhoods. People became familiar with the street language, the concept of dissing rivals, brawls and emotions associated with this style. T-shirts with the dictum ‘Apna Time Aayega’ are a still a common sight. Listeners took to YouTube and streaming platforms to check out Divine, Naezy, Badshah, Honey Singh, Raftaar and Emiway Bantai. Badshah claims his 2018 song ‘She Move It Like’ attracted 285 million YouTube views and ‘Paagal’ had 220 million. Detractors will insist that a large chunk of these are ‘paid’ views.

Promoters pushed the genre, either through recordings or live shows. VYRL Originals, the non-film division of Universal Music India, hyped up Divine's album Kohinoor. Big Bang Records, a joint venture between Sony Music and entertainment agency Kwan, released Naezy’s Maghreb. Azadi Records put out albums by Kashmiri rapper Ahmer and Mumbai’s urban hip-hop act Tienas. Newer artistes came out with singles, and got noticed. The genre was analysed in seminars like ‘All About Music’ and ‘Music Inc’. The Dharavi Dream Project has continued its quest in finding rappers, beatboxers and emcees. Rolling Stone India and Qyuki teamed up to create Haq Se Hindustan live shows and Haq Se Bolo podcasts. Basically, there was an increase in action.

A long journey

Still, a year later, the genre faces a few challenges. With public memory being short and new releases coming in, the impact created by the Gully Boy music was temporary. Secondly, though there were rappers in India since the early 1990s, the actual movement began only recently, two decades after it became a craze in the US. Naturally, there were comparisons with international stars.

Industry observers say a major problem is that the target age comprises those below 25. This restricts the audience, unlike Indipop or folk-fusion, which attract wider age segments. Many youngsters also prefer electronic dance music or independent artistes, and their tastes evolve with time. Divine, Badshah and producer Sez On The Beat may be celebrities within the genre, but it will be difficult for them to get the mass attention of Daler Mehndi, Lucky Ali or Indian Ocean.

Finally, barring Badshah’s claims, there have hardly been any megahits in 2019. The albums by Divine and Naezy fared moderately. Some great tracks - like Ahmer’s ‘Little Kid, Big Dreams’ and Bengaluru rapper Brodha V’s ‘Vaishnava Jan To’ - had less than two million YouTube views. Many wannabes entered too, but that’s natural when a genre suddenly gets mileage.

A few developments took place last week. Divine released the video of ‘Gandhi Money’, from his album Kohinoor. The initial response has been positive. Secondly, Gully Boy shared the Filmfare best music award with Kabir Singh, and Divine and Ankur Tiwari got best lyrics awards for ‘Apna Time Aayega’. Though the latter award seemed shocking for many, this should lead to a short-term revival of the Gully Boy soundtrack, that is if, Zee Music Company uses the opportunity.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/13153z/article30872985.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21bm-music-cilumn,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/gully-boy-and-desi-hip-hop/article30872987.ece
313,2020/02/20,Musicians from six countries to come together for Chennai’s Global Isai Festival,"About 30 artistes from six countries will be performing in Chennai, Pune and Mumbai over the next two weekends. As Global Isai Festival spreads to another State this year, here’s what to expect

The song of his people

Lildami is upbeat about the hip hop scene in Spain. And isn’t talking about just his music, popular though he is.

The genre, which picked up in Spain in the late 1970s-early 1980s, has been constantly evolving, says the artiste who has been putting his music out since 2017 and is already two full-fledged albums old. “Hiphop, as all genres are, is healthy only if it is constantly changing. Luckily, it’s style has a great number of variations and sub-genres. Right now, in Spain you can find an artist who is tailored to your taste, and that’s amazing. We recommend to check Mi Amargo, Rels B, Recycled J, C Tangana, 31FAM, PAWN Gang...” he lists out via email.

We are excited about JANSKI Beeeats, a DJ from France who combines his talents for electro music and illustration, creating a surreal experience that is as visual as it is musical

Castle In Time Orchestra from Israel, who blend classical music with electronica to put together some powerful performances

Shan Vincent De Paul, a Tamil/Canadian rapper whose performance in the Chennai leg of GIF is part of his début India tour

Lildami’s own sound is light and upbeat and has a tinge of the electronic, though he states that it is primarily hiphop with some influence from “Catalan music and Latin sounds.” It is a sound he is excited to be debuting in India with GIF — “We are so excited to have the chance to show our music and sounds in a part of the world that doesn’t even speak our language; but music is a universal language.”

The tabla is universal

Three countries have influenced the music of Subhash Dhunoohchand, who has taken his signature blend of electronic music and tabla to cities around the world, from Sydney to Nairobi.

“I was born in Mauritius; my father was a folk singer in Hindi and Bhojpuri. I grew up with his music as well as western music broadcast on TV and radio,” says Subhash, who settled at the age of 24 in Reunion Island. Though a French overseas island, Reunion’s Maloya folk music is distinct unto itself, and has influenced the Carnatic-trained Tablatronics (his stage name) as much as his “confrontation” with jazz and blues has.

“My guru, Pt Sudhir Kumar Saxena wanted me to practise and teach the music in its purity but at the same time told me to adapt my playing according to my audience. Playing in most jazz and folk festivals of the island has changed my approach towards music as a tabla player,” he says, “Maloya is a form of music, song and dance native to Reunion Island. It was created by Malagasy and African slaves on the sugar plantations and was later coloured by indentured workers from India.”

Proudly Chennai

Founded on this vast musical heritage, Tablatronics’ experimental structures of inviting ambient EDM and crisp tabla rhythms stand strong and cohesive. They have held their own in collaborations with Rakesh Chaurasia, L Shankar and Sivamani, among others. With GIF, the Chennai regular is excited to take his music to Mumbai and Pune as well. “Tabla is one of the most natural instruments that can interact with any kind of music,” he says.

Folksy existentialism

A celestial shopkeeper, some wistful regrets, the tired tears of a woman drained. Swarathma’s songs are as philosophical as they are personal, aided by a signature evocative, yet soothing folksy music that is recognisable to fans across the country.

At GIF, the Bengaluru-based band is doing what they have only done twice before: accompanying their music with creative visuals. Guitarist Jishnu Dasgupta elaborates: “An LED screen will have contextual visuals for each song, including photographs, lyrics and artwork.”

It is the latter that is most intriguing — it features two-page spreads from a comic book made by artists from the Ghost Animation Collective, released along with Swarathma’s latest album Raah-e-Fakiri.

But that is not the only thing the band is gung-ho about. Recognised for their socially relevant (and sometimes political) content, a lot of the band’s songs still hold in society as it stands today, with all its political and social contentions. “Songs we wrote in 2009 are relevant today. We are excited to be playing in a time like this.”

In Chennai, Global Isai Festival will be underway from February 21 to 23 at Phoenix MarketCity, Velachery. It will be inaugurated by Minister for Tamil Development, Culture and Archaeology, K Pandiarajan, director of Alliance Francaise of Madras, Bruno Plasse, and Dewan to the Prince of Arcot, Mohammed Asif Ali.

Entry is free and open to all.

314,2020/02/20,Charmers for planet earth,"Working towards traditional skill building and conservation of intangible heritage, the Centre for New Perspectives organised a performance of eight snake-charmers in New Delhi

At sunset on a chilly winter day, under an aged banyan tree in the Gandhi King Plaza at the India International Centre (IIC), the haunting sound of the been once again resounded last week. There were in an orchestra eight snake-charmers four with the been and four others playing the percussion tumba. They played folk euphonies from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Bengal that were melodies on water, earth, trees, nature, and wind. A large crowd gathered and swayed, only to be interrupted by the act of an amazing larger than life Bahurupiya (impersonator) Shamshad Khan as a djinn. He was the sutradhar (anchor). The actor who splendidly strung the show with sharp satirical commentary and multiple character roles to highlight the theme “Music for Climate Action”.

The stars conspired to create a beautiful evening where the talent on display matched the stunning beauty of the fading sunlight that filtered through the dense canopy of the tree under which the artists performed.

The performance was the finale of the two-month skill-building programme by the Delhi-based NGO Centre for New Perspectives (CNP). Said its director Shailaja Kathuria, “Our project ‘Tama Show’ is working with marginalised, traditional folk performers to connect them with existing markets. The larger objective is addressing preventing traditional skill displacement and conservation of intangible heritage.”

Well-known flautist, Rajat Prasanna, who worked with the been performers said, “The snake-charmers have their traditional songs. My approach to skill upgrading was multi-pronged. Music for climate action immediately was about making them conscious of their power as snake-charmers. They are organically naturalists. And I am hoping to connect their talent to fill a present demand – music for environmental awareness. They have an ear for music but are not formally trained like classical musicians. It was important to widen their repertoire, teach them systems to play together in different tonal scales, and to keep them in the folk music frame.”

Affinity with nature

Such is their affinity with nature that even a small movement in the air, says Sapera Jagdeesh, “the pattas (leaves) in our been move and she becomes disturbed and out of tune.” The oldest of the group, Sapera Shisha Nath just before the concert interacted with a CNP volunteer to display the manner he grew a special gourd, collected wax from the beehive in the forest, along with the bamboo to craft the been. Says Narayan and Sheru Nath, “All our skills revolve around snakes. As craftsmen, we make our instrument, we are musicians, we have deep knowledge of herbs to cure snakebite and are taught to identify snakes. But with the snakes gone, we now sometimes play in government shows like the Surajkund Mela, or marriages.”

Experimental percussionist Makrand Sanon worked with the tumba percussionist player. “Like the been, the tumba, called a talking drum, is also made of gourd. The idea was to upgrade tumba players by teaching them several warm-up exercises and simple rhythmic variations. Gradually, I taught them the art of accompanying the been with those variations. It was challenging.” He was assisted by percussionist Rahul Sharma.

Conservation of skills

The project was funded by the Ministry of Culture, Government of India, the venue for training given by the Alliance Francaise and the performance organised by the India International Centre. The most important part of the project was the launch of two self-help groups – Sadabahar Snake-Charmers Orchestra managed by Snake-charmer Mahipal Chauhan and the Bahurupiya Bahu Kala Mandali managed by Bahurupiya Shamshad Khan.

To ensure the conservation of all the knowledge skills of snake-charmers CNP is proceeding to create a programme for the children of the snake-charmers. For the moment the Snake-charmer orchestra will perform with composers and their gurus – Rajat Prasanna and Makrand Sanon.

The group hopes to widen the relevance of the Orchestra by facilitating collaboration with international musicians for Music for Climate Action. Economist Dr. Rajat Kathuria, Chief Executive of Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations says, “Climate change, air pollution, inequality, monopolies to name a few are both a cause and outcome of markets working badly or not at all. So when you see targeted efforts to address one of the glaring market failures of our times i.e. the lack of sustainable and productive livelihood opportunities for marginalised communities, you feel optimism is warranted.”",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/8vqlk/article30870593.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Image,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/charmers-for-planet-earth/article30870594.ece
315,2020/02/20,This Malayalam music video on post-partum depression sends a positive message for new mothers,"‘Jananya’ sensitively depicts the overwhelming feeling of helplessness and despondency that some mothers have to overcome to enjoy motherhood

In most situations, mum is the word when it comes to dealing with post-partum depression. While there are several songs about the charms of motherhood, the depression that some new mothers have to deal with has rarely been discussed in our films or music. However, ‘Jananya...’, launched last week, sensitively depicts the overwhelming feeling of helplessness and despondency that some mothers have to overcome to enjoy motherhood.

Sung melodiously by Gouri Sreekumar and Gireesan AC, the song, written by Din nath Puthenchery and composed by Pratik Abhyankar has been visualised by Anand Anilkumar. Anand, an assistant director of Driving Licence and Underworld, says that he had been planning a music video for some time to make an independent work but he did not want it to be on the lines of the romantic numbers seen aplenty in social media. That was when his wife, Soni Sunil, suggested they make a music video on post-partum depression. “My wife knew a friend who had gone through this and she also knew that there were many new mothers who struggled with this issue,” says Anand.

Anand liked the idea and he and cinematographer Raam H Puthren met several doctors and young mothers to get a comprehensive idea of how to go about it. Once they were ready with the facts Anand got in touch with Din nath, another friend of his and Pratik’s. “Jananya means earth. And once the concept was ready what made it easy was that we are all friends and so everything quickly fell into place. Even the actors, Mridula Madhav and Jain K Paul, are our friends and so the shoot was over in a day’s time,” says Anand. The video has been edited by Basodh T Baburaj.

It was the relevance of the theme that struck a chord with Pratik as well. He says that instead of the fluffy music videos, he was happy to have got a chance to work on a theme that went beyond romance. Gouri says she was instructed by Pratik to empathise with the new mother and sing accordingly. “So the song begins on a sad note and it is when they seek help that we sense the mood changing,” she says.

The visuals show a celebration as a young mother walks into her house with her newborn. But amidst all the smiling faces, the mother’s face is filled with sorrow and confusion. Her weeping bouts go unnoticed till her husband stumbles upon her anguish and decides to break the silence and seek help. “That is what we wanted to convey. ‘Speak up, seek help, you are not alone’. Ever since it was released, we have been getting positive vibes from all those who have heard the song and seen the video. Maybe the likes we get might be a little slow in coming but I would not have it any other way,” says Anand.

It has been produced by Mom Premium Women’s Hospital in Edappally.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/g9alw6/article30870064.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21tvmJasnanya1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/this-malayalam-music-video-on-post-partum-depression-sends-a-positive-message-for-new-mothers/article30870065.ece
316,2020/02/20,Singer Gayatri Asokan on her journey in music,"After accomplishing a smooth transition from singing playback to ghazals, Gayatri Asokan says she wants to create a body of work that will stand the test of time

Gayatri Asokan is on song. ‘Tasavvur’, a ghazal sung by Gayatri and Jazim Sharma and featuring sitar maestro Purbayan Chatterjee, is a treat for fans of ghazals as the singers weave aural magic with their soulful music and superb rendering. Poet Zeeshan Niazi’s verses have been scored by Hyderabad-based ghazal singer Ramavtar Dayama. The single, released recently, has been garnering superlatives from leading musicians like Shaan, Taufiq Qureshi, Suresh Wadkar and Richa Sharma and, naturally, Gayatri is on a high.

“To make it as a ghazal singer on the national scene has always been my dream and now it is coming true,” she says over phone from Mumbai.

For the last three years, Gayatri, who made a mark as an award-winning playback singer in Malayalam, has been making herself heard on the ghazal circuit as a singer to look out for. Two years ago, Pankaj Udhas had released ‘Ghazal Gaze’, her album of ghazals. ‘Suna hai log’, one of the compositions in that album, became a hit and gave her a firm footing on the ghazal circuit.

“Poet Ahmed Faraz’s ‘Suna hai log’ has been doing extremely well. It has got more than three lakh views on YouTube without any kind of promotion from my side. It became my calling card in North India. Whenever I perform in Delhi, I get requests to perform that ghazal. And in Pakistan, leading singers have done covers of the same composition. That one ghazal has got its due in terms of recognition,” she says happily.

In addition, last year and the year before that, she was invited to perform for the Jashn-e-Rekhta, a three-day annual Urdu festival in Delhi, one of the prestigious cultural events in the national capital. The only South Indian to be invited for the programme, she recalls how she was able to strike a chord with the packed audience at the Major Dhyan Chand National Stadium in Delhi.

“Vishal Bhardwaj, Javed Akhtar, Shabana Azmi, Nooran Sisters, Warsi brothers... it was a big honour for me to be featured with these greats. I was given a one-hour slot and I got good reviews after my concerts. I could not believe it myself because it is not easy for a South Indian to make the grade at such events. I sang my original ghazal ‘Suna hai log...’. Now, every other month, I have a ghazal concert in Delhi,” she says.

Gayatri was also featured in the Urdu Heritage Festival in Delhi last year. Organised by the government of Delhi, the ghazal concerts held in connection with the festival has a galaxy of ghazal singers. “And on December 31, 2019, I had a concert at the India International Habitat Centre. It was a poetry-based festival where I sang one ghazal each from the repertoire of great poets such as Ghalib, Iqbal, Parveen Shahir and so on.”

Although the singer has been missing from the film music industry in Kerala for some time, clearly she has been extremely busy on the ghazal circuit and winning plaudits for her music. As she points out, she moved to Mumbai three years ago after her marriage to Purbayan and since then Gayatri has been focussed on ghazals.

“For 20 years of my career, I have almost always participated in film-based concerts only. I am thankful to God for giving me these new opportunities,” she says.

In the meantime, Gayatri’s home videos of her jamming with her husband went viral and was noticed by greats like Hariharan. She recalls with a giggle how she became tongue-tied when Hariharan complimented her on her singing. “Zakirji (Zakir Hussain) also had seen some of the videos of my songs that my husband had shared on his Twitter account. Thanks to his generosity, it got noticed. Purbayan is also my biggest critic and that is why I am improving every day. I sit with his students and learn from him. Initially, I used to be inhibited because it is not easy learning from him. It is really tough because the sitar is much more complex than vocal music, I feel. Rhythmically, it is much more evolved than vocal music. Once, I started sitting with his students and learning from Purbayan, I realised I was a big zero. Moreover, he has given me some valuable tips. One important tip is that ‘what makes a maestro a maestro is not just his skill. It is the conviction he has’. Conviction is such an important thing in music,” she explains.

She points out that in Mumbai, all the reputed ghazal singers take a song and own it. “For that, you need courage. In Mumbai, the training and encouragement is there for singers to make a song their own. That is why there is such a huge pool of talent. This large pool of talent is there in Kerala too. Unfortunately, the problem is that when you have done playback all the time, you are taught to believe that you should only faithfully reproduce what has been taught to you. The scope for improvisations is quite limited. So, in Kerala, new talents that come up end up being fantastic singers but they are encouraged to be clones of the original, so you can’t own a song. Young singers are not encouraged to improvise and even if they do it, it is ignored,” she adds.

Creating own music

According to Gayatri, that kind of unfettered improvisation is found among bands such as Masala Coffee, Thaikkudam Bridge and others. Calling them torchbearers, she avers that they are the singers of the future.

“Young singers like (KS) Harisankar are super talented, capable of improvising and completely thinking out of the box and doing their own stuff. That ability should be applauded instead of making the singers dependent on playback alone. You should come out and create your own music for posterity. Otherwise, there is such a clutter of singers and nobody knows who has sung what. At present, once a song releases, its lifespan is extremely short. In such a scenario, I feel that to make a long-term impact, you have to create your own songs.”

As she has been busy with her ghazal recitals, Gayatri says she has not been worrying or thinking about playback singing. Her focus is to carve a niche of her own in the ghazal world and compose her own body of work. “This is not something I have ever hoped for. Since I have been given a chance, I want to concentrate, create a space for myself and also create a body of work that will stand the test of time,” she says.

At present, she is working on three more independent ghazals. British pianist Rekesh Chauhan and Gayatri tune in for a composition by Parveen Shakir. Then there is one with Gujarati singer-composer Alap Desai and a duet with Prithvi Gandharv.

“People once thought ghazals were a dying art. But actually it is the young people who are lapping up the new ghazals and coming with cover versions and sharing it on social media. Now, I make it a point to include my originals in my concerts,” she says. Gayatri hopes that in two or three years, she will have a repertoire of original compositions.

“For instance, even today, when I do Malayalam programmes, I have a handful of songs that people enjoy and want to listen to though I am not a happening singer in Malayalam film music. I feel good that they still remember those gems such as ‘Deenadayalo Rama’, ‘Pularumo’, ‘Chanchadi’ ... My wish is to have a similar collection of timeless ghazals too,” she signs off.

Gayatri will be performing at India International Center, New Delhi, at 7 pm, February 21.

317,2020/02/20,Double delight,"Puspa Panda and Sharanya Chandran impressed with their unhurried grace and sound training at the IIC’s Double Bill Concert

Usually, at India International Centre’s Double Bill Concerts, one dancer edges out the other. However, this time, both the performers – Odissi exponent Puspa Panda and Bharatanatyam dancer Sharanya Chandran – gave superlative performances.

While the lithe and lucid Puspa was everything an Odissi dancer is expected to be, Sharanya breathed life and beauty into the linear structure of her form, making the traditional repertoire quite absorbing to the audience.

Puspa exuded grace with excellent mukhabhinaya (facial expressions) in the two lengthy pieces she chose to present in the first half of the evening, on Krishna and Shabari. Both songs had their singular charm and demanded divergent emotional response. The artiste rose to the occasion, in fact, excelled in bringing alive the shringara rasa as well as the devotion (bhakti) from two different protagonists who stood apart in their distinctive ages.

While the Krishna dance, spiced as it was, with footwork delineations tickled the viewer with its romantic sensitivity, the flow of devotion from an aged tribal woman Shabari coupled with Ram’s immeasurable compassion took the dance to a different level.

Puspa Panda

Simple gesticulations and matching expressions like the gopi (Radha) shuddering at being unaware of an invisible Krishna closing her eyes from behind and then the bashful yet happy looks on realising her beloved, the surreptitious look before untangling her anklets one after the other are some laudable instances worked out with care to detail and creativity. The Shabari piece juxtaposed the divine Ram with the devotee. Puspa made for an arresting picture of Ram kneeling down (with back to the audience) stringing his bow and slowly heaving himself up to the eulogising verse being recited in the background.

Emulating a hunched and tottering Shabari plucking forest fruits and gathering them in her basket, the dancer most convincingly picturised the devotee’s utter dismay at seeing the lord who so far only resided in her heart, live in front of her. The surprise and joy-giving way to ecstasy was brought out by the artiste with aplomb. Smearing herself all over with the dust from the feet of her lord, Shabari’s offering of the fruit to him was done in great detail so as to attribute credibility to the depth of bhakti that could arise in a simple tribal woman. The concluding ‘tann namami Ramachandram...’ refrain once again depicted the physical and divine attributes of lord Rama with clarity and diversity in expression. The blue costume was apt for the theme.

The Arthanareeswar invocation was an unexpected opening to Sharanya Chandran’s Bharatanatyam recital, which formed the second half of the evening. Though it started with Adi Sankara’s verse, the artiste expounded Vidyapathi’s ‘jaya jaya Shankara, jaya tripurari..’ composition with vigorous footwork balanced with lucid expressions. The dancer captured the varying energies of Shiva and Shakti principles – the feminine grace of Shakti as opposed to the masculinity of Shiva with a seamless shift of stances and gestures in quick succession.

The entire performance was done in an unhurried fashion even while keeping to the pace of the taal and not losing out a split second. In fact, the hallmark of Sharanya’s dance was this unique quality of unhurried grace, a sort of an artistic pause before going on to the next verse of the song along with rigour in execution of footwork with a smile that never left her face as she navigated through nritta with jati patterns.

The varnam was evocative. She handled it with such ease and elan that it turned out to be the most interesting piece to watch. The visual impact was stupendous. The footwork following each stanza either to mnemonics or swara was not complex but was well laid out with the last jati pattern being the best. The content of the varnam as well as the ‘ninda stuti’ that followed (Vidyapathi composition) were in keeping with the theme of love.

Guru Geeta Chandran on the nattuvangam was compelling. K.Venkateswaran on the vocals, Raghavendra Prasath on the violin and Manohar Balakrishnan on the mridangam were a complimenting orchestra.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/6yowzj/article30869808.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/USV5863,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/double-delight/article30869811.ece
318,2020/02/20,Hyderabad-based Ekansh Agarwal aka BLITHE bats for ‘old school’ equipment,"BLITHE explains why music is in his blood and how ‘old school’ equipment still has pull

“In the past couple of years, quite a few people have come up to me with assumptions that, as an artiste, because I play a bunch of different shows and that I’m going from city to city, that I am constantly surrounded by alcohol and women, and that my life is one continuous party of fun,” laughs Ekansh Agarwal, a music producer and DJ, “but I want to make people understand that this is far from the big picture. What they see is about 20% of what DJs and music producers do. They don’t realise that what they enjoy for an hour, we are preparing for about a week in advance. This is serious work, getting your gear right, understanding the venue, etcetera.”

Ekansh, aka BLITHE, has been in the DJ-ing game for more than six years, but does not have any original music out at the moment.

He specialises in Progressive music and prefers people come see him perform live and given he is a regular on the live set circuit, it is possible. In fact, BLITHE often plays at Prism Bar & Kitchen — is most recent set was just this past Sunday for their Synth Sets. He also has a day job of sorts, he says, and it involves running shows at clubs like Prism as well as exclusive pop-ups. “It keeps me involved during the daytime hours too,” he chuckles, as having an active schedule is a priority for him. “You have to keep pushing yourself because it’s so easy to procrastinate.”

BLITHE’s music set up is very basic, he says. “Right now I’m playing on all the CDJs and the CD players on the mixer so it’s not really anything digital, it’s mostly just software. I think that’s what keeps my sets versatile and grabbing attention.”

It is clear that music is in his blood, “My grandfather and grandmother come from a very musical background; they know how to play quite a few instruments so there is always a good atmosphere at home which fosters musical passion. My grandmother would sit me down and have me understand the creative medium. I tried to learn a couple instruments when I was younger but I didn’t really follow through. I can play a few chords on the guitar and maybe a few notes on the keys. Ekansh does not remember his first set but he can recall the feelings of nervousness which still come up today ahead of a live set. “The first time, I was so nervous, my hands were shaking before I could even hit ‘play’, but it is a good experience because halfway through, my confidence kicked in.”

When there was no scene...

Six and a half years in the business has shown Ekansh a world of changes in the city’s live music scene for sure. “I remember when there was no music scene at all, only a clubbing scene. It was mostly the same kind of music and whoever was doing something alternative didn’t get as much pull.” Of course, things are different now as musical revolutions are better embraced. Over time, Ekansh’s inclinations evolved too and it reflected a lot in his journey.

If you go online, hunting for a Soundcloud or Bandcamp page by BLITHE, think again. He explains that his original music is undergoing approval with record labels, but expect something out within the next few months.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/gg84bi/article30869758.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy19-blithe1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/hyderabad-dj-blithe-ekansh-agarwal-progressive-music/article30869760.ece
319,2020/02/20,Homage to the master,"The winter chill has given way to a spring of Carnatic concerts in Delhi-NCR

It’s that time of the year in the National Capital Region where various organisations pay their homage to the legendary saint composer Tyagaraja. Aradhana festivals, organised to celebrate the music composer, invariably culminate with group rendering of his famous Pancharatna krithis. The scene recently in the neighbouring Noida was no different.

On a chilly evening, the Ramakrishnapuram South Indian Society in association with the Vedic Prachar Sansthan, Noida paid homage to Tyagaraja which culminated in a group rendition of Pancharatna krithis led by the Delhi-based Guruvayur Dr. T.V. Manikandan and his disciples. The programme was organised in the under-construction Sri Vinayaka and Karthikeya temple complex, Noida.

After presenting an invocation song to Lord Ganesha, Manikandan and his students regaled the audience during their rendition of the Pancharatna krithis, namely, “Jagadananda Karaka” (Natai), Duduku gala (Goula), Sadhinchane (Arabhi), Kanakana Ruchira (Varali) and Endaro Mahanubhavulu (Shree Ragam). The synchronised manner in which the krithis were rendered was another noteworthy feature.

G. Ragavendra Prasaath on the violin and Elanthoor Jayan P. Das on the mridangam ably supported Manikandan and his group.

At another venue, the Shankar Mutt in Noida, Jyothi Sridevi led the group rendition of Pancharatna krithis in a delightful manner under the aegis of Vishnu Sahasranama Satsangam, Noida. Being the Silver Jubilee year of the Satsangam, a grand three-day event titled ‘Radha Krishna Kalyana Mahotsavam’ was organised. Another highlight of the event was the “Villu Pattu”, an ancient form of musical storytelling.

Using this form, the story of Jayadeva who lived in the 12th century and who composed ashtapatis (sung in Radha Kalyanam) was depicted brilliantly. Though it was an ‘in-house’ production by the members of the Satsangam, the professional manner in which the members performed was a scintillating experience.

Elsewhere in the Capital, Carnatic music concerts seem to be picking up with the winter season slowly waning away. Charanya Lakshmikumaran during the monthly concert series of Delhi Tamil Sangam delighted the music fans in a well structured vocal recital.

In two speeds

She began her concert in a befitting manner with the ata tala varnam “Sarasijanbha” in the raga Khambhoji in two speeds. She sang Papanasam Sivan’s “Ranganai Thudipporku” in the raga Chakravakam, a song not heard frequently in concerts, in a delightful manner. The virutam that preceded the song and the kalpanaswaras that succeeded the rendering were indicative of her creative talent at the early stages of the concert.

Not only did Charanya took up two songs for detailed presentations, namely Tyagaraja’s “Nagumomo” in Abheri and Swati Tirunal’s “Pankaja Lochana” in Kalyani, she also did adequate justice to these songs.

G. Raghavendra Prasaath who provided violin support played a delightful alpana of the ragas Abheri and Kalyani. J. Vignesh on the mridangam and Sriram on the ghatam paired together to provide able percussion support in the concert. Besides, the duo’s tani avartanam in Misra Chappu tala was engaging.

On the whole, a concert that reflected the hard work of the vocalist but Charanya should desist from consulting her notebook while singing.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/werufv/article30869632.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Charanya-Lakshmikumaran-1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/homage-to-the-master/article30869633.ece
320,2020/02/20,The joys of a spiritual journey,"Listening to Aruna Sairam makes one realise that the human voice is probably the most revealing musical instrument

The VSK Baithak, known for its inclination towards Hindustani music, offered a melodious surprise recently when Sangeet Kalanidhi Aruna Sairam regaled the hard-core Hindustani music rasikas with a Carnatic music concert at the Godrej Hall of the WWF in New Delhi. The resonant timbre of her unique voice with impeccable ‘Shruti Shuddhata’ (accurate alignment of the Shruti) and the dazzling range of repertoire comprising the multi-hued bouquet, with the boundless expanse of the raga lying beneath each intuitive breath, left the audience spellbound. Listening to her made one realise that the human voice is probably the most revealing musical instrument that communicates magic, illusion, surrender and several other elements that are part of a spiritual journey.

She shares her opinion on constructing a (Carnatic) concert, “The artist meets the audience in a typical day-to-day life situation where all of us are struggling in a hundred and one things. The listeners leave their work places, get ready and come to a concert. It takes time to settle down, so we don’t plunge into the main deep raga elaboration right in the beginning. We take you, instead, gradually from one level to the next, quietly deepening the quality of ragas and compositions before the detailed and intuitively improvised Ragam Tanam Pallavi comprising a detailed aalap. Then we proceed to the nom tom of tanam followed by the elaboration of the lyrical content and a sawal-jawab by the percussionists, tapering back to lighter pieces before concluding the musical fare with a thillana sort of piece.

Her mother Smt Rajlakshmi was her first guru who initiated her into Carnatic classical at a tender age and made her remember by rote, the eternal compositions of the Carnatic Trinity – Tyagaraj, Muthuswami Dikshitar and Shyama Shastri. Also, the innumerable Sanskrit shlokas and devotional chants that she renders with effortless ease. Sangeet Kalanidhi T. Brinda groomed her further in the style of her own mother and guru, the great Veena Dhanammal. Her own approach to music is enriched by her exposure to the best of the Hindustani and Western music but it is perhaps her own sensitivity which has given her music its own signature and fragrance.

No dilution

The concert in Delhi also showcased her integrity, because it was not diluted to please the Hindustani music lovers and offered an authentic taste of Carnatic classical where she helped them appreciate and enjoy it. Opening with a Bhairavi Varnam, resembling the architectural structure of a temple Gopuram, she went on to sing a Thyagaraja kriti in raga Chandrajyoti with the vivadi (discordant) notes, the Hindustani music ears are not used to. She explained there are vivadi swaras in this raga, too close to each other, hence, perceptibly, the first impression will not be pleasing, but it has been composed in such a way that gradually it grows on you.

There was a beautifully rendered Tyagaraja composition in raga Mohana-Kalyani, similar to Hindustani Shuddha-Kalyan and an Adi Shankaracharya sloka for Shri Ranganath in Brindavana Sarang before she went on to present the centrepiece, the detailed ragam tanam pallavi in raga Shanmukhapriya, with the lyric very aptly evoking Shanmukha (Kartikeya), the son of Shiva. A contrasting Kshetragna Padam came thereafter accentuating the viraha (separation) aspect of Shringar where the yearning to meet the beloved reached the limit of vilap, wailing.

Ecstasy of devotion

The ecstasy of bhakti moved the hearts in the Marathi Abhang of Namadeva, Bengali song on Kali of Kalighat in “Tumi jago…” and the excerpts from Lalitha-Sahasranama, before she left the audience enthralled with the Kalinga-Nartan Thillana composed by Oothukkadu Venkatasubba Iyer rendered with perfect diction and devotion.

Aruna was not just melodious or intellectually competent in ragadari or swar-prastar, her music had an intensely emotional approach to the raga and kriti which was slower than the standard speed limit of the Carnatic highway, where artistes, sometimes, are in such a tearing hurry that the concert tends to collapse on its own axis. Aruna loves the swaras and composition she renders, and this love transfers to the audience, who in turn take delight in them.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/e0i8bp/article30869564.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21DFRARUNASAIRAMDELHI1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/the-joys-of-a-spiritual-journey/article30869565.ece
321,2020/02/20,More than just ‘superb support’,"Bickram Ghosh on the art of accompaniment, his return to the classical fold and how he learnt the importance of professionalism on stage from Pandit Ravi Shankar

“Indian classical music is spontaneous and interactive. Musicians like us do not play second fiddle as tabla accompanists,” Bickram Ghosh is emphatic while discussing the art of accompaniment. “We all remember duos like Ali Akbar Khan-Shankar Ghosh, Ravi Shankar-Allarakha, Shiv Kumar Sharma-Zakir Hussain. Were these people just second fiddle? No. But, somewhere in the middle, it got lost.” He agrees tabla players do not decide what raga and tala to play but goes on to add, “they share the entire gamut of music-making, without waiting for the ‘nod’ or ‘chance’, because a sensible accompanist would never play out of context.”

“From the instrumentalists’ point of view,” he says, “one must point out how correct is the sitar/sarod players’ use of the left or right hand, is dhere-dhere on the tabla crisp enough, why not dhene-gene instead....” Justifiably, he points out, a review should analyse the technique of raga-tala elaborations applied by both the artistes on stage. “The tala part is often dismissed in a few words like ‘superb support’. I wonder whether this is because of ignorance or sheer prejudice against our clan,” he chuckles.

While listening to this extremely articulate, trendy, classical musician, who wears several caps, one could not help remember his father and guru tabla-legend Pandit Shankar Ghosh, who decided to perform solo or present his percussion ensemble, to protest against this mindset. Almost echoing the senior’s feelings, Ghosh, dressed in branded jeans and leather jacket, says, “If I remain complacent with my worldly comforts and go away without using my fame to set this right, I would be doing a disservice to this great art .”

In the plush living room of the ‘Bickram Ghosh Studio’, atop Ghosh’s four-storied house in upscale South Kolkata, one notices a pair of dumbbells, well-preserved oxygen emanating indoor plants and a collection of books on diverse topics. Following one’s gaze, he could anticipate what was coming and adds smilingly, “You had to suffer the absence of the lift! The reason is, I am a fitness freak and prefer to climb. I do the weights in between recordings, walk a lot, try to eat sensibly despite our kind of erratic lifestyle – only to be able to work unimpeded by lifestyle-related problems.”

Edited excerpts:

It is widely known that during your impressionable age you were in Pandit Ravi Shankar’s constant company. Did you learn this from him?

Oh, yes. In his company, I also learnt how to bring professionalism on stage, how to create a show, which is more relevant today. Content is king, but why stop at that! I saw Pandit Ravi Shankar edit and plan his recitals according to his audience. Once in Taipei, he began with a ten-minute Rupak and asked me ‘fatiye baja’ (nail it). Sure enough, it won thunderous claps. Then he said, ‘This was the exciting part. We have an equally important spiritual part. For this, you all have to shut your eyes.’ This way he befriended the uninitiated and cast his spell.

The high-nosed attitudes of classicists, who place themselves in rarefied space, alienate listeners. I started in the 1980s when there were not many options. Now, I have to give enough to lure and hook my listeners who are spoilt for choice.

In a mehfil of the initiated audience, it is different. In hugely attended soirées, one needs to cater to all present. For this, I have to have that range! But whatever I do, I cannot be far from classical.

Tell us about your film music scores?

In films like Kadambari, Basu Parivar, I used pure classical with vengeance and brought classical back into the commercial cinema – as it was in ’60s. Thanks to my vocalist mother, my music is greatly influenced by Patiala gharana. Even the films’ soundscape is driven by classical or classic-folk medley because I want it to be percolated into generations. I am happy that people follow these crazily in local puja pandals and parties. Yet there is nobody who can say ‘Bickram tabla theke sore gechhe (Bickram has strayed away from the tabla)’.

Sonu Nigam and I had composed music for Jal. The musical score made it to the long list of the Oscars. After that, I started taking my music scores even more seriously. I am doing a lot of commercial films like Torbaaz.

You played the lead role in a Bengali film. Now you are acting in a Hindi film. Is glamour calling?

Acting is not my cup of tea; it just happened. Band of Maharajas offered me a very interesting, meaty role and I am scoring its music as well. I have been straddling different genres of music with an open mind since childhood. I always listened to Bollywood, Western music, played conga in school.

Baba, a strict disciplinarian, did not mind if I did my riyaaz regularly.

You started off as an A-listed tabla accompanist and moved in the haloed zone for fifteen years. Then suddenly, apart from giving solo recitals, you began body drumming, cheek-playing. Again a phase came wherein you were into fusion. Last two years you are back on the classical stage and released fifteen classical albums! Why such paradigm shifts?

I felt I had more music in me beyond pure classical. I always dabbled in varied forms because as a child I saw Baba doing a lot of experimental work with his musical drums (rhythm ensemble). My school-college influences led me to other forms and genres. Besides, after a point, I wanted my status as a tabla player to have a much broader spectrum. I wanted to create a brand to get more opportunities as opposed to rock-guys or Adhunik or Bangla Band gigs, etc. I, therefore, vanished from the classical arena for five-six years.

Nobody tried this risky professional hiatus like me, and yet I came back with a renewed, expanded, ‘versatile’ image. My photo and name now find a respectable place alongside the ‘main’ artists in most of the posters. I fought this battle seriously and am reaping the benefits.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/xookax/article30869485.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Pandit-Bickram-Ghosh-1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/more-than-just-superb-support/article30869486.ece
322,2020/02/20,When the Ahilya fort echoed with rhythm,"The annual Sacred River Festival held by the Narmada in Maheshwar is a confluence of history and art

More than two centuries after her reign, you still feel queen Ahilyabai Holkar’s presence throughout Maheshwar, an ancient town caressed by the languid Narmada. The Ahilya Fort stands guard on the banks, its formidable walls with finely crafted arches holding within them many stories of the Maratha queen’s bravery, rising high above the ghats. One of the most powerful women rulers of Indian history, Ahilyabai ascended the throne after the death of her husband and son, and endeared herself to the people of Malwa through her welfare and development measures.

It is a dark chilly February evening. I walk past the school named after her and rows of shops selling Maheshwari handlooms, a weaving tradition patronised by her, to reach the huge gate of the Devi Ahilyabai Holkar palace. Two women in traditional nine yard saris, carry flowers to place at the feet of the life-size statue of their beloved Ma Saab. Her royal court and residence on the way to the riverfront stand out for their simplicity. Several stone steps take you down to the Ahilya Parisar, a magnificent complex that houses temples with towering shikars and intricately carved domes and long corridors with floral and animal motifs. The setting sun coats the royal arena in hues of crimson. A few more steps through an arched gate and you are at the venue of the Sacred River Festival.

It’s a quaint and intimate setting — the river gently flows behind the stage and the ramparts of the 18th century fort illuminated by hundreds of diyas. Among the audience are devotees, tourists and art lovers.

Presented by The Devi Ahilyabai Holkar Memorial Charitable Trust and Ms Mary McFadden, the annual festival celebrates history, architecture, Nature, the performing arts and crafts. This year’s theme ‘Paarasparyam – The strength of Partnership’ underlined the essence of this celebration, where the past coalesces with the present, where genres come together and where the connoisseur and uninitiated mingle.

The festival goes beyond performances to take a closer look at the process of how a creative idea takes shape and what the artistes go through before presenting it. So the three-day event typically begins with a baithak session each morning at the Lingarchan section of the palace that is decked up with colourful flowers. Musicians and dancers explain the nuances of their presentation that evening. Compere Anjana Rajan, a Bharatanatyam dancer and theatre practitioner, not just anchors the proceedings but also aids the audience in establishing a deeper understanding and a wider perspective of art.

Deepa Chakravarthy

The 2020 edition (February 7 to 9) opened with the performances of Mohiniyattom dancer Deepa Chakravarthy and ghazal singers Shaheen Salmani and Sadia Iqbal Khan.

On Day Two, multi-media dance production ‘Rango’ntaratma, featuring four dancers and two classical dance styles, unravelled the many layers of existence through philosophy, concept of sound, creative energy of a bindu, diverse forms of kala and the enjoyment of rasa.

As the full moon cast its silvery glow on the stage and the lamps set afloat on the river moved in synchrony, Bharatanatyam dancers Purvadhanashree and Shridhar Vasudevan, along with Kathak artistes Divya Goswami and Hemanta Kumar Kalita, conveyed the beauty of inclusiveness and harmony. They danced solo and in group to show how we all are actors in the play of life. The production was conceptualised by renowned Delhi-based scholar, choreographer and mentor Kamalini Dutt. ‘Rango’ntaratma was backed by great music, narration and visuals.

Rama Sundar Rangaanathan

Day Three, held at the Ahilya Parisar, began with a tribute to the royal patronage to art and culture of the region. Hindustani vocalist Rama Sundar Ranganathan, through her thematic concert based on sagun (form) and nirgun (formless) compositions presented a fine sketch of the not-much-heard Indore Gharana, founded by the legendary Ustad Amir Khan. Her repertoire included songs by Adi Shakaracharya (on the Narmada), Swati Tirunal, Bulleh Shah, Kabir, Guru Nanak and Mahatma Gandhi. She ended her concert with a Tulsidas bhajan that saw the contrasting attributes of the two philosophies as complementary paths.

The concluding performance of the festival featured sitarist Uma Shankar, flautist Kiran Kumar and tabla artiste Siddhartha Chatterjee. They started with the melodious Bageshri. After playing some solo phrases, they built up the crescendo with an eclectic blend of laya and taal. They wound up the concert with ‘Vaishnava Janato’.

The instrumental ensemble

The appeal of such festivals, held outside auditoria, lies in the fact that they make the arts accessible. They are more about shared experiences. So it was at Maheshwar, where you saw the people of the quiet town avidly watching the performances. And when the venue is a heritage site, it allows you to engage with the past and understand the true meaning of tradition.

Richard Holkar’s ode to the legacy

It was at the suggestion of a Swiss friend that Richard Holkar conceived the Sacred River Festival to continue the Holkar legacy of promoting art and culture. “He thought we should have some kind of an event to preserve the architectural, cultural and environmental heritage. After all, the royal courtyard would have seen several such performances. So I felt it’s great idea to revive the tradition. And we are already into the 20th year of the festival,” says the enigmatic Holkar descendant, who takes keen interest in the curation and presentation of the festival.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/5ku87q/article30869351.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21FRSACRED1JPG,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/when-the-ahilya-fort-echoed-with-rhythm/article30869361.ece

“Sudha Ragunathan? Well of course, anyone would jump at the opportunity. I know I did!” Bickram Ghosh laughs heartily as we begin chatting. He’s gearing up for a six-city tour, debuting some of his original works alongside tried-and-tested melodies.

The travelling performance that spans metros including Bengaluru, Mumbai, Pune, Delhi, and finally Ghosh’s hometown Kolkata, kicks off in Chennai this weekend with a special guest: senior vocalist Sudha Ragunathan. Of course, it’s hardly the first time Ghosh has interacted with Chennai and its rich Carnatic music heritage.

Three decades ago, he made waves, collaborating with the likes of Guru Karaikudi Mani and G. Harishankar, before joining hands with the late Pt. Ravi Shankar, an artistic endeavour that would endure until the sitar maestro’s passing.

The experience left an indelible mark on Ghosh and his music and has been evident in many of his musical ventures, including the latest, Omkara, that also features veena exponent Rajhesh Vaidhya, ghatam artiste Suresh Vaidyanathan, drummer B.S. Arun Kumar, and keyboardist Pulak Sarkar.

The concert is a celebration of sorts, honouring Ghosh’s first fusion show at the Music Academy in the 2000s and his many collaborators who have taught him so much about art.

“This show will kick off with popular pieces from my maiden venture, Rhythmscape. This includes our single, The Dance of Shiva, given that our performance falls on the auspicious occasion of Shivaratri. We will then move into a rhythm jam, which forms the nucleus of another piece I present called Drums of Shiva. After this, Sudha ji will join us in more of an extempore segment,” he explains.

The improvisational aspect has Sudha equally enthused as it has the potential to incite what she calls ‘the electrifying effect of extempore.’

“Given that I am the only vocalist on stage with all other artistes being instrumentalists, who are masters of their craft, the combination makes this particular performance exciting. I think we’ll all be enraptured by the suspense because honestly, we won’t even know what the outcome will be until we come together on stage,” she says.

The experience, she says, is akin to painting a mural, splashing colour upon colour to create a masterpiece that unveils itself in totality in its final moments

‘Omkara’, presented by Eventart, will be held on February 21 (6.45 p.m.) at Narada Gana Sabha.

324,2020/02/20,Shruti S Bhat presents a lively concert at Palakkad,"A highlight of Shruti S Bhat’s vocal recital was the beautiful exposition of Reethigowla and the short RTP towards the end

A highlight of Shruti S Bhat’s vocal recital at Palakkad was the beautiful exposition of Reethigowla and the short RTP towards the end. The singer started off with the Swathi Thirunal varnam ‘Chalamela’ in Sankarabharanam set to Ada tala, succeeded by Dikshitar’s ‘Ramachandram Bhavayami’ in Vasantha. The elegant alapana of Reethigowla, developed stage by stage, was shaped in the classical mould.

The raga swaroopa emanated clearly in the delightful sangathis, and the manodharma swaras in ‘Cheraravathe’, a kriti of Tyagaraja, were full of verve. The swarajathi, ‘Kamakshi’, a chowka kala kriti of Shyama Sastri in Yadukulakamboji , not a popular one though, did not carry much impact. However, the next item, ‘Nenarunchara’, again a Tyagaraja composition in the rare raga Simhavahini, revived the tempo.

The elucidation of the main raga, Madhyamavathi, interspersed with elaborate sancharas, was a good effort, though a few off-beat phrases crept in between and the raga bhava was not given due prominence. Syama Sastri’s magnum opus ‘Palinchu Kamakshi’ was the chosen composition, wherein the niraval was too brief, but the swaraprastharas were comprehensive.

The thaniavartanam at this stage by N Anirudh Raj (mridangam) and Bijay Sankar (ghatam) was prolonged, though both exhibited their talent abundantly. Their support during the kriti renditions was also appreciable. Due to time constraints, Shruti presented a short but sweet version of Varali for RTP.

The thanam was brief but the vocalist did justice to the pallavi ‘Vara Thyagaraja Deekshita Shyama Varade Varaleeyave, Varaali Veni’ in praise of the trinity, which was abundant with pleasing lyrics and was rendered authentically, with ingenious sangathis. The swaras in Kuntalavarali, Nagaswaravali and then again Varali were praiseworthy.

The unique feature of the pallavi was that it was executed in Panchamukhi talam with variations in ‘dritam’ and ‘laghu’ in kandagathi and chathusragathi’, a creation of music maestro M Balamuralikrishna. The presentation revealed the vocalist’s erudition. The concluding piece was a soulful ‘Kshemam Guru Gopala’ of Narayana Teertha in Mohanam, Kapi, Behag and Sindubhairavi.

Shruti’s sister Sreelakshmi Bhat’s brilliant violin accompaniment was a major plus point of the recital. She excelled both in raga alapanas and swaraprastharas. A budding artiste with potential, Shruti could have paid a little more attention to sruthi, diction and overall presentation.

325,2020/02/20,Stage of novelty,"Composed by flautist Nagaraju, Aata Gadara Shiva showcases around 50 artistes in a symphonic style

A good piece of music can impact us in various ways: we feel calm or energised, invigorated or peaceful, and transported to a different time and space.

A unique musical symphony to be held this weekend promises such an experience with a blend of music and rhythm to create a mood that blends spirituality with nostalgia. Aata Gadara Shiva, a unique show created and composed by flautist Nagaraju Talluri, showcases a multitude of artistes under one stage. Incidentally, the show is scheduled to be held on the eve of Mahashivarathri. Aata Gadara Shiva is actually a well-known anthology of 108 verses written by film and literary personality Tanikella Bharani. Popular in literary and music circles, it has been performed in different ways at several programmes / concerts. This event however takes Aata Gadara Shiva to the next level.

What to expect

It features a mammoth gathering of artistes comprising the who’s who of the music field. From percussion wizard Sivamani on the drums, Nagaraju on flute and bassist Mohini Dey, to violinists from Chennai and 12 singers, the cast promise a spectacular evening.

The stage backdrop has been designed by set designer Ashok (who designed sets for Indra and Varudu films). The show is anchored by actor Sai Kumar and Mani Nagaraju, and will begin with Bharani’s introduction of the book.

It all started when Nagaraju was discussing the music he had composed for Gangavataranam, another anthology of verses by Bharani, with the writer, when the duo decided to present Aata Gadara...in a different format. Several months of planning followed.

Nagaraju’s wife and singer Mani shares how it was a challenge to create a symphony for the anthology. She says, “Since the verses are in similar rhythm, it is tough to bring in novelty. But one cannot sing it in a same style. He (Nagaraju) composed tunes in such a way that it is devotional yet in a symphonic style; it sounds contemporary too.”

The timing of the show — the eve of Maha Shivaratri — is just a happy coincidence, says Mani. “In fact, the event first planned for January 5, but there were too many events clashing on that day. Since we wanted it to be a unique musical experience, we rescheduled it.”

Mani says, “The audience can look forward to a musical stage with soulful sounds. Most group shows are film-based. We rarely have shows where a different kind of music is in focus. We have made sure the music doesn’t lose its authentic devotional touch even as it creates the joy of symphony music.”

331,2020/02/20,Blaze at Brahmapuram yard contained,"The risk of another fire outbreak looms large over the plastic waste piled up at Brahmapuram with the civic authorities struggling to find a permanent solution to the recurring menace.

It required the service of 110 personnel from seven stations of the Fire and Rescue Services to contain the fire that broke out on Tuesday.

Fire lines were cleared and water was pumped on to the burning heaps to control the fire. Excavators were being used to churn waste. Seven excavators had been deployed for the job. The temperature of waste heaps would be controlled by continuously pouring water over them, said a communication from the district administration.

“Though the latest fire could be contained by Tuesday evening, the risk is still there as the embers must be glowing deep inside the heaps,” said V.P. Chandran, the LDF leader in the council.

The interior pathways that were created in the areas where garbage had been piled up helped control the spread of the blaze. Had the roads, which segregated the garbage into blocks, not been created, the fire would have gone out of the yard, posing serious health risks, said Mr. Chandran.

The Corporation has mobilised its work force from various zonal offices to the plant site to keep the waste wet. The pumps installed by the local body are being used to pour water over plastic waste. “The process has to be continued through the summer months,” he said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/blaze-at-brahmapuram-yard-contained/article30864878.ece
332,2020/02/20,Particulate matter in air increases after fire,"It can cause breathlessness, cough, and choking sensation

The air quality at Ambalamugal and Vyttila declined after the total emissions of particulate matter (PM) were found to be five to 10 times higher following a major fire that broke out at the Kochi Corporation’s waste dumping yard at Brahmapuram on Tuesday.

The data available with the Pollution Control Board showed that the levels of PM10 (fine particles) and PM2.5 (a known carcinogenic) were 450 microgram/cubic metre and 352 microgram/cubic metre respectively at Ambalamugal at 5 a.m. on Wednesday. The air quality data was collected from the board’s monitoring stations at Ambalamugal and Vyttila.

The stations recorded ozone concentrations to the tune of 0.52 ppm (parts per million) against the standard limit of 0.1 ppm at 4 p.m. on Tuesday. It dipped to 0.18 ppm on Tuesday night.

According to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) of India, the 24-hour average for PM10 is 100 microgram/cubic metre, and 60 microgram/cubic metre for PM2.5.

At Vyttila, the levels of PM10 and PM2.5 at 1 a.m. on Wednesday were 533 microgram/cubic metre and 528 microgram/cubic metre respectively. The PM10 level was found to be over 10 times higher than the limit while the PM2.5 level was eight times higher than the prescribed limit.

The levels of PM10 and PM2.5 at Vyttila at 8 a.m. on Wednesday were 325 microgram/cubic metre and 248 microgram/cubic metre respectively. The increase in particulate matter in the air can cause breathlessness, cough, and choking sensation. The board will submit the air quality data and other findings before the State Level Monitoring Committee on Solid Waste Management as part of submitting a detailed report before the National Green Tribunal in the case related to the legacy waste scenario and fire breakouts at Brahmapuram. The committee had pointed out that the inordinate delay in clearing the legacy waste at the site had led to frequent fire incidents.

A study conducted by the CSIR-National Institute for Interdisciplinary Science and Technology (CSIR-NIIST) after a major fire at Brahmapuram on February 24 last had found that the levels of dioxin observed in residual ash samples were in the range observed in various infamous waste dumping sites in Vietnam, Philippines, Cambodia, Netherlands, Greece, and the United States. Dioxins are highly toxic chemical compounds that are harmful to health, and they are known as Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs).",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/ug4gib/article30864876.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20KIPLASTICWASTE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/particulate-matter-in-air-increases-after-fire/article30864877.ece
333,2020/02/20,Drive against modified silencers in bikes,"MVD takes action against 67 riders under Operation Stop Thunder

Think twice before you replace factory-fitted silencers with modified silencers to get that thumping sound.

The Motor Vehicles Department (MVD) has taken action against 67 motorbikes as part of its Operation Stop Thunder launched in Perumbavoor. “Inspections revealed that the riders had replaced factory-fitted silencers, which adhere to noise pollution norms, with modified silencers. The use of modified silencers caused noise levels in the range of 85 to 90 decibels,” said B. Shefiq, Joint Regional Transport Officer, Perumbavoor.

The owners of the motorbikes were asked to replace the modified silencers with the original factory-fitted silencers. “Those who complied with the directive were asked to pay a fine of ₹5,000 as per rule 182 A(4) of the amended Motor Vehicles Act. Violators who fail to produce vehicles after replacing modified silencers will be blacklisted and their details along with registration and other information will be uploaded on the centralised Vahan web-based platform,” said Mr. Shefiq.

MVD officials pointed out that the vehicle owner had no right to alter the vehicle as the manufacturer comes out with a vehicle following environment norms. From April 1, only BS-6 compliant vehicles can be registered. Factory-fitted silencers helped in regulating the emission of carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide etc., besides ensuring the rules pertaining to sound pollution, they said.

The use of modified silencers was found to be causing health problems to commuters, especially women and the elderly.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/o99f07/article30864871.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19ki-Silencerjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/drive-against-modified-silencers-in-bikes/article30864873.ece
334,2020/02/20,Giving them back their childhood,"Sarana Balyam project comes to the rescue of hapless children, most of them migrants

Child labour and irregularly employed adolescent boys among migrants dominate those rescued and rehabilitated in the district under the Sarana Balyam project of the Women and Child Development Department.

Since its launch through the District Child Protection Unit (DCPU), 17 youngsters aged under 18 years have been rescued under the project. Of this, 11 were migrants out of which nine accounted for child and adolescent labour.

Sarana Balyam, aimed at cracking down on child labour, beggary and exploitation of children, was initially introduced on an experimental basis in Pathanamthitta, Kottayam, Alappuzha and Kollam districts before it was expanded across the State in 2018.

“We rescued three 13-year-old boys engaged in child labour. One boy from Tamil Nadu was engaged as a domestic worker in Paravur and the other two from Bihar were employed in a rubber sheet mill at Edayar near Aluva,” said Jeffin Franco, Child Rescue Officer, DCPU. While the boy from Tamil Nadu was repatriated, the other two remain sheltered in a child care home.

Besides, four adolescents children, two each from Assam and Odisha, who were found employed in hotels in Perumbavoor region were rescued and repatriated to their home States along with their parents.

Two other adolescents from West Bengal were found employed in a hotel at Ernakulam KSRTC stand without minimum wages and for excessive working hours following which labour and police departments and the Child Welfare Committee (CWC) intervened. On being warned, the hotel owner started paying minimum wages while the working hours were reduced in compliance with the law governing adolescent labour.

A tricky thing

“Migrant children make repatriation under the project tricky. Often they are found engaged in labour or begging along with their parents and even if they are rescued and repatriated to their home States, they may return to some other district within a matter of months,” said Mr. Franco.

Five children, all from the district, were rescued after being found in need of care and protection. Among the rescued were four children belonging to two mentally unfit parents. They were found locked up in their homes without being sent to schools. Another child was found abandoned by parents.

Three children have since been sent with their parents while one continue to remain in a shelter home. The abandoned child was found to have an elder brother and was sent with him.

Three children were rescued from the streets after being reported as suspected cases of child begging. “Two children had their parents living under the Edappally flyover and were heavily into drinking. They are now sheltered in a home as they could neither be repatriated nor could be restored with the parents who claim to be from Puducherry but have steadfastly declined to share details of any relative,” Mr. Franco said. Another child was also rescued from the street from parents living in dubious circumstances in Piravom. DCPU shelters children rescued in any of their 96 child care homes in the district registered under the Juvenile Justice Act till they are sent back to their parents or guardians.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/giving-them-back-their-childhood/article30864868.ece
335,2020/02/20,Cusat develops nanogenerator of electricity,"Varsity plans to begin start-up venture aimed at developing devices using technology

Nanotechnology researchers at the Cochin University of Science and Technology (Cusat) have developed a triboelectric nanogenerator that can generate electricity from simple body movements such as walking and running. Triboelectric nanogenrator converts small scale displacements, vibration energy, rotational energy, and sound energy directly to electrical energy.

“We have developed a novel triboelectric material based on the composites of a rubber-like polymer with nanomaterials that can harvest static electrical energy generated from vibrations, body movements, and frictional impulses etc or by a simple touch,” said Honey John, Head of Department of Polymer Science and Rubber Technology and Director of the Nano Energy and Device Group of the Inter University Centre for Nanomaterials and Devices (IUCND), which developed the product.

Stating that a lot of energy that was burned up during walking, running and physical exercises could be effectively converted into electricity, Dr. John claimed that this approach of generating electricity from the finger-tip could be a solution to the development of self-powered devices. “The material has prolonged ability to provide electricity for wearable devices and body implanted sensors for medical research. The future plan of Nanoenergy and Device Group at the varsity is to develop self-powered tiny sensors and transistors which can function at very low currents using these cost-effective nanogenerators,” she said. Researchers said that the material was developed using eco-friendly and cost-effective raw materials and its large scale production was simple and economical. A scaled-up model of the product could light up 100 LED bulbs, charge a smart phone and power calculators and digital watches.

“We have demonstrated how the human body movements such as walking, stepping, and even the pulses of the blood vessels can be used to harvest electricity. When connected to a battery, it can store energy and can be used for charging portable devices. Further, this invention can lead to the development of security and biomedical sensors, wearable devices etc,” they said.

Dr. John said that applications for three patents had been filed based on this technology. The next step was to begin a start-up venture at the varsity aimed at developing devices using this technology.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/6wzzcx/article30864500.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19ki-Cusatjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/cusat-develops-nanogenerator-of-electricity/article30864502.ece
336,2020/02/20,When a ‘patriotic’ thief turned contrite,"Intruder breaks into retired Colonel’s house, leaves behind note expressing remorse

Patriotic fervour found its unlikeliest votary in an intruder who turned remorseful when he realised that the house he broke into was that of a retired Army officer.

The incident took place in the house of a retired Colonel at Thiruvankulam near Thripunithura in the early hours of Wednesday, according to the Hill Palace police.

The house, which had been remaining closed for more than two months as the family was reportedly away in Bahrain, was broken into using an iron rod, which the trespasser procured from the compound of the house itself and which the police later recovered.

The burglar went rummaging through the rooms when he probably come across the military cap of the house owner, suddenly turning him patriotic and remorseful. That was reflected in a flurry of handwritten messages in a confessional tone that he left on a wall inside, invoking nothing less than the seventh commandment from the Bible, which states, “Thou shalt not steal”.

“I violated the seventh commandment in the Bible. But then, you will be there before me (in the journey) to hell,” he wrote quite inexplicably.

His love for the Army found expression in another scribbling that read: “I realised that this was the house of a soldier only in the last minute when I saw the cap. Had I known it earlier, I would never have broken into the house. Please forgive me”.

He was even candid enough to sum up the things, negligible considering the risk taken, he had stolen, which included a pair of dress, a little alcohol and ₹1,500.

It is, however, not clear whether he turned into confessional mode after taking a few drinks!

The police said that he had probably broken into a few shops in the building opposite the home, an admission of which was also scribbled on the wall.

“A bag and a few documents (have been left behind in the home). Return it to the tyre shop to which it belongs,” it read.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/when-a-patriotic-thief-turned-contrite/article30864481.ece
337,2020/02/20,Industrialist calls for focusing on the present,"Women not being fully engaged in the economy is worrying, says Sunil Kant Munjal

The Indian economy will have to figure out what has to be done here and now to create that wonderful future for ourselves, Sunil Kant Munjal, chairman, Hero Enterprise, has said.

He was delivering the inaugural address at the 39th annual national management convention organised by the Kerala Management Association here on Wednesday.

“That India will become one of the largest economies in the world is a given. For the medium to long term, we are in a great shape but in the medium to long term, we are all dead. So, we have to focus on the here and now,” Mr. Munjal said.

He said that though Kerala did better than other States, the fact that the much smarter part of the population was not fully engaged in the economy remained a matter of concern. “Women are the much smarter half of the population. The next big wave of productivity will happen when men and women have equal roles in the economy,” Mr. Munjal said.

Through history, civilizations were considered successful if they had four attributes at the same time – if they had the ability to defend themselves, had a thriving and growing economy, had a role in global decision-making, and a strong cultural foundation. India has done very well in the first three counts though not on the fourth. “We have inherited one of the richest cultural heritages in the world and we are allowing it to decline and in many cases, die. A study a few years ago showed that we have lost 30% of our heritage in the past 30 years. We cannot have a future without a strong foundation. It is important to remember where we come from and build on that,” Mr. Munjal said.

History showed that it was not the strongest, biggest or the toughest who had survived but those who were more adaptable, flexible and were willing to learn and make the first move themselves and pre-empt the change before they were forced to.

One has to think at a lightning pace because that was needed now in a highly competitive and connected world. “A quarter now is what the whole year used to be once. If you have to make a plan for five years, you have to execute it within this year itself. That is the pace at which things are changing,” he said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/1a0d6j/article30864458.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19KI-MUNJAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/industrialist-calls-for-focusing-on-the-present/article30864459.ece
338,2020/02/20,Youth Theatre Festival of Kerala in Thiruvananthapuram brings plays from across Kerala,"Theatre groups from 13 districts will fight it out for the prize money

From today, the sylvan grounds of Tagore Theatre will be the venue for a two-day Youth Theatre Festival of Kerala (YTFK) featuring plays from 13 districts of Kerala. The curtain goes up on plays inspired by mythology, folklore, contemporary events and more. “From 9 am, it will be plays unlimited as theatre enthusiasts of all shades come under the spotlight. Plays of diverse genres will be helmed by actors and directors from all walks of life, including students,” says actor Krishnan Balakrishnan, the festival coordinator.

Big win The prize money is a highlight of the festival, with ₹1 lakh, ₹75,000 and ₹50,000 to be given to the top three teams respectively. Also, grants are provided to teams selected to the state-level contest and those who came second and third in district-level competitions.

Calling it a first-of-it-kind initiative by the Kerala State Youth Welfare Board (KSYWB), P Biju, vice-chairman of KSYWB, which is organising YTFK, says that the festival is among the several initiatives of the Board to promote art and culture among the youth. It has been conceptualised on the lines of prestigious national theatre festivals. “The plays were chosen after screenings and competitions held in the districts over a period of three months. Theatre has contributed immensely to the socio-cultural fabric of our state. We opted for the competition format to ensure fair and equal participation from all the districts, even those that may not have an active theatre culture,” he adds.

While nine plays will be staged on the first day, the rest will be presented on the concluding day. Mazhavil Dhwani, a theatre group of transpersons, will stage their production Parayan Maranna Kathakal, prior to the valedictory function on February 22. Many of the plays deal with contemporary subjects with its aceent on political, economic, social and gender issues.

“We are nervous, but also excited about the opportunity. Such a big stage is a first for us,” Meera Krishnan admits. An alumna of SB College, Changanassery, Kottayam, she is the scriptwriter and one of the three directors of the play, Iravathi, which will be vying for top honours. The play recounts the trials and tribulations of the third gender through the story of Iravan, a character in the Mahabharatha. In the cast and crew are her friends and juniors from college. Playing the lead is another director of the play, Binto Alex.

Arun Lal, director of Kentonians, a production of Little Earth School of Theatre, Malappuram, feels that a theatre festival involving the youth is a stimulus for theatre groups like theirs, whose members are all below the age of 40. “Although a competition has its limitations, such an initiative has its advantages. Besides being given a chance to take our work to a large audience, the reward is equally worth fighting for. If this festival becomes a regular feature, then, perhaps, in future, theatre groups will come up with productions specifically for this event,” says Arun, director of critically-acclaimed productions such as Chillara Samaram and Bolivian Stars.

Arun Kumar Karayi, director of the play, Abhisarika, a production of Yuva Arena CUKerala, the theatre club of Central University of Kerala, Kasaragod, is of the view that the festival has given opportunity for troupes from rural areas to showcase their creativity. “And we students couldn’t have asked for more. We pursue different streams of study at the University and the theatre club is the meeting point of actors, technicians and musicians,” says Arun, a research scholar at the University. The play, based on the Bengali film Rajkahini [later made in Hindi as Begum Jaan], is about a brothel that stood on Radcliff’s Line that separated India and Pakistan and the plight of the female prostitutes who eventually commit suicide. It was adjudged the first runner-up at the inter-university National Youth Festival at Noida earlier this month.

Meanwhile Sam George, director of Pets of Anarchy, a work of APT from Thiruvananthapuram, observes that it is sheer coincidence that he gets to present a work that reflects upon the volatile situation in India now. “It talks about what happens when a society fails to react. We made it soon after journalist Gauri Lankesh was murdered and it is more relevant now when the nation is up in arms against the Citizenship Amendment Acts,” says Sam.

339,2020/02/20,Treat for the senses,"Raising contemporary issues, the foreign entries at the 21st Bharat Rang Mahotsav made a lasting impact

As always, apart from the Indian entries, the 21st Bharat Rang Mahotsav (BRM) saw participation of theatre practitioners from across the world. This year, audiences got a chance to watch ten plays that gave them an idea of the American and European theatre and, of course, the creative mood in the neighbourhood. From the plight of women in war to growing xenophobia, the plays dealt with contemporary issues with traditional forms and mythical tales

Russian play “Djhyrybyna: the Warrior Woman” was undoubtedly the most enchanting foreign play of the festival. A true treat for the senses, the lyrical style of this play resembled like an old pastoral song resonating in the hills and meadows.

“The Trojan Women”, the second Russian play, depicted the sad story of the women left behind, after a war is over. Vasilisa Tapliakova, director of the play, said that she used this ancient Greek tale of Euripides in an effort to present the tragedy to the younger generation, living in a world still not worth living for the women. They need to learn from these tales, tragedies the women face at the end of each war. It brings the play near to Dharmveer Bharti’s modern classic “Andha Yug”, where a grieving Gandhari curses Krishna for the loss of her sons. Effort of the young director was “not to make the play’s situation similar to the contemporary problems,” but to let the audience create its own associations with today’s war-torn world.

Simiarly, Nepalese play, “Kumari and the Beast”, depicted the woman-power at play. Presented in the dance-drama style, “Kumari and the Beast” presented the religio-historical aspect of the Nepalese society, depicting the tradition of choosing a young prepubescent girl as Kumari, who is worshipped by the people like goddess till the age of puberty. This, along with the other play from Nepal, “Mahabhoj”, represented two contrasting aspects of the Nepali society of today. Based on Mannu Bhandari’s novel and play of the same name, “Mahabhoj” narrates the tale of ordinary humans forced to act as puppets in the vicious grip of the system.

A strong political undercurrent was best visible in the Sri Lankan play “Grease Yaka Returns”. It tries to understand the deeper fears in the minds of the people, created completely out of nothing sometimes, to exploit the differences between the communities. Director of the play Nishantha De Silva asserted that globally people are finding solace in the arms of what constitutes smaller and smaller communities. For Nishantha, the solution seems to be in not getting carried away. He felt that the leftover issues of the colonial era are now coming to the forefront, creating tensions.

The other play that made a strong comment on the political system was “Mrityu Ghar”. The play from Bangladesh, an adaptation of German playwright Dea Loher’s 1992 play “Olga’s Room”, tells the story of the torture of Ila Mitra, a Communist peasants’ movement activist of East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) in the early fifties. Director Mukul Ahmed said that it was a conscious decision to take actors from India, stressing that cultural dialogue between the societies is important. Another Bangladeshi play “Tragedy of the Polahbari” was a serious comment on the well-entrenched system of corruption because of politician-bureaucrat-corporate nexus.

Wendy Jehlan’s “Conference of the Birds”, the US entry, used Sufi poetry of 12th century to counter xenophobia in its many manifestations. Re-contextualising the classical Sufi text with a non-verbal approach, Wendy created a fluid narrative through flexibility of the body and rhythmic lyricism.

Czech Republic’s play “Richard III”, an adaptation of Shakespeare’s historical work about the ruthless King of England, tried to raise concerns about the plight of the refugees all over the world.

“Live Nukes” from the US was a silent comedy. It made excellent use of physical action on the stage to narrate the comic story of how two idiots working in a nuclear facility accidentally launched a nuclear weapon.",theatre,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/glw82i/article30870539.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CzechPlayRichardIII,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/treat-for-the-senses/article30870540.ece
340,2020/02/20,"Poor living standards, social variations prevail among Adivasis of Bengal, says report by Amartya Sen’s Partichi Trust","The report has produced a picture of lack of understanding and appreciation about the humanity and culture of Adivasis

Even though there is an amount of romanticism with the Adivasi (tribal) way of life in Bengali literature the indicators of well-being like education and health suggests that they are lagging behind other groups of the population, Nobel laureate Amartya Sen said here on Wednesday.

Releasing a research report titled ‘Living world of the Adivasis of Bengal’ compiled by Prof. Sen’s Pratichi Institute and Asiatic Society, he added that despite the “native talent, the achievements of Advasis have been constrained”.

The report, according to him, has produced a picture of lack of understanding and appreciation about the humanity and culture of Adivasis. Prof. Sen pointed out that as early as the third century BC Emperor Ashoka pointed to the need to pay attention to the rights of “forest people,” but that needed attention had very rarely materialised. In the introduction to the report, Prof. Sen writes that deprivations of the Adivasis arise not merely from the lack of private resources and the prejudices of society at large, “but also from the neglect of their interests in the governmental distribution of public facilities”.

The report, running over 288 pages, reflects in details the reasons for lower degree of educational achievement among the Adivasis, how the approach to the problem of healthcare of the Adivasis must take a “biosocial route”. On the issue of livelihood of the Adivasis, the document points out that the shrinkage of traditional livelihood opportunities resulting from the alienation of natural resources has finally left no alternative for the Adivasis but to become wage labourers. Prof. Sen recollected his own experiences of a child while growing up in Santiniketan, where he witnessed how tribals selling up their land in distress to work as agricultural labourers.

Work participation rate

Significant focus is also on the poor living standard of the adivasi population in Bengal. The researchers have recorded this while analysing the work participation rate (WPR) that denotes the ratio of the population engaged in income generating work. The WPR in tribal population is higher than average. “ Our survey also found a similar pattern with the WPR at 53 % which meant both children and elderly people were involved in earning,” the paper quotes

Among the tribal communities in West Bengal multiple variations in terms of access to food, literacy, availability of toilets and landlessness were observed across different tribal communities. The study points that about 12 % of the households among all tribal groups could not afford food more than twice a day (not necessarily full meals to fill the stomach) the corresponding figures for the Lodhas was as high as 47 %. Similarly, while the availability of toilets for all tribal groups was about 51 % for Lodhas the researchers did not find any access to toilet. Similarly, in terms of literacy, the Magh people topped the list with an 88 % literacy rate while the Gorait people are placed at the bottom with a literacy rate as low as 32% .

The variations did not depend on different tribal groups but also among the region – south Bengal or north Bengal or the districts. West Bengal has about 40 tribal groups. Adivasi population of over five million people form six% of the total population of the State.

“The vicious cycle of political-economic deprivation and social alienation continues to keep the Adivasis subjugated to the ruling modern. The politics of dominance, economics of immediate gain, and social outlook of separateness have charted out for the Adivasis as well as others a very different path,” the report states.",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/8jqbqg/article30867192.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THNAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/poor-living-standards-social-variations-prevail-among-adivasis-of-bengal-says-report-by-amartya-sens-partichi-trust/article30867193.ece

342,2020/02/20,JU students’ union polls peaceful,"Elections held after a gap of three years; results today

The students’ union elections in the Jadavpur University, held after a gap of three years, passed off peacefully on Wednesday, with the RSS-affiliated Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad and the CPI(M)-backed Students’ Federation of India claiming they received a good response from the students.

A university official said no untoward incident was reported in the elections in both Arts and Engineering faculties, that began at 10 a.m. and ended at 7 p.m.

Vice-Chancellor Suranjan Das, in a statement, thanked all sections of the university for the smooth conduct of the elections.

SFI’s Jadavpur University unit leader Ushashi Pal said a large number of students voted enthusiastically. “We were cautious of not falling into the ABVP’s trap and asked our activists and supporters to be careful so that the election process was not disrupted,” Mr. Pal said.

The ABVP had put its candidates for the first time in the polls of JU, known as a hotbed of the Left-wing politics. “We were careful so that the SFI or other Left unions could not instigate any trouble,” ABVP’s JU unit leader Shyamasree Karmakar said.

According to BRC sources, the project titled ‘Pachilakkad’ was opened by actor Mohanlal some time ago by handing over saplings to students. The small forest is expected to come up on a one-acre plot. The sources said that different types of bamboo plants, trees and other smaller plants would be planted there along with saplings of local varieties.

There is plan to develop a butterfly park in the area too as most of these trees would attract them. Local residents, environmental organisations, along with Kunnummel block panchayat and Maruthonkara grama panchayat have extended support to the project, which is expected to be completed in three years.

BRC officials pointed out that the students who were part of the drive had problems travelling and were given home-based education. The little forest was also expected to be a lung space for the region, which would develop as a habitat for birds and other animals that were on the verge of extinction, they pointed out.

345,2020/02/20,Surendran seeks NIA probe into CAG findings,"Case could be linked to extremist activities, says BJP president

Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) State president K. Surendran has sought a National Investigation Agency (NIA) probe into the Comptroller and Auditor General finding that rifles and cartridges are missing from the police headquarters.

Addressing a meet-the- press event organised by the Calicut Press Club here on Thursday, he claimed that the CAG finding could be linked to attempts by extremist elements to gain foothold in the State. “Maoists are reportedly gaining strength in the ruling party, the CPI(M). Communal forces too are active here. Only a Central agency can bring out details on the extent of these extremist activities,” Mr. Surendran claimed. He also sought a Central Bureau of Investigation probe into the unaudited funds being received by the State police to counter left-wing extremism.

Mr. Surendran also alleged that Muslim fundamentalist elements had intruded into the leadership of both the CPI(M) and the Indian Union Muslim League. “The BJP will launch an agitation highlighting these issues by March first week,” the BJP leader said.

Mr. Surendran alleged that the office of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had become a “carbon copy” of his predecessor, Oommen Chandy, in terms of corruption. He claimed that some of the advisors of the Chief Minister and their relatives had a role in the alleged corrupt deals involving the Home Department. “They have converted Keltron, a well-known public sector undertaking (PSU), to a shell company for corruption. The concessions Keltron is entitled to as a PSU are being misused, purchases are in violation of rules and tender procedures are being avoided,” Mr. Surendran alleged.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/x2r7lm/article30873858.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21CTSURENDRANa,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/surendran-seeks-nia-probe-into-cag-findings/article30873859.ece
346,2020/02/20,Stress on judicious use of groundwater resources,"Stakeholders urged to use emerging techniques for groundwater exploration

The third National Groundwater Conference, which concluded on the Centre for Water Resources Development and Management (CWRDM) campus here on Thursday, came up with an eleven-point recommendation urging stakeholders in the sector to explore emerging techniques in managing groundwater resources.

The three-day sessions, which stressed the judicious use of groundwater resources, observed that water security could be achieved by adopting appropriate groundwater recharge practices. It called for the use of advanced tools such as geophysical techniques, remote sensing and GIS for groundwater exploration, assessment and management.

Effective measure

The use of groundwater modelling was highlighted as an effective measure in water resource assessment for sustainable groundwater development projects. Delegates during their presentations on water conservation models said drip irrigation and fertigation systems should be popularised among farmers. In areas where groundwater development was more than 70%, steps should be taken to ensure conservation of groundwater by adopting sprinkler and drip irrigation systems, they said.

The panellists also pointed out that coastal and urban hydrology were becoming increasingly important due to population pressure that exerted excessive stress on limited groundwater resources in such regions. The future water demand in these areas should be considered and groundwater resources should be judiciously used and protected, they said.

One of the major recommendations at the conference was the need to conduct more studies on seawater intrusion and submarine groundwater discharge using numerical modelling, geophysical and hydro-chemical techniques. Scientists who made the recommendation explained that such studies would highlight the importance of quantum of nutrient and freshwater discharge to the ocean which has larger societal implications.

Data base

Creating a data base system for integrated water resources management from basin scale to watershed scale was another suggestion made at the conference. Scientists said this should be backed up by legal framework so that the data base could be freely accessed by all stakeholders in the country.

The idea for such an interaction was developed by one of the former students of the school, now settled in Texas. His son and another student, from Coppell High School, Dallas, participated in the interaction. The conversation touched culture, language, heritage monuments, and important personalities.

349,2020/02/20,Calicut airport implements ban on single-use plastic,"Eco-friendly alternatives being promoted

Some proactive measures have helped Calicut International Airport to successfully implement the ban on single-use plastic for the past one year.

This was after the directions of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change asked all 35 Airports Authority of India (AAI) airports to ban the use of plastic in the first phase, K. Mohammed Shahid, acting Director of the airport, said.

He said that various steps had been taken to eliminate the single-use plastic items at passenger terminals and the city side of the airport. Thus, drinking straws, cutlery and plates made out of single-use plastic were banned and people were advised to switch over to alternatives and replacements.

Besides, Mr. Shahid said that the airport was also implementing a modern waste management system and was promoting the use of eco-friendly alternatives progressively like the use of eco-friendly garbage bags and installation of plastic bottle crushing machine at the airport. Now, the environment management system of the airport has been certified, he said.

In ensuring the successful implementation of dissuading the usage of single-use plastic items, the airport has been carrying out internal audits of its airports along with the stakeholders. The AAI has engaged Quality Council of India to assess and check the implementation of the ban of single-use plastic items at its airports, Mr. Shahid said.

He said that the AAI had formulated an environment policy that envisaged its commitment for reduction of green house gases and sustainable development by implementing cost-effective carbon mitigation action to conserve environment and reduce adverse impact on society, community, and ecosystem, thus contributing to national development goals, he said.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/calicut-airport-implements-ban-on-single-use-plastic/article30864480.ece

The Palayamkottai police have registered case against 23 members of political parties and various Muslim outfits and over 12,000 Muslims who participated in the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act demonstration held near the District Science Centre on Wednesday.

Urging the State government to adopt resolution in the Assembly against CAA, National Register of Citizenship and National Population Register, various Muslim outfits that announced that they would lay siege to the Collectorate staged demonstration near the District Science Centre on Wednesday.

Against this backdrop, the Palayamkottai police have registered case against the agitators including 25 identifiable persons and around 12,000 unidentified persons including 7,000 men.

The organisers, however, said the agitation was originally planned to lay siege to the Collectorate demanding the State government to pass resolution against the CAA in the Assembly to send strong signals to the Centre.

“When the police held talks with organisers even as we were making arrangements for the agitation, they asked us to organise the demonstration near District Science Centre instead of laying siege to the Collectorate. As a mark of respect to their appeal, we agreed to it. When the agitation was organised, none of us moved beyond District Science Centre and the leaders addressed the protesters from the makeshift stage there. However, the police, who said that 3,000 protesters had participated in the agitation, have registered case against 12,000 protesters including 5,000 women.

Informing farmers that adequate direct purchase centres (DPC) have been opened in the district and specific request from farmers would be considered for opening a few more, said Collector K Veera Raghava Rao here on Thursday.

Speaking at the monthly farmers’ grievance meeting, he said that originally it was proposed to set up 13 DPCs but subsequently there were requests to open more. Officials, after inspection, added seven more taking the total DPCs to 20. If there were more points to be covered, officials would certainly look into the issue, he said.

The Collector explained how compensation was given by insurance companies to farmers for crop loss since the last four fiscal. A group of farmers alleged that there were irregularities in the DPCs since the staff were demanding money. When the Collector inquired, an official admitted that some workers may have collected ₹ one a kg of paddy as “wages.”

Not in a mood to accept the explanation, Mr. Rao directed the official to immediately take steps to return the money to the farmers and instructed him to take action against such staff.

Agriculture department officials said that paddy was cultivated on 1.27 lakh hectares in the district and harvest was completed in 85 % areas. Through DPCs, 2072 tonnes of paddy was purchased so far.

When some farmers wanted to know whether DPCs would be opened to procure chilli, Mr. Rao said that apart from Kamudhi and Paramakudi, DPCs would be made available at Mudukalathur and R S Mangalam after examining the possibilities.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/more-dpcs-to-be-set-up-if-necessary/article30873691.ece
355,2020/02/20,HC grants bail to suspended SI,"Court suspends the life term awarded to him by a trial court

MADURAI

The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Thursday granted bail and suspended the life sentence awarded to a suspended Sub-Inspector of Police, A. Kalidass, by a trial court for gunning down an accused during an interrogation in Ramanathapuram district in 2014.

A Division Bench of Justices T. Raja and B. Pugalendhi granted bail and suspended the sentence awarded to Kalidass. The court directed him to stay in Tiruchi and appear before the Judicial Magistrate - I on a daily basis till further orders.

The court was hearing the appeal filed by Kalidass, challenging the life sentence awarded to him by Ramanathapuram Principal District Judge for having shot K. Syed Mohammed dead during an interrogation at SP Pattinam police station.

In his appeal, Kalidass said that a mechanic had filed a complaint alleging that Syed Mohammed had attempted to murder him following a dispute over returning a two-wheeler left for repair. Based on the complaint, the accused was being interrogated at the police station.

During the interrogation, Kalidass claimed, Syed Mohammed attempted to assault him with a knife and in self-defence he fired three rounds from his service revolver at the accused. Had he not opened fire, he would have been stabbed to death by the accused, he said.

He also claimed that even when the accused was secured by the police, he had abused them under the influence of alcohol and used filthy language against them. He had no motive to kill the accused, he said and appealed against the life sentence awarded to him.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/hc-grants-bail-to-suspended-si-madurai-ramanathapuram/article30873382.ece
356,2020/02/20,Fisherman ‘shot at’ by SL Navy,"He was admitted in Madurai Aravind Eye Hospital

Jesu, 55, a fisherman of Rameswaram, was allegedly shot at by Sri Lankan Navy personnel on Wednesday.

Fishermen association leaders from the island town demanded immediate action against the Sri Lankan Navy and urged the officials concerned to raise the issue and save the lives of fishermen.

After the new government took over in the island nation, fishermen from coastal pockets of Rameswaram have been facing hurdles, the leaders said in a memorandum submitted to the Collector and Deputy Director Fisheries Department.

The police said a group of fishermen, who had gone for fishing on Wednesday, suddenly heard gun shots hitting their boats. In the confusion, fisherman Jesu was hit by a “bullet” on his right eye. According to government hospital doctors here, they suspected some foreign body had hit the patient after piercing through the boat where he was seated.

On reference, the fisherman was rushed to Aravind Eye Hospital Madurai as the case looked complicated, a doctor here said.

When fishermen community accompanied by their family members assembled before the fisheries department demanding action, officials said the fisherman was out of danger and doctors at the Aravind Eye Hospital had advised multiple surgeries and he was being taken care of well by a team of doctors.

357,2020/02/20,CM to inaugurate Rajaji Park,"The lacklustre Rajaji Park here, which was gradually losing sheen for the past several years due to poor maintenance, has been given a new lease of life on an outlay of ₹ 1.77 crore under the Smart City programme.

Though the park with age-old trees attracts a decent crowd in the morning and the evening, no maintenance was taken up in the past in a big way. Consequently, the park was virtually neglected gradually.

When the corporation decided to renew it under the Smart City programme, ₹ 1.77 crore was allocated. With this allocation, the corporation has renewed the park with fish tank, walkers’ path for about 180 metres, yoga shed, fountain, colourful seats, play equipment for children and gym. As the existing ground-level sump has given way for the fish tank, a range of colourful fishes are to be released here.

Since the renewed park is to be opened by Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Saturday as he is scheduled to visit the port town, beautification work has moved to top gear.

“The Chief Minister is likely to visit the Thoothukudi Medical College Hospital to inaugurate new facilities in the Departments of Cardiology and Oncology. Since the Rajaji Park shares boundary with the Medical College Hospital, we expect that the Chief Minister may spend a few minutes in renewed Rajaji Park,” said a senior official attached to the corporation.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/cm-to-inaugurate-rajaji-park/article30872735.ece
358,2020/02/20,Hundreds of Muslims attempt to lay siege to Madurai Collectorate,"The anti-CAA protesters disperse after police deny permission

Hundreds of Muslims belonging to various organisations and political parties on Wednesday were stopped by police when they attempted to lay siege to the Collectorate here in protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

The protest, which was called by Jamath-Ul-Ulama Sabai, saw women participating in good numbers. The agitators from across the city and suburbs started gathering near Tamil Sangam Building at Tallakulam to proceed towards the Collectorate.

However, a huge posse of police personnel led by Commissioner of Police S. Davidson Devasirvatham put up several layers of barricades en route and stopped the agitators near Corporation swimming pool.

The protesters, who carried the national flag and placards, raised slogans against the Centre for passage of the Act and attempt to take up a national register of citizens.

The police repeatedly announced through the public address system that their petition seeking permission to lay siege to the Collectorate had been denied and wanted them to disperse.

Representatives of the ulamas announced that a team would meet Collector T.G. Vinay and submit a petition seeking the revocation of CAA. “We will insist that the State Government pass a resolution in the Assembly during the current session against the NPR, NRC and CAA, which were unconstitutional and sought to divide the people on religious lines,” they said.

After repeated appeals made by the representatives that they should cooperate with the police and leave the spot, the agitators started to disperse.

Police sealed all roads leading to the Collectorate. Senior police officials, including Deputy Commissioners of Police, were posted at vantage points.

360,2020/02/20,Coast Guard begins pollution response exercise,"A two-day State-level pollution response exercise under the auspices of the Coast Guard Karnataka began here on Thursday.

The exercise, the first such this year, was conducted to validate and reinforce the response mechanism for oil pollution incidents and enable the Indian Coast Guard to fine tune the actions required in such eventualities.

Other stakeholders such as New Mangalore Port Trust, Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd, Indian Oil Corporation Ltd also took part in the exercise, according to Deputy Inspector General S.B. Venkatesh, Commander, Coast Guard Karnataka.

The coast guard is responsible for marine environment protection in the maritime zones of India. It is the coordinating authority for response to oil spills in Indian waters, he said in a release.

It has drawn up a National Oil Spill Disaster Contingency Plan, and has established pollution response centres at Mumbai, Chennai and Port Blair. A robust national system for oil spill response is critical for a major economy like India as 75 per cent of the country’s oil imports are through the sea, he said.

A table top exercise simulating oil spill from a tanker was conduced on Thursday. A real time demonstration of oil spill scenario would be conducted on Friday.

Anniversary

Meanwhile, the Karnataka unit of the coast guard celebrated its 29th anniversary at its State headquarters here on Thursday.

Speaking on the occasion Mr. Venkatesh recalled the origin of the headquarters from February, 1991 when a small coast guard contingent was placed here under the leadership of Deputy Commandant K. Rajendra who assumed the duties of Commander.

“Since then the headquarters has continued to grow, modify and emerge more efficient over the years,” he said.

Today, the State headquarters provides logistical, technical and administrative support to units under the command and units that call on the New Mangalore Port, he said.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/coast-guard-begins-pollution-response-exercise/article30874153.ece
361,2020/02/20,‘Many fishing boats don’t have documents and life jackets’,"This came to light during Coast Guard’s ‘Operation Sajag’

The ‘Operation Sajag’, a coastal security exercise conducted by the Indian Coast Guard in Karnataka on Wednesday keeping fishermen in focus, has helped to identify many drawbacks, according to Deputy Inspector General S. B. Venkatesh, Commander, Coast Guard Karnataka.

In an informal chat on the sidelines of the 29th anniversary of establishing the coast guard’s Karnataka unit in Mangaluru on Thursday, he said the fishing boats operating in the State’s coast were checked whether they had mandatory documents and life jackets required while in sea.

“We noticed that many such boats did not have the mandatory documents and life jackets. The matter would be taken up with the fisheries department,” he said. The commander said wearing life jackets while fishing is very important. It is especially so during rainy season when there would be adverse weather.

The operation helped the coast guard to check if fishermen were taking the mandated precautionary measures while sailing. These included ensuring that their distress alert transmitters were in working order, Mr. Venkatesh said.

The commander said the proposal to set up a hover port for its two hover crafts or air-cushion vessels is in the final stages. In addition, moves are on to have separate hangars for its three interceptor crafts at the coast guard’s air enclave in Bajpe to park the Dorniers permanently in Bajpe. The government has given in-principle approval for setting the country’s first Coast Guard Training Academy in Mangaluru on about 160 acre land. The academy will provide specialised training for coast guard personnel, the Commander said.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/7ksg63/article30874143.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/S21BGCG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/many-fishing-boats-dont-have-documents-and-life-jackets/article30874144.ece

Inaugurating the workshop, KCCI president Issac Vas said that there were three types of entrepreneurs — those who do business solely for profit, those who believe in giving the best products and services to consumers and lastly, those who want to bring about change. “Entrepreneurs are dreamers who want to make a difference. To be an entrepreneur one should be brilliant and also crazy,” he said.

He advised the delegates to harbour high entrepreneurial vision. “The world is changing demographically and there is enough space for new entrants in business,” he said and added that “Profit is no longer the first objective. Today, moral capital and social obligations are considered to be of greater importance.”

The objective of the workshop was to enable the participants to understand the processes, challenges, risks and rewards involved in starting a new business. It also aimed to equip them with tools required to start their own business and to provide deep understanding on legal procedures required for start-ups.

About 90 delegates — from corporates, faculty members and students — attended the workshop. Women’s National Education Society president Kudpi Jagadish Shenoy and institute director Molly S.

He was delivering the keynote address at the inauguration of a two-day national seminar on “Indian economy in transition: Prospects and challenges of cooperatives” at the University College here. Mr. Marathe said that there were over 65,000 cooperatives in the country that were running profitably. Profit can be earned through extension and proper planning in cooperative mode, he said.

In his inaugural address, Mangalore University Registrar A.M. Khan said that the “growing together” policy of the cooperative sector can boost Indian economy in the present juncture. Recalling the white revolution and green revolution, he said that cooperative policies should help the downtrodden, while the corporate style of functioning does not suit the sector.

Speaking on the occasion, CAMPCO president S.R. Sathishchandra said that the cooperative policy was nothing but a lifestyle and primary cooperative system was like the cradle of democracy. With the help of green, white and knowledge revolution, India has turned to become a superpower in the world, he said.

Stating that India has lakhs of cooperative entities, Sahakara Bharathi National General Secretary Udaya Vasudeva Joshi said that their presence should help the sustainable development of downtrodden.

Additional Deputy Commissioner Sadashiva Prabhu said on Wednesday that Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, known for his ideals and indomitable courage, was an inspiration to the youth.

He was speaking at the Chhatrapati Shivaji Jayanti celebrations organised by the Udupi district administration, the Udupi Zilla Panchayat and the Department of Kannada and Culture here.

Mr. Prabhu said that Chhatrapati Shivaji was known for the battles he led against the suzerainty of the Mughal empire in the country. He was known for his adventurous spirit. The youth should follow the ideals of Chhatrapati Shivaji and become good citizens of the country, he said.

Dinesh Nayak, leader of the Maratha community, said that Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was an able administrator. He provided good governance in his entire kingdom. It was necessary to tell about the life and achievements of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj to the children, he said.

Seshashayana Karinja, Deputy Director of Public Instruction, Prakash Rao Kavade, Keshav Rao, leaders of the Maratha community, and departmental heads, were present. Assistant Director of Kannada and Culture Kumar Bekkeri welcomed the gathering.

He was speaking after inaugurating a national seminar on “ Advances in Nanotechnology and Environmental Chemistry for Sustainable Development” organised by MGM College here.

Mr. Prabhu said that nanotechnology was affecting almost all sectors, including healthcare, food processing and biotechnology. Advances in nanotechnology would also help in conservation of environment, he said.

Registrar of Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE) Narayan Sabhahith said that sustainability of environment was important. Population on the planet had increased rapidly in the last 200 years.

During the ancient times, the human settlement was along the course of rivers because people needed water to survive and for other purposes also, he said.

As long as population was less, there were no problems. But with the constant increase in population leading to the present levels, this had put a strain on the rivers and water bodies, he said.

High population had led to increase in pollution, which was putting pressure on environment. It was becoming unsustainable, he said.

The other problem was consumption of resources, which would pose a problem in the future. If the 10 % of the affluent population in the world reduced their consumption of resources, sustainability could be attained, he said.

Recycling and reuse of products should be given importance. Management of waste water was a big challenge in a small city such as Udupi. Hence, waste water management should be given importance, Dr. Sabhahith said.

Associate Professor, Department of Atomic and Molecular Physics, MAHE, Suresh D. Kulkarni, delivered the keynote address. College principal M.G. Vijay presided over the inaugural function. MGM PU College principal Malati Devi was present.

368,2020/02/20,Kambala Samiti proposes uniform track length,"It says this will remove confusion in maintaining records

The District Kambala Samiti, representing Kambala buffalo owners from Kasaragod, Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts, is contemplating to introduce uniform track length (Kare) for Kambala events across the region to rule out confusion about the time taken by buffaloes and jockeys to complete the race.

Samiti president P.R. Shetty said that a uniform track of 135m for the 20-odd Kambala events held will be implemented from the next season.

He said the lengths of tracks vary at Kambala locations across the region thus creating confusion in maintaining records and documents.

Irrespective of track’s physical length, the samiti has decided to fix the race length at 135m, Mr. Shetty said.

The samiti has also decided to introduce laser=beam technology at the starting point to exactly record the start time, Mr. Shetty said. At present, it is used only at the finishing point. The measure would produce accurate results, he added.

Mr. Shetty also said the samiti is planning to build a Kambala Bhavan in the region to facilitate its activities and offer training to jockeys.

It will be built either at Miyar in Karkala taluk or at Pilikula near Mangaluru, he said. The samiti will hold discussions with legislators and MPs of the region on all the three proposals before arriving at a final decision, Mr. Shetty added.

369,2020/02/20,Westinghouse set to sign pact with Nuclear Power Corporation of India for reactors during Donald Trump visit,"The agreement will lay out timelines and the lead local constructor for the reactors to be built at Kovvada in Andhra Pradesh.

U.S. energy firm Westinghouse is expected to sign a new agreement with the Nuclear Power Corporation of India for the supply of six nuclear reactors during U.S. President Donald Trump's visit, officials said, aiming to kickstart a long-running project.

The agreement will lay out timelines and the lead local constructor for the reactors to be built at Kovvada in Andhra Pradesh and also address lingering concerns over India's nuclear liability law.

The United States has been discussing the sale of nuclear reactors to energy-hungry India since a 2008 landmark civil nuclear energy pact and last year the two governments announced they were committed to the establishment of the six reactors.

Last week, representatives from U.S. energy and commerce departments, Westinghouse, the U.S.-India Strategic Partnership Forum and The Nuclear Energy Institute were in India for talks with government officials as part of a commercial mission to promote nuclear exports to India.

“We are encouraging moving forward with Westinghouse and NPCIL to sign a MoU. It certainly is a private industry to private industry, a business to business decision,” Rita Baranwal assistant secretary for the Office of Nuclear Energy in the U.S. Department of Energy, told Reuters in a phone interview.

“We're optimistic that an MoU will be signed shortly,” Dr. Baranwal, who was part of the mission, said. Once that is cleared the two sides will begin contract negotiations, delivery schedules and pick vendors. The plan for a new MoU has not been previously reported.

Westinghouse did not respond to a request for comment nor did NPCIL. But Ministry of External Affairs spokesman Raveesh Kumar said on February 20 that Westinghouse and NPCIL were in talks to move forward with the project. “Following resolution of Westinghouse's bankruptcy issues, the two sides are in discussion regarding the division of responsibility of the work,” he said.

Mr. Trump has made bilateral trade with India a top priority, seeking greater market access for U.S. products from farm goods to motorcycles. Negotiators are trying to put together a limited trade deal before a bigger agreement that Mr. Trump said this week will probably happen after the U.S. Presidential elections.

Lack of movement on the nuclear reactors has been a sensitive issue, another member of the U.S. delegation said, after Washington made an exception for India by agreeing to provide it civilian nuclear energy technology even though it has not given up its nuclear weapons programme.

A longstanding obstacle has been the need to bring Indian liability rules in line with international norms, which require the costs of any accident to be channelled to the operator rather than the maker of a nuclear power station.

Pittsburgh-based Westinghouse's plans to supply the AP1000 reactors to India which it has also sold to China were thrown into further doubt when it filed for bankruptcy in 2017 after cost overruns on U.S. reactors.

Liability law

Canada's Brookfield Asset Management bought Westinghouse from Toshiba in August 2018 and has sought progress on the India sale over the next six-seven months, the member of the U.S. delegation said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

India has made clear there is no going back on the 2010 Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage law that foreign governments and vendors say leaves open the possibility of lawsuits against suppliers for nuclear accidents, rather than the operators of the plants.

The Narendra Modi government has tried to limit the impact of that law by setting up an insurance fund for potential victims of a nuclear accident.

“To be clear, there are still open issues around the liability issue,” Dr. Baranwal said, adding it was part of the discussions last week. “I can't say that it's been resolved. But we made some progress and understanding was that concerns were at a higher level.”

India expects to generate 22,480 MW of electricity from nuclear stations by 2031 up from the 2019 level of 6780 MW.

370,2020/02/20,"Vehicle registrations sputter, slide 7% on poor sentiment","Lack of demand boosters in Budget impacts retail auto sector in January: FADA

The automobile sector continued to ply on the slow lane in January 2020 with total vehicles registrations declining 7.17% year-on-year as per FADA data, indicating the persisting contraction in the sector.

Except for three-wheelers and tractors, all other segments witnessed contraction as per the monthly vehicle registration data released by the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA).

As per the data, two- wheeler registrations declined by 8.82% year-on- year while passenger vehicles registrations plunged 4.61% and commercial vehicles by 6.89%.

On the other hand, registrations of three-wheelers showed a growth of 9.17% while tractor registrations rose by 5.11%.

This is the first time that tractors have been included in the list. “Auto sales continue to be in the negative territory in the month of January,” FADA president Ashish Harsharaj Kale said.

“Except for three-wheelers, others suffered, with many consumers still not concluding their purchase decisions,” he added.

“The ongoing transition of BS-IV to BS-VI is also a factor in the delayed purchase decisions.” Mr. Kale said the overall weak economic sentiment continues in the market and “even the Union Budget, although an inclusive one with growth drivers for the mid to long- term, did not have any direct measures to spur growth in the sector.”

‘BS-IV units returnable’

“The last 14 months has seen one of its toughest times in auto sales. FADA has, therefore, requested the OEM’s, through the SIAM, that any BS-IV vehicle billed further, which is not against specific customer order, to be on returnable basis to avoid financial loss to our members,” Mr. Kale said.

He said the association will also co-ordinate with banks and NBFCs to ensure financing of BS-1V inventory till the stock is liquidated before March 31 and for the smooth transition to BS-VI without any financial implications to any stakeholder.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/ubnazj/article29771442.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/automobile-sector-NKV,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/vehicle-registrations-sputter-slide-7-on-poor-sentiment/article30873580.ece

372,2020/02/20,A diminished Victoria’s Secret is sold,"The company’s owner, L Brands, said that the private-equity firm Sycamore Brands will buy 55% of Victoria’s Secret for about $525 million

Victoria’s Secret, beset by falling sales and uncomfortable questions about a billionaire founder who has run the company for five decades, is being sold.

The company’s owner, L Brands, said that the private-equity firm Sycamore Brands will buy 55% of Victoria’s Secret for about $525 million. The Columbus, Ohio company will keep the remaining 45% stake. After the sale, L Brands will be left with its Bath & Body Works chain.

Victoria’s Secret will become a private company.

Les Wexner, who founded the company in 1963, will step down as chairman and CEO after the transaction is completed and become chairman emeritus.

The selling price signifies a marked decline for a brand with hundreds of stores that booked about $7 billion in revenue last year. Shares of L Brands, slid more than 7% on Thursday.

“We believe the separation of Victoria’s Secret Lingerie, Victoria’s Secret Beauty and PINK into a privately held company provides the best path to restoring these businesses to their historic levels of profitability and growth,” said Mr. Wexner in a prepared statement. “Sycamore, which has deep experience in the retail industry and a superior track record of success, will bring a fresh perspective and greater focus to the business.”

Sales at Victoria’s Secret stores are in decline because competition is increasing and tastes are changing. Rivals like Adore Me and ThirdLove, which have sprouted up online, offer more options for diverse body types.

Victoria’s Secret suffered a 12% drop in same-store sales during the most recent holiday season. L Brands said on Thursday that same-store sales declined 10% at Victoria’s Secret during the fourth quarter. Bath & Body Works, which has been a bright spot, is now mostly a candle business, says Randal J. Konik, an analyst at Jefferies.

“The [Victoria’s Secret] brand has lost its way, while the lingerie market is not large or high growth, and has become commoditised,” Mr. Konik wrote on Thursday. “Furthermore, with athleisure taking over, the need for regular bras continues to wane.”

Victoria’s Secret lit up runways and clogged up the internet with its supermodels and an annual television special that mixed fashion, beauty and music.

That glamour has faded and so have sales. The show has been pulled from network television and shares of Victoria’s Secret, which went for triple digits less than five years ago, now cost a quarter of that.

The company has been beset by allegations of a toxic work environment and its founder recently apologised for his ties to Jeffrey Epstein, who was found hanged in prison after being indicted on sex-trafficking charges.

Epstein started managing Mr. Wexner’s money in the late 1980s and helped straighten out the finances for a real estate development backed by Mr. Wexner in a wealthy suburb of Columbus. Mr. Wexner has said he completely severed ties with Epstein nearly 12 years ago and accused him of misappropriating “vast sums” of his fortune.

Mr. Wexner offered an apology at the opening address of L Brands’ annual investor day last fall, saying he was “embarrassed” by his former ties with Epstein.

Mr. Wexner is the longest-serving CEO of an S&P 500 company. He founded what would eventually become L Brands in 1963 with The Limited retail store, according to the company’s website. Mr. Wexner owns approximately 16.71% of L Brands, according to FactSet.

Sycamore has about $10 billion in assets under management. The firm’s investment portfolio includes retailers such as Belk, Coldwater Creek, Hot Topic and Talbots.

“The separation of Victoria’s Secret into a private entity will enable L Brands to reduce debt and focus on its strong core business of Bath & Body Works, which represents over 80% of its operating income,” said Moody’s vice president Christina Boni.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/y9vd1d/article30873320.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20THLTVICTORIASSECRET-SALE,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/a-diminished-victorias-secret-is-sold/article30873321.ece

Automobile dealers’ body FADA on Thursday said passenger vehicle (PV) retail sales in January declined 4.61% to 2,90,879 units as compared to same month last year, hit by tepid response by end customers.

According to Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA), which collected vehicle registration data from 1,223 out of the 1,432 regional transport offices (RTOs), PV sales stood at 3,04,929 units in January 2019.

Two-wheeler sales declined 8.82% to 12,67,366 units last month as compared with 13,89,951 units in January 2019.

Commercial vehicle sales declined 6.89% to 82,187 units as compared to 88,271 units in January 2019.

Three-wheeler sales, however, rose 9.17% to 63,514 units last month as compared with 58,178 units in January 2019.

Total sales across categories declined 7.17% to 17,50,116 units last month as against 18,85,253 units in the year-ago month.

“Auto sales continue to be in the negative territory in the month of January, except for three wheelers, with many consumers still not concluding on their decisions. Ongoing transition of BS-IV to BS-VI is also a factor in delayed purchase decision,” FADA President Ashish Harsharaj Kale said in a statement.

Overall weak economic sentiment continues and even the Budget 2020, although an inclusive budget with growth drivers for the mid to long term, did not have any direct measures nor any immediate growth enabling initiatives for the auto sector, he added.

On sales outlook, Mr. Kale said with continued weak consumer sentiment and the overall economic situation as well as the upcoming transition to BS-VI regime, the near-term demand situation will continue to be dynamic.

The defence business of Airbus on Wednesday laid out plans to cut more than 2,300 jobs, citing a flat space market and postponed defence contracts.

The aircraft maker said its Airbus Defence and Space division had entered consultation with the company's European works council on the planned cutbacks.

The plan foresees the reduction of 2,362 positions until the end of 2021, of which 829 would be in Germany, 357 in Britain, 630 in Spain, 404 in France and 141 in other countries, according to a statement.

The head of the defence business said on Saturday that talks were about to start with labour representatives as the German-based group retrenches following setbacks with its A400M military transporter.

Recurring technical problems with the A400M led the German air force to refuse delivery of two of the aircraft last autumn.

The group has also taken a €1.2 billion ($1.3 billion) charge on the worsening sales outlook, with a German ban on defence exports to Saudi Arabia causing Airbus Defence and Space to lose a promising potential customer, Dirk Hoke said.

380,2020/02/20,Turning ships into museums,"Decommissioned naval vessels can be given a makeover

In the Union Budget, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced a set of initiatives to enhance India’s potential as a tourism and cultural destination. Among the proposals, the decision to set up a maritime museum at Lothal in Gujarat was especially noteworthy. However, when it comes to augmenting the country’s maritime tourism potential by preserving retired naval vessels as museums, India’s record has been weak.

Here, two decisions taken last year have implications for the idea of a maritime museum. First, the Tamil Nadu government in July decided to drop the project to preserve the decommissioned submarine INS Vagli as a museum. Second, it was decided that the INS Viraat would be scrapped. Not long ago, in 2014, India’s first aircraft carrier, the INS Vikrant, had met with a similar fate.

Creating employment

It makes tremendous economic sense to preserve decommissioned naval vessels, rather than scrapping them. In general, museums make an important contribution to the economy in many ways, for instance, by promoting tourism, creating jobs, contributing to government revenues and aiding the development of local communities. A 2018 study titled ‘Museums as Economic Engines’ revealed that in the U.S., museums contribute $50 billion every year to the Gross Domestic Product, provide jobs to 7,26,200 people and generate $12 billion per year in tax revenue. Every $100 of output generated in the museum sector generates an additional $220 of output in other areas of the U.S. economy. Another study titled ‘The Economic Impact of Museums in England’ estimated that the direct economic impact of the museum sector in England was £2.64 billion in income, £1.45 billion in output and 38,165 in jobs.

A major challenge facing India is the need to generate adequate employment opportunities for the abundant youth population. Estimates show that in terms of employment elasticity, defined as the percentage change in employment for a one percentage point change in economic growth, services is an employment-intensive sector. Therefore, the focus should be on promoting services industries where employment potential is high. Tourism and allied industries fit into this requirement as they have proved to be top job-generating sectors across the world.

Excellent museums often turn out to be a fine tourist attraction that draws in visitors, both local and overseas. They also act as places of historical value, preserving a country’s heritage for future generations and offering knowledge to the public about the nation’s history and culture. Military and maritime museums bring some added benefits — they can be used to honour military heroes, make the general public aware of the hardships faced by defence personnel and, also, inspire the younger generation to join the armed forces.

Partnering with private sector

When viewed from these angles, repurposing decommissioned submarines and aircraft carriers into museums makes economic and social sense. There are 60 such submarine-turned-museums in the U.S.; 11 in the U.K.; 10 in Russia and Germany and five in France. Similarly, many countries have preserved their retired naval warships as museums, with the U.S. again topping the list. India has been preserving only one naval vessel, the INS Kursura, as a submarine museum in Visakhapatnam.

A significant, and genuine, concern about naval vessel museums is the cost involved in their maintenance. They require both public and private funding and need to generate sufficient revenue. Private sector involvement in building cultural institutions has worked very well in advanced nations. There is no reason why, in today’s India, this should not be possible.

Either through a nudge or a directive, the government can ensure that corporates allot a portion of their Corporate Social Responsibility spending towards conservation of heritage and culture.

That said, a mere display of retired naval vessels will not attract the desired number of visitors. For this, warship museums need to offer a range of services and entertainment options. They need to include virtual flight zones with simulators; and allow events and shows to be hosted on them. Many Indian cities have limited entertainment options. Naval-vessel museums would provide an alternative mode of entertainment.

Support from the private sector is necessary to realise the business potential of such museums and impart professionalism in their management. In this context, it is important to recall how the active participation of the private sector revolutionised football and kabaddi. It is high time we made proper use of the private sector to preserve our retired naval vessels.

381,2020/02/20,A mandate from the youthful multitudes,"The youth and women of Delhi, not the leaders, set the tone for a resounding rejection of Hindutva

The people have spoken in the Delhi election. So has Home Minister Amit Shah. He admitted earlier this month that provocative slogans by a few of his Cabinet colleagues and party members during the campaign may have contributed to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s loss. But he also wondered aloud in the same breath, “Who knows why the people of Delhi voted the way they did.” Was this an expression of genuine remorse or a show of disappointment?

Arvind Kejriwal won handsomely. But the victory of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and, more pertinently, the defeat of the BJP has a message that goes much beyond the results. The election was clearly a clash of two ideologies and a contest for two visions of India. One is about fashioning India into a ‘Hindu’ nation in the image of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) — the ideological fount of BJP — an image that is distinct from the idea and ethos of India and philosophy of Hinduism as enunciated in the Upanishads and Gita and interpreted by the likes of Mahatma Gandhi, Rabindranath Tagore, Ramakrishna Paramahansa, Swami Vivekananda and many eminent philosophers of the East and the West. It is a zealous, jingoistic and parochial interpretation of Hinduism called ‘Hindutva’ where nationalism and patriotism are equated to a subscription of the ironclad ideology that the BJP espouses. The other vision is composed of a universal spirit, a philosophy that embraces all creation. And the latter won.

Focus on livelihood issues

It is true that Mr. Kejriwal never openly drew a sword and invited Mr. Shah and Prime Minister Narendra Modi to a direct duel on the two ideologies but spoke mostly of issues pertaining to education, school, water, electricity and governance and delivery. And, in the end, the mandate was unambiguous — voters of Delhi soundly rejected Hindutva forces this time. While Mr. Shah and his party invoked their own version of Ram and equated those with a differing, nobler idea of Ram to Pakistan sympathisers, Mr. Kejriwal paid obeisance to Hanuman but without any collateral demands of loyalty. The BJP turned this election into a Hindu-Muslim, nationalism-anti nationalism referendum instead of a governance and developmental contest. And the party’s chosen, proprietary ‘god’ clearly failed it.

In stark contrast to the BJP’s interpretation of Hinduism stands Mahatma Gandhi, a devout and proud Hindu and, at the same time, an embodiment of love for all his fellow beings. Embracing Hinduism for the Mahatma was never in conflict with subscribing to elements of Islamic or Christian schools of thought.

True, Mr. Kejriwal is no Gandhi. He is erratic and often abrasive and perennially in a confrontation mode. He has been criticised by intellectuals and secularists for not visiting Shaheen Bagh, Jawaharlal Nehru University or Jamia Millia Islamia and for dodging questions on the issues of anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protests and police violence in the capital. During the campaign and later, Mr. Kejriwal remained astute and canny. Not crossing swords with Mr. Modi or Mr. Shah was a poll strategy for him. He won by controlling the narrative and, instead of playing into the hands of Mr. Shah, deftly navigating the minefield the BJP was trying to draw him into, and harping on the AAP’s record on good governance and issues of livelihood. And it was the BJP which side-stepped these burning issues — the ‘Modi mantra’ that in fact catapulted the BJP to power in 2014.

What influenced the voters

Yet, there is a larger pan-India message from this election. It is no longer the politicians who are steering the discourse and narrative on matters of serious import to the country. It is not the BJP that is in command now, though it succeeded through polarisation in the 2019 general elections; it is not Mr. Kejriwal either, though his victory brought relief and gave some insight into where the majority community stood on communal issues and what mattered to them; and it is certainly not the Congress Party, which is rudderless; or the regional chieftains, none of whom has a pan-India appeal or presence. It is not the courts or the intellectuals in command. It is the youth across the country and, of late, the women leading the fight against communal, divisive and hate politics, who are influencing the voters today. These agitators, with their stoic courage and resilience, are demanding justice and freedom to dissent and lighting up the torch of democracy. In a role reversal, they are inspiring the celebrities, intellectuals, and leaders of civil society and breathing hope and optimism where darkness and despair reigned before.

It is remarkable and laudable that these people have risen spontaneously in one voice. It seems as though uncannily and collectively, they have understood that the Opposition is incapable of speaking up for them. They have realised that they need to stand up for themselves against the arrogance, venality and might of the state that is threatening their very future and tearing up the marvellous and cohesive social fabric that held India together. There was a Gandhi, a Bose, a Patel, a Nehru against the British; a J.P. Narayan to take on the dictatorship of Indira Gandhi; an Anna against the UPA’s corruption and crony politics but this time around, there is no one leader leading the movement. It is as though the sea has risen.

The people of this country are now under the spell of the youth — these are intrepid young men and women from every social strata and religious and caste denomination; these are the silent women whose silent protests are more eloquent than all the fiery speeches. It is these people who have left an impression on the voters and made an impact on their voting choices. This is the answer to Mr. Shah’s bewildered remark at the recent summit: “Who knows why the people of Delhi voted the way they did.”

If the politicians care to listen to the message people have sent through the mandate in the Delhi election, it is this: Don’t use religion for votes. Focus on governance. Create jobs. Improve standards of living of people. There are enough laws and provisions in the Constitution to deal with any kind of threats to the country. The many institutions and arms of the government, both at the State and Centre, can take care of the various, serious problems facing the country, including citizenship issues. Do not interfere with and influence the institutions. Don’t demand allegiance to the ruling party. The people’s allegiance is to the rule of law. Their fealty is to the Constitution.

The youth and women have risen and given hope for the country. If the politicians don’t heed their warning and meet their demands they will surely rein the leaders in. Their gods, then, may not be enough to hoist them to power.

382,2020/02/20,"By agreeing to Partition, Congress kept India united","Else, India would have been a fragmented entity

It has become a fashion these days to blame the Congress for Partition. Certain sections of the right, who in fact became the prime beneficiaries of Partition, are the leading proponents of this thesis. Had Partition not taken place, the demographic exigencies of undivided India, with a Muslim population of 25%-30%; and five, and possibly six, Muslim majority provinces, among them Bengal and Punjab would have rendered the parties espousing Hindutva permanently irrelevant. But this is a topic for another time. If the Congress leadership, especially Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, had not accepted the division of the country, it could well have led to the dismemberment of India as we know it today. The reasons are as follows.

What was on offer as an alternative to Partition was the Cabinet Mission Plan of 1946. This plan not only envisaged a loose federal structure with a very weak centre, it could be called a ‘crypto-Pakistan plus’. It not only grouped provinces on the basis of religious majorities, it left the issue of the princely states’ future as a matter of discussion between the princes and the weak centre that it envisioned. The central authority would have then had a very weak hand to play against the wily princely rulers, both Hindu and Muslim, who would have joined hands with each other and with the Muslim League in defence of their common interest to further weaken the centre.

Cabinet Mission Plan

Moreover, documentary evidence, especially the resolution of the Muslim League Council in June 1946 that accepted the Cabinet Mission Plan, proves that the Muslim League’s acceptance was premised on the belief that the Plan was a stepping stone towards the ultimate formation of Pakistan, which to quote the resolution was its “unalterable objective”. The League inferred this from the Cabinet Mission Plan’s provision that said that “any Province by majority vote of its Legislative Assembly could call for a reconsideration of the terms of the Constitution after an initial period of ten years and at ten-yearly intervals thereafter.” Hence the Plan did not rule out the dissolution of the Union if provinces made a demand.

Furthermore, the working of the interim government formed in September 1946 made it clear that the Muslim League was bent on thwarting its smooth functioning. It was the feeling that the interim government was like a chariot being pulled in two different directions that convinced Patel that Partition was the only way to save India from becoming a totally dysfunctional state. In his own famous words, “In order to keep India united it must be divided.” It was Patel who convinced Nehru that Partition was better than an eternally fragmented India.

Nehru, whose opposition to Partition was based on his unstinted commitment to secularism, which refused to encounter the idea of India bring divided on communal lines, finally realised that his vision of a modern and strong Indian state could not be achieved with the Muslim League, in power in Bengal and Punjab, thwarting it at every step. With Patel and Nehru convinced of the necessity for Partition, the rest of the Congress Working Committee, except Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, who voted against it, and Maulana Azad, who abstained, accepted the plan.

Historical evidence based on impartial scholarship demonstrates that had the Congress Party not accepted the Partition plan, India today would have been a weak state and a divided polity barely able to keep itself together and constantly teetering on the brink of collapse. The Congress did a favour to the country by accepting its division in order to save it from collapse or dismemberment. This is a historically verifiable fact that cannot be refuted by partisan propaganda.

383,2020/02/20,"A Trump India visit, in campaign mode","With a trade deal unlikely, New Delhi must calibrate the costs and benefits of the U.S. President’s political tour

During U.S. President Donald Trump’s maiden visit to India on February 24-25, the U.S. and India were initially expected to sign a limited trade deal. Over the past three years, U.S.-India trade tensions have been escalating despite America’s trade deficit with India beginning to narrow and it being less than a tenth of the U.S.’s trade deficit with China.

As trade negotiations stalled, the Trump administration levied steel and aluminium tariffs on India, revoked India’s benefits under the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) programme, briefly contemplated limiting H1-B visas quota for Indians to 15% due to divergences on e-commerce policy, and raised the possibility of a Section 301 investigation into India’s tariff/non-tariff barriers to coerce India to eliminate practices that impede U.S. exports.

Defence package

India has reportedly finalised a defence package worth $3.5-billion for 24 MH-60R Seahawk maritime multi-role helicopters and six AH-64E Apache attack helicopters. In exchange, the expectation for India was the restoration of benefits under the GSP programme — under which, Indian exports worth $5.7-billion to the U.S. enjoyed duty-free status (2017).

However, a day after Mr. Trump’s visit dates were announced, the United States Trade Representative (USTR) released a federal notice on eliminating a host of countries from its methodology for countervailing duty (CVD) investigations. India was removed from the list of developing countries that “are exempt from investigations into whether they harm American industry with unfairly subsidised exports”. With this move, the U.S. essentially closed the door on reinstating India’s benefits under the GSP, a preferential arrangement meant only for developing countries.

The timing of this move suggests Mr. Trump’s motivations pertaining to his India visit have little to do with tempering bilateral frictions. Instead, political motivations seem to be writ large. New Delhi will have to carefully calibrate the costs and benefits of Mr. Trump’s move.

‘America first’

Earlier this month, the U.S. Senate voted to acquit Trump on two articles of impeachment — abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. It was an expected outcome, as polarisation in American politics has accentuated with the U.S. Congress being divided into two partisan strongholds — the Democrats are in-charge of the House of Representatives and Republicans hold the Senate. However, given the fact that the impeachment proceedings prolonged well into an election year, the American electorate has not heard the last of it just yet. Mr. Trump was alleged to have sought a quid pro quo over U.S. military aid to Ukraine, in exchange for Ukraine’s assistance in acquiring dirt on former U.S. Vice-President and now Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. In the upcoming elections, the allegation is expected to feature prominently in the Democrats’ attempt to deride the Trump administration’s values-bereft, transactional conduct of U.S. foreign policy. Concurrently, Mr. Trump has begun to hail his Senate acquittal as a matter of total exoneration. Moreover, in discrediting Democrats’ criticism on Mr. Trump’s conduct of American international relations in general, his re-election campaign is sure to outline the supposed gains of the “America First” world view.

It is here that a potential trade deal with “tariff king” India would be listed among other renewed partial/complete trade deals such as the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA); renegotiated trade terms with South Korea, and Japan; and the “Phase One” deal with China, as instances of vindication. For instance, just days before the Democrats’ caucus in Iowa, Mr. Trump held a rally in Des Moines, Iowa. Citing his renewed trade deals and the Democrats’ opposition to his approach of exacting them, Mr. Trump said, “We’re going to win the great state of Iowa and it’s going to be a historic landslide.” He added, “And if we don’t win, your farms are going to hell.”

‘Namaste, Trump’

Moreover, with the India visit, the U.S. President has expressed his exhilaration over “millions and millions of people” that are expected to attend the “Namaste, Trump” event in Ahmedabad. With its pomp and ceremony, it is expected to be the Indian iteration of the “Howdy, Modi!” rally held late last year in Houston. Evidently, the same was an attempt to court the 270,000-strong Indian American community in the emerging battleground state of Texas. Similarly, the rally in Gujarat also holds relevance in terms of Mr. Trump’s political arithmetic for 2020. In visiting Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s home turf, one can see the American President’s attempt to mobilise the Indian American community by showcasing his proximity to Mr. Modi’s India.

Mr. Trump’s political motivations notwithstanding, it would be prudent for India to not let the visit reflect as a partisan endorsement for his re-election. In recent years, American political polarisation has begun to erode the once-iron clad bipartisan consensus on U.S. foreign policy. In case of Congressional bipartisanship on India, that schism has emerged also due to the apparent partisan fervour of the “Howdy, Modi!” rally and House Democrats’ rising apprehensions on the communications lockdown in Kashmir.

Challenges for India could worsen in the coming years. If re-elected, Mr. Trump will possibly double-down on his will to seek renewed trade deals. At which point, remainder issues under U.S.-India trade ties could witness heightened tensions. Or, Congressional Democrats’ apprehensions may assume heightened vigour. Even in their worst-case scenario in 2020 of not winning back the White House, they are expected to, at the very least, chip away at the Republicans’ already slim majority in the Senate.

Moreover, working towards reinstating a certain sense of Indian neutrality on American polarisation would also make sense from the standpoint of the Senate entering an era of minimal majorities. The Republicans’ slim majority of 53-47, has opened the door to defections by legislators who do not always identify with the Trump agenda or do not mind crossing the aisle on initiatives that constrain Mr. Trump’s foreign policy decision-making.

Thus, with Mr. Trump’s visit, New Delhi must ensure its projection as a net gain for the bilateral relationship at-large — and not merely an extension of the U.S. President’s re-election campaign.

384,2020/02/20,Infinite crisis: On Afghan presidential poll result,"Afghanistan is no closer to peace after the declaration of Ashraf Ghani as the President

The Afghan Independent Election Commission’s much-delayed announcement that President Ashraf Ghani is the winner of the September 28 Presidential election is expected to deepen the political crisis in the war-torn country. That it took almost five months to declare the official results — he secured a narrow victory with 50.64% of votes against his main opponent Abdullah Abdullah’s 39.52% — itself points to the seriousness of the crisis. Mr. Abdullah has called the results fraudulent and vowed to form a parallel government. If he does so, it would undermine the already feeble Afghan administration whose writ does not stretch beyond the main urban centres. For the Afghan voter, this is a déjà vu moment. Five years ago, Mr. Ghani was declared winner of the election but Mr. Abdullah refused to accept the result. The then U.S. Secretary of State, John Kerry, brokered a power-sharing agreement, which allowed Mr. Ghani to take over the presidency and made Mr. Abdullah the government Chief Executive. And throughout the five years, they were at odds with each other, while the Taliban steadily expanded across the country’s hinterlands and stepped up attacks on its city centres. Unsurprisingly, only less than a fourth of registered voters turned up in September, raising questions about faith in the whole exercise.

Worse, the infighting comes at a time when the U.S. is near a Taliban agreement. Initial reports suggest that U.S. President Trump has given the go-ahead to its signing if the insurgents reduce violence for a seven-day test period. The deal would see the U.S.’s Afghan troop pullback, winding down America’s longest war and leaving the Taliban and the Afghan government to start direct talks for a final settlement. The problem, however, is that even with an American troops presence, the Afghan government had never been able to take control of the security situation. The U.S. excluded the government from its direct talks with the Taliban as the insurgents do not see the government as Afghanistan’s legitimate rulers. U.S. withdrawal would invariably weaken the government, aiding the Taliban even before the talks start. The disputed poll results and chronic political infighting would weaken the administration further. How will the government defend the Constitution or any of the post-Taliban achievements if it is going to negotiate with a resurgent Taliban from a position of such weakness? All involved parties in the conflict seem to be missing the big picture. The U.S. just wants to get out of a lost war. Mr. Ghani wants to retain his presidency. Mr. Abdullah may want to make sure there is power sharing with the Opposition. What is lost in these narrow, self-interest-driven moves is the collective quest for defeating the extremists and rebuilding Afghanistan.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/infinite-crisis-the-hindu-editorial-on-afghanistan-presidential-poll-result/article30863877.ece
385,2020/02/20,Secrecy hurts: On handling SARS-CoV-2 outbreak,"Opacity in the time of an outbreak is sure to kill more people

From quick sequencing of the whole genome of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19 — after alerting WHO in December 2019 about a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown cause — to quickly developing viral diagnostic tests, China has done much to address the epidemic. As on February 19, mainland China had 74,185 cases and 2,004 deaths. Add to this the speed at which two new hospitals with 2,600 beds were built. Also, the many facilities that became temporary hospitals in the face of growing cases is testimony to China’s ability to pull off the unimaginable in containing the epidemic. Whether the decision to shut down huge cities to halt the viral spread may have actually helped is debatable, but it is important to note that China has done a lot after the initial delay in reporting the disease. However, China, given its capabilities, could have contained the spread with very little effort and resources had it been transparent and acted on time. Apparently, China did not apply the lessons it learnt from the SARS outbreak despite strident global criticism. Downplaying and being secretive about public health issues, particularly novel virus outbreaks, as it found out during SARS, and then now, can be very counterproductive. This is in contrast to the way Kerala handled the Nipah virus outbreaks in 2018-19. Transparency and timely action helped the State contain the outbreaks within days, with few cases, deaths in 2018.

There is an eerie similarity between China’s SARS outbreak response in 2002-03 and the current epidemic. If, during SARS, it initially withheld information and delayed by three months reporting it to WHO, in the case of COVID-19 it systematically downplayed its scale for nearly six weeks after pneumonia cases of unknown cause were first seen on December 8, 2019. Shockingly, even as it reported the case cluster to WHO on December 31, and the wet market, thought to be the outbreak hotspot, was closed on January 1, people were kept in the dark. In fact, eight doctors who sounded an early alarm were detained for “spreading rumours”. Ironically, even as about 900 patients presented with symptoms each day by late December, as a daily reported, official numbers stayed the same. In fact, after initially reporting 44 cases to WHO, the numbers were reduced to 41 on January 11 and continued to remain the same till January 16, when the city and province’s annual political congress ended. Even on January 16, WHO was informed of only “limited” human spread, thus putting more people at infection risk. The cases reported began rising slowly since January 17 to reach 121 on January 19 when a community dinner was held in Wuhan. It took a Chinese epidemiologist’s revelation the next day about the outbreak’s severity for Wuhan to start acting decisively. The lesson is that in the event of an outbreak, secrecy is a killer and transparency the saviour.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/secrecy-hurts-the-hindu-editorial-on-handling-sars-cov-2-outbreak/article30863870.ece

With the dual aim of helping police personnel deal with the stress of their job and focus on their physical fitness, the North East division conducted a Zumba dance class during an award ceremony on Thursday.

Bhimashankar Guled , DCP, (North East division), who initiated the idea, said that he chose Zumba as it promotes coordination, synchronisation and team-building,which is the essence of the police department.

As many as 300 police personnel – from constables to the assistant commissioner of police – danced their worries away for over an hour.

“We have a concept of ‘cop of the month’, where police personnel in the division are recognised and awarded for best investigation practices. Since the award programme was pending, we decided to organise it in a more meaningful way,” said Mr. Guled.

Many police personnel enjoyed the dance session, but admitted that it tested their fitness levels.

The aggregator said that the integration will enable seamless sharing of ride information, including driver and car details. The police can track the vehicle and contact information of the passenger will also be shared with the police.

The company has promised that Ola’s Safety Response Team (SRT) will also immediately contact the customer and provide on-phone assistance until his or her safety is confirmed.

388,2020/02/20,Actor Darshan’s neighbours file cases against him and fans for damaging houses and cars,"Alleged incident occurred during his birthday celebrations on the weekend

Neighbours of Kannada film actor Darshan Thoogudeepa in Ideal Homes Township, R.R. Nagar, have filed complaints with the police alleging that their houses and vehicles were damaged by unruly fans during his birthday celebrations from Saturday night to Sunday evening.

Based on the complaints, the R.R. Nagar police have filed at least three FIRs against Darshan and the organisers of the birthday party.

M.C. Shyamshukha, a 70-year-old resident, said that thousands of fans gathered outside the actor’s house on Saturday night, created a ruckus and broke flower pots in his compound.

Subbaraju Gupta, 70, told the police that the crowd scaled his wall and damaged the garden. Another neighbour, Ramprasad, 54, found that his car had been damaged as people had climbed on it. The cost of repairs: ₹40,000.

Residents alleged that there were no proper barricades to control the fans.

“In their complaints, they alleged that the organisers had not made proper arrangements for the thousands of fans who thronged the actor’s house.

“We were threatened when we tried to object to their behaviour,” they alleged.

A constable attached to the Jnanabharathi police station was allegedly attacked by the actor’s fans while he was trying to manage the crowd.

389,2020/02/20,Will take to the streets if elevated corridor project is taken up: citizens' groups,"They are upset with government for bowing to a group of MLAs from the city and ministers who are lobbying hard to revive the project

The citizens’ groups at the forefront of opposition to the network of elevated corridors are livid that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which once opposed the project, is pushing for it now that it is in power. They have threatened to take to the streets if the government goes ahead with the project.

Bengaluru witnessed large-scale protests against the proposed steel flyover in 2016 and the elevated corridors when the project was mooted in 2019. While the steel flyover proposal was scrapped, the elevated corridor project was shelved.

However, a group of MLAs from the city and ministers are lobbying hard to take up Phase I of the project – East-West corridor between K.R. Puram and Yeshwantpur – which is likely to cost over ₹5,000 crore.

“The BJP stood with citizens and opposed the project less than a year ago. Today, they want to implement it. In fact, the Chief Minister scrapped the tender process that was already under way for the North South corridor,” said Srinivas Alavilli, Citizens for Bengaluru (CfB). “We will be left with no option but to take to the streets if the government goes ahead with the project.”

Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, who holds charge of Finance and Bengaluru Development, is preparing to present the State’s budget on March 5. Citizens’ groups have decided to meet him to demand that the project not be taken up.

CM in a spot

The project is championed by newly inducted ministers B.A. Basavaraja and S.T. Somashekhar, whose defection from the Congress was instrumental in bringing the BJP to power.

Basavaraja represents K.R. Puram and Somashekhar the Yeshwantpur Assembly constituency.

There seems to be dissatisfaction brewing in the party over the dominance of the newly inducted ministers. “The BJP had taken a stand and opposed the project. The newly inducted leaders had championed the project in the Congress but should be made aware of the party's stand. Mr. Basavaraj recently announced another flyover, also to K.R. Puram, though the Chief Minister holds charge of Bengaluru Development,” said a senior BJP leader.

However, some BJP legislators, including Deputy CM Dr. C.N. Ashwath Narayan, are reportedly positive about the project.

“Mr. Yediyurappa has the onerous task of balancing several leaders in the city amidst an aggressive pitch by the newly inducted ministers, who he cannot antagonise,” said a source in the party.

Push for public transport

Urban mobility experts argue that the government needs to invest in public transport.

Dr. Ashish Verma, associate professor, Centre for Infrastructure, Sustainable Transportation and Urban Planning (CiSTUP), IISc., said the elevated corridor will not solve the congestion problem, but only aggravate the situation. “Numerous studies have proven that provision of infrastructure for private vehicles will only increase the congestion over time. We have built over 50 flyovers over the last decade-and-a-half. Yet a recent study said Bengaluru is the most traffic-congested city,” he said.

Others pointed to the failure of the suburban rail network to take off. “These projects need to be given priority,” said urban mobility expert Sanjeev V.

391,2020/02/20,Customs officials find drugs hidden in lace,"The incident came to light during a routine check at KIA

Alert customs officials on Tuesday busted an international drug smuggling racket and seized five kg of ephedrine, which was concealed in bobbins of embroidery lace and was slated to be couriered to Australia.

The incident came to light during a routine check at the air cargo terminal at Kempegowda International Airport.

An alert was raised after authorities found powder in the bobbins. They examined 45 plastic bobbins and found polythene pouches hidden within the folds. They were packed with a white crystal powder that was later identified as ephedrine. A total of 5.115 kg of the drug was discovered hidden in the packets.

Ephedrine is a primarily medication used to prevent low blood pressure during spinal anaesthesia but can be abused as a stimulant and an appetite suppressant. It can also be reportedly used to make crystal meth. According to officials, it is a controlled substance covered under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act.

392,2020/02/20,Hyderabad techie held for killing relative in Bengaluru,"He was obsessed with the wife of the victim, said the police

The Mahadevapura police solved the murder of a software engineer and arrested his co-brother — also a software engineer based in Hyderabad – who was allegedly obsessed with the victim’s wife. Eight others have been arrested in the case.

“Lakshman Kumar, 33, was murdered on February 3 based on a plan hatched by Satyaprasad, 44, who lives in Hyderabad,” said the police. Satyaprasad is married to the sister of Lakshman’s wife. He allegedly offered ₹15 lakh to a taxi driver, Dinesh, to do the job. Satyaprasad gave him the details of Lakshman’s schedule, and a photograph that he had downloaded from his Facebook account.

“Dinesh took ₹1.5 lakh as advance and came to Bengaluru in January last week along with his wife and associates. They stayed in a lodge in Horamavu to recce the area Lakshman resided in,” said a police officer.

According to investigators, they made two attempts — one on January 30 and the other on January 31 — to murder Lakshman but he did not turn up at the spot where Satyaprasad told them he would. On February 3, the accused waited for him in two cars and on two bikes near his house. They saw him leave on his scooter for work.

“They followed Lakshman till Mahadevapura. They intercepted him under the bridge where they stabbed him repeatedly. He tried to flee, but could not escape,” said the police officer. He was found by passers-by and taken to a hospital where he succumbed to his injuries.

The Mahadevapura police verified CCTV camera footage and managed to nab two of the accused Prashanth and Prem Kumar who had allegedly attacked Lakshman.

Their arrest led the police to Dinesh, who was arrested along with his wife Sayeeda and other associates Lokesh, Kushanth, Santosh and Ravi. Based on Dinesh’s confession, the police arrested Satyaprasad from Hyderabad.

“Satyaprasad claimed that he was in love with Lakshman’s wife who was unaware of his obsession,” said the police.

Not the first time

Ashwathnarayana Swamy, who cracked the case, said Lakshman had been attacked in Hennur in July 2019. He survived and the case is under investigation. The police suspect that Dinesh was behind that attack, too.

393,2020/02/20,101 families to be shifted to make way for Bengaluru Metro work,"The Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited will bear the cost of rehabilitation.

One hundred and one families living in shanties at Lakkasandra will be relocated to temporary shelters to make way for metro construction work. The Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) requires up to six acres of land to construct makeshift structures to build a casting yard for the underground line from Dairy Circle to Nagawara under Phase II. The plot is located close to the BBMP swimming pool.

The authorities have decided to shift the families to Kurubarahalli in Thavereke Hobli on Magadi Road. BMRCL will bear the cost of rehabilitation, which includes the setting up of temporary shelters and other facilities such as drinking water, electricity and sanitary facilities.

Residents – most of who hail from various parts of Karnataka – are resigned to the move.

V.C.K. Murthy, a resident, said, “People living in this area hail from Ballari, Raichur, Kalaburagi and Yadgir. Most have been living here for more than 15 years and work as construction labourers. After many rounds of meeting s, the authorities concerned have promised to provide temporary shelters with basic amenities at Kurubarahalli.”

While BMRCL has announced that it will rehabilitate 101 families, residents claim that the actual number of households that will be affected is 120.

“We have come from rural areas. All of us are Kannadigas. Earlier, we were told that we have erected shelters on government land and must leave the area. Now they have promised that we will be shifted elsewhere. But BMRCL has taken note of 101 families. We want the authorities to provide rehabilitation facilities to all the 120 families. No one should be left out,” said another resident.

Land acquisition remains a hurdle for BMRCL, which has taken up work on Bannerghatta Road.

Chennappa Goudar, general manager for land acquisition and rehabilitation, said, “For several months, attempts were made to acquire the area. The plot is government land and suitable for a casting yard.”

The BMRCL had approached the deputy commissioner to hand over the land.

“The families are living in the area by erecting temporary shelters. On humanitarian grounds, the BMRCL will bear the cost of their rehabilitation, including shifting charges,” he added.

It will be providing funds to the Karnataka Slum Development Board for rehabilitation work, and an initial deposit of ₹1.08 crore has been made. An official from the slum development board said, “We were in the process of notifying the slum. Then BMRCL approached the DC asking for the land for their project. We held many rounds of meetings with representatives of residents who agreed to be shifted to Kurubarahalli, which is located around 15 km away.”

The BMRCL has already taken a survey of individual families living in the area.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/h28vc4/article30867206.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20BGLAKKASANDRA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/101-families-to-be-shifted-to-make-way-for-bengaluru-metro-work/article30867209.ece

396,2020/02/20,"In Pallavaram, a transit station has become a dump yard","Since the closure of the Vengadamangalam dump yard, the local bodies of Pallavaram, Tambaram and Sembakkam, have been facing difficulties in removing waste from their transit stations.

Mounds of garbage fast piling up at the transit station of the Pallavaram Municipality is turning it into a dump yard.

Since the closure of the Vengadamangalam dump yard, the local bodies of Pallavaram, Tambaram and Sembakkam, have been facing difficulties in removing waste from their transit stations.

The Pallavaram Municipality has a transit station in Ganapathy Nagar on the Pallavaram Thoraipakkam Radial Road. Since the Venkadamangalam dump yard was closed, garbage, particularly plastic waste, has been stacking up in the transit station at Ganapathy Nagar for more than a year, a senior official of Pallavaram Municipalitysaid.

The Pallavaram locality with more than 3 lakh residential accommodations, located in 43 wards has been facing hardships to remove the collected waste, he said. The Municipality, which generates more than 100 metric tonnes of dry and wet waste, has been facing difficultyies in fully removing more than 50 tonnes of the collected garbage from the transit station.

The Chennai Corporation has permitted the three municipalities, which were using the Vengadamangalam dump yard, to use the Perungudi dump yard on a “temporary basis” with restrictions in quantity, officials said.

Garbage has started stagnating in the transit stations of both Pallavaram and Tambaram. Tambaram Municipality’s transit station is located at Kannadapalayam, officials admitted.

The officials are now concerned that if the Vengadamangalam dump yard is not re-opened, the collected waste would soon become a headache for the local administration and also lead to serious health issues for the residents.

The National Green Tribunal (NGT) had directed the Vengadamangalam dump yard to be shut down because of the non-functioning of the garbage segregation machine and piling up of garbage.

“The waste segregation machine has been repaired at a cost of ₹25 lakh recently and has started functioning. The stagnated garbage at the dump yard are being converted into manure and plastic fuel using this machine,” an official said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/h367e6/article30869254.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20FEBTH-PALLAVARAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/in-pallavaram-a-transit-station-has-become-a-dump-yard/article30869255.ece

Former Anna University Vice Chancellor (VC) M. Anandakrishnan is one of the proposed Senate nominees of the University of Madras’ VC search panel.

On Thursday, a special Senate meeting will be held to name a nominee for the panel. Prof. Anandakrishnan confirmed that the AUT and MUTA (both teachers’ associations) representatives had approached him and he had given his consent.

Last week, the Syndicate unanimously approved P. Ramasamy, former VC of Alagappa University, as its nominee for the search panel. He was earlier the head of Biotechnology Department of the University of Madras.

The present VC Duraisamy’s tenure will end on May 24. He helmed the University at a time when the institution was deep in the red in debt. At one point the university could not pay the salary of its employees or settle the pension of its non-teaching staff.

Mr. Ramasamy’s nomination came after one of the members from an aided college proposed the name of an industrialist. Mr. Duraisamy had to read out the requirements for nomination to the panel and clarify that the person should be an academician, sources said. Following it, there were discussions and Mr. Ramasamy’s name was proposed.

400,2020/02/20,Special public prosecutors appointed for Pocso cases,"The Prosecution Department announced the appointment of 16 special public prosecutors to handle offences relating to the Protection Of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act, 2012 in 16 special courts across the State. The Supreme Court had in its order dated January 8, 2020, called for all states to appoint exclusive public prosecutors in all the courts that had been exclusively set up for Pocso cases.

In 2019, the Supreme court had directed that special courts be set up in each district that had over 100 cases of child abuse and sexual assault pending trial under the Pocso Act. Following this, the Tamil Nadu government had constituted 16 special courts in Chennai, Coimbatore, Cuddalore, Chengalpet Nagercoil, Madurai, Nagapattinam, Salem, Sivaganga, Thanjavur, Tirunelveli, Tiruvannamalai, Thoothukudi, Vellore, Villupuram and Srivilliputhur exclusively for the trial of cases under the Pocso Act 2012. Vidya Reddy of Tulir, Centre for the Prevention and Healing of Child Sexual Abuse said that the Special Public Prosecutors have a key role in ensuring that child-friendly measures stipulated under the Pocso Act are adopted and rights of the child are protected. She also stressed on the need for the SPPs to facilitate appreciation of medical evidence and forensic reports.

“It is also hoped that the prosecutors will ensure a better application of Rule 7 of the Pocso Act which states that there is an eligibility for interim compensation to meet the immediate needs of the affected child will be considered,” she said.

“An enabling experience for the child and family is likely to encourage victims and their families to cooperate with prosecutors and view the criminal justice system with less trepidation and apprehension. This is essential in ensuring that the child or young person maintains their engagement with the criminal justice process,” Ms Vidya said.

She further stated that successful convictions of sexual abuse offenders can provide victims with a sense of empowerment and safety.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/special-public-prosecutors-appointed-for-pocso-cases/article30865287.ece

402,2020/02/20,"Pass resolution in Assembly within the next 24 hours, demand anti-CAA protesters in Chennai","In a massive show of strength, the Federation of Tamil Nadu Islamic and Political Organisations mobilised thousands of people on Wallajah Road in the scorching heat on Wednesday to demand that the State government pass a resolution against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, the National Population Register and the National Register of Citizens in the Assembly.

The leaders demanded that the government pass the resolution within the next 24 hours. Well-known Islamic political leaders participated in the agitation and were critical of the State government, especially Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, who had accused the Opposition leaders of misleading the people of the State on the issue.

‘Part of plan’

Addressing protesters, Manithaneya Makkal Katchi founder M.H. Jawahirullah claimed that had CAA been brought in during the 1950s, the AIADMK’s founder and former Chief Minister M.G. Ramachandran, who was born in Kandy in Sri Lanka, wouldn’t have received Indian citizenship. He added that CAA, NPR and NRC should not be seen as individual elements but as a whole.

“Just like how [Prime Minister] Modi announced that ₹500 and ₹1,000 notes were no longer valid in 2016, this is his plan to invalidate the citizenship of Tamils and Indians,” he said.

Manithaneya Jananayaga Katchi leader and Member of the Legislative Assembly Thameemun Ansari said the AIADMK government should announce that it would not implement NPR in Tamil Nadu to “compensate for the mistake” it made by supporting CAA in Parliament.

Tamilaga Valvurimai Katchi founder T. Velmurugan said that the actions of the Modi administration had brought all secular forces together. “The protests will continue till the CM announces that CAA, NRC and NPR will not be implemented,” he added.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/96vpzx/article30860731.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH19CAA-PROTESTS-2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/pass-resolution-in-assembly-within-the-next-24-hours/article30865244.ece
403,2020/02/20,Disciplined defiance: when thousands of anti-CAA protesters hit Wallajah Road,"Police and protesters work in sync to ensure rally is peaceful

The rally by the Federation of Tamil Nadu Islamic and Political Organisations, attended by thousands of protesters, including women and children, to lay siege to the Secretariat, went off peacefully on Wednesday morning.

The police and the protesters ensured that there was no violence. Though traffic was affected on arterial roads during the protest due to the sheer size of the crowd, the police along with the protesters, ensured that vehicle movement resumed quickly.

Despite a Madras High Court ban, the federation announced a long march to the Secretariat demanding that the Assembly pass a resolution against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, the National Register of Citizens and the National Population Register.

Following this, the entire stretch of Wallajah Road was teeming with policemen and personnel from the strike force since early on Wednesday. The road was blocked for traffic. Barricades were placed at important points on the stretch and a makeshift stage was set up near the Chepauk Guest House.

Hundreds of policemen, senior officers including Prem Anand Sinha, Additional Commissioner of police (South), and deputy commissioners were deployed to monitor the rally. City Police Commissioner A.K. Viswanathan also inspected the security arrangements multiple times. A control room was set up at the venue and feeds from five drones and over 20 CCTV cameras were monitored by the officers.

Around 9.30 a.m, the protesters started pouring into the venue and by 10 a.m. there were thousands of people at the venue. “I have come here to safeguard our future,” said Khader Basha, a differently abled person who had come on a wheelchair. Around 10.15 a.m, the march began slowly and it ended near the stage around 11 a.m. Political leaders addressed the gathering till 12.45 p.m and the protest ended with the national anthem. Soon after, the crowd started dispersing.

But chaos prevailed after a few protesters staged a road roko on Anna Salai near the Anna Statue demanding that the government pass a resolution. Due to this traffic was affected once again on the arterial road. The police held talks with the protesters and the leaders of the federation also persuaded them to disperse.

A senior police officer said that the situation could have led to a major law and order problem. “The protesters behaved responsibly. Besides, we held multiple meetings with them and gained their trust. It was all about the goodwill the Chennai police has with the people,” he said.

Police claimed that though traffic was affected, order was restored quickly. “We had earmarked parking spots in Sivananda Salai, MMC Ground and Island Grounds. The protestors left their vehicles at these spots and walked to the venue. This prevented chaos,” said an officer. Besides the protesters also helped the police in managing the crowd and vehicles.

CMRL officials estimated that about 5,000 people took the Metro in a few hours’ time. “Usually, only about 1,500 people travel through this station. Many who wanted to avoid traffic came to our station,” an official said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/95rkpu/article30865214.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20THPROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/disciplined-defiance-when-thousands-hit-wallajah-road/article30865216.ece
404,2020/02/20,Australian team in Chennai to pick up restoration tips,"Work on Humayun Mahal, using traditional conservation techniques, comes in for high praise

Mughal-era techniques, followed for conservation of heritage buildings in the Chepauk Palace complex, have caught the attention of Australian heritage experts.

A seven-member delegation from Australia was in the city on Wednesday to learn about the traditional techniques adopted for restoring Humayun Mahal. They were all praise for the use of traditional methods, particularly the Kangeyam bulls employed to grind lime mortar used to plaster walls.

The delegates, who were part of AusHeritage, a network of cultural heritage management organisations established by the Australian government, had a meeting with Building Centre and Conservation Division (BCCD), Public Works Department (PWD), and also walked around the historic Humayan Mahal that is being restored.

C. Kalyanasundaram, superintending engineer, BCCD, said that they explained the laborious process involved in conservation of heritage structures and the Mughal plastering technique.

Australian experts also made a presentation about Australian conservation techniques. Roger Beeston, deputy chairman, AusHeritage, said, “It was great to learn about revival of traditional craftsmanship and materials sourced from specific locations to ensure quality. The process of preparing lime mortar is universal. But India has some unique additives like jaggery and curd. The labour-intensive work is not possible in Australia where it is expensive.”

“There are 16 steps in Australian heritage conservation and conservation management planning is given more priority there. More balance is required between engineering and architecture in Indian style of conservation,” he said.

The delegation had earlier visited Malaysia and will visit Delhi next. AusHeritage’s chairman Vinod Daniel said a team had already visited Chepauk Palace last year. “We are exploring the possibility of long-term collaboration with the PWD. We shared conservation management and preservation of heritage collections and how to document and communicate about preservation,” he said.

K.P. Sathyamurthy, joint chief engineer, PWD, said nearly 50% of the work on Humayun Mahal is complete. The project is expected to be completed early next year.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/34q2w0/article30865187.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20THHERITAGEAUSSIES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/australian-team-in-city-to-pick-up-restoration-tips/article30865188.ece

According to a bulletin released by the Directorate of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, the cargo ship — M V Magnate — had arrived at the Chennai Port with 19 Chinese crew members. During screening, two of them had mild fever. Their nasal, throat swabs and blood samples were sent for testing to the King Institute of Preventive Medicine, Guindy and returned negative for COVID-19.

The ship was allowed to enter the port after an incubation period of 14 days from the time it had last visited a Chinese Port, according to a press release. “On berthing, Port health team of the Port Health Organisation including a public health specialist cum deputy port health officer boarded the vessel and examined all the crew. It was observed that two of the 19 crew members had mild fever without other respiratory symptoms and otherwise healthy in all respects,” the release said.

The crew members were isolated inside the ship and the crew was not allowed shore access. The State health team and port health officer, Chennai visited the ship on Wednesday, and collected samples for testing.

With this, 46 samples lifted from passengers have tested negative for COVID-19 in the State.

With all evacuees from Wuhan, China, testing negative for COVID-19 and allowed to leave the ITBP quarantine facility in New Delhi, health officials said that this included 84 persons from Tamil Nadu.

“Out of the 84 evacuees from Wuhan, who were discharged from the camps, 34 persons have reached their homes in Tamil Nadu, while others are on their way. All of them have completed 18 to 20 days of quarantine and will be followed up for another eight to 10 days,” Health Secretary Beela Rajesh said.

Exams postponed

She added that the Chinese Embassy has informed that the country has decided to postpone the next semester for students. “The Government of India had taken up the concern of students with them, and they have responded favourably. Students pursuing courses in China need not return now,” she said. As on date, a total of 2,493 persons, who had travelled from China and other COVID-19 affected countries, were enrolled for follow-up in the State.

Nine persons were injured in the accident at a private studio located at Nazarathpet.

According to police sources, the accident happened when a crane used for the shoot came crashing down on the location where the Kamal Haasan-starrer was being shot.

A senior official of the police said that the accident happened when workers were engaged in putting up a set for a scene. A heavy-duty light that was mounted on the crane also fell.

The three died on the spot. The deceased were identified as Krishna, 34, an assistant director in director Shankar’s team, Madhu, 29, and Chandran, 60 — who were part of the catering team.

Police sources said Mr. Haasan, who was at the accident spot, helped transport the victims to a private hospital. Police officials added that three bodies had been sent to the Government General Hospital for post-mortem.

The injured persons had been admitted to a private hospital near Poonamallee.

The Nazarathpet police have filed a case and are investigating the cause of the accident.

Fire and Rescue Services personnel, along with a fire tender from Irungattukottai, were rushed to the spot when news of the accident first came in.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/vaxtra/article30864989.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Indian-2-film-site,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/3-killed-during-indian-2-shoot/article30864990.ece

409,2020/02/20,The missing piece in India’s defence jigsaw puzzle,"The country needs a clearly articulated white paper on its defence needs which sets out its strategic concerns

Undoubtedly, we are living through a moment of decisive change and turbulence. This geopolitical period is perhaps the most troubled since the final decades of the 20th century. Hence, there exists a vital need to adopt right strategic choices. According to 2018 data, India occupies the fourth place in military expenditure across the world, behind the U.S., China, and Saudi Arabia. This does not mean that India has no further need to increase its stock of state-of-the art weapons. What is needed, nevertheless, is sober reflection and a cost-benefit analysis, to ensure that the amounts expended are in tune with our strategic requirements.

Defence deals in the pipeline

This is an opportune moment to undertake such a cost-benefit analysis. The first lot of Rafale fighter jets are expected shortly. The final deal on the 200 Kamov Ka-226 light utility helicopters from Russia is in advanced stages and expected to be signed soon. In October 2018, India and Russia had signed a $5.4-billion mega deal for the S-400 Triumf Air Defence System. Under contemplation today are yet another set of high-value U.S. defence deals, including additional purchases of P-8I Maritime Reconnaissance Aircraft and Apache Attack Helicopters. According to estimates, the total worth of defence equipment purchased from the U.S. alone since 2007 is in the region of $17-billion.

On the eve of U.S President Donald Trump’s visit to India, a further spurt in defence purchases is anticipated. Speculation is rife that India and the U.S. would sign a deal for the National Advanced Surface to Air Missile System (NASAMS-II), intended as part of a multi-layered missile shield to protect Delhi. The U.S. side is also hoping for two more mega defence deals, worth $3.5-billion to be signed for 24 MH-60 Romeo Multi Mission Helicopters for the Navy and an additional six AH-64E Apache Attack Helicopters for the Army. (India’s Cabinet Committee on Security, on Wednesday, cleared the MH-60 helicopter deal.)

Also Read Should military spending be increased?

Given India’s rising global profile, and with two major adversaries on its borders, India needs to be fully prepared. What is lacking in the defence jigsaw puzzle, however, is a well considered and clearly articulated white paper on India’s defence needs, that sets out its strategic concerns, how it is positioning itself to meet these challenges, and the putative costs of meeting the country’s defence needs.

Pakistan, China threats

Several nations undertake such exercises. In India, exercises of this kind are sometimes undertaken, but they suffer from a lack of clarity and are restricted in scope. They contain vague references to the threat posed by China and Pakistan, but there is clearly more to India’s defence needs than exercises in military hagiography. What is required is a well formulated defence white paper, putting the different threats and dangers the nation faces in perspective, alongside steps taken to meet these challenges.

In the case of Pakistan, the threat motif is, no doubt, obvious. India’s political and defence establishment are on record that India can easily defeat Pakistan, even if a “weaker” Pakistan possesses “nuclear teeth”. Yet, while this makes for excellent copy, a great deal of effort is called for to explain to the public, the true nature of the threat posed by Pakistan, and why India is so confident of beating back the Pakistani challenge.

Meeting the military, strategic and economic challenge from China is an entirely different matter. China is not Pakistan, and while China and Pakistan may have established an axis to keep India in check, explaining the nature of the threat posed by China to India is a complex task that needs to be undertaken with care and caution.

Understanding Beijing

To begin with, there are many experts who express doubts as to whether China intends today to pursue its 19th Century agenda, or revert to its belief in ‘Tian Xia’. Undoubtedly under China’s President Xi Jinping, China aims to be a great power and an assertive one at that. India’s defence planners should, however, carefully assess whether there are degrees of “assertiveness” in China’s behavioural patterns. There is little doubt that regarding its claim to areas falling within the ‘nine-dash lines’ (the first island chain), China is unwilling to make compromises. Whether this applies to other regions of Asia and the Indo-Pacific, calls for an in-depth study. It would be premature for India without undertaking such an analysis, to adhere to a common perception that China is intent on enforcing a Sino-centric world order in which India and other countries would necessarily have to play a secondary role.

Also Read China defends heavy defence spending, hints at further rise

If after undertaking such an “analysis”, it appears that China does not pose a direct threat to India’s existence, notwithstanding the fact that India is its main rival in Asia, then India’s political, strategic and military planners need to come up with a different set of alternatives. In recent years, unfortunately, much of India’s strategic thinking regarding China’s aggressive behaviour has been coloured by that of the U.S. and the West, though it is a proven fact that China has not used lethal military force abroad since the 1980s.

China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) does convey an impression that China seeks to put itself at the centre of the world. The speed with which many of the steps to progress the BRI are being taken, again conveys an impression that China is intent on shrinking the physical and psychological distance between Europe and East Asia. This does not, however, necessarily mean that China is preparing to confront individual countries in Asia, such as India, which do not subscribe to the BRI.

A defence white paper would provide a more definitive answer to such issues. A detailed exercise to assess whether China is indeed a threat, rather than a challenge, to India should prove invaluable. It is possible that a detailed study may indicate that China understands that there are limits to its strength and capabilities. Several instances of late, have shown the frailties in China’s policies — Hong Kong, Taiwan, and even Xinjiang are instances that indicate that China has its own Achilles heel. Consequently, China may not be ready, for quite some time at least, to seek a direct confrontation with India.

A closer look at Beijing’s policies, undertaken as part of a defence white paper, may also indicate that rather than a “conflict-prone” role, China is more intent on an “influence-peddling” one. This is important from India’s point of view. Already there is one school of thought that believes that Beijing is better at converting its economic heft into strategic influence, rather than employing force beyond certain prescribed areas.

Also Read Arms sales worldwide up nearly 5%, says new report from Swedish institute

If this view is espoused by a defence white paper then, despite the vexed border dispute between India and China, the two countries could try and arrive at a subliminal understanding about respective spheres of influence. Today, one of India’s major concerns is that China is attempting to intrude into its sphere of influence in South Asia, and the first and second concentric circles of India’s interest areas, such as Afghanistan and parts of West Asia. The defence white paper might well provide a strategic paradigm, in which India and China agree to peacefully co-exist in many areas, leaving aside conflict zones of critical importance to either, thus ensuring a more durable peace between them.

One other outcome that the defence white paper could attempt is: whether China views geo-economics as the primary arena of competition today. China has invested heavily in artificial intelligence, robotics and bio-technology, and perhaps, India needs to recognise that rather than blacklisting Chinese technology Tech firms, (which could prove counter-productive) there exist avenues for cooperation, paving the way for better state-to-state relations.

A focus on domestic politics

A final word. The defence white paper needs to underscore that a country’s domestic politics are an important pointer to a stable foreign policy. There could be different schools of thoughts within a nation, but equilibrium needs to be maintained if it is not to adversely impact a nation’s foreign policy imperatives. An impression that the country is facing internal strains could encourage an adversary, to exploit our weaknesses. This is a critical point that the defence white paper needs to lay stress on.

In Kerala, wetlands and indigenous flora are bird habitats. Quails, spotted doves, weaver birds and munias were abundant in villages till some years ago; wetland water hens and lapwings were also ubiquitous. Today, as ‘development’ destroys indigenous flora and wetlands, these birds are disappearing. Even after two devastating floods that were directly caused by the environmental degradation caused by the development mania,

Kerala is still not ready to retract from the path of ‘development’ at the cost of the environment.

413,2020/02/20,This akhara in Delhi trains India’s future women wrestlers,"The Guru Prem Nath wrestling centre in the city is overcoming a sporting taboo

Amidst the hustle and bustle of Gur Mandi in North Delhi, is the Guru Prem Nath akhara, a regular two-storey building. The reception area has photos of wrestlers like Divya Kakran and Unnati Rathore on its paint-peeling wall.

On the ground floor is a traditional mud pit, made soft with turmeric, milk, curd, henna, and gravel-less mud rolled together. On the first floor, is a modern wrestling mat, where kids warm up in groups and practise their moves in four-minute sessions. They halt and greet every visitor who walks in.

Vikram Kumar Sonkar — he’s a former wrestler whose father, the Arjuna awardee wrestler Prem Nath founded the space — is presently the head coach and owner of the akhara, and does not charge the trainees. The akhara, adopted by Sports Authority of India, needs more attention.

“Every five years, the mat has to be replaced with a new one to avoid injuries. The mat costs around ₹3-3.5 lakh. We have been waiting for the new one for a very long time. The current condition of the mat can cause injury to the wrestlers,” says Sonkar.

Regardless, the 46-year-old akhara is today breaking long-held gender-based taboos and conventions: Girls outnumber boys here.

“There are 80 girls out of 150 students. They are very talented and most of the girls have defeated boys in their villages. The 2018 Commonwealth Games bronze medallist Divya Kakran is still my student, whenever she is in Delhi, she trains here,” says Sonkar, who coached the Greco-Roman wrestling team in the 2014 Asian Games.

Badges of honour

One of the reasons that female participation in wrestling has been slow to catch on, is regular physical injury and bruising. Deformed, or “cauliflower ears” is a common sight with wrestlers. But cousins Shivani Singh and Simran Pawar say that it is “a matter of pride” for wrestlers to have one.

This has also kept families away from ‘sending’ girls to the mat. But Kavita and Rani, mothers of Neha, 13, and Sheetal, 14, accompany them to the akhara daily. “Initially I used to be scared about Neha getting injured but one can get injured at home also,” says Kavita. “So, I am not afraid of it any more. I give her massages when we go back home to soothe her muscles,” she adds. They came from Nahari in Sonepat to Azadpur in Delhi, three months ago, for training.

Miles to go

Neha’s family is an example of those who have moved from neighbouring towns to be closer to the Prem Nath akhara, to devote more time towards learning.

Many of the students here also make long daily commutes, from places like Burari, a town in the North Delhi district.

Sonkar refers to Manya Rajput, 10, who has won the title of “Nau Sherwaan” (nine bouts in succession) and claims that she can be “the next big thing in wrestling”. Another gifted girl is Anjali Sharma, 11, he says.

The pride of the akhara is the 18-year-old Unnati Rathore, who comes from a family of wrestlers.

“I want to make this akhara, my family, and my country proud,” she says despite nursing an operated left shoulder while fighting in a competition six months ago. Rathore likes India’s 2020 Olympic medal hopeful, Vinesh Phogat, but she refers to United States’ wrestler Helen Louise Maroulis, a gold medallist in the 53 kg category, at the 2016 Rio Olympics, as her favourite.

The growing number of girls wanting to pursue wrestling is a sign of the times. It is no more a taboo and, as Sonkar observes, women wrestlers are set to bring glory in times to come at the world level.",fitness,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fitness/9u6bf1/article30849931.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/WRESTLINGAKHARAMETROPLUS,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fitness/this-akhara-in-delhi-trains-indias-future-women-wrestlers/article30870506.ece
414,2020/02/20,"Looking to the past, seeing the future","The fourth edition of Godrej L’Affaire is a day long celebration of design, fashion, parenting and music

It was in 2016, that music composer Shantanu Moitra took a 100-day trip to the Himalayas. The visit triggered memories, leading him to revisit his roots in classical music and folk music. “The Himalayas took me back to my childhood in Benaras, and I started creating tunes that were entrenched in ragas and folk sounds,” he recounts.

This and many such stories and songs will be part of Moitra’s session at the fourth edition of Godrej L’Affaire, a curated experiential lifestyle platform by the Godrej Group. The one-day event at Godrej Vikhroli this Saturday will see several actors, fashion designers and architects taking part in the day’s activities. This year, the event’s theme is ‘New Beginnings: Going Back to Roots’ that plans to showcase India’s rich culture. “The thought behind the theme was an already existing narrative, evident from our research,” says Sujit Patil, Vice President and Head of Corporate Brand and Communications, Godrej Group. According to Patil, trends in food, fashion, design and other aspects of lifestyle indicate that Indians want to re-connect with their roots and cultural legacies. “We thought [the theme] is perfect for 2020, the new decade. The three things we are looking for here are: authentic content creation, experiential engagement and building a community of lifestyle enthusiasts,” he emphasises.

What’s in store?

Curated masterclasses and engaging sessions on food, music, travel, health, and design by an eclectic mix of artistes and personalities are the highlights of the event. Actor Bhumi Pednekar will don a chef’s hat for a live cook-off with Chef Varun Inamdar. Celebrity TV couple Karanvir Bohra and Teejay Sidhu will share their learnings with millennial parents on inculcating spirituality in their children through travel. Designers Krsnaa Mehta (India Circus), Alan Abraham (Abraham John Architects), Madhav Raman (Anagram Architects), Swarup Dutta (Scenographer) and Asha Sairam (Studio Lotus) – will engage in a conversation on how to make sustainable homes, to help give back to nature and why sustainable designs cannot be an either-or-choice anymore.

415,2020/02/20,How Rioja wines pair with spicy Indian food,"Pernod Ricard’s wine ambassador Hortense Cabouret talks about Chennai’s wine culture and pairing Spanish wine with South Indian foods

“This is a whisky drinking region. Like everywhere in India, but especially here.”— Hortense Cabouret, Pernod Ricard’s wine ambassador is well aware of the challenges that come with trying to market alcohol, wine in particular, to a city with complicated liquor licensing.

We meet her at a wine and food pairing luncheon at Barracuda Brew, which claims to be the city’s longest bar. Along with chef Mohamed Siddiq, who is serving up a rich six-course meal, she is showcasing Pernod Ricard’s two main wine brands: Jacob’s Creek from Australia and Campo Viejo from Rioja, Spain. “We are also bringing Jacob’s Creek Double Barrel to Chennai in May,” she informs us, “It is finished in aged whisky barrels so it has more texture.”

While Chennai is quite familiar with Jacob’s Creek, Campo Viejo, which has been available here for two years now, is still new in the minds of the consumer, recognises Hortense. “Which is why it is important for us to take the time to explain the wines to the consumers,” she says.

“Sniff, swirl, savour,” she starts with the basics at Barracuda. Chef Siddiq, who prides himself on creating dishes that are South Indian but tweaked for the global palate, has included Brazilian beef with slow grilled peppers, and prawns baked in the pulp of passion fruit and essence of wasabi. We pair the former with Jacob’s Creek Shiraz and the latter with Campo Viejo Tempranillo Blanco-viura.

Main course includes tomato rice with seer fish, and a Persian roast chicken with paprika scented rice. Both are paired with the Campo Viejo Tempranillo Red. “Campo Viejo flavours are more light,” explains Hortense, “The red is easier to drink especially with Indian dishes. It is not so high in tannin. If there is too much tannin in your wine, you can’t pair it with spicy food common to India. It will burn your mouth.”

The Campo Viejo, she adds, is crafted by an all female winemaking team in Rioja, a flagship wine region in Spain. “Campo Viejo pairs nicely with Southeast Asian dishes like coconut curries, and spicy dishes because it offsets the spiciness of the food.”

On the other hand, we pair the Jacob’s Creek Chardonnay with Chef Siddiq’s mushroom and truffle soup. “It is the kind of wine that will go well with creamy Indian dishes, like palak paneer and butter chicken,” she says.

Explaining wines for an Indian setting has been a major part of Hortense’s work here. “I have noticed that people keep red wines at room temperature. That would have been fine in Europe, but here in India, especially in Tamil Nadu, that makes no sense. They have to be stored at 14 to 16 Celsius degrees max.”

Hortense has been in India for five months now, observing the booming wine market. In Chennai, she has been meeting with the staff at hotels like InterContinental, Crowne Plaza, Holiday Inn, Novotel and so on, during the day, and interacting with consumers during the evenings.

Her main goal is to increase visibility, which is why Sula now being available in TASMACs does not bother her much. “Yes, we are competitors but at the same time, we are from the same wine industry. If they are pushing wine consumption, it helps the whole industry,” she says.",food,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/auegpw/article30870890.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MPBarracudaMAHI5879jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/pernod-ricards-wine-ambassador-on-chennais-wine-culture/article30870892.ece
416,2020/02/20,These tuktuks in Kerala dish out tapioca and more,"Amma Ruchi, with its bright autos selling fresh home-style food to Kochi’s office-goers, is Kerala’s answer to food trucks

By 9 pm, traffic on the Salem-Kanyakumari Highway is a high-speed blur of lights and motor vehicles. Outside Kochi’s Kalamassery metro station, Priya Babu stands by a yellow and green three-wheeler, dressed in a bright pink chef’s coat and green apron. The little vehicle is an ingenious combination of autorickshaw and food truck, outfitted with a stainless steel kitchen, in which Priya cooks nine thattu dosas on a skillet. Beside her are large steel vessels, filled with sambar and coconut chutney.

As she methodically flips dosas, her aunt, serves them, five a plate, to waiting customers. “The food is tasty, that’s why we are here,” says a group of students as they wait for their dosas. At ₹30 for a set of five, it is also economical.

Priya is at this location practically every night, from 7 pm to 2 am in the morning, as are nine other women residents of Koonamthai’s PA Beerankutty Road Lane II, off the National Highway. They are all part of Kalamassery Municipality’s Kudumbashree project ‘Amma Ruchi’, of which Priya is the president.

The project, mooted by Koonamthai-Milma Ward councillor Jaleel Pamangadan for the area’s women belonging to the Scheduled Castes, was inaugurated on December 30 last year, and the women started the business on January 2. They drive the vehicles and sell food prepared by them, at locations between Edappally Toll and Premier Junction in Kalamassery on the National Highway. The standardised menu, primarily, is typical Kerala comfort food — it includes kappa-meen curry (tapioca and fish), puttu-kadala (chana) curry, boti, fish fry, parottas, chapatis and dosas, as well as the universally popular desi Chinese dishes, fried rice and chilli chicken. Since it is early days, they can choose the dishes they sell; for now they cook at their homes.

A couple of days later I meet Priya, Asha Salin, Leela Raju, Sindhu Suresh, Greeshma Arun and Sanitha Sajeevan at Koonamthai Anganwadi, which is on the lane they live on. The women, aged between 28 and 52, are neighbours; their educational qualifications range from Class V to Class XII (Intermediate). The others are Vasanthi Shaji, Suni Shibu, Shinju Babu and Divya Raju. Nine of the women have autorickshaws, while Divya is to be in-charge of the central kitchen where the food will be prepared.

Four of the nine three-wheelers are parked in a line outside their houses. The e-vehicles, fabricated by Lifeway Solar Devices, are mounted with solar panels to power the lights. All the women had to get a three-wheeler driving license before they bought the vehicles. “It is not as easy as it sounds,” says Asha. Two-wheeler and four-wheeler license are prerequisites for this, so she had to learn how to drive a four-wheeler. “I already had a license,” says Leela who used to be an autorickshaw driver. The rickshaws have been bought, and outfitted, with a bank loan and another from Kudumbashree totalling ₹4 lakh each.

The ideation Councillor Jaleel Pamangadan got the idea of vending food through three-wheelers when he was on a trip to Bengaluru.

“I saw food being sold on a Royal Enfield motorbike. There isn’t much space on a motorcycle to do that, but it was done efficiently,” he says. “That set me thinking about using a small vehicle, preferably a three-wheeler that women could use for the same purpose.”

Back home, he pitched the idea to the Kalamasserry Municipality.

He then got in touch with Lifeway Solar Devices, which made a prototype of the e-vehicle. “I thought of e-vehicles as it would significantly cut down their expenses and be sustainable too,” he says

The project is part of National Urban Livelihood Mission (NULM)

This is the primary occupation for most of these women, but some, like Greeshma have other jobs. She works at a cable company keeping accounts from 9 am to 5.30 pm; then sets out after work with the rickshaw to her spot at Pathadipalam. “It is so hectic, I barely manage a couple of hours of rest. By the time we get home it is past 2 am, it’s almost 5 am by the time we go to bed. This would be impossible without the support of our families,” says Greeshma.

“It has almost been two months since we launched, and we have all lost weight because there is so much work and no rest or time to eat,” says 34 year-old Asha, as the others burst out laughing. The last month-and-a-half has been tough, but they are slowly finding their balance.

The menu is tried, tested and more importantly, familiar. Priya, Sindhu, Suni and Shinju attended a month-long training programme by Kudumbashree in Thrissur. “It helped ready us in terms of how to prepare food on this scale,” says Priya. Asha chips in, “We cook like we do for our families, we take a portion out for our use. Anyway we are cooking, this way we save time.”

Prices are standardised — one dosa costs ₹6, a chapathi ₹8 and one parotta is ₹10. The prices of fish dishes depends on the variety of fish used — ayala (mackerel), mathi (sardines) and kozhuva (anchovy). A meal costs around ₹150.

Since most of these women set shop after six, office-goers returning from work are regular customers. Leela, however, begins at 3.30 pm, since her spot is at Cochin University of Science and Technology (CUSAT). “I start with bhajjis, and later my husband or son-in-law bring the dinner items,” she says. Since she starts early, she is done by midnight.

“As of now we are neither making a profit nor a loss,” says Asha. The women are buoyed by the flow of regular customers and positive feedback. The late hours by the roads don’t scare them. “There are enough policemen on the roads and people are decent,” says Priya, “What is there to be afraid of?”",food,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/5dx8va/article30870412.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21KIMPKUDUMBASHREE7,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/amma-ruchi-with-its-bright-autos-selling-fresh-home-style-food-to-kochis-office-goers-is-keralas-answer-to-food-trucks/article30870415.ece
417,2020/02/20,"Not right to deprive child’s access to grandparents, says Bombay High Court","Woman’s petition challenging a family court order rejected

Observing that it is not right to deprive access of a child to his/her grandparents, the Bombay High Court has directed a Mumbai-based woman to let her 10-year-old son meet her former in-laws once a week.

A Division Bench of Justices S.J. Kathawalla and B.P. Colabawalla earlier this week rejected a petition filed by the woman challenging a family court order, which directed her to let her late husband’s parents meet their grandson once a week, or as and when they come to Mumbai from Delhi.

The woman, who has now remarried, in her petition claimed that when she was married to her late husband, she was not treated well by her in-laws. She also said her son had never met his grandparents since his birth.

The Bench, however, refused to accept this argument.

“The reason given by the appellant (woman) that she was not treated well by her in-laws cannot be a ground to deprive access of the child to his grandparents. If the boy has not met his grandparents till date, it is the appellant who is responsible for it,” the court said.

The boy was born in December 2009. His father died in February 2010. The boy’s mother then started living with her parents and later remarried. The woman’s former in-laws approached the family court seeking access to their grandchild.

In June 2014, the family court allowed the grandparents to meet the boy whenever they visit Mumbai.

However, the woman did not comply with the order following which the grandparents re-approached the family court seeking execution of its 2014 order.

The family court, in its order last month, directed the woman to allow the grandparents to meet the child on the court premises every Saturday, and warned that if she fails to do so, a fine of ₹5,000 would be imposed on her. The woman then approached the High Court.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/fbaxm4/article30866856.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20BMBOMBAYHIGHCOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/not-right-to-deprive-childs-access-to-grandparents-says-bombay-high-court/article30866857.ece
418,2020/02/20,552-year-old Haji Ali Dargah listed in World Book of Records,"The unique marble structure houses the tomb of saint Pir Haji Ali Shah Bukhari and a masjid

Mumbai’s Haji Ali Dargah has been listed in the World Book of Records as one of the most visited shrines. The 552-year-old dargah which boasts of Indo-Islamic architecture is not only a popular religious site but also a tourist attraction.

The certificate was handed over to dargah chairman and seniormost managing trustee Abdul Sattar Merchant last week by the official team of the World Book of Records.

“As managing trustees, we have been striving for the best for the dargah. It is a unique place where people from different castes and creed visit everyday in large numbers,” said trustee Suhail Khandwani adding that the dargah has a daily footfall of 50,000 people. “On Thursday, Friday and Sunday, the visitors go up to one lakh,” he said.

Located on an islet, the unique marble structure houses the tomb of the saint Pir Haji Ali Shah Bukhari and a masjid. The dargah can be reached through a pathway, that can be accessed only during low tide. It is under restoration and the cost of the project is pegged at ₹40 crore.

Vice-president of the World Book Records-India Usman Khan said the dargah is unique in many ways. “Not only it is located on a small island but also brings together people from all religions,”he said adding that the committee had applied to them. “We have a team that conducts ground work to see if the application is well deserving. After our selection, we send it for final approval to the World Book of Records-London which issues the certificate,” said Mr. Khan.

The World Book of Records has many such listings. For example, BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir in Vadodara and Shree Mahakaleshwar Temple in Ujjain have been listed among the most visited temples and Nepal’s Pashupatinath Temple for being the oldest temple with mythological significance among others.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/article19493241.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15THHAJIALI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/552-year-old-haji-ali-dargah-listed-in-world-book-of-records/article30866394.ece
419,2020/02/20,DYFI protesters stopped at Tilak Nagar,"500 held for over 12 hours in a school, let off in the evening for Chaityabhoomi protest

The Mumbai Police on Wednesday restrained nearly 500 members of the Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) from marching to Chaityabhoomi in Dadar, holding them for over 12 hours at a school in Tilak Nagar where they had halted. They were allowed to leave at 6.30 p.m. in their own vehicles to participate in the protest at Chaityabhoomi.

The march had been organised from Uran to Chaityabhoomi against the Citizenship Amendment Act, National Register of Citizens and National Population Register along with issues of unemployment, privatisation of public sector undertakings and education.

“It was the fifth time in four days that we were being detained by the police. We were kept as prisoners and treated like we had committed a crime. Some of the protesters from Amravati wanted to go back home, but the police did not let them leave,” Preeti Shekhar, State secretary, DYFI, said.

The protesters started walking from Uran on Sunday, after which the Navi Mumbai Police arrested and later released them on personal bonds on Tuesday. Ms. Sekhar said many of them were taken to railway stations and bus stops and forced to board trains or buses going out of the city. “Many arrived as late as 2.30 a.m. We didn’t know where they had been taken and which police stations they were in. The picture began to emerge only in the morning,” she said.

On Wednesday, the protesters congregated at their halting point at Adarsh Vidyalaya in Tilak Nagar and planned to march to Chaityabhoomi. The police, however, blocked the entrances and refused to let anyone leave, protesters said.

Around 4 p.m., members of the central committee of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) Dr. Ashok Dhavale and Mahendra Singh and MLA Vinod Nikole, arrived at the spot and asked the police to let the protesters leave for Chaityabhoomi. The police, however, refused to do so.

Dr. Dhavale said, “The State government is trying to destroy this peaceful march. It is shameful that the government is allowing Raj Thackeray’s Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) to carry out a rally only because the MNS is supporting the Bharatiya Janata Party. [Chief Minister] Uddhav Thackeray said they are against the NRC, but still allow its supporters to carry out a rally.”

Deputy Commissioner of Police (Zone- VI) Shashikumar Meena said the police had “to restrict the protesters” at the school as they did not have permission for the march. “We even made arrangements to drop them [to Chaityabhoomi] by police vehicles and also called BEST buses for them, but they refused to come along with us. Later, we allowed them to use their personal vehicles [accompanied by us]. We reached Chaityabhoomi around 7.45 p.m. and the protesters stayed there till 9,” Mr. Meena said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/x5gnme/article30865220.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20BMDYFI1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/dyfi-protesters-stopped-at-tilak-nagar/article30865221.ece
420,2020/02/20,MMRDA invites fresh bids to complete Metro 2B works,"Previous contracts cancelled over slow progress

The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) has floated tenders for the balance works on Metro 2B, following its termination of two contractors earlier this month for slow pace of construction.

The authority on Wednesday floated three separate tenders for the remaining works along the corridor, which include the construction of a viaduct, 15 stations and the proposed car depot at Mandale in Mankhurd.

The first tender is for an elevated viaduct and five stations — work that had been awarded to a consortium of M/s.MBZ and M/s. RCC for ₹521 crore. Sources said the earlier contractor completed only 4.48% of the work on the 5.9-km stretch in 30 months.

The estimated cost of the fresh tender is pegged at ₹474.52 crore and the period of completion is set at 30 months from the date the contract is awarded.

The consortium had also been awarded the contract to build the Metro car depot at Mandale at a cost of ₹390.44 crore, where it managed to complete only 6.98% of the work in 36 months. The MMRDA has floated a tender for these works to be completed within 42 months at an approximate cost of ₹464.75 crore.

The third tender pertains to the work that had been awarded to Simplex Infrastructure and includes civil works on 12.7 km of the corridor, starting from ESIC Nagar in Andheri (West) to Income Tax office in Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC). The previous contract, awarded for ₹1,080 crore, also included the construction of 10 stations on the stretch.

According to sources, the contractor only managed to complete 5.07% of the work in 30 months. In the new tender, the balance works are expected to be completed within 30 months at a cost ₹1,058.71 crore.

The MMRDA had also terminated the same company’s contract for Metro 7 for slow execution of works, for which it has since floated a fresh tender.

Metro 2B is being built between DN Nagar and Mandale, and is expected to serve nearly 10.5 lakh passengers daily once it is commissioned. The line was expected to be started by 2021, but due to the issues with contractors the new deadline is end of 2022.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mmrda-invites-fresh-bids-to-complete-metro-2b-works/article30865175.ece
421,2020/02/20,Three parties show interest in reviving Parsi Lying-In Hospital,"BPP, hospital’s managing committee invite tenders

In an attempt to give a new life to the defunct and dilapidated Parsi Lying-In Hospital (PLIH) in Fort, the Bombay Parsi Punchayet (BPP) and the hospital’s managing committee have jointly invited tenders from healthcare companies. Three parties have already shown interest to construct, equip and operate the hospital.

BPP chairman Yazdi Desai confirmed that they have received three expressions of interest, but had not yet looked into the details.

Opened in 1895, the PLIH was a maternity hospital where women could deliver and spend some time recovering after childbirth. The hospital has been defunct for over three decades. In 2011, a plan to convert it into an orthopaedics super specialty hospital failed due to a tussle between BPP trustees and the PLIH managing committee. One of the main contentions was that the lease agreement signed with the healthcare operator was kept secret.

Taking a cue from the past, the BPP and PLIH have now made public announcements. The latest issue of community magazine Parsiana published a letter by Shehnaaz Khambatta, joint deputy chief executive officer of the BPP funds and properties, announcing, “PLIH offers invited.” The letter said the hospital will be given on a sub-lease basis after demolishing the dilapidated structure.

“The hospital has not been in use for more than 30 years; the annual liability towards the collector’s rent and other outgoings is upwards of ₹3.5 crore,” it said. The bidder will place an interest-free refundable security deposit and pay quarterly lease rent computed with reference to a percentage of the gross revenue of the new hospital. Also, provision will be a made for free or concessional treatment for deserving Parsi Zoroastrians.

Plans to redevelop Parsi properties have faced objections from community members in the past. Most recently, plans to revive the Parsee General Hospital had to be stopped after a section of the community opposed them.

“Disposing of community trust property is highly problematic. The interested party needs deep pockets, plenty of patience, a willingness to fight legal battles and attempts to malign his or her name and that of their organisation. It’s definitely not for the faint-hearted,” said Jehangir Patel, editor of Parsiana, which has an office on the ground floor of PLIH. The J.J. College of Commerce also occupies a few rooms on the second floor.

BPP’s Mr. Desai agreed that someone from the community may raise objections. “But we are now better prepared,” he said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/7j6pk2/article30865159.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20BMPARSIHOSPITAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/three-parties-show-interest-in-reviving-parsi-lying-in-hospital/article30865160.ece

423,2020/02/20,"On pretext of updating KYC, man duped of ₹86,999","Conman gets debit, credit card details by posing as Paytm customer care executive

A Kharghar resident was allegedly cheated of ₹86,999 by an unidentified man pretending to be a customer care executive of Paytm, who managed to get the victim’s debit and credit card details out of him on the pretext of updating his KYC.

Santosh Jain, who retired as an additional general manager from the Nuclear Power Corporation of India, filed a complaint with the Kharghar police on Monday.

Mr. Jain received a call around 12.30 p.m. on November 30, 2019, with the caller saying he was from Paytm. The caller said the KYC of Mr. Jain’s Paytm account was about to expire and needed to be updated. He asked Mr. Jain to provide details of his debit and credit cards. Mr. Jain gave him the details of his Bank of India debit card and State Bank of India credit card.

The caller then asked Mr. Jain to download Google Pay and TeamViewer QuickSupport apps to complete the process. After downloading the apps, Mr. Jain filled in the required information in Google Pay, following which he got a message that ₹76,000 had been debited from his Bank of India account, and ₹10,999 had been spent on his SBI credit card.

When Mr. Jain asked the caller about this, the conman said the money would be credited to the Paytm account, and disconnected the call.

Realising that he had been duped, Mr Jain blocked both cards and asked the banks to revert the payment. Since the banks did not do so, Mr. Jain approached the Kharghar police and filed a case.

“QuickSupport is a remote access app, using which the conman could access the complainant’s details. No details of bank accounts or cards should be revealed on the phone to anyone. No app should be downloaded on recommendation of any caller either,” an officer from the Kharghar police station said.

The unidentified caller has been booked under Section 66D of IT Act (cheating by personation online).",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/on-pretext-of-updating-kyc-man-duped-of-86999/article30865097.ece
424,2020/02/20,Hawkers pool in for friend’s weight loss surgery,"Thane vegetable and fruit sellers collect ₹1.43 lakh for fellow vendor, who lost 18 kg after procedure

Altogether 46 vegetable and fruit vendors from a market in Kopri contributed humble amounts to fund a weight loss surgery of a fellow vendor who weighed 140 kg. With contributions ranging from ₹2,500 to ₹10,000, Vasant Kanade (51) managed to raise ₹1.43 lakh and went under the knife earlier this month. He has already lost 18 kg and his health problems like breathing difficulty, sleep disorder and backache have reduced to some extent.

With a monthly income varying from ₹10,000 to ₹15,000, Mr. Kanade, who is the sole earning member of his family comprising his wife and two daughters, only had savings of about ₹25,000. “Because of my health problems, I would spend a lot of money on medicines every month. It had come to a point where I would struggle to manage household expenses,” said Mr. Kanade, a Thane resident who decided to consider the option of bariatric surgery after coming across a television interview of a doctor talking about the procedure.

Vasant Kanade

In September last year, he consulted bariatric surgeon Dr. Manish Motwani from Astha Healthcare in Mulund, who gave him an estimate of ₹3.5 lakh for the procedure. As the news spread in the market, fellow vendors began enquiring with Mr. Kanade and considering his financial constraints, began offering small amounts.

“We have been friends for long and I have seen how the health issues were troubling him. He has always stood by me when I needed him. This was my time to stand by him,” said Vilas Ambre, a vegetable vendor who contributed ₹2,500.

Another vendor, Mahesh Kharpude who contributed ₹3,000, said he decided to stand by Mr. Kanade because of his “good heart”. “He was apprehensive to accept money from us at first. But we managed to convince him,” said Mr. Kharpude. At times, Mr. Kanade would be so sick that he would be unable to walk due to swollen legs, he said.

Vaibhav Jadhav, a vendor who contributed the highest sum of ₹10,000, said it was difficult to see a friend suffer so much. “He had hypertension and would have severe breathing difficulty,” he said.

In the first week of February, Mr. Kanade underwent a sleeve gastrectomy procedure, which involves stapling the stomach to restrict food intake. “The surgery went well and he has already lost 18 kg,” said Dr. Motwani. The hospital waived the remaining amount.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/oig1ya/article30865104.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20BM-veggie-vendors,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/hawkers-pool-in-for-friends-weight-loss-surgery/article30865052.ece
425,2020/02/20,Body of drowned teenager recovered,"Police suspect girl may have taken her own life, but say motive is not yet known

The body of a 19-year-old girl, who drowned in an open drain in Goregaon on Tuesday night, was recovered early on Wednesday. The Bangur Nagar police said prima facie, her death seems to have been a suicide.

Komal Mandal was a resident of the Bhagat Singh Nagar, which is close to the open drain. The fire brigade received a call about the incident around 8.30 p.m. on Tuesday and rushed a team to the spot.

A senior fire brigade officer said, “We entered the nullah using boats and on foot. Since it was high tide, we went as far as we could. The nullah meets the sea at Versova. The locals also helped us. Since we did not find the girl, we started looking around the spot where the incident had occurred.”

The officer said the body was recovered not far from the spot around 3.30 a.m. on Wednesday, as the water had receded. It was taken to Shatabdi Hospital in Kandivali.

“It seems the girl took her own life. We are investigating the reason for it. Her family has not been able to provide any motive for her extreme step. Mandal used to work in a battery manufacturing unit in Oshiwara, and is survived by her parents, three younger sisters and a brother,” senior police inspector Shobha Pise, Bangur Nagar police station, said.

Bhushan Kumar Malhotra, a nearby resident, said there was no way Komal could have accidentally fallen into the nullah, as it has a high steel railing around it.

The police have registered an accidental death report.

Meanwhile, a group of journalists visiting the area to speak to the Mandal family on Tuesday night was allegedly manhandled by local residents. Police officials said the reporters were leaving the Mandal residence, when eight to nine men accosted them and started insisting that they be interviewed as well. The men allegedly said they wanted to highlight the delay on the part of the authorities in responding to the situation.

“When the journalists told the men they could not be interviewed as they were not directly related to the deceased, the men shoved the journalists and dragged them out of the area physically. We have registered a case against unidentified persons and are conducting further inquiries in the matter,” Ms. Pise said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/xh741t/article30865044.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20BMNULLAH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/body-of-drowned-teenager-recovered/article30865046.ece
426,2020/02/20,Using children for poll work: HC issues notice to Varsha Gaikwad,"Petition urges HC to declare minister’s election null and void

The Bombay High Court recently issued a notice to Congress MLA from Dharavi, Varsha Gaikwad, after a local resident alleged that Ms. Gaikwad used children aged between 9 and 13 for campaigning and other work during the Assembly election, which is contrary to the Election Commission (EC) rules and the code of conduct. She is currently the School Education Minister.

A single Bench of Justice S.C. Gupte was hearing an election petition filed by Ashish More (47), a resident of Dharavi, in December 2019. He relied upon circulars issued by the EC in 2009, 2013, 2014 and 2017, prohibiting involvement of children in the election process.

The petition also mentioned an order passed by the HC stating ‘political parties must ensure there is no participation of minor children in election-related activities and that no child is involved in the entire process.’ Mr. More had attached photographs of children’s involvement during the election campaign in the plea. He had also filed a complaint with the senior police inspector of Dharavi police station on October 12, 2019. Mr. More filed the petition under the Representation of the People Act, the Child, Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, and the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) of Children Act.

He said the code of conduct for the election was in force till October 30, 2019. However, Ms. Gaikwad held a rally on October 28 involving children, he claimed. He also alleged that Ms. Gaikwad had not shown the expenses incurred for the rally to poll officials.

Mr. More urged the court to call for records of the rally and direct the Maharashtra State Commission for Protection of Children (MSCPC) to take disciplinary action against the Congress leader. He also appealed to the HC to declare Ms. Gaikwad’s election as MLA null and void, and ban her from contesting in Maharashtra for the next six years.

The Bench issued notices to Ms. Gaikwad, MSCPC, and Women and Child Development Department, and posted the matter for hearing on March 9.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ryhssw/article30865008.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20BMVARSHAGAIKWAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/using-children-for-poll-work-hc-issues-notice-to-varsha-gaikwad/article30864985.ece
427,2020/02/20,Two held for stabbing Powai resident to death,"Victim, a Zomato delivery executive, had an argument with a roadside vendor over not paying for fruits bought from him

The police on Wednesday arrested two men for allegedly killing a 30-year-old Powai resident late on Tuesday. The accused were nabbed within six hours of the murder.

According to the Powai police, the murder was reported to them a little after midnight. “We were informed that a murder victim had been brought dead at Hiranandani Hospital and sent a team to conduct inquiries. We were able to identify the deceased as Amol Suradkar, a resident of the Gokhale Nagar area in Powai who worked as a delivery executive with Zomato,” an officer with the Powai police said.

Subsequent inquiries indicated that Suradkar had been in an argument with two men just a couple of hours before his murder was reported.

The team then fanned out in the area and, with the help of local informants, identified the suspects as Sachin Singh (20) and Jitendra alias Pran (32).

“We found out that Mr. Singh is from Pratapgarh in Uttar Pradesh and obtained information about trains leaving for Pratapgarh. Based on this information, we sent teams to Kalyan and Lokmanya Tilak Terminus (LTT) railway stations. We found Mr. Singh on board a mail train that was about to depart from LTT when our team got there,” Assistant Commissioner of Police (Saki Naka division) Milind Khetle said.

Mr. Khetle said inquiries with Mr. Singh, who still had the murder weapon in his possession when he was caught, led to the arrest of Mr. Jitendra from Powai.

“Mr. Singh used to sell fruits on a handcart for a living and Suradkar would often take a few fruits from him without paying for them. Lately, he had started bringing his friends to Mr. Singh’s cart to have fruits for free, which did not go down well with Mr. Singh. This led to an argument on Tuesday night, following which the two stabbed Suradkar to death with the knife that Mr. Singh used to cut fruits,” Mr. Khetle said.

Both accused have been charged with murder under the Indian Penal Code.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/75bx94/article30864982.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20bm-Powai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/two-held-for-stabbing-powai-resident-to-death/article30864983.ece
428,2020/02/20,"Soon, motorists to get seamless connectivity from WEH to BKC","Elevated road on Hans Burga Marg, likely to be ready by Oct., will ease congestion

In a few months’ time, motorists will be able to seamlessly travel between Kurla and Santacruz in around 15 minutes.

The elevated road being constructed as an extension of Santacruz-Chembur Link Road on Hans Burga Marg is expected to be completed by October. It will provide motorists direct access to Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) and Kapadia Nagar in Kurla on LBS Marg, from Santacruz on the Western Express Highway (WEH).

The elevated road has been designed in such a way that it doesn’t add to the congestion at Vakola junction on the highway. It will cross over the Vakola flyover and then run parallel to it towards Borivali. “The elevated road will meet WEH at Ramnagar Bridge, which is a little after the Vakola flyover towards the north. Such an arrangement will ensure safe merging of traffic from the elevated corridor with the traffic on the highway,” an official from the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) said.

At present, there are heavy traffic snarls on Hans Burga Marg during rush hour, as it is used by motorists travelling from BKC or LBS Marg to WEH and vice versa.

MMRDA officials said the elevated road will reduce the congestion on the road below. The 5-km-long road will have two lanes for 3.3 km and four lanes for the remaining distance. The project is estimated to cost ₹560 crore, of which ₹225 crore has been spent, MMRDA officials said.

Officials said that once completed, the elevated road will serve as another east-west connector and an entry point to BKC from the Kurla end. The road, along with the the Kalanagar flyover scheduled to be commissioned by March, is expected to ease access to BKC.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/aqf94f/article30864963.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20BMFLYOVER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/soon-motorists-to-get-seamless-connectivity-from-weh-to-bkc/article30864940.ece
429,2020/02/20,Forgery case: developer back in police custody after discharge from hospital,"Real estate developer and director of Bhumiraj Group, Bhupendra Shah, who was admitted to MGM Hospital following his arrest, was discharged on Tuesday after JJ Hospital gave a report that he did not need to be admitted.

Mr. Shah was arrested on February 12 in a cheating and forgery case and remanded in police custody till February 15. But after reaching the police station, Mr. Shah’s blood pressure shot up. He was taken to Uran rural hospital by the Nhava Sheva police where doctors referred him to MGM Hospital.

On February 13, senior police inspector Pramod Jadhav from Nhava Sheva police station approached court to get the police custody order cancelled to save the days meant for police custody. The court granted magisterial custody and asked for a report from JJ Hospital to ensure if the hospital admission was necessary.

After the report from JJ Hospital suggested that Mr. Shah was fit to be taken into custody, he was discharged from MGM Hospital. Later he was presented before the court, which sent him to police custody till Thursday. “There could be more accused involved in the case and to identify them, the custody of Mr. Shah is required,” Ashok Dudhe, Deputy Commissioner of Police, Zone II, said.

A case against Mr. Shah was registered on December 3 at Nhava Sheva police station for forgery of a farmer’s certificate that was used to usurp an 80-acre plot at Gavhan. Before Mr. Shah, four people — Anil Sawant (45), Krishna Gawli (35), Ramesh Bhalerao (54) and Satish Shirke (47) — were arrested in December 2019.

The farmer’s certificate was made after purchasing an agricultural land in Latur. The land belonged to Sopan Gawli, who was father-in-law of a talathi of Karjat — Mr. Bhalerao. The land from Mr. Gawli was purchased in 2006 by Mr. Shirke and Mr. Sawant who posed as Harilal Hinduja and Ratanlal Wadhwa respectively.

In 2007, it was sold to Mr. Shah. In 2011, Mr. Shah sold it to the first owner’s wife, Rahibai Sopan Gawli. During investigations, it was found that the photo and signature of Mr. Shah in the documents of purchase in 2007 and in the documents of sale in 2011 are of different persons and not of the original Mr. Shah.

“The one who posed as Mr. Shah in 2011 was Mr. Shirke while we are yet to find out who signed as Mr. Shah in 2007. After the deal of 2007, Mr. Shah procured the farmer’s certificate which he used to purchase the 80 acres at Gavhan in Nhava Sheva,” Mr. Dudhe said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/forgery-case-developer-back-in-police-custody-after-discharge-from-hospital/article30864913.ece

432,2020/02/20,LNG import terminal at Karaikal port to commence operations in 2021,"The project will provide clean and affordable fuel to Puducherry, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, the CEO of the company said

The LNG (liquefied natural gas) import facility at Karaikal port in Puducherry is likely to commence commercial operations by the fourth quarter of 2021.

Puducherry chief minister V. Narayanaswamy performed the ground-breaking ceremony for the LNG facility, owned and operated by the Singapore-based Atlantic Gulf and Pacific (AG&P), one of the global leaders in running LNG and gas logistics and distribution solutions.

Karaikal LNG will serve the city gas networks of AG&P, and other city gas companies. AG&P has city gas distribution license for Kanchipuram and Ramanathapuram districts of Tamil Nadu.

JM Sigelman, CEO of AG&P said, Karaikal LNG is a cornerstone project for Puducherry, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka that will provide clean and affordable fuel.

LNG will be exported from countries like the US, Oman and Qatar. The gas will be delivered to end customers -- vehicles, kitchens, large and small factories, power, restaurants and malls, he said. “This is part of our $1.5 billion commitment in southern India,” Mr. Sigelman said.

The USD 1.5 billion investment will be made over a decade towards the LNG terminal and city gas distribution network.

Karaikal LNG import terminal will complement Indian Oil’s LNG terminal at Ennore and will provide wider gas accessibility to Puducherry and Tamil Nadu for industrial development.

The re-gasification terminal at Karaikal port is located 4 km away from a tie-in point on GAIL's Narimananan-Kuthalam natural gas pipeline network to provide gas to customers in Tamil Nadu.

The Karaikal LNG import facility is being built on a 12-hectare site within the Karaikal port, 280 km south of Chennai. It will have an initial capacity of 1 million tonnes per annum (mtpa), and increase it to 6 mtpa in a phased manner. The facility will include a floating storage unit, leased through a long-term charter agreement with ADNOC Logistics and Services from 2021.

The LNG terminal will provide natural gas to power plants, industrial and commercial customers within a 300 km radius stretching in to interiors of Tamil Nadu.

Mr. Narayanaswamy said overcoming bureaucratic hurdles, the project has taken off. With large parcels of land available at Puducherry, he urged investors to invest in the Union Territory.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/xbnyqf/article30868842.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20FEBTH--Narayansamyjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/lng-import-terminal-at-karaikal-port-to-commence-operations-in-2021/article30868843.ece

434,2020/02/20,Mrityu Ghar is a tale of hope and defiance in the face of brutal crackdown,"The play depicts the struggle of three women tortured for their anti-State political activities

Set in a restive period of peasant rebellion, with a nervous State responding with brutal crackdown, Mrityu Ghar is a searing Bangladeshi play that focuses on the tormented lives of three women who are jailed and tortured for their political activities against the State.

Written by Atik Rahman and performed by the Mukul Ghetto Tigers, Bangladesh with direction by Mukul Ahmed, the play was staged at the 21st Bharat Rang Mahotsav’s parallel theatre festival of the National School of Drama at Adishkati theatre in Auroville.

With the life of three women — Asha, Kalpana and Bina — at stake, women’s resistance in the face of gruesome police brutality unleashed by the State serves as the backdrop of the play.

German roots

Mrityu Ghar is an adaptation of celebrated German playwright Dea Loher’s first play Olga’s Room (published in 1992) that traced the life and travails of the German-Jewish communist rebel tortured in the Nazi Germany.

The hour-long play depicts the life of the three women as they are pitted against their torturer, Zafar, with whom lies their fate in the jail.

With minimal props — a table, stool, and a pair of thick ropes dangling in the backdrop — an evil symbolism pervades the setting.

Eventually Asha, who is pregnant like Olga, will be placed in a gas chamber. Her story is a tale of survival as she struggles to hold onto her disintegrating sense of self.

Asha symbolises defiance in the face of most hostile of conditions, as she challenges a sadist like Zafar.

“The women are tortured by Pakistan police but we wanted to show the way police brutality becomes the face of authoritarian repression...which is something that resonates across the world, peoples and periods,” said Mr. Ahmed. “Through the dark events that unfold in the lives of these women, Asha stands as a symbol of hope and optimism that social change is possible, whatever sacrifice it may take,” said the director.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/b8wyok/article30865006.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH19DRAMA2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/mrityu-ghar-is-a-tale-of-hope-and-defiance-in-the-face-of-brutal-crackdown/article30865007.ece

439,2020/02/20,Pongala banners to turn cloth bags,"Joint effort of advertising firm, Kudumbashree

The Attukal Pongala this year will provide an opportunity for the city to flaunt its green image. Cloth used for printing banners and boards for the festival will be turned into shopping bags by Kudumbashree and sold to city residents at an affordable price. The Kudumbashree district mission has entered into an agreement with an advertising firm to reuse the cloth.

Balamurali Krishnan of the advertising firm says that with the ban on flex boards, the likelihood of a shift to cloth boards is more. The problem, though, is the difference in cost. While the cost of printing a flex board is ₹8 a sq.ft., that for cloth is ₹25 to ₹30. Another issue is removal of these banners after the events.

To address these issues, the firm has finalised a project after talks with the Kudumbashree district mission and the city Corporation. Under the project, the firm will print cloth banners and boards at ₹18 a sq ft and for those bringing the used banners back, the firm will pay back ₹6 a sq ft.

Parassala centre

The cloth thus collected will be handed over for free to a common facilitation centre of the Kudumbashree at Parassala to make cloth bags, which will be sold at ₹5 or ₹6.

The Parassala facilitation centre of the Kudumbashree that has been struggling to keep up production owing to the high cost of cloth will also get an opportunity to overcome a rough patch.

Over 2 lakh cloth bags are expected to reach the market under the agreement.

For the advertising firm, the bags will get publicity — the bags will carry its name and contact number.

442,2020/02/20,Capital to become a 24-hour city,"Cabinet approval for operating commercial establishments, eateries all-night in designated areas

The capital city’s tag as a city which sleeps early, with its streets deserted and shops shuttered by nightfall, is set to change with the State Cabinet’s decision on Wednesday to accord permission for commercial establishments, including restaurants, to function round-the-clock in areas designated by the Corporation.

The government will also form a committee consisting of officials of the Tourism, Police, Local Self-Government and Labour departments and the city Corporation to oversee the new system and to ensure safety measures.

The plan is to extend the same to other cities by April this year. Earlier this year, the Maharashtra government had also lifted restrictions on trading hours to allow shopping and dining round-the-clock.

At present, most of the commercial establishments here function between 9 a.m and 9 p.m, with restaurants and bars staying open till 11 p.m. A handful of restaurants and wayside eateries function up to 1 a.m. or 2 a.m.

Hoteliers’ reaction

According to office-bearers of the Kerala Hotel and Restaurant Association, who participated in a meeting convened by the government in this regard, the officials had raised the issue of non-availability of food in the city after 11 p.m. “We are ready to keep our shops open, as long as the government can ensure security even late at night. Some of our members are concerned whether there will be enough business to justify the extra costs in keeping the restaurants and shops open round-the-clock,” says Vijayakumar, district secretary, KHRA.

While some restaurant owners are hopeful that there is a considerably huge crowd who would choose to dine out and shop at night, some others are wondering whether there would be enough attitudinal change among the city crowd to make the move a success.

444,2020/02/20,Mumbai City in must-win situation,"Game in hand puts Chennaiyin at an advantage

The one match in hand for Chennaiyin FC, before its ISL season six campaign comes to a close, may calm nerves in the visitor’s dugout and improve its performance against Mumbai City FC at the Mumbai Football Arena here on Friday night. The home side, meanwhile, faces a win-at-all-costs situation in its concluding league game.

Victory for fourth-placed MCFC, coached by Jorge Costa, will keep it in the reckoning for the league play-offs. Chennaiyin, in fifth place heading into its penultimate tie, won’t mind a draw in a tough away match. The visitor travels to Guwahati next to face NorthEastUnited FC and a win there will be enough to seal a berth in the play-offs.

Multiple options

MCFC is at full strength for this crucial game, giving Costa multiple options. The blues attack has forwards Modou Sougou of Senegal and Amine Chermiti of Tunisia as focal points. Diego Carlos, Mohammed Larbi, Bidyananda Singh, and Rowlin Borges also possess goal-scoring skills.

CFC will have to work over-time to keep MCFC’s marauders in check. If the visitor’s defensive formation under coach Owen Coyle can handle the heat, the contest to control the ball will be engrossing in midfield, where CFC looks better equipped.

Potent threat

Lithuanian forward Nerijus Valskis — 13 goals, four assists and 41 shots on goal in 16 leagues appearances in his debut season for CFC — remains a threat to any opponent, especially MCFC whose backline has a tendency to switch off. With captain Amrinder Singh in goal, the blues have let in the most goals among the first four squads — 28 against 25 scored.

Replying to a query about no players ruled out due to card suspensions, Costa observed: “We still have some injuries, it will go on till the end of the season. It feels good to have more options for the last game of the season, the most important match for us. This is one game we want to win, we need to win.”

CFC coach Coyle, said: “in terms of fighting for our lives, we have been doing that for three months, since I came to the club.

Manchester City showed no signs of letting their off-field problems distract them as they comfortably beat relegation-threatened West Ham United 2-0 in their re-arranged Premier League game on Wednesday.

City took the lead on the half hour from a well-worked corner routine, Rodri rising to meet Kevin De Bruyne delivery with a superbly angled header at the near post.

De Bruyne doubled the lead in the 62nd minute, squeezing in a right-foot shot at Lukasz Fabianski's near post after a swift exchange with Bernardo Silva.

UEFA handed City a two-year ban from European football on Friday for serious breaches of their Financial Fair Play regulations. The Premier League champions deny the charges and are appealing against the decision.

While manager Pep Guardiola deflected pre-game television questions about the issue, City fans had no such reticence, shouting chants aimed at UEFA, including one which ended with “we will see you in court”.

447,2020/02/20,Champions League | Werner penalty gives Leipzig 1-0 win at Tottenham,"Timo Werner's 58th-minute penalty after a foul by Ben Davies on Konrad Laimer was enough for Julian Nagelsmann's Bundesliga side to take an advantage home for the second leg on March 10, although they might rue not putting the last-16 tie to bed.

RB Leipzig marked their first appearance in the Champions League knockout round with a deserved 1-0 victory at last season's runners-up Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday as their impressive season continued.

Timo Werner's 58th-minute penalty after a foul by Ben Davies on Konrad Laimer was enough for Julian Nagelsmann's Bundesliga side to take an advantage home for the second leg on March 10, although they might rue not putting the last-16 tie to bed.

Tottenham, without injured strikers Harry Kane and Son Heung-min, were largely outplayed and will need the sort of heroics they produced away at Manchester City and Ajax Amsterdam last season to keep their European quest alive.

But for inspired keeper and captain Hugo Lloris and some wayward finishing from Leipzig, they would be facing an even tougher task in the return leg.

“Leipzig are a very, very good team with a lot of energy. We had some situations that we could have managed better,” Lloris said. “We're not really happy with the result, but we did it last season -- let's hope we try to create another story.”

Tottenham did rally late on as Leipzig appeared to settle for a narrow win and the hosts came close to equalising with the impressive Giovani Lo Celso curling a free kick against the post and Lucas Moura heading over.

The first German club to play at Tottenham's magnificent new stadium was Bayern Munich in October and they marked their visit with a 7-2 humiliation of their hosts.

Leipzig, who are one point behind leaders Bayern in the Bundesliga, attacked the Tottenham defence with similar relish and could have scored three times in the opening three minutes.

In a whirlwind opening, Patrik Schick fired wide before Angelino's shot was deflected against the post by Lloris who seconds later blocked Werner's shot from a tight angle.

It was pretty much the pattern of a first half in which Tottenham's defence was stretched by the pace and incisive passing of Leipzig. Schick headed another chance wide and Lloris again denied the dangerous Werner.

Steven Bergwijn forced a fine save by Peter Gulacsi in a rare Tottenham attack while Dele Alli failed to connect with a header but the hosts' attacks were few and far between.

Leipzig, formed only 10 years ago by drinks company Red Bull, got their noses ahead when Davies clumsily took out Laimer, giving Werner the chance to net his seventh goal in the competition this season, all away from home.

Tottenham were indebted to Lloris soon after as he produced a superb save to keep out Schick after Werner's clever dummy.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/qounlw/article30866683.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/WERNERKB,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/champions-league-werner-penalty-gives-leipzig-1-0-win-at-tottenham/article30866684.ece

As part of a plan to beautify Krishna and Godavari rivers, the canals abutting the two rivers will be cleansed and people in the catchment areas will be provided clean drinking water.

The plan is to involve local voluntary organisations, the municipal administration, the Irrigation Department and the Pollution Control Board in the clean-up drive.

Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy on Wednesday launched a website at a review meeting and directed the officials to groom parks and walking tracks along the banks of the canals. He wanted them to ensure that water pollution was completely eliminated.

Chandrababu Naidu of launching a false campaign on the plights of IT companies in Visakhapatnam, Minister for Industries, Commerce and Information Technology Mekapati Goutham Reddy on Wednesday said that it was instilling a sense of insecurity among the companies, causing a huge loss to the sector.

“The government will not take over the buildings of the IT companies for establishment of the Executive capital in Visakhapatnam,” Mr. Goutham Reddy told the media after taking part in a meeting with Chief Executive Officers of several IT companies here on Wednesday.

The Minister said that business process services company Conduent had expressed its willingness to expand their operations in the city.

“The Adani Data Centre will come up in Vsakhapatnam, but at an alternative site as the one that was given to the company at Kapuluppada is needed for some other requirements. The alternative site has been already shown to the company representatives. The government is committed to the growth of IT in Vizag,” he said.

Mr. Goutham Reddy also dismissed the talks that the Millennium Towers at Rushikonda was being acquired.

‘IT policy soon’

Referring to the IT policy, Mr. Goutham Reddy said it would be declared soon.

“The dues of ₹86 crore payable to IT companies will be released in the near future. A meeting will be convened with the managements of engineering colleges in the north Andhra region to apprise them of the requirements of the IT industry,” the Minister said.

The Minister also said that the funds required for the construction of Millennium Towers-2 had been released.

“The Opposition parties are making false allegations that funds are being released for the Executive capital works in Visakhapatnam,” the Minister said.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/93xblj/article30864856.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20VZ3MEKAPATI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/govt-will-not-take-over-buildings-of-it-companies-in-vizag-says-minister/article30864857.ece
450,2020/02/20,Ex-bank manager among 3 sent to jail in loan fraud case,"He illegally sanctioned the overdraft on mortgage of a property

Second Additional Special Judge for CBI cases, Visakhaptnam, G. Satya Prabhakara Rao on Wednesday sentenced a former Senior Branch Manager of Bank of India and two others to three years rigorous imprisonment and imposed a total fine of ₹30,000 in a property mortgage case.

Marella Satyanarayana Murthy, former Senior Branch Manager of the Madhuranagar Branch in Kakinada of East Godavari District, Marisetti Venkata Satya Chandra Sekhar Sudheer Raju and his wife Marisetty Durga were convicted of duping the bank for gains.

Case details

As per the allegations, Satyanarayana Murthy; Sudheer Raju; Durga; Soorabathula Venkata Maruthi Chandra Sekhar, a panel valuer and proprietor of Swapna Soudha Architects & Designers, Kakinada; and Pattamatta Ravi Shankar, an advocate entered into a criminal conspiracy to cheat the bank.

Satyanarayana Murthy, by abusing his official position, fraudulently sanctioned the overdraft on mortgage of a property and disbursed the entire loan amounts to Sudheer Raju and Durga between 2003 and 2006, on the basis of legal opinion of Ravi Shankar that the property had a clear title.

Chandra Sekhar, knowing well that the property mortgaged to the bank was an agricultural land, valued it as a residential property.

The conspiracy caused loss to the bank.

Two loans worth ₹9.25 lakh and ₹9.60 lakh (without interest) were the outstanding when the charge sheet was filed.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/ex-bank-manager-among-3-sent-to-jail-in-loan-fraud-case/article30864800.ece

452,2020/02/20,Mrs. Gandhi denies charges of totalitarian tactics,"The Prime Minister, Mrs. Indira Gandhi, to-day [February 19, New Delhi] refuted in the most categorical terms a suggestion that she was adopting totalitarian tactics and said that whatever programmes she pursued were in line with accepted principles of the party. Addressing the members of the Ruling Congress Parliamentary Party this evening on the eve of the budget session, she assured them that all the resolutions of the Bombay Congress would be implemented within the framework of the present Constitution. She pointed out that the Government was not doing any new thing. Only new methods were being adopted to implement accepted policies and principles. She referred to the new mass upsurge in the Country and appealed to the members to channelise their enthusiasm for constructive purposes. What was necessary was the involvement of the people in the implementation of progressive ideas that were now being pursued by the Government. In a brief reference to the Supreme Court judgment on bank nationalisation, the Prime Minister pointed out that whatever the Government had done following it was only to achieve the socialist ideal. In this context, she said service to the community must be the goal of members of Parliament. Even those who were engaged in professions should try to serve the people in the villages and the Government proposed to provide incentives to them for this purpose. She, however, cautioned that the Government might become a little unpopular because it might not be able to fulfil all the aspirations of the people. Their demands were so numerous and yet legitimate, but the resources at the disposal of the Government were limited. The only way people could be satisfied was to involve them in the task of nation-building.",archives,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/archives/mrs-gandhi-denies-charges-of-totalitarian-tactics/article30862783.ece

454,2020/02/20,Tiruppavai in French,"Andal’s pasurams have been translated by Vasumathi Badrinathan

asumathi Badrinathan, classical vocalist, has translated Andal’s Tiruppavai into French. Le Tiruppavai ou Le chant matinal de Margali has been published by Editions Banyan, Paris. According to Vasumathi, her work is significant, amidst a gamut of translations in the area of contemporary literature.

“The 30 verses of Andal, one of the Azhwars, make for beautiful poetry and have to be read by all. Tiruppavai is a part of Indian culture and heritage, which should not be missed because of language barriers,” she says. “The translation will reach it to international audience, especially the French speaking population,” she adds.

The French work, launched last year, won acclaim in a panel discussion, organised by the Alliance Française de Bombay. It was attended by a large number of poetry-loving and French speaking audience, several officials from the French consulate, including Sonia Barbry, the Consul General of France in Mumbai. The conversation flowed in three languages — French, English and Tamil.

Author of short stories and poems, her linguistic felicity has enabled Vasumathi to translate works in Marathi and Tamil into English and French.

“I believe in building bridges across communities and lands through art and literature. The Tiruppavai translation a milestone in this context,” says Vasumathi, a Fulbright Fellow, Erasmus Mundus scholar and visiting professor to many universities, who has been propagating Carnatic music at international fora for the past several decades. Le Tiruppavai ou Le chant matinal de Margali is currently available in the link: http://www.editions-banyan.com/ produit/le-tiruppavai/

In this email interview, Vasumathi speaks of her love for Andal, her French connection and more:

How did you gain such proficiency in French?

Well, right from an early I have been deeply drawn to languages. I learnt French, Russian, Spanish besides Indian languages. However I decided to specialise in French and obtained my Ph.D. in French at the Lille 3 University in France. I am close to French language. It’s a very soft, musical and beautiful language.

How did the translation happen - what exactly was the trigger apart from the fact that it is great poetry?

Most of my musical productions like Stree Gaanam, MahatmArpan, Vandé Bhaaratam, Muraağam, Darbari Darshan, Concerto Sangeetam, Swar Samvad, etc., have à spoken component to them in order to highlight their salient features. Whenever I perform to a foreign audience, I realise how keen they are to fathom the meaning of the lyrics presented. I try to bring them closer to the lyrical part by explaining the meaning in their own language.

With respect to Tiruppavai, a translated book is an ideal way of reaching out. Besides, today, the world of translation is dominated by contemporary literature. There is very little translation of old texts.

Tiruppavai being one of my favourite poems, I was very keen on translating it. French Indologists are far and few today and I felt I had a responsibility of translating this gem from Sangam literature and taking it to a wider readership. And above all I have a personal connect with this poetry.

During my travels I also noticed how that several Indians of Tamil origin, especially those of the third and fourth generations, living abroad in France and Francophone countries like the Reunion Island were cut off from our literature and our language though they are keen to understand more. This translation could be a bridge for such people to get closer to their roots.

All this triggered me to take up the Tiruppavai to be translated into French. It took me some years to complete this project.

Are you devoted to Andal?

Andal as a feminine figure, as a poetess, as a creator has always intrigued me. She’s an iconoclast in every sense of the term. As a child I used to be mesmerised by the black and white portrait with all its fine details and beauty with Andal standing at the centre, serene and lustrous. She’s timeless and eternally radiant. Her poetry is simple yet evocative and passionate. I belong to a Sri Vaishnavite family and my grandfather was a Sanskrit scholar. Many great scholars used to visit him and discuss these works. I grew up in this milieu, listening to the paasurams and about Andal all my life. With this background, I worked on another project a few years back and released an exclusive album of Carnatic music called “Tamilmarai Isai” — a collection of Azhwar Pasurams. It’s a rather one of it’s kind engagement with the Alwar poetry and music. The Tiruppavai translation was a logical flow from all of this experience.

Have your literary engagements taken you away from the music circuit at home because you haven't been visible here for the past few years?

I have not been visiting Chennai of late during the music season due to domestic compulsions. It was difficult to move away from Mumbai for extended periods of time and to allocate two weeks at a stretch for Chennai music season. However, I have been presenting concerts in various venues in India and overseas.

Recently on January 26, for Republic Day, I curated and presented a special concert titled, “Vande Bhaaratam” in Bangalore. I continue to work on various projects and present them in different concerts and venues across the globe. My literary engagements have certainly not taken me away from music. Rather they share a complementary and symbiotic relationship ! And needless to say, I would be very happy to perform in Chennai again as and when Sabhas invite me !

What was the French literati's reaction to the book?

Well, many French research scholars were extremely happy to see this book. Many of them are deeply involved in Indian literature and some of them do a lot of work in Indian music as well. The book was released by Editions Banyan, a Paris-based publisher specialising in Indian literature, towards the latter part of last year. It was well-timed and prompted many French readers to buy this book as an Xmas and New Year gift.",books,https://www.thehindu.com/books/aob3fw/article30868804.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21FRVASUMATHI,https://www.thehindu.com/books/tiruppavai-in-french/article30868808.ece

456,2020/02/20,Blurring boundaries,"Author Jospeh O’ Neill explains why he does not want to confine himself to one nationality

Even though national boundaries and entry permits like visas are getting more and more defined in the political sense, in the geographical and mental spaces, the boundaries seem to blur. Author Jospeh O’ Neill thinks of himself as a collection of many nationalities, “I had no grand intention to become an American citizen, but then I stayed and stayed. And then there just came a point where I had no real desire to go back to some other place. And I realized that I'd become an American. Maybe not exclusively an American, but in addition to what I was already.“

What was he already? Irish because he was born there, Turkish like his mother and Dutch, since he grew up in the Netherlands. O’Neill says, “When you ask somebody,”Are you an American?” or from wherever, the meaning of that question has changed so much in the last 15-20 years, simply because the meaning of nationality and nationhood has changed so much. The age of globalization has completely emptied the kind of geographic distances that were so significant in the past… for an Irishman to come to the United States involved a perilous journey by ship over the sea. And it involved singing lots of songs before you left, saying goodbye. And once you were in the United States, it involved singing lots of songs about how you were never going to set foot in Ireland again. But nowadays the transfer of people from country to country is not irrevocable in the way that it used to be. You can go backwards and forwards as often you like, subject to legal and financial restrictions. And furthermore, you can stay in touch with everyone back home. So that there's this enormous collapse in the very idea of migration, so that migration becomes less traumatic and less decisive than it used to be. And you have these rather fused and rather blurred identities that emerge as a consequence.”

O’Neill says candidly that the Americans, “… didn't get anything about me or my experience…one of the great pluses of being an immigrant is that you get to start again. In terms of your identity, you get to shed the sort of narratives which cling to you, where you come from. And at the same time, I felt in New York City that people were just interested to take me at face value… They don't ask you where did you go to school and who do you know?

They cannot immediately categorise people in terms of class and background and so forth - people aren't that interested. And it's liberating on the one hand and sort of ignorant on the other hand.”

About American society O”Neill says,“The very specific kind of narrative in American life authorizes people to do whatever it takes to climb up by their boot straps and to make something of themselves -because there's a sort of tolerance within the culture for this sort of irregular kind of self-enrichment…”",authors,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/blurring-boundaries/article30870570.ece
457,2020/02/20,Majrooh Sultanpuri: The wounded heart,"A committed communist, Majrooh Sultanpuri wrote about matters of love and freedom with equal conviction

Main akela hi chala tha janib-e-manzil magar

Log saath aate gaye aur karvan banta gaya

( I set out towards my destination all alone but people began to come along and a caravan was formed.)

With the exception of master poets like Mir Taqi ‘Mir’ or Mirza Ghalib, it seldom happens that an Urdu couplet becomes so popular and is quoted so often that it becomes part of everyday speech and people do not even remember the name of its creator. This is what happened to the above quoted couplet of Majrooh Sultanpuri whose enormous contribution to the Hindi film industry was acknowledged when he became the first lyricist to be decorated with the prestigious Dadasaheb Phalke Award in 1993. In 2013, a commemorative postal stamp was also issued on him.

Hindi literary journal Yugtevar has come out with a special number (January-March, 2020) on him to celebrate his life and work. It offers detailed information about the poet and contains critical appraisals and reminiscences written by, among others, top Urdu critics such as Prof. Shamim Hanfi, Urdu poets like Ali Sardar Jafri and Javed Akhtar, Hindi poets like Subhash Rai, and singers such as Lata Mangeshkar. A selection from his poetry has also been given in the concluding section of the journal.

Majrooh was born on the eve of Id as Asrar ul Hasan Khan in town Nizamabad that fell under police station Sarai Mir in Azamgarh district where his father Sirajul Haq Khan was posted as a police constable although his family belonged to village Ganjehdi near Sultanpur. There seems to be some confusion about the year of birth while the date is unanimously given as October 1. In his article, Akhtar Farooqui mentions 1918 as the year of Majrooh’s birth but Utkarsh Singh settles for 1919 while Rekhta website takes it back to 1915.

Asrar ul Hasan began writing poetry at an early age using the pen name ‘Naseh’ (religious preacher). As a young lad, he fell in love with a girl but failed to receive her affections. Soon, on the advice of his close friends, he became Majrooh (wounded) to the world and remained so until the end. Little wonder that his song “Jab dil hi toot gaya” in film Shahjehan remains hugely popular even now after more than 70 years. Initially, he wrote songs and lyrical song-like nazms but soon turned towards ghazal. As Prof. Shamim Hanfi recalls, in a creative life spanning nearly 60 years, he wrote only fifty odd ghazals and two notable nazms, besides penning more than two thousand film lyrics.

Traditional physician

Young Asrar ul Hasan studied Unani medicine to train as a traditional physician but he practised for only a few years as a Hakim appointed by Sultanpur District Board. He studied Arabic and Persian in Sultanpur and Tanda. While training to become a Unani hakim in Lucknow, he took admission in a music college to learn classical Hindustani music. However, his destiny was not to sing but to write songs for others to sing.

Top Urdu poet Jigar Muradabadi had noticed Majrooh’s talent and Majrooh too treated him as his ustad. He wrote that although Jigar never advised him on his ghazals, but he did shape his poetic temperament. Jigar Muradabadi was the uncrowned king of mushairas (poetic soirées) and he took Majrooh to Bombay (now Mumbai) in 1945 to take part in a mushaira where Majrooh proved to be a big hit. A R Kardar wanted Jigar to write songs for his film Shahjehan but Jigar recommended Majrooh’s name. Thus, the film lyricist was born. Perhaps, it it not common knowledge that Majrooh, whose mother tongue was Awadhi, wrote lyrics for a number of Bhojpuri films too and was a great success.

Impressive persona

It was during the Emergency when Majrooh Sultanpuri and Jaan Nisar Akhtar came to Jawaharlal Nehru University. Majrooh’s was a very impressive persona and he recited his ghazals in a tuneful but robust voice. And, fearlessly, he recited a ghazal that had shades of Kabir in it as it challenged the injustice and oppression. This couplet continues to resonate with me even today.

Sutoon-e-daar par rakhte chalo saron ke chiragh

Jahan talak ye sitam ki siyaah raat chale

(March ahead while placing the lamps of our heads on the opening of wounds till the dark night of oppression lasts.)

This was a poet who had spent two years in jail for reciting a poem at a mill union workers’ meeting in 1949 that harshly criticised the then prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru. A committed communist and member of the All India Progressive Writers’ Association (AIPWA), he followed the communist party’s line that held “Yeh aazadi jhoothi hai” (This freedom is false). The Maharashtra government slapped a case on him and asked him to seek forgiveness if he wanted to avoid jail.

Instead, Majrooh went underground and appeared in public in 1951 to attend a meeting organised to protest the arrests of Faiz Ahmed ‘Faiz’, Sajjad Zahir and others in Pakistan in the Rawalpindi Conspiracy Case. He was arrested after the meeting was over.

458,2020/02/20,The traveller who followed the sun,"A spontaneous friendship between a tourist and her autorickshaw driver, results in an unexpected bridge between Kochi and the tiny village of Seydisfjordur, in Iceland.

“Iceland is an island, as big as Kerala with a population of three and a half lakh people. It has volcanoes and glaciers high mountains and vast wilderness. It is a beautiful country, but as different as can be from green and fertile Kerala. I love both places dearly. I have the best of both worlds” says Thora Bergny, architect and hotelier, who first came to Kerala in 1998.

The Icelander has spent over two decades between these two diametrically opposite worlds, running a hospitality enterprise in both.

Thora runs a guest house in her native small village, Seydisfjordur of 650 inhabitants in a deep fjord on the east coast of Iceland, were the sun disappears behind high mountains four months every year, from November to February.

Though the dark and quiet winter has an appeal of its own, she was tempted to move towards the sun. So when a friend suggested she travel with her to Kerala in 1998 Thora jumped on board.

To cut a long story short, she fell in love with both land and people and came again the following winter — this time with a group of Icelanders.

“The first years I hung out around Kovalam and Trivandrum, but in 2003 I had an architectural project running in my home town, renovating an old bank building and turning it into a hotel. Earlier, I had been impressed with the fantastic antique markets in Mattancherry so I managed to convince my clients that this was best place to source the most fabulous décor for their hotel,” she says.

Finding a secret garden

In 2003 she travelled to Kochi and packed a container of antiques, furnishings, furniture and textiles to send to Iceland. On that trip a life changing event took place. “A knock on the door in my humble room in Burger Street. A rickshaw driver that I had been driving with that day found my cellphone under the seat in his tuktuk. He took the trouble to track me down to return my phone. I was impressed, so I asked him if he was free the next day.”

He was, and since then Faizal Abdul Khader has become her dearest friend, instrumental in Thora’s daily life in India. Through the years they have taken on many projects together.

He was her “go to” man when she decided to make a Mongolian Yurt for her guest house, ‘Hafaldan’, in Iceland. When Thora and her daughter-in-law established an Indian art and craft shop in Seydisfjordur, Faizal introduced contacts, acting as interpreter, guide and project manager.

He also found her a home in Kochi. “When I saw Peace Cottage I knew this was it, I could see with my architectural eyes that this place had potential,” says Thora who converted the house into a four bedroom “tiny-hotel”, blending traditional and contemporary architectural styles. She opened it as Secret Garden in 2007 later adding more rooms, a pool and a Yoga area.

Through all these experiences Thora’s relationship with Kerala and its people grew. “I got to know a lot of people and saw incredible craftsmanship. I find this one of the most fascinating things about India. Artisans can make almost anything by hand,” she says pointing to a recently made stained glass window in her hotel.

It’s has been more than twenty years since Thora and Faizal met, and the partnership has been mutually beneficial. As they worked together to establish her businesses in Kochi, he matured as a professional entrepreneur and was able to improve livelihood prospects for himself and his family.

“Without Faizal none of this would have been possible” Says Thora. He was my connection to a world that I had no knowledge of ...”

The small tranquil hotel “Secret Garden” has bloomed and prospered through both soft and rough times. A steady stream of travellers find their way to Secret Garden now. “They hear about us and seek out our small, secluded hideaway,” says Thora. Faisal manages the property while she is in Iceland.

“I realised quickly that I could not change India,” says Thora, explaining how she ended up finding a home in Kochi. She adds, “But I could allow India to change me.”",life & style,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/1p9jzh/article30870091.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KIMPTHORA1,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/icelander-thora-bergny-and-her-little-hotel-secret-garden-in-kochi/article30870093.ece
459,2020/02/20,"Now, pet birthdays go one level higher with various options","Pup cakes for me please

Move over peanut butter, treats and all things packaged. Pet owners in the city are going all out to treat their furry babies on their birthday in super special ways. A pet spa day followed by a doggie house party are a must. But a birthday party without a cake is no party at all, right? No worries...Hyderabad has home bakers ready to bake a special treat for pets that live up to the saying ‘have a cake and eat it too.’

The idea of making cakes for pets is to allow them to eat as they wish. With ever growing awareness on what is good and bad for your four-legged members, pet owners are only looking for what’s best for them — the premium stuff. So in the menu are ingredients like fresh blueberry, strawberry, coconut flour, carrot and yes, maybe a dollop of peanut butter here and there.

Some like Divya Varam, owner of two-year-old shih tzu Koko, baked a birthday cake for him because nothing can be better than home-made goodies. “Koko’s cake was simple — vanilla sponge cake with ingredients that are safe for him and are easily available, like flour, eggs, vanilla pod, palm sugar (natural), little coconut oil instead of butter and two spoons of milk. One can add dates too in moderation,” explains Divya.

If you are one those who feel your furry baby deserves more than a bowl of treats on his/her birthday then you sure would have turned to google to search for places that cakes for pets. Cakes for pets are still not very common, and home baker Jit Chowdhary regrets not getting a chance to bake a cake specially for pets at Cake O’clock. His dilemma is, “When I get orders for pets, I get very excited but it doesn’t last long. It all fades the moment clients say, ‘But we are the ones who will eat the cake,” he laughs.

He reasons “I agree a cake meant for a pet should be edible for human beings, but a cake meant for human beings shouldn’t be fed to pets.” That is because while flour and ingredients like eggs are good to go on a cake for your furry ball, the same cannot be said about a combination of eggs, salt and butter.

A lot of pet lovers leave no stone unturned to get their pet a cake packed with everything that are their favourite. That is why Chaitali Pednekar, baker at The Willow Bake Shop makes sure she picks only ingredients like blueberry, coconut flour, carrot, coconut oil, yogurt and so on. “Coconut oil is good for their skin and fur so it is good to include. And with one of my partners Sujit Seshadri being a vet, I know I can never go wrong with the ingredients,” smiles Chaitali.

Others like Cafe De Loco at Kondapur who don’t just bakes cakes for pets but have a separate menu and cake menu for your puppers are definitely rocking it for a pet party. Cake, pupcakes (cup cakes for pups) birthday parties for dogs, they do it all. “Since our cafe is pet-friendly there is a lot more pet activity and we are all very happy about it. Our pet cake journey started with Ruchira, my wife, reading, and experimenting with ingredients to bake cakes for our pets. Now we have 50 varieties meant for pets and if human beings want they can take a bite too. We stay away from using packaged pet food, sweets and colours that could be toxic. What is meant for us humans, need not be good for our pets. Even the peanut butter that we use in our cakes is homemade; we avoids the use of salt and sugar. We only do ‘baked’ cakes and avoid raw cakes. Feeding raw food is not very healthy for pets,” says Hemant Sakarwal.

Pet bakers do have a word of caution about feeding them cakes. All of them stress on how much is too much and that love shouldn’t reflect in quantity of cake served. “Unless the cakes are meant to be shared with other dogs I recommend smaller cakes for my clients. I started baking in my studio as an experiment. We have a lot of restrictions for our dog as it is epileptic. I am a baker by profession and teach baking but that doesn’t mean I should go all out with butter and sugar for pets. These cakes need a lot of care when it comes to ingredients. It is also important to know about allergies. I bake cakes only on order and only if it picked up from the studio,” says Arundati Rao of Escapades Culinary Studio.",life & style,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/ypc85k/article30869504.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/escapades,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/pup-cakes-for-me-please/article30869510.ece
460,2020/02/20,The ‘cute’ rodent,"The Five-striped or Northern Palm Squirrel is our friendly-neighbourhood creature we tend to take for granted

The February of 2013 was an eye-opener for me. I was still trying to make it as a credible birdwatcher and was given an opportunity by a female Shikra to observe its theatrics with a bunch of squirrels, for a month. The terror that it used to instil in the squirrels was fascinating. However scared though, these rodents are bold and inquisitive, and I would often see them invading the Shikra’s private space just to get a sniff, while the vigilant Shikra preened.

The Five-striped Palm Squirrel (Funambulus pennantii), as the name suggests, has five pale longitudinal stripes set against a dark brown saddle patch on its back. The three middle ones are longer than the two lateral ones, and the central stripe extends to the tail. The head to body length is about 130-150 mm and the tail is the same length as that of the body or slightly longer and is quite bushy. This number of stripes on the back of the animal separates them from a few other squirrels found in other parts of the country.

This species is found from the foothills of the Himalayas to northern Karnataka, and from Pakistan in the West to Bangladesh in the East. The Northern Palm Squirrel has also been introduced on the Andaman Islands and in some parts of Iran, Israel, and Western Australia.

The species is commonly seen across all city habitats, from orchards and plantations to built up areas. They are active diurnally, and their activity peaks in the morning and late afternoon-evening periods as they need to feed before retiring for the day. These squirrels are omnivorous, where they relish a menu full of ‘dishes’ like bark, buds, young shoots, fruits, seeds, insects, eggs of insects and birds; they relish tree sap. They sometimes do resort to scavenging, feeding on the remains of termites, beetles, moths and wasps.

Being friendly creatures, most city folk look upon them benevolently, as harmless creatures, but they can be pests. They may cause severe damage to fruit orchards especially mango, guava and other seasonal fruits. Because they are sociable, people try and hold out their palms for them to feed off. One does need to be careful as squirrels are rodents and may carry the same diseases.

Although these animals look quite cute and clean, they certainly do not display the same behaviour when it comes to building nests. They build their conspicuous spherical shaped nests on tree limbs and in hollows, and also in holes and niches in walls and buildings, inside air-conditioning units and wherever else they may find space. Their nest are untidy, made up of grass, twigs, leaves, paper, cloth, hair and anything soft that they might be able to get their hands on. Sadly, I’ve also seen them add plastic glasses to their nests. These nests bring them comfort during the breeding season and they use them throughout the year for sleeping as well.

I live in one of the most concretised parts of the city and there are several trees I’ve seen them nest on: eucalyptus, mulberry and more. The squirrel is likely to be territorial, but this is only restricted to the vicinity of their nests and trees that they use as shelter.

Now that it’s spring, we see them in abundance — they’re less visible in winter, unless they’re basking in the sun or foraging for food. A lot of their time goes into shielding itself from predators like the Shikra, owls, crows and sometimes black kites.

When I started off as an amateur birdwatcher, the shrill, bird-like calls of the squirrel used to throw me off. Although I do not mistake one for another now, it is still fun to play along with kids before someone can give me the answer I am looking for!
