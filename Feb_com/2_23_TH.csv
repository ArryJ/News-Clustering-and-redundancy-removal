0,2020/02/23,"‘Ten years on, still a long way to go for fire safety’","The responsibility to ensure safety lies not just with government authorities, says Uday Vijayan of Beyond Carlton

Ten years ago, on this day, horrific images of thick black smoke billowing out of a building on HAL Airport Road, as desperate people jumped to death in a bid to escape the suffocation, stunned the city. Prior to that the last big fire tragedy Bengaluru had witnessed was at the Venus Circus in 1981.

The Carlton Towers fire of February 23, 2010 haunts survivors and families of the nine people who lost their lives. Every time a fire accident is reported in the country, they relive the horror. But what came out of the tragedy was the birth of probably the only citizen-led fire safety advocacy group in the country, Beyond Carlton, which, over the years, has become the go-to body for fire-related issues such as compliance.

Uday Vijayan, who lost his 23-year-old son in the tragedy, is the managing trustee of the fire advocacy group. “We set two objectives that haven’t changed in 10 years, one of which is making authorities more accountable. Carlton was a failure of the system: there was no inspection, fire emergency vehicles could not reach, maintenance of the building ... everything that had to go wrong went wrong. Second is coordination between different agencies — Fire and Emergency Services Department, traffic police, the building association, etc.,” he said.

Have things changed since the accident? Mr. Vijayan said certain things have. “Our PIL petition resulted in the Fire and Emergency Services Department conducting inspection every two years. The managing committees of high-rise apartments are a lot more accountable now. In the first two months, what we learnt was that most of us don’t know much about fire safety and there was huge apathy. No one wants to believe that we can die in an accident or fire,” he said.

But awareness and the culture of safety still has a long way to go. For instance, Beyond Carlton recently highlighted that only two hospitals in the city have a burns ward.

Rooftop establishments

After another major accident — the Kamala Mills fire in Mumbai in 2017, Beyond Carlton raised the issue of fire risks in rooftop establishments in the city. This was followed by a crackdown by the Fire and Emergency Services Department and the police on establishments flouting fire safety rules. “Local bodies such as I Change Indiranagar were active and so we got involved with them,” he said.

Going forward

Going forward, Beyond Carlton wants to see that nobody dies in a fire accident. But, it is a long journey, admitted Mr. Vijayan. “It is not a realistic goal to set it for the next five or 10 years. A fire accident could happen anywhere. In Bengaluru, for example, we hadn’t anticipated the city’s growth, and we are grossly under capacity to handle fire safety. When you can provide water and electricity to a new layout, why not a fire station, like a park? The government has land,” he said.

But the group also maintains that the responsibility lies not just with government authorities.

“There is very little time to escape a fire. In a high-rise building, for example, the internal system has to work. There is a larger chance of single ownership properties following the rules. The problem is with multi-tenanted and commercial establishments; Carlton was a similar case. There are more people involved in decision making, and fire safety is a continuous and expensive process,” he said.

Through its ‘I am a fire champ’ series, Beyond Carlton has been learning about positive steps being taken by individuals and communities. Among them is Yashve, a 9-year-old from Chennai. “We have conducted fire drills in school. We also have a fire extinguisher in the house and my mom has taught me how to use it,” she said.

Fire safety committee yet to take off

Coordination among different agencies has been a sore point in fire safety, but a committee that was promised to look into it is yet to take off. Members of Beyond Carlton have pointed out that all stakeholders — BBMP, Bescom, CREDAI, along with the fire advocacy group, were to be part of the fire safety committee. “A Government Order was also issued in 2018, but it is sadly yet to work out,” said members of Beyond Carlton.

Beyond Carlton had released a five-year fire safety blueprint for Bengaluru in consultation with the Karnataka Fire and Emergency Services Department in 2018, which has a five-year roadmap from 2018 to 2022. Among its key recommendations are introducing a retrofit policy for older buildings, linking property tax payment and fire no-objection certificates, introducing a public-private partnership policy for private agencies to partner for new fire stations and monitoring, making burns wards compulsory in well-equipped hospitals, and developing protocols for inter-agency coordination. The plan also pushes for adoption of technology in a big way, including a tech upgrade that enables fire truck screens to see building plans.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/7gwlby/article30892556.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22BGRITZCARLTON,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/ten-years-on-still-a-long-way-to-go-for-fire-safety/article30892557.ece
1,2020/02/23,"In Bengaluru, officials seize ephedrine worth ₹5-crore concealed in wedding invitations","This is the second such drug bust this week

Customs Department officials at Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) unearthed another drug smuggling racket on Friday and recovered over 5 kg of ephedrine, this time concealed in wedding invitations that were to be shipped to Australia. This comes just a few days after officials detected a 5 kg of the drug concealed in bobbins of embroidery lace. That consignment, too, was slated to be couriered to Australia.

Officials were on alert after the first bust. While inspecting the wedding invitations, they realised that the cards were heavier than usual. A preliminary scan revealed polythene packets hidden inside the cardboard layers of the packaging. Each bag was filled with a powdery substance.

Officials recovered 86 polythene pouches filled with ephedrine. A further verification found that the consignment has been booked by the same Madurai-based exporter who had sent the bobbins of lace. The total quantity of ephedrine seized on Friday is estimated to be ₹5 crore in the international market. The authorities are now on the lookout for the exporters whom they suspect are part of an international drug racket. “If you consider both hauls, then the value is estimated to be about ₹10 crore. We are also verifying with the courier agencies and the company that printed the wedding cards,” said a police officer.

Ephedrine is a primarily medication used to prevent low blood pressure during spinal anaesthesia but can be abused as a stimulant and an appetite suppressant. According to officials, it is a controlled substance covered under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/e0grl9/article30892481.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22BGDRUGS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/customs-officials-seize-5-kg-of-ephedrine-concealed-in-wedding-invitations/article30892483.ece
2,2020/02/23,Citizens submit plea to Deputy Chief Minister against elevated corridor,"A delegation of citizens’ groups met Deputy Chief Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan and petitioned him to permanently shelve the controversial elevated corridor project, which a group of BJP MLAs have been lobbying to be included in the upcoming State Budget.

“We reminded him that citizens across 70 civic groups had gathered in thousands to oppose the project less than a year ago and how the BJP, which was in the Opposition then, had vociferously opposed it as well,” said Srinivas Alavilli of Citizens for Bengaluru.

The petition submitted to Dr. Narayan said that world over cities were dismantling flyovers in the core city and were instead focussing on mass public transit systems. They argued for bus priority lanes and suburban trains.

While Dr. Narayan was positive on bus priority lanes and said the government was committed to introducing them on 12 high- density corridors, he was non-committal about the elevated corridors, said the activists who met him. “He said that he saw the elevated corridor as one of multiple priorities, including various ring roads and other projects, that are vying for allocation in the Budget. He said the government, facing a fund crunch, would look at public-private partnership as a viable alternative model,” Mr. Alavilli said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/citizens-submit-plea-to-deputy-chief-minister-against-elevated-corridor/article30892468.ece
3,2020/02/23,Kannada gotilla? Residents’ associations here to help,"Some of them are organising spoken Kannada classes

The city, with its thriving and expanding migrant population, is becoming a cultural melting pot, and many newcomers are keen to embrace Kannada. Residents, too, want migrants to learn the language. With this in mind, several groups and residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) have taken up the task of teaching basic spoken Kannada to those who are not familiar with it.

Residents’ Welfare Association Bangalore East (REWABE), for instance, has been holding classes regularly, and is hoping to start another round of tutorials next month. Roy Thomas, one of the organisers, said that such a necessity arose around Cooke Town as the area is predominantly filled with non-Kannada speaking residents. “As it is close to Cantonment, it has always had that cosmopolitan touch. Many who were born and raised here don’t speak Kannada,” he said.

RWABE had conducted classes in 2019. “Since many expressed their desire to join, we thought that classes during the weekends would be more beneficial. We previously had classes on weekdays. This will be our third batch,” he said.

Veena Damodaran, one of the instructors, said they taught basic conversation skills. “We give them home work and instruct them to speak in Kannada in public. Once they do it, they come up with doubts for the next class,” she said.

Similar spoken Kannada classes were being conducted by various teams in and around Whitefield and Varthur areas, but are not formally structured. “There is a huge migrant population in and around the area who cannot speak Kannada. Hence, instead of blaming that they do not know or speak Kannada, we decided to teach them,” said Jagadish Reddy of Varthur Rising.

Volunteers teach working professionals who live primarily in gated communities. “Such efforts should be held in a sustained way across the city. We often witness fights and people venting their frustration owing to the language barrier. Instead of complaining, we should work towards bringing about a positive change,” he said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/jnv84l/article30892442.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22bgKannadSpeakingcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/kannada-gotilla-residents-associations-here-to-help/article30892443.ece

Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa will preside over the event and inaugurate the festival. Film producer Boney Kapoor and singer Sonu Nigam will also be among the guests at the event, which will be held at Sri Kanteerava Indoor Stadium.

Both the opening and closing films of this edition revolve around film-making. The festival will open with the Iranian film Cinema Donkey (Cinema Khar), written and directed by Shahed Ahmadlou, which is about the making of a film with a donkey. Golden Voices, an Israeli film directed by Evgeny Ruman that tells the tale of two Russian film dubbing artistes who migrate to Israel after the fall of the Soviet Union, will be the closing film.

The festival will screen 225 films from 60 countries, mainly at Orion Mall, Rajajinagar, from February 27 to March 4. Select films will also be screened at Navrang theatre at Rajajinagar, Suchitra Film Society at Banashankari, and Karnataka Chalanachitra Kalavidara Sangha, Chamarajpet. Films from Germany, the Philippines, and Australia, and those that portray traditional Indian music will be the focus of the festival.

The 1996 to 2002 batches of DAV Matriculation, Gopalapuram had a reunion on February 16 at the Alumni Club - Anna University on Boat Club Road, R.A. Puram. This alumni meet was initiated by founder-principal Vasantha Krishnaswami.

For the alumni as well as the mentors, this day will be indelibly marked in their memory, as many of them shared anecdotes from their days at the school, dwelling on the ethos of DAV Gopalapuram, especially its emphasis on spiritual development through the weekly 'havan', a unique feature of DAV Gopalapuram.

The teachers expressed their pride over having played a role in the development of young individuals who have turned out to be high-flying professionals and service-minded members of society.

The alumni donated a token amount towards the development of the school, as an expression of their gratitude for it.

To quote a student, ""The best way to show gratitude to our roots is to bear strong seeds and serve as roots for much stronger trees.

7,2020/02/23,Rally against child abuse held in Chennai,"Holding placards, children and elders walked for a few hundred metres as part of the rally

A rally against child abuse was held at Besant Nagar beach in Chennai on Sunday morning.

Holding placards carrying messages against child abuse, children and elders gathered near the police booth on the beach road around 6.30 a.m. They walked for a few hundred metres as part of the rally.

H. Jayalakshmi, Deputy Commissioner of Police, special wing for crimes against women and children, was the chief guest at the event.

She said that the police had zero tolerance towards crimes against children. “All angles of abuse and neglect are looked into. We employ the best practices from around the world in ensuring children-related crimes are handled with due care and diligence. Our All Women Police Stations have child counsellors and all police officers working there are trained consistently on handling sensitive crimes,” she said.

Social activist and politician Apsara Reddy, who organised the event, said that society needed to look at child abuse as a human rights issue.

Stating that it could happen in any home and there was no real profile of a perpetrator, she added that boys too were subjected to sexual abuse.

8,2020/02/23,Craniofacial clinic opened for children at Kanchi Kamakoti CHILDS Trust Hospital,"Craniofacial disorders involve the head and face of the children, and they are affected with severe breathing difficulty, speech and vision problems.

To provide comprehensive care for children with craniofacial disorders, doctors of the Kanchi Kamakoti CHILDS Trust Hospital have started a Craniofacial Clinic.

Craniofacial disorders involve the head and face of the children, and they are affected with severe breathing difficulty, speech and vision problems.

“We have been performing surgeries for craniofacial disorders since 1991. This cannot be done by doctors of a single speciality. The children will need correction of the head, nose, teeth and eyes. Now, Doctors of various specialities including neurosurgery, dentistry, ENT, ophthalmology and anaesthesia have come together. We will see children individually throughout the week and later, plan the treatment,” S. Ramesh, head of department, Anaesthesiology, told reporters on Saturday.

B. Chidambaram, neurosurgeon, said earlier, they received 10 to 12 children with craniofacial disorders a year. “We see 50 to 60 children with the disorder per year. There are no definite reasons for the disorder but in some cases, it is genetic. The first thing is to restore normal brain growth and then normal facial growth. The face of these children will be small, so the air passages will be small and they would not be able to breathe properly,” he said.

Dr. Ramesh said how early the surgical correction is done is important. “Three months to nine months is the ideal time for surgery. One of our youngest patients was two-and-a-half-month old,” he said.

While a neurosurgeon corrects the skull deformity first to allow normal brain and skull development, midface advancement by internal or external distractors are done by a maxillofacial surgeon. Ophthalmic problems such as protrusion of eyeballs, squint and poor vision may also arise, while there could be problems of poorly developed upper jaw requiring intervention by specialists.

Doctors emphasised that the surgery for craniofacial disorders was not cosmetic but is reconstructive and needed to restore normalcy of brain and body growth.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/craniofacial-clinic-opened-for-children-at-kanchi-kamakoti-childs-trust-hospital/article30892411.ece

Three murders were reported in the city in the last 24 hours.

On Friday evening, a 60-year-old man was murdered by a four-member gang at the Kasimedu wharf. According to police, the victim, Kuppan alias Sori Kuppan, of Indira Nagar, Kasimedu, was murdered by Aadu Ramesh, Sampath, Rakesh and Santosh. The police nabbed Aadu Ramesh, the main accused, and during interrogation he said the victim made derogatory comments about his wife, so he plotted the murder.

Dhanraj, 30 , an auto driver, was hacked to death by a gang in Krishnadas Nagar, Otteri. He was standing near his mother-in-law’s house when an eight-member gang riding on bikes surrounded and attacked him.

Neighbours rushed Dhanraj to the Government Stanley Hospital where he succumbed. Police suspect he was killed due to a dispute over selling liquor in the area.

At New Colony in Koyambedu, a 40-year-old man was found dead near the Cooum river with stab injuries. Police investigation revealed that the victim was Dhanasekar from Madurai.

Kuppai Thiruvizha, a series of events to promote zero-waste initiatives, scheduled for February 22, was cancelled.

11,2020/02/23,Illegal bungalow on ECR razed following High Court order,"Owner chose to demolish the structure on his own

A 16,218 sq. ft. bungalow, constructed so close to the Bay of Bengal that large boulders had to be placed around it to prevent the waves from hitting it, was demolished by its owner on Saturday in compliance with a directive issued by the Madras High Court on January 21.

The bungalow, used as a guest house by Rajsriya Automotive Industries Private Limited, at Olive Island in Muttukadu Taluk on East Coast Road, was razed to the ground using bulldozers since it fell in the intertidal no-development zone classified as Coastal Regulatory Zone III.

On Friday, the counsel for the automotive company made a mention before a Division Bench of Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and R. Hemalatha and said it had decided to demolish the building on its own without the involvement of the government authorities as directed by the court.

However, Special Government Pleader E. Manoharan insisted that any demolition must take place in the presence of the officials from Chengalpattu District Coastal Zone Management Authority.

The court was also told that the DCZMA had conducted a meeting on Thursday regarding implementation of the court order and issued a notice to P.S. Govindachari, the managing director of the private company, informing him about the decision taken to demolish the building on February 25.

Accepting his submission, the judges told the counsel that it was up to the petitioner to approach the officials concerned and obtain permission for self-demolition. They made it clear that the court’s intention was only to see that illegal structures do not remain. The senior judge in the Bench pointed out that no illegal building on the ECR, from Neelankarai to Mahabalipuram, would be able to escape the axe after the SC judgment that led to demolition of high-rises at Maradu in Kerala.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/t2cms7/article30892324.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22FEBTHDEMOLITION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/illegal-bungalow-on-ecr-razed-following-high-court-order/article30892326.ece
12,2020/02/23,Shelved Marina-ECR link could be answer to High Court query,"Elevated road along the coast till Kottivakkam was envisaged over a decade ago

The Madras High Court has asked the Chennai Corporation to study the possibility of constructing a new road connecting Light House on the Marina with Besant Nagar to reduce congestion.

Such a facility was envisaged over a decade ago and the elevated road was to run along the coast till Kottivakkam, via Besant Nagar. The idea was to take the strain off Santhome High Road, Greenways Road, Sardar Patel Road and Lattice Bridge Road.

“Rush hour is bad on these roads. If you take Greenways Road, it is lined with the homes of judges and ministers. Then Santhome High Road has six schools and is just a two-lane facility with no space for expansion. Traffic snarls on these roads are a common sight and during peak hour, it could well take vehicles between 25-30 minutes to cross from Light House to Thiru Vi Ka Bridge across the Adyar river,” explained V. Rajkumar, who works out of Karpagam Gardens and travels to Rajiv Gandhi Salai and Tiruvottiyur on a regular basis. A former official of the Highways Department said that the older proposal went up to the stage of fixing of alignment and submission of the detailed project report but had to be dropped due to opposition from several quarters.

“We had ensured that there was no disturbance to anyone, not even the fishing communities The AIADMK even made it an election issue in 2011 but dropped it after it came to power,” he recalled.

Taking off from this was the circular corridor running along the Adyar river from Malar Hospital to Miot, Mount Poonamallee Road, Porur Bypass, Ennore, Basin Bridge, Wall Tax Road and then back to Kamarajar Salai. However, even that remains frozen in time.

The road suggested by the court would perhaps run to a distance of 6-7 km, which would mean a cost of ₹1,200 crore and around 2 years to construct. “However, CRZ clearance would be required. If the government wills, this can be done. In Mumbai the Bandra- Worli link is on the sea, in Kolkata the Metro has gone under the Hoogli and there is a huge bridge across the mighty Brahmaputra. This road would really help reduce congestion,” said a retired traffic planner.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/oxw8oa/article30886384.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Pattinampakkam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/shelved-marina-ecr-link-could-be-answer-to-high-court-query/article30892297.ece
13,2020/02/23,Jitender provides the silver lining,"Punia and Aware clinch bronze medals

Jitender Kumar was the silver lining for India on the final day of competition at the senior Asian wrestling championships amidst below-par display from some of the big names on Sunday.

India managed to add a lone silver and just two more bronze to its tally. The performances itself, however, left a lot to be desired from all the five Indians in action.

The only Indian to reach the final, Jitender failed to find a way past reigning champion Daniyar Kaisanov of Kazakhstan, losing 1-3 in the 74kg but salvaging some pride after World championships silver medallist Deepak Punia (86kg) and World and Asian championships bronze medallist Rahul Aware (61kg) disappointed.

Edging past

Having won his qualifying round easily, Jitender managed to edge past Iranian Mostafa Mohabbali Hosseinkhani on criteria after being tied 2-2 on points in the quarterfinal before winning the semifinal against Sumiyabazar Zandanbud of Mongolia 2-1, all three points coming through passivity penalties for the opponent.

It was, however, a disappointing outing for Punia who appeared completely off-colour in both his morning bouts, losing 1-4 to Shutaro Yamada of Japan in the semifinals.

Punia, already qualified for the Olympics, hardly seemed to put in any effort before eventually winning a consolation bronze against Issa Abdulsalam Abdulwahhab Al Obaidi of Iraq 10-0 in under three minutes.

Aware, though, would be ruing the decision to challenge the referee’s decision at a crucial juncture in his semifinal bout against Ulukbek Zholdoshbekov of Kyrgyzstan.

Trailing 0-2 with his opponent under caution for passivity, Aware sought points for what he thought was a scoring exposure move with 45 seconds left on the clock.

He lost the challenge to concede a 3-point lead and even though he scored a take-down immediately after to narrow the margin, it was enough to make him lose focus and go down 3-5 and miss out on a spot in the final and settle for a bronze, winning 5-2 against Iran’s Majid Almas Dastan.

In the 125kg, Satender Malik failed to impress, going down 1-12 in the repechage round to crash out of the competition.

Satender had replaced original qualifier Sumit Malik in the draw after the latter tore his MCL before the event but appeared out of depth on the mat.

Somveer was outclassed 10-0 by Ajiniyaz Saparniyazov in the 92kg quarterfinal.

The medallists:

61kg: 1. Ulukbek Zholdoshbekov (Kgz), 2. Muhamad Ikramov (Tjk), 3. Rahul Aware, Ryuto Sakaki (Jpn).

15,2020/02/23,Not too affected: Coggins,"Hong Kong based triathlete weighs in coronavirus and people’s protest

The people’s protest and the coronavirus outbreak has disrupted normal life in Hong Kong. But triathlete Oscar Coggins says he’s not been “too affected” due to his schedule.

He’d been training in Phuket (Thailand) when the first cases of the virus were reported in Hong Kong. “I had planned to go there to prepare for this event,” he says after winning the men’s silver in the Triathlon Asian Cup here on Sunday.

“But I extended the trip because it makes sense to stay away from Hong Kong for a while. It was kind of good timing in a way. I was quite lucky,” he adds.

So, is travel as a Hong Kong athlete too inconvenient in the time of coronavirus?

Western look

“A lot of places don’t let you in with a Hong Kong passport. I would say I have an advantage since I look very western. My parents are both from England. But when I do anything to do with travel, or anything official, then that’s when the questions come.

“So, when you show the Hong Kong passport, they ask, like, where you’ve been, if you’ve visited China, and all that. The way I look definitely helps, though. I would say some of the treatment of people who look Chinese has been quite unjustified.”

The 20-year-old says “there’s a huge amount of paranoia” in Hong Kong especially since it was “heavily hit by SARS less than two decades ago”. He recalls he was a three-year-old when his family stayed out of Hong Kong for six months then.

Serious problem

He says the shutting down of training facilities has now been a “serious problem” for a lot of Hong Kong-based athletes. “Like, it’s still very busy, but everything is closed. Everything government-run, like the schools, parks, public swimming pools and running tracks, are all closed. The (Hong Kong) Sports Institute (HKSI) is still open, but there are a lot of precautions now.

“So, every athlete who’s training there has to undergo a daily temperature check. If you come back from China, you have to undergo a two-week quarantine. It’s extremely challenging. If I was training in Hong Kong, it would be extremely disruptive for me. For instance, I used to train in a public swimming pool. Overall, it’s not great, but there are ways around it.”

Precautions

He said the least of all precautions that any athlete in the virus-affected regions would take is to avoid crowded places. “And that’s very difficult to do in Hong Kong because it’s so dense.”

He adds: “I’ve been very careful with my travelling especially because I’m trying to qualify for the Olympics. Getting sick normally can be a big problem. And (getting infected) with coronavirus, it’s like zero chance for the Olympics. Like, possibly, months in the hospital, and although the death rate is not as high for healthy people, it’s still a big risk to take.”

He reckons the civil unrest has died down a bit. “It’s a bit of a depressing situation. I know it’s the right decision to avoid Hong Kong right now. But it’s not an easy decision.”",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/i4b1gm/article30895882.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH24COGG,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/not-too-affected-coggins/article30895883.ece

India’s Jitender Kumar settled for the silver medal after losing to Kazakhstan’s defending champion Daniyar Kaisanov in the 74kg final of the Asian Wrestling Championships here on Sunday.

The Indian, who had sealed his place in the team for the Olympic Qualifiers by reaching the final, lost 1-3 to Kaisanov in the summit clash at the KD Jadhav Indoor Stadium.

After winning his qualification bout rather easily, Jitender just about managed to win his following bouts against Iran’s Mostafa Mohabbali Hosseinkhani (2-2) and Mongolia’s Sumiyabazar Zandanbud (2-1).

However, his performance was enough to convince the national federation that he should travel to Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan for the Olympic Qualifiers without a re-trial.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/jitender-kumar-settles-for-silver-in-asian-wrestling-championships/article30895775.ece
17,2020/02/23,"Stojanovic, Barbara emerge champions","Adarsh and Sarojini Devi bag the National titles

Ognjen Stojanovic (Serbia) and Barbara Riveros (Chile) emerged the men’s and women’s champions of the Chennai NTT ASTC Triathlon Asian Cup here on Sunday.

The initial swimming in the outside area of the INS Adyar Naval establishment was skipped due to rough sea conditions and a 5 km road running was had instead.

“Taking the safety aspect into consideration, we decided to skip swimming,” said Sri Lankan Sam Wikramasinghe, the technical delegate of the event.

Stajanovic made a sedate start, came third in the opening run, was second after cycling, and finished first after the second running phase.

He said he was “disappointed” the event could not have the swimming, but was happy with the final outcome.

Barbara was sixth after the initial running, jumped to the second spot after cycling, to finally finish first.

“I’m happy I could come to India. Like the people and the culture, but yes, triathlon without swimming was unexpected,” she said.

Adarsh Muralidharan Nair (Services Sports Control Board) and Sarojini Devi Thoudam (Manipur) won the men’s and women’s titles in the senior National championship.

The results: Asian Cup: Men: 1. Ognjen Stojanovic (Ser) 01.48.47s; 2. Oscar Coggins (Hkg) 01.49.03; 3. Jan Celustka (Cze) 01.49.24.

18,2020/02/23,A smile can go a long way,"Though the only species endowed with this graceful expression, humans do not comprehend its myriad strengths and often forget to use it

As I turned to the main road, my smartphone rang. I looked at the car’s dashboard display for a fraction of a second to see the caller name while I reflexively whirled the wheel around the street corner. The brief lapse in concentration was enough to miss a biker. Fortunately, both of us stopped at the right time but he ranted expletives at my family, particularly the women. Undeterred, I opened the window, smiled at him and said, “I am sorry.” He immediately paused, and then just advised me kindly to look on all sides of the road while driving.

That is the power of the unique and wonderful act called smile. It can break barriers and bridge chasms. The power of the smile is often underestimated by us. Despite being the only species with this graceful expression, humans do not comprehend the myriad strengths of smile and often forget to use it. Of course, a few primates like chimps can smile, but it is more a politicians’ grin rather than a spontaneous smile.

Just like the innumerable gifts of nature which we have taken for granted, I had missed the countless influence of smile in my early years. The awakening occurred in my early twenties when I worked as a junior doctor in a hospital. I joined recently then and when we, a group of doctors, were having coffee together, one of the senior doctors told me, “You seemed to have missed an important developmental milestone.”

Developmental milestone refers to various social, motor and vocal skills which a child acquires at each period of its development in infancy and childhood such as rolling over, standing and speaking. To my despair, he declared, “You haven’t got your social smile yet.” While I considered myself a pleasant person, his harsh comment rather irked me.

At three to four months of age, a growing child starts recognising familiar faces and in an attempt to interact with them, it expresses the social smile. It is typically towards the parents, grandparents and siblings initially, and then slowly extends towards other familiar faces. It is nature’s evolutionary attempt to increase the bonding between humans. It is a way of expression to pronounce one’s affability. But somewhere during our growth and interaction with society, we have been taught directly or indirectly that strangers are not to be smiled at. After long days of introspection, I made it a point to reclaim my lost milestone.

Smiling is contagious. If we smile at a person, he would smile back. In Western countries, it is part of their culture to smile even at strangers on the road whenever there is eye contact. They may feel offended if a smile is not reciprocated. But in our culture, we are afraid to smile. The shopkeeper refrains from smiling for the fear of requests for discounts. The employer is afraid to smile fearing that he may not get the job done by the employee. The worker shows a grim face at his boss fearing he will be burdened with more work. Likewise, the teacher is afraid to smile at the students, the driver forgets to smile at the passengers and the doctor remains morose when examining patients.

Smiling has a deep impact on our brain and our external persona. It increases the endorphin hormone secretion in our body which gives a sense of well-being in the brain. It makes us feel younger and energetic. It enhances positive vibes in the work zone. We are enthralled at the sight of a child’s social smile and every time the infant smiles, our happiness multiplies. But why should the smile be just a child’s domain? As we matured into adults, we have made up our minds not to smile at others. Imagine a situation where the doctor greets you with a smile when you are sick. When did we last receive the maid into our home with a smile? Won’t it be soothing to see the security personnel or a lift operator smile at us at the end of a hard day? An act of smile does not cost a penny or a calorie. For, smile is the shortest distance between two people. Keep smiling!

19,2020/02/23,No mall rats back then,"Large shopping establishments were unknown in the past, and people had no money to splurge

Though I live close to a mall, I rarely go there. One of the rare visits was to pick up a gift for a baby’s naming ceremony. After much deliberation, I selected a moderately priced toy and was awaiting my turn at the counter, when a smartly turned-out child skipped gaily across me to where the toffees and chocolates were on display, and in one swift smooth action, picked up and handed over one of the pricier ones to her mother, to be added to the shopping bag.

Seeing the nonchalance with which the entire transaction was done, my mind went back several decades to when we were children living in Bombay. Malls were unknown then, the only place that came close to being called one being Akbarrallys near Flora Fountain, which was way beyond the reach of a lowly paid government servant that my father was. As children, we satisfied ourselves with small pleasures such as visits to the sea face, where we would brave the jagged rocks to get to the water’s edge to sample its brackish taste.

Air conditioning was a rarity then, and I still recall tentatively pushing open the door of an “air-conditioned” Chandu Halwa outlet that had come up near our house and gingerly stepping in, pretending to be “customers”. We had no money on us — children didn’t get pocket money those days, at least not in our house; hence, after ogling at the mouth-watering sweets on display in glass cases, we trooped out, feeling satiated at having experienced the cool air inside the shop.

Even when our parents took us on those rare outings such as to watch Ben Hur or Guns of Navarone, eating out or buying biscuits or chocolates from a shop were pleasures far beyond our reach.

Imagine our joy, therefore, when returning home one evening after a social visit, my father veered off the pavement with us in tow into a shop which had a neon sign announcing itself as J.B. Mangharam and Sons. Alas, our expectation that father was going to buy us a packet of those crisp and creamy wafer biscuits that this brand was famous for, was a short-lived one. In one of his lighter moods, he asked the man at the counter if he had inspected the neon sign in front of the shop lately. Upon seeing the quizzical look on his face, my father told him that part of the lighting had gone on the blink and the shop now proudly announced itself as J.B. haram and Sons. With that, he guffawed loudly and walked out of the shop with us reluctantly bringing up the rear, our longing for creamy wafer biscuits still unfulfilled.

20,2020/02/23,Enough of the princesses,"Despite parents’ attempts to make play time more gender neutral, princesses have an indomitable presence in homes

“Enough of the princesses,” I admonish my little ones, gesticulating with one hand and flicking off the television with the other.

As I go about tut-tutting, picking the various princesses in plastic off the floor, and shutting them tight behind the closet, I lament how Disney continues to exploit the “princess fetish” among little girls world over. In a house of two daughters, needless to say, our home is brimming with tiaras of all sizes, dolls in all shades of pink, make-up sets, kitchen sets, glittery shoes and what not. Our collection of princesses hair bands and hair pins remains constant, because of years of losing and buying them. Alas! Even the cutlery is painted with the demure faces of princesses.

Despite my attempts at making their playtime more gender neutral, I must admit, the princesses have an indomitable presence in the house. Even the more “boyish” pursuits, such as football, bicycle, car and badminton sets, bear a stamp of “frozen princesses”. At this point in time, it looks like a Ph.D. in Disney princesses would’ve been a far more appropriate title for my thesis.

I am mostly trying to strike a balance between indulging my little ones with princesses and giving them a lecture on feminism. Princesses don’t do a real job, they don’t rescue themselves, they don’t get a real education. “But mama, they ride horses into the sunset, throw down their lush golden hair from the top of a tower, create snow even in deserts!” How does one argue with that?

Hence, like a good millennial mother, I turn to Google for answers. The reliable old algorithm rakes up quite a few answers and perspectives. I deduce the following from it. This “princess culture” is a global endemic. However, it’s not all dark and gory. On the bright side, the princess tales always inadvertently have a young girl with a difficult life, who thinks for herself and tries to overcome the hardships that life throws at her. The majestic castles, the shining knight, the glorious white stallion, are all but embellishments to the story of the princess! Therefore, the trick lies in letting the children watch and read a range of books and movies, and infer important life lessons themselves. Much like the princesses, who navigate magical spells, evil witches in the garb of innocent women, thinly veiled household responsibilities in the form of domestic drudgery and so on quite by themselves. It even promotes role play and thus a better understanding of relationships, instils confidence, sparks creativity.

Feeling better about all the “pink” strewn over the house, I settle myself into watching my current favourite show on TV, The Crown, a drama which chronicles the life and times of Queen Elizabeth. Look at the irony of it all! The princess culture followed me right into my thirties! How does one justify that?

Maybe, there is something empowering about the journey the woman with The Crown has made — how from being just a pretty face with a sparkly tiara, she can metamorphose into a woman who plays a key diplomatic role in global affairs, about how she can charter an off-beaten path and reach out to the underprivileged, downtrodden women and children around the world with her wand, and how, if the curtsies and tiaras become burdensome, she will forgo them, for she will still remain the princess of her story.

21,2020/02/23,Gaming at the surgery,"Advait, 8, had a hole in his heart. During the summer holidays, his parents and doctor brought him to see a cardiac surgeon and was slotted to get a patch sewn on to his VSD — our fancy name for the hole.

Apart from a few painful pokes by the nurses, it was not a bad experience for him. Then one day, things seemed a bit different and his mother appeared distracted. He wasn’t given any food in the morning. When he started to get a little cranky from hunger, his dad let him have his cellphone.

I found him sitting cross-legged on the operating table, amid the beeping monitors and under a brilliant overhead light, poking on the phone screen without a care in the world. I said hello and admired his gaming skills before asking him if I could put the face mask with oxygen on him. He nodded, his demeanour being “Do what you got to do, just let me play my game.” In truth, it’s a volatile anaesthetic gas mixed as vapour with the oxygen. My smile may have reassured him, because he soon went back to his game.

He was sliding his fingers swiftly on the screen, notching up points, while I held the mask covering his nose and mouth, careful not to obscure his vision. He kept scoring well, judging by the stars flying around on the screen. Then as I scanned his vitals, I heard an alarm, with the word “Fail” flashing on the screen. That was Advait falling unconscious.

If all goes well, he will go home at the end of the week. We get annoyed at our children for playing with gadgets but on that day, this gizmo was on my side.

22,2020/02/23,Of women porters and shouting matches,"Journey by trains in India has a phenomenal ability to throw up surprises

I am 87 and widely travelled. Now in the past decade, my wife and I have been thinking of our earlier journeys and compare the conditions then and now.

In 1952, for instance, while travelling from Madras to Kandla as a student, I had to get down at Virangam, near Ahmedabad, to take a connecting train. When the train stopped at the station at night, two or three women porters (have you seen them in any other station?) barged into the coach and picked up my luggage and ran out, yelling in Gujarati. I panicked. My Gujarati co-passengers told me calmly that the porters would come back and take me to my luggage and seat. Within 10 minutes, it happened.

Two years later, my classmate and I were travelling from Pilani to Delhi, carrying some 15 steel trunks belonging to us and our friends, each weighing not less than 30 kg and packed with books and other goods. We stacked the trunks one upon the other up to the roof of the coach. But then the ticket examiner, a Punjabi, told us to shift the trunks to the brake van. When I shouted “Muttal” in Tamil, he shouted back in equally chaste Tamil. “I am not a muttal. I follow the rules. I had worked and stayed in Tamil Nadu for 17 years,” he said. I ran away leaving my friend to deal with this. Soon, I returned to apologise for my rude remark, and we became good friends.

In 1963, I went to the Tatanagar station to buy tickets to travel to Madras and beyond the next month. I went to the station late in the evening and stayed there the whole night. I was second in the queue in the evening. No one joined the line till the morning when I bought the ticket. Strange! Only then I realised that the date and day were considered inauspicious for travel towards south. Had I known this earlier, I would have gone to the counter only in the morning.

23,2020/02/23,Dr. Internet is in the wrong trade,"Enter the symptoms and lo, the diagnosis is made. How casual and at what cost?

It was a peaceful Saturday at the clinic, but my pleasant chain of thought was broken by a loud hello. A man in his late 30s introduced himself as a successful senior executive at the local office of a leading multinational information technology giant. His exposure to information science, he said, has made him aware of the need to invest time in his health. I commended his mature insight into life’s priorities, and asked him the reason for his visit.

“I think I need a biopsy,” he said. “Whatever for,” I asked taken aback.

“How else do you propose to diagnose my lymphoma?” The unexpected question knocked the wind out of my sails.

“Whoever told you that you have lymphoma?”

“The signs are all there.” He had entered his “symptoms” into an online app, which unequivocally made the “diagnosis”.

“Would you mind telling me what exactly are the symptoms and signs,” I asked with the greatest respect to the oracle of the modern world, the Internet.

Just aches and pains

“If you must know,” he said rolling his eyes, “it all started six weeks ago with generalised aches and pains; I have been waking up each morning as if I have been through the mill.”

“And then,” he said softly with the air of a writer narrating his story to a prospective film producer, “I noticed a progressively increasing painless lump in the right groin. To think that this happened after working out at the gym under a trainer for the past two months to stay healthy!”

“Since you want me to biopsy the lump for you, would you mind if I examined it,” I asked. “Be my guest,” he said.

I spent the next five minutes examining him. I found a small scar on his right lower belly from an appendicectomy. I couldn’t help but smile as I reassuringly declared that he was safe. The lump was an early groin hernia. “Easily sorted with a standard operation,” I said.

“What about my early morning fatigue, aches and pains,” he countered.

“That is your gym trainer giving you value for your money and your muscles protesting ... Your right groin already possibly weakened by the scar of your appendicectomy might have given up in protest,” I added triumphantly. Sherlock Holmes, I thought, could not have done better.

The furrows that appeared on his forehead and the knitted brow could make Rodin’s Thinker look like he was simply bored. “How can you be so sure,” he asked indignantly, upset by my dismissal of the oracle’s prophesy. My clinical diagnosis, I assured him, was the summation of elements I had picked up from his medical history and signs I had noted on examination, a skill afforded to me by years of training.

“With due respect to you doctor,” he said, “I would be happier if this could be proved through an objective test such as a scan rather than embark on surgery based on human perception alone.”

At this point, I decided it was time to call it quits and wrote him out a request for an MRI. Two days later, he returend a much happier man waving his report. “Doc, you were right! It is indeed a hernia,” he said expecting me to feel happy. I was glad, I said. The perception of the machine projected as images had convinced him that my real-world perception of his clinical situation was worthy of acceptance.

The evident lack of trust in clinical medicine is driving many clinicians to rely more on investigations and imaging than on their professional judgment, sounding the death knell for clinical medicine and driving care beyond the reach of most.

24,2020/02/23,"Peking duck, anyone?","Let the Chinese eat what they like. Leave it to the scientists to find out if their eating habits are causing periodic outbreaks of diseases

On a recent weekend, I, along with my wife and son, went to a popular multicuisine restaurant in Gurugram for an early dinner. As we sat down at a table, a little girl came running towards us, calling out yeye. Even without her calling me grandpa in Mandarin, I would have guessed that the little angel was from China as her sprightly gait was unmistakably that of the hundreds of little empresses I had seen during my stints in the Indian diplomatic missions in that country.

Her grandfather back home must be a retired teacher, I thought. I had seen hardly anyone other than some elderly academics and a few retired journalists in urban China who have not dyed their grey hair black.

As I turned to look for her parents, I saw a small group of young couples huddled together at a corner table.

The mother was waving at the daughter to return, possibly hesitant to walk towards us through the restaurant nearly full with weekend diners.

While the little girl was oblivious of the havoc COVID-19 has unleashed in her home country, her mother was clearly conscious of the sensitivities of the other diners and seemed unwilling to move away from the sanctuary the corner table seemed to provide the Chinese group. We waved at the young lady who gave us a half-smile that seemed to thank us for the gesture.

Authentic tastes

As we waited for our order, the elderly Caucasian couple at the table next to ours were served their meal. The Chinese chef came to their table, rousing my curiosity. I noticed a roast duck sitting on a platter, skilfully sliced, skin first followed by the meat in well-rehearsed, regimented movements unique to Chinese chefs.

The aroma of the dish that had wafted across by then reminded me of our visits to popular Peking duck restaurants near the Forbidden City in Beijing. I was pretty sure instantly that my gong bao chicken was going to be great. As we were leaving post-dinner, the girl’s father waved us goodbye. As I walked up to their table for courtesy’s sake, the quizzical look of the Caucasian couple seemed to ask me, “Are you sure?”

The group was from central China, not far from Wuhan. The girl’s parents were in India on a business-cum-pleasure trip with friends and had decided to extend the stay for a few more days for the sake of their only child.

The Year of the Pig that just ended witnessed a slowing down in their business, but the Year of the Rat has brought bad luck to their nation, the young man said in a choked voice. He said my unruly grey hair reminded him of his ailing father back home, and invited me to join them for a quick drink. I thought he would break into tears if I stayed longer. I wished them and the entire Chinese population good health and prosperity as I left.

I did steal a quick glance at the meal they were having. For, the best food for the Chinese anywhere in the world is Chinese food. The Chinese, like most Indians, are not adventurous as their Western counterparts are in trying out unfamiliar cuisines.

After the outbreak of COVID-19, friends have been sending me videos of Chinese wet markets, asking if it was true that they eat all the wild animals and birds figuring in the footage. Yes, several videos are genuine, but certainly not as scary as the Western commentators have made them out to be.

Friends in academic circles in mainland China have often told me that the Chinese do not go after “anything that walks, creeps, swims or flies” on purpose. In fact, as in India, they have one of the exquisite range of dishes that varies from region to region.

China was hit by several droughts and famines, some of which lasted years on end. Stricken with hunger, millions perished. Those who were lucky to survive went into the forests, foraging for wild berries, fruits, roots and leaves. And animals and birds that they knew were tasty. For those in the coastal regions, the sea provided sustenance.

When even that became scarce, they caught and ate whatever was available. It was not a question of taste or sensitivities, but a simple matter of survival.

When conditions improved, some of the people were already hooked on to several “exotic” animals, birds and other lifeforms normally not relished in other parts of the world. That too varied from region to region in a large country like China.

Spice challenge

It is generally a trying experience for a number of Chinese to savour spicy Indian cuisine. So is the case with most of the Indians on short visits to China. Trying out various exotic dishes even during official banquets has been a challenge to visitors and even many of those Indians working in China. We all go searching for Indian restaurants not only in China but in other parts of the world as well.

After all these years, I have come to realise that no food is good or bad. It is just a matter of getting used to the taste.

Let the Chinese eat what they like. Leave it to the scientists to find out whether their eating habits have led to the periodic outbreaks of diseases caused by viruses jumping from animals and birds onto humans.

Let us wish the billion-plus people of our neighbouring nation well. Even as we take precautions, let us not follow the West, but continue to respect the sensitivities of the visitors from China. After all, for us, athithi devo bhava is not just another proverb.

30,2020/02/23,Details of ingenious smuggling racket lie buried in FIR since 2018,"Gangsters turned gold into jelly, fused it in under wear, and used couriers: Crime Branch

The Mumbai Police Crime Branch’s investigation into the 2018 assault case against gangsters Tariq Parveen and Salim Maharaj has unearthed a well-organised and ingenious gold smuggling racket allegedly going on for several years.

Mr. Parveen and Mr. Maharaj, both aides of gangster Ejaz Lakdawala, were booked for assaulting a woman and her brother in their Pydhonie residence in 2018. Two hours after it was registered, the case was transferred to the MRA Marg police station without any proper explanation. The Crime Branch took over the case earlier this month and found no progress in the case in the past two years.

The modus operandi of the smuggling operation came to light when the Crime Branch was examining the FIR documents in which the woman who was assaulted has given specific details of the racket. However, the MRA Marg police did not probe the smuggling angle nor did it invoke the Customs Act in the case.

Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime) Santosh Rastogi confirmed to The Hindu that the Crime Branch, apart from the assault allegations against Mr. Parveen and Mr. Maharaj, is also investigating the smuggling racket. “Our inquiries into the smuggling operation are under way and appropriate action will be taken,” Mr. Rastogi said.

A Crime Branch officer said, “Inquiries conducted so far reveal that couriers were flown to Dubai by Mr. Parveen, who headed the racket. The gold that was to be smuggled to India was treated with some chemical which would turn it into a jelly form and fused with clothes, mostly undergarments, which would be worn by the couriers. The chemicals also help hide certain properties of gold, as long as it was in jelly form, making it possible to evade detection by baggage or body scanners,”

On landing in Mumbai, the couriers would meet the receivers and head to a pre-decided location, usually the nearest hotel or public rest room, and hand over the gold-fused undergarments to the receiver. These would then be taken to select gold jewellery manufacturing workshops in Zaveri Bazaar, where the gold would be separated and turned back into solid form. Sources said that in her statement, the woman has admitted that she was assaulted by Mr. Parveen and Mr. Maharaj because the weight of the gold extracted in India did not match that picked up from Dubai.

“The racket was active till the time Mr. Parveen was arrested. The woman alone claims to have made several trips for him. Obviously, multiple couriers were used as the same person cannot make too many trips within a short span of time without attracting undue attention,” the officer said.

Sources said while Mr. Parveen would handle the operations part of the racket, Mr. Maharaj, who had contacts in the police as he was also an informer, would handle any trouble with the authorities.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/qnuvj5/article30892403.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23BMTARIQPARVEEN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/details-of-ingenious-smuggling-racket-lie-buried-in-fir-since-2018/article30892404.ece
31,2020/02/23,BJP leader detained for firing revolver in public,"It is more or less like a toy gun: police

A former Peasants and Workers Party leader, who is currently with Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), was briefly detained by the Crime Branch on Saturday after a video of him firing a revolver in the air during an event went viral.

The incident occurred during a cricket match at Vihingar village in Panvel on Friday night, when Pandharinath Phadke entered the ground in his BMW. As he got out of the car and walked to the other end of ground, a special Marathi song was played for his welcome and his men showered currency on him, while the vehicle followed them. During this time, Mr. Phadke is seen firing a revolver in the air three times.

After the video went viral, the Khandeshwar police was alerted about the incident, following which the Central Unit of the Crime Branch detained Mr. Phadke for enquiry. “The revolver he possessed is called a starter revolver. He has a receipt of purchase from Mumbai in 2006 and a certificate issued by arms and ammunition department of the Mumbai Police, permitting him to keep the revolver. It is more or less like a toy gun, which only makes sound and smoke. We have seized it and will be verifying his claims and also the certificate he has produced, and later take a call on returning the same. As of now no case has been registered,” senior police inspector Nivrutti Kolhatkar said.

32,2020/02/23,Decomposed bodies of four of family found at Taloja apartment,"Owner of flat got suspicious after he did not receive two months’ rent

The decomposed bodies of four members of a family were found in their rented apartment at Taloja phase I on Saturday morning. The deceased were identified as Nitesh Upadhyay (35), his wife Babli (30), their eight-year-old daughter and seven-year-old son.

The flat owner, Rajesh Bharadwaj, reached Shiv Corner building in Sector 9 around 10.30 a.m. and approached the secretary and chairman of the society. He told them that Mr. Upadhyay had not paid the rent for two months and was unreachable.

“He found this suspicious and wanted to visit the flat. The secretary, the watchman and I entered the flat using Mr. Bharadwaj’s duplicate key and found a broken mobile and a removed sim card. There was dust everywhere, as if the house had not been cleaned in a long time. When we entered the bedroom, we saw a body and immediately closed the door and called the police,” Asif Khan, the chairman, said.

The police reached and found three more bodies in the house. “The bodies were decomposed,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (Zone II) Ashok Dudhe said. “There was no foul smell outside the flat or in the hall. The foul smell came out only after we opened the bedroom door,” Mr. Khan said.

Two suicide notes

The identity cards of the victims were found burnt in the kitchen and the police also found two suicide notes. One said the family was committing suicide and anyone who finds the bodies should conduct their last rites as per Hindu rituals. It also said some cash and gold ornaments were kept in the room and that they had no relatives. The other note said that no one must be held responsible for their actions.

The owner said he last spoke to Upadhyay in December end and after January 8, there has been no response on WhatsApp either. His display picture read: “Death: Any last wish? Me: You are late.”

“Prima facie, it looks like Upadhyay first killed his wife and children, and then committed suicide. We are yet to understand the reason behind the act. We have been able to contact his relative in Delhi and once they come here, we can get some idea about the reason,” Mr. Dudhe said.

Moved from Delhi

The Upadhyays had moved into the society in September 2019 and were in Delhi before that.

“We were told that he was into online trading. The family was once present in a pooja in the society but were not present for Republic Day celebrations. The neighbours are all working and busy in daily lives hence all thought that the family had gone to Delhi and were not seen outside,” Mr. Khan said.

Upadhyay would generally transfer the rent to the owner by the fifth or sixth of every month, and since it was not received, Mr. Bharadwaj became suspicious. After enquiring with the children’s school, the police learnt that they were seen last on January 2.

34,2020/02/23,Unveiling the writer Antulay one never knew of,"At book release function in Mumbai Thackeray, Pawar recall friendship with the former chief minister

A compilation of letters by former Maharashtra chief minister Abdul Rehman Antulay to his wife was released on Saturday in the presence of Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and Nationalist Congress Party leader Sharad Pawar.

The book, released by Mr. Pawar at Anjuman-I-Islam school in south Mumbai — Antulay’s alma mater — has been published by the late politician’s daughter Neelam, who said she was touched by how beautifully her father could express himself on paper. She claimed the letters were art which revived a feeling of nostalgia.

The book, which is in Hindi, transliterates the letters written by Antulay to then fiancee Nargis in the late 1950s and early 1960s, while he was finishing his education in London. The book is titled ‘Banaam Nargis Baqalam AR Antulay’ (In the name of Nargis from the pen of AR Antulay).

“People only knew him as a politician and saw the ups and down in his career. This book will reveal his inner self and the kind of loving person that he was. When my mother handed me his letters, I was touched by how beautifully he could express his thoughts on paper. Each letter in the book is an emotion in itself and show the evolution of a man who rose to become a successful politician from a very humble beginning,” Ms. Antulay said.

Lyricist Javed Akhtar, who has penned the back cover, said, “We don’t have a habit of preserving things, but the letters preserved by Nargis is a proof that how a politician can also be a lover. Today, technology has eased everything, but it cannot ease romance. The letters prove that though there was a lot of physical distance between Antulay and Nargis, that distance was filled with love.”

Mr. Pawar recalled his relationship with Antulay, and how it was his friendship with the late Balasaheb Thackeray, which resulted in Shiv Sena supporting the Indian National Congress after the Emergency.

“Antulay and I worked together and as representatives of opposite parties, we attacked each other multiple times in Parliament. But I remember that after every session, both of us sat together and discussed politics. As co-workers, I only knew what kind of a politician he was but this book has shown us another aspect of his personality.”

The Law College of the Anjuman-I-Islam institute was also renamed as Barrister AR Antulay College of Law. Mr Thackeray, too, spoke about Antulay’s friendship with his father.

“Mr. Antulay would have been very happy to know that his friend’s son is now the Chief Minister. It was he who renamed the Kolaba district to Raigad and now I have the honour of renaming a college after him. It is a great idea that the college of law, named after Mr. Antulay, will give equal admission to students from all religions. We need communal harmony and it is great to have an institute with students from all the religions studying in it. A stone which is used for pelting can be used for building a school instead,” Mr. Thackeray said.

“The letters show his feelings for Nargis and in the way she has preserved the letters, show that their love was strong from both the sides,” he added.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/uie3nm/article30892087.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23BM--BOOKLAUNCH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/unveiling-the-writer-antulay-one-never-knew-of/article30892088.ece
35,2020/02/23,CR rolls out QR-based app to improve cleanliness on trains,"SPARK has been provided to staff on nearly 42 trains

In a bid to improve cleanliness and services on-board trains, the Central Railway (CR) has rolled out a mobile app to monitor the work of the on-board housekeeping staff (OBHS) on a real-time basis. The app, called SPARK, has been provided to staff on nearly 42 trains of CR’s Mumbai division.

The app is linked to a QR code-based complaint redressal system, which allows a passenger to register a complaint online with details such as train number and coach number. Once submitted, the complaint is sent to the OBHS supervisor on the app and an SMS, and is monitored by the control centre. “All complaints need to be addressed within 30 minutes or it is escalated to a railway officer. We have received around 90 complaints over the last two months through this system,” a CR official said.

Unique feedback

Instead of collecting feedback through a paper form, passengers will be now be given a tablet, on which they will need to provide their feedback. “Each feedback will be unique as it will be linked to a PNR number and can be submitted only on getting an OTP code. This will ensure that the feedback is not being tampered with,” an official said. The official added that the old system gave room for fudging of feedback, on the basis of which contractors for OBHS are appraised.

The OBHS supervisors will also need to send updates of the cleanliness schedules through the app and upload photos clicked by the app. “Earlier they used to send images, which was difficult to verify where or when they had been clicked. Now after each round of cleaning, they are expected to upload an image which is clicked from the app, which will have a time stamp and the location of the picture,” a senior railway official said

“We aim to serve our passengers better through the use of this new system. We should have the system in all trains of Mumbai Division within a month,” Shivaji Sutar, chief public relations officer, CR, said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/cr-rolls-out-qr-based-app-to-improve-cleanliness-on-trains/article30892085.ece
36,2020/02/23,New technology to reduce trauma in eye surgeries,"Foundation installs 3D digital microscope to conduct free cataract, retina surgeries

The Aditya Jyot Foundation For Twinkling Little Eyes has installed a three-dimensional digital microscope that will ensure more precise and trauma-free eye surgeries.

Using the new technology, ZEISS ARTEVO 800, the Aditya Jyot Hospital in Wadala will conduct 5,000 free cataract and retina surgeries for patients from low-income groups from Monday.

The ZEISS ARTEVO 800 will eliminate binoculars, which are commonly used in ophthalmology. According to Dr S. Natarajan, managing trustee of the foundation, the adoption of this technology will be extremely beneficial for patients. “There are two cameras attached to the microscope, which produce a digital image. They record the same action while a surgeon is performing a surgery, with a little time difference. The digital image is then conveyed to a screen, looking at which the surgeon will operate,” said Dr. Natarajan. Eyes are the most sensitive organ and any surgery is an insult to the tissue, but with this technology, the inflammation will be reduced, he said.

“There are different layers of the eye and a microscope magnifies the areas of the eye but the digital microscope not only provides a magnified image but also depth perception. High-quality surgery helps in identifying different tissue layers in microns, which leads to lesser damage to tissues and faster recovery,” Dr. Natarajan said.

Madhur Bajaj, trustee of the Bajaj Foundation that has funded the installation and will also finance the 5,000 surgeries, said he is happy to contribute to the cutting-edge technology. “This installation is the transition to the state-of-the-art microscopic 3D surgery in India,” said Mr. Bajaj.

Dr. Natarajan said they are planning to train young doctors on simulators to use the new technology.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/3yxq16/article30892062.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23bm-ZEISS-ARTEVO-800,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/new-technology-to-reduce-trauma-in-eye-surgeries/article30892063.ece
37,2020/02/23,Doctors successfully treat brain aneurysm using a robot,"In the first-of-its-kind experimental procedure, the researchers have used a robotic system specifically adapted for neurovascular procedures

In a first, doctors have used a robot to perform a surgery to treat brain aneurysm in a 64-year-old female patient, an advance that may lead to improved use of robotic technology in cardiology and neurology.

In the first-of-its-kind experimental procedure, described at the American Stroke Association’s International Stroke Conference 2020, held in the U.S., the researchers used a robotic system specifically adapted for neurovascular procedures.

The surgeons, including those from the Toronto Western Hospital in Canada, used software and hardware adaptations which enabled them to accommodate guidewires and other devices used for procedures involving blood vessels in the brain.

They said the modifications also provided the operator additional precise control of the robotic parts compared to previous system models.

“This experience is the first step towards achieving our vision of remote neurovascular procedures,” said lead researcher Vitor Mendes Pereira, a neurosurgeon from the Toronto Western Hospital.

“The ability to robotically perform intracranial aneurysm treatment is a major step forward in neuro-endovascular intervention,” Mendes Pereira said.

In the first case, a 64-year-old female patient presented with an unruptured, bulging, weakened area in the wall of an artery, or an aneurysm, at the base of her skull, the researchers said in a statement.

They said all steps of the surgery were performed with the robotic arm.

The study noted that the scientists have also successfully performed five additional aneurysm treatments using the robot.

“The expectation is that future robotic systems will be able to be controlled remotely. For example, I could be at my hospital and deliver therapy to a patient hundreds or even thousands of kilometres away,” Mendes Pereira said.

“The ability to deliver rapid care through remote robotics for time-critical procedures such as stroke could have a huge impact on improving patient outcomes and allow us to deliver cutting-edge care to patients everywhere, regardless of geography,” Mendes Pereira added.",technology,https://www.thehindu.com/news/xxib92/article25087841.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-brain-science,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/doctors-successfully-treat-brain-aneurysm-using-a-robot/article30895287.ece
38,2020/02/23,"Beyond immediate news frenzy, no sustained efforts to address fire accidents","Online fire safety rating system will push building owners to comply with laws

The year 2019 continued to see a string of accidental fires in public places across India — a coaching centre in Surat, a hotel in Delhi, the Aero India show in Bengaluru, to name a few. There were also fires in illegal factories in Delhi. Over a hundred people died in just eight publicised accidents.

However, beyond the immediate news frenzy after such tragedies, there have been no sustained efforts to address this significant life-threatening challenge.

It has been well documented that the primary reason for fire accidents in India is the violation of fire safety laws by building owners or managers — locking exit doors, constructing restaurants on rooftops, having inflammable material in the building … the list is long. We have reasonably strict fire safety laws in various States and good building codes, especially after the introduction of the National Building Code of India. However, owing to poor oversight and lack of awareness among the public, many have continued to flout the laws.

Violators probably believe that the cost of compliance is much higher than any personal loss from a fire, be it monetary or legal. I’ve listed some ideas to address this issue of compliance.

Ratings for public spaces

Today, most citizens check online ratings before they go to a restaurant or a hotel. We should get online platforms such as Swiggy, Zomato, Oyo, MakeMyTrip, BookMyShow (for theatres), and Practo (for clinics/hospitals) to add a fire safety rating tag to the property on their platform. This could be a combination of a self-administered audit periodically updated by the property as well as user ratings. Failure to comply with fire safety will become expensive, because the property will lose customers if their ratings are poor.

The Fire Department should publish fire safety inspection reports of buildings with a simple rating system of green, orange, and red. Citizens should be able to go online and check the rating of a building. In Karnataka, the Fire Department is tasked with not only giving a fire no-objection certificate after the construction of a building, but also inspecting buildings every two years, based on the public interest litigation (PIL) petition filed by Beyond Carlton. These inspection reports are not easily accessible. With this simple rating system available online, there will be pressure on building owners to comply with the laws.

The Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act has increased the fines on traffic violations dramatically. While the statistics are still not out on its impact on road safety, I do believe that a similar approach should be taken against those who flout safety rules. There should be a monetary fine imposed on the building owners and associations on any reported violation. This, however, may need a change in the State Acts and may take longer to be implemented.

I believe that some of the ideas, if implemented, will ensure that the cost of compliance is much lower than the consequences of violations and should result in a reduction in fire accidents.

42,2020/02/23,A case of exploding mangoes and nerve gas that ‘brought down’ Zia’s plane,"Former President’s son points to ‘suspicious’ role of ex-Pak. General, ex-NSA, while also blaming Indian and Israeli intelligence agencies

In an exclusive interview with a foreign publication, former President and Army Chief General Zia-ul-Haq’s son Muhammad Ijaz-ul-Haq says the role of former Army Chief General Mirza Aslam Beg and former National Security Advisor General Mahmood Ali Durrani “draws suspicion” while “based on the evidence that he has collected Indian and Israeli spy agencies were also involved” in the his father’s plane crash in August 1988.

According to Mr. Haq’s interview, “the plane came down due to spraying of nerve gas in the cockpit that maimed pilots. He also confirmed the presence of explosives in the mango crates, besides claiming that a projectile had also hit the plane.”

Talking to The Hindu, Mr. Haq says he believes that Generals Beg and Durrani were somehow involved is because “some of the doctors who were working in CMH Multan informed us [Gen. Zia’s family] probably a month or two months after the incident that they received orders from higher-up not to do the autopsy of the body parts that were found after the crash. Later on some of them told us that they were transferred from Multan to farflung places, which was obviously done to to cover it up. When the autopsies were done on Brigadier General Herbert M. Wassom, who was the US military attache, then why not the Pakistanis? I asked Gen. Beg directly and indirectly but he never responded. The orders to transfer the doctors to farflung places didn’t come from their immediate bosses; only the GHQ could have done it.”

Mr. Haq says that Air Commodore Zaheer Zaidi carried out an investigation and those hundred pages of his personal inquiry are with him. He also talks about an air force officer Akram Awan “who was arrested by our intelligence agency for espionage and he was kept in safe custody of the agency of Pakistan without any access to the outside world. When he recorded his statement under oath to an Additional Session Judge [Magistrate] under section 164 of the Pakistan Criminal Procedure Code, it must have been authentic. He was being investigated for helping Israelis bomb Kahuta. He was being investigated by one brigadier, one major and one colonel. When they handed the report to the GHQ, it wasn’t released at the orders of Gen. Beg who said this could lead to uncertainty. Gen. Beg kept the original report with him and never released it. These three officers were then transferred out of the agency.”

Mr. Haq says that he has gathered all this information through different sources — some directly and some indirectly.

”These are the things that lead to suspicion. According to the joint US-Pak investigation said that it was a criminal act of sabotage. The US tried to cover it up but in the end, as their own nationals were killed in the crash, they had to give a conclusion. Also there is late Justice Shafi-ur-Rehman Commission report, which said that there was negligence on part of the government and the army both. The report recommended that there should be a criminal investigation into the plane crash incident. Unfortunately, Justice Shafi-ur-Rehman Commission Report was never released by the government.”

This is not the first time Mr. Ijazul Haq has said this. Mr. Haq wrote two articles, ‘A criminal conspiracy’ and ‘Punish the Bahawalpur conspirators’ published in Daily Times and The News on September 8 and 9, 2009.

Defence analyst General (retd) Amjad Shoaib says that Ijaz-ul-Haq has always blamed former Army Chief Gen. Mirza Aslam Beg and former National Security Advisor Gen. Mahmood Ali Durrani for his father’s plane crash but he doesn’t think they had any role in Gen. Zia’s plane crash.

“I think it was their decisions around that time, which led to this suspicion. Gen. Durrani, with permission from Gen. Zia, decided not to travel to the tank trial while Gen. Beg, instead of traveling with Gen. Zia, preferred to fly back in a separate plane after Gen. Zia's plane had taken off. It was also reported that Gen. Beg did see Gen. Zia's plane crashing but instead of supervising the evacuation of casualties, he decided to rush back to Rawalpindi. Even at that time Gen. Beg's action was criticised by many senior officers in the Army. In my opinion there is no reason to doubt Gen. Beg's action. It is said that Gen. Beg saw the burning plane and very rightly assumed the that the chances of having any survivors were almost negligible. Since a number of senior army officers who were accompanying the former Army Chief Gen. Zia, were assumed to be dead, he had decided to rush back to the capital to take charge of the affairs to prevent creation of chaos by the interested elements in the civil and military hierarchy. On his return to GHQ, Gen. Beg assumed the control and the next morning addressed the officers in GHQ and apprised them of the situation emerging as a result of the unfortunate air crash.”

Gen. Shoaib says that unfortunately no conclusive investigation was ever held to establish the causes of the air crash. “Consequently, of and on, we keep hearing various conspiracy theories. One of the stories which is widely believed, implicates a retired Air Marshal who was alleged having links with some Israeli elements assumed to be responsible for the planning and execution of this dastardly act. I have come across many officers within our intelligence set up who tend to believe this story.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/jbjnn3/article30897074.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc--Zia-ul-Haq,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ijaz-ul-haqs-explosive-allegations/article30897075.ece

South Korea went on high alert after the number of infections surged over 600 with six deaths. Italy saw a rise to 132 cases and imposed curbs in parts of the country to try to stop the spread. Iran has reported 43 cases, with eight deaths.

In China, authorities reported 648 new infections — higher than a day earlier — but only 18 were outside of Hubei province, the lowest number outside the epicentre since authorities began publishing data a month ago and locked down large parts of the country.

President Xi Jinping said that while measures to deal with the virus had been effective, the battle to contain it was still at a crucial stage. State run television urged people to avoid complacency, drawing attention to people gathering in public areas and tourist spots without wearing masks.

The virus has killed 2,442 people in China, which has reported 76,936 cases, and has slammed the brakes on the world’s second largest economy. It has spread to some 26 other countries and territories, with a death toll of around two dozen, according to a Reuters tally.

Most vulnerable

It has been fatal in 2% of reported cases, with the elderly and ill the most vulnerable, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), which said on Saturday it was worried by the detection of infections without a clear link to China.

South Korea’s President said the government had raised the disease alert to the highest level, allowing authorities to send extra resources to Daegu city and Cheongdo county, which were designated “special care zones” on Friday.

Health officials reported 169 new infections, bringing the total to 602, having doubled from Friday to Saturday.

More than half the new cases are linked to a church in the southeastern city of Daegu after a 61-year-old woman known as “Patient 31”, who attended services there tested positive for the virus last week. The woman had no recent record of overseas travel.

In Italy, schools and universities were closed and some soccer matches postponed in the affected northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto, the country’s industrial heartland.

Iran reported a total of 43 infections, with eight deaths — all since Tuesday.

45,2020/02/23,"In show of might, Sanders wins Nevada","His latest triumph, after Iowa & New Hampshire victories, makes it difficult for rivals to slow his march

Senator Bernie Sanders claimed a major victory in the Nevada caucuses on Saturday that demonstrated his broad appeal in the first racially diverse State in the presidential primary race and established him as the clear front-runner for the Democratic nomination.

In a significant show of force, Mr. Sanders, a liberal from Vermont, had a large lead over his nearest rivals in early tallies, and The Associated Press named him the winner on Saturday evening.

His triumph in Nevada, after strong performances in Iowa and New Hampshire, will propel him into next Saturday’s primary in South Carolina, and the Super Tuesday contests immediately thereafter, with a burst of momentum that may make it difficult for the still-fractured moderate wing of the party to slow his march.

Mr. Sanders, speaking to jubilant supporters in San Antonio, trumpeted what early results suggested would be a landslide victory.

“We have just put together a multigenerational, multiracial coalition, which is not only going to win in Nevada it’s going to sweep the country,” he said, predicting another victory in Texas next month.

While Mr. Sanders boasted that “no campaign has a grassroots movement like we do,” and was bathed in “Bernie, Bernie!” chants, he otherwise ignored his Democratic opponents.

Mr. Sanders’ success, and the continued uncertainty over who is his strongest would-be rival, makes it less clear than ever how centrist forces in the party can organise themselves for a potentially monthslong nomination fight. The moderate wing is still grappling with an unusually crowded field for this late in the race, the lack of an obvious single alternative to Mr. Sanders and no sign that any of those vying for that role will soon drop out to hasten a coalescence.

As results were being counted Saturday night, former Vice-President Joe Biden, former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, billionaire investor Tom Steyer and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota were all competing for what would clearly be a distant second-place finish.

With the full order of finish still in doubt, Mr. Buttigieg used his caucus-night speech to deliver a stern warning about the implications of nominating Mr. Sanders, urging Democrats not to “rush” into anointing him as their candidate.

“Sen. Sanders believes in an inflexible, ideological revolution that leaves out most Democrats, not to mention most Americans,” Buttigieg said, adding that Sanders wanted to “reorder the economy in ways most Democrats, not to mention most Americans, don’t support.”

Mr. Biden appeared at a Las Vegas union hall while most votes were still uncounted to claim a comeback and vowed victory in South Carolina. “Y’all did it for me,” he told supporters, trying out a new line aimed at his rivals. “I ain’t a socialist, I ain’t a plutocrat, I’m a Democrat.”

Mr. Biden’s campaign asserted that he would finish in second place here, a claim challenged by Mr. Buttigieg’s aides.

Time is running out

The apparent scale of Mr. Sanders’ victory margin presented an immediate challenge to the rest of the candidates, many of whom have been counting on a drawn-out nomination fight to give them time to catch up. But time is plainly running short, and few of Mr. Sanders’ rivals have a clear path to closing his advantage. Among them, only Mr. Biden has a realistic chance of winning South Carolina next week, the sole remaining contest before Super Tuesday on March 3.

46,2020/02/23,"Donald Trump, seventh U.S. President to visit India","When Air Force One touches down Ahmedabad, he will become the fourth consecutive American president to visit India.

Donald Trump will be the seventh US president ever to travel to India and the first one to land in Ahmedabad, where he will be joined by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for an unprecedented roadshow and a historic joint address before a record crowd of more than one lakh people.

Mr. Trump on Sunday left for his maiden visit to India for talks with the top Indian leadership during which the two countries are expected to significantly ramp up bilateral relations, especially in the defence and strategic ties.

When Air Force One touches down Ahmedabad on Monday, he will become the fourth consecutive American president to visit India, reflecting on the new phase of bonhomie in the 21st century between the two largest democracies of the world.

Also read: Namaste Trump: POTUS visit to India

And he is only second White House occupant to travel to India in their first term. Barack Obama was the first U.S. president to do so in 2010.

Mr. Obama visited India twice in 2010 and 2015.

Dwight D Eisenhower was the first US President to visit India in 1959. Richard Nixon travelled to India in 1969 and Jimmy Carter in 1978. Bill Clinton visited India in 2000 and George W Bush in 2006.

President Eisenhower’s historic visit to India from December 9 to 15 launched the bilateral relationship at an important period just over a decade after India’s own independence.

Through meetings with Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, the two sides affirmed the desire to foster a strong bilateral relationship and cooperate on shared values, including world peace, The Asia Group said.

“On this trip I have been talking a lot about America’s deep desire for peace. [ ] As far as the longing and aspirations of peoples are involved, we know we are one. [ ] The people to people is what will save the world, Eisenhower then said. Eisenhower addressed both houses of Parliament and delivered an address at the US Embassy in New Delhi. He received an Honorary Doctor of Law from the University of Delhi, participated in the inauguration of the World Agricultural Fair, and attended a civic reception hosted by the City of New Delhi.

Tensions over US tacit support for Pakistan and close ties with Pakistani General Yahya Khan loomed over President Richard Nixon’s short visit to India from July 31 to August 1, 1969.

While President Nixon sought to build trust, the lack of personal chemistry with the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi dampened progress. These tensions would only deepen as India and Pakistan progressed toward conflict, which escalated into the Bangladesh War of Independence in 1971, The Asia Group said in a report released ahead of the visit.

In New Delhi for less than one day, Nixon met with Indira Gandhi at the Rashtrapati Bhavan. No official statements or speeches were published from the visit.

President Carter visited India from January 1 to 3, 1978, soon after Janata Party leader Morarji Desai succeeded Indira Gandhi as the prime minister.

During his visit, Carter sought to ease tensions between the US and India, which had escalated during the 1971 Bangladesh War of Independence and India’s 1974 nuclear weapons tests.

However, Carter’s attempt to urge India to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty blunted significant progress, The Asia Group, a strategy and capital advisory group based in Washington DC, said.

Carter met Prime Minister Desai and addressed both houses of Parliament. He visited a village in Haryana, which soon after adopted the name Carterpuri. The two sides released a memorandum of conversation between the leaders, as well as President Carter’s remarks before the Indian Parliament.

Following a period of intense diplomatic engagement with India and Pakistan to deescalate the 1999 Kargil War, Bill Clinton visited India from March 19 to 25, 2000.

“His watershed visit saw the two sides advance a higher level of ambition and outline new areas of bilateral cooperation across economic and strategic pillars. The diplomatic breakthrough also coincided with the rise of the Indian American diaspora in the United States, which strengthened the growing people-to-people ties between the two countries, The Asia Group said.

Travelling with his wife Hillary and daughter Chelsea, the Clintons visited New Delhi, Agra, Jaipur, Hyderabad, and Mumbai.

Clinton and Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee issued an expansive joint statement, in which both sides pledged to enhance cooperation. Clinton also addressed both houses of Parliament and committed to strengthening ties as strategic partners.

During his visit from March 1 to 3, 2006, President George Bush’s visit charted new opportunities for substantive bilateral cooperation.

“Notably, the two countries finalised the framework the US-India Civil Nuclear Agreement, which affirmed the US acceptance of India as a nuclear power. Progress during the visit also reflected growing bipartisan support for the relationship and view that supporting India’s rise was in the US interest — particularly amid China’s growing regional influence, The Asia Group said.

Bush gave remarks on the US-India relationship at Purana Qila in New Delhi.

Mr. Obama’s first visit to India from November 6 to 9, 2010 elevated the country as a strategic partner and critical focus in the foreign policy pivot to Asia.

“The two sides made progress across the strategic and trade pillars of the relationship. Notably, President Obama backed India’s bid to join the United Nations Security Council, The Asia Group said.

The two sides also agreed to $14.9 billion worth of trade deals and relaxed select trade restrictions and Mr. Obama addressed a joint session of the Parliament.

Mr. Obama created history when he visited India for the second time in 2015 — the first by a sitting US president — from January 24 to 27.

“The visit solidified the strong relationship between the two leaders and enabled them to chart historic progress on defence, clean energy, and climate change, The Asia Group said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/hokcnn/article30896647.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TRUMP1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/donald-trump-seventh-us-president-to-visit-india/article30896648.ece
47,2020/02/23,Italy races to contain COVID-19 outbreak as cases rise over 100,"The government passed stringent emergency measures on Saturday after the first two deaths from the disease were recorded in Lombardy and Veneto

Italy scrambled on Sunday to contain the biggest outbreak of COVID-19 in Europe, shutting off the worst affected towns and cancelling a string of public events as the number of those infected jumped above 100.

The government passed stringent emergency measures late on Saturday after the first two deaths from the disease were recorded in the wealthy northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto.

The number of certified cases of the illness in Lombardy rose to 89 from 54 a day earlier, while in Veneto some 24 people had come down with the virus, including two people in Venice, which is packed with tourists for the annual Carnival.

Explained | When can people transmit the novel coronavirus?

Health officials reported isolated cases in the neighbouring regions of Piedmont and Emilia Romagna, saying the total number of known infections in Italy was 132.

Almost a dozen towns in Lombardy and Veneto with a combined population of some 50,000 have effectively been placed under quarantine, with locals urged to stay home and special permission needed to enter or leave the designated areas.

Universities were shuttered across much of northern Italy until early March and four top flight Serie A soccer matches set for Sunday were postponed.

Lombardy and Veneto represent Italy's industrial heartland and jointly account for 30% of gross domestic output, so any prolonged disruption there is likely to have a serious impact on the whole economy, which is already flirting with recession.

Lombardy, which is home to Italy's financial capital Milan, ordered all schools in the region to close, and said all public gatherings should be cancelled, including religious services. Museums and public libraries will also be shut.

Fashion designer Giorgio Armani has said his fashion show scheduled to take place in Milan on Sunday would go ahead in an empty theatre without any press or buyers present.

‘Patient zero’

Health authorities are struggling to work out how the outbreak started. The first cases were announced only on Friday and doctors do not know the source of the illness.

Initial suspicion in Lombardy fell on a businessman recently returned from China, the epicentre of the new virus, but he has tested negative. In Veneto, doctors tested a group of eight Chinese visitors who had been to the town that was home to the first fatality, but again, they all tested negative.

“We are [now] even more worried because if we cannot find ‘patient zero’ then it means the virus is even more ubiquitous than we thought,” said Veneto Regional Governor Luca Zaia.

Prior to Friday, Italy had reported just three cases of the virus – all of them people who had recently arrived from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the virus first emerged last year.

After the first confirmed cases, Italy suspended all direct flights to and from China, but did not keep tabs on those arriving from second countries.

Italy's far-right opposition League party has demanded that the government reintroduce border controls to try to prevent new arrivals, but Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has rejected this.

President Xi Jinping on Sunday said the COVID-19 epidemic is China’s “largest public health emergency” as the death toll from the deadly virus climbed to 2,442 and the number of infections hit almost 77,000 in the country.

President Xi, who attended a meeting here to double efforts in coordinating the prevention and control of the COVID-19 outbreak, said the epidemic “has the fastest transmission, widest range of infection and has been the most difficult to prevent and control“.

In comments reported by state broadcaster CCTV, Mr. Xi said, “This is a crisis for us and it is a big test.” He called the epidemic China’s “largest public health emergency“.

The meeting, in the form of tele-conference, was presided over by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang.

Mr. Xi acknowledged that the epidemic will “inevitably have a large impact on the economy and society”, but he said the effects will be “short-term” and controllable.

Chinese health officials in worst-hit COVID-19 hit Wuhan city ordered 14 days’ quarantine for all recovered patients following reports that some of them tested positive for the virus after recovery.

Ninety-seven more people died in China due to COVID-19, taking the death toll to 2,442, officials said on Sunday, as a team of WHO experts visited the worst-affected Wuhan city in Hubei province.

By the end of Saturday, 76,936 confirmed cases of novel COVID-19 infection had been reported in 31 provincial-level regions, China’s National Health Commission (NHC) said in its daily update on Sunday.

Ninety-six deaths were reported from Hubei province for which Wuhan is the provincial capital and one from Guangdong province on Saturday besides 648 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 infections, it said.

Hubei province, where the virus first emerged in December last, reported 630 new confirmed cases, taking the total confirmed cases in the hard-hit province to 64,084, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

Officials in Wuhan ordered that all patients who have recovered and discharged from hospitals be sent to designated places for two weeks of quarantine and medical observation.

So far 15,299 people who were cured of the virus have been discharged from the hospitals in Wuhan. But they were all asked to go for two-week quarantine after some of them tested positive after being discharged from hospitals, Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported.

Hubei province on Saturday reported 630 new confirmed cases of the virus infection and 96 new deaths on Saturday, the provincial health commission said Sunday.

49,2020/02/23,Berlin starts controversial rent freeze on 1.5 million homes,"In addition there is an overall housing shortage in Berlin.

Berlin is freezing the rents of 1.5 million apartments for the next five years starting this Sunday in a controversial move to control the exploding costs that have forced many to move outside Germany’s capital city.

Berlin is the first German city to influence the rental prices so directly and the law has been both celebrated as a step toward more fairness by its supporters and ripped apart as a socialist method by critics.

“It is correct that Berlin tries to stop the spiraling rent costs,” Ulrich Ropertz, the head of the German Tenants Association, told German news agency dpa. “The federal legislature has missed the opportunity to pass effective measures in recent years.”

Only a minority of Berliners own their homes or apartments — as in the rest of the country, the majority of people traditionally rent their homes.

The German capital had been a low-rent mecca after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 opened the gates to the economically depressed former communist east of the city.

That gave rise to an influx of artists and others seeking a more bohemian way of life. However, in recent years, rents have skyrocketed in the city of more than 3.7 million inhabitants, pushing middle class families from Berlin’s central residential neighborhoods like Mitte or Prenzlauer Berg to the outskirts. Even traditionally working class and immigrant neighborhoods like Neukoelln or Kreuzberg have become so gentrified that long-time tenants can no longer afford therisingrents.

In addition there is an overall housing shortage in Berlin, which makes it even more difficult for newcomers or those who get pushed out of their homes due to the rent spike to find new, affordable living accommodations.

The rent freeze is supposed to keep rents for apartments that were built before 2014 at the current level for the next five years. Critics have pointed out that the rent freeze will keep landlords from investing any money into much-needed renovations of homes, because they cannot raise the rent afterward.

Tenants, who think their rent isover-priced, have been encouraged by pro-tenant organizations to ask their landlords for a reduction in rent. However, the controversial law has been taken to court by its opponents and some experts have warned tenants to keep all the extra money that they may now be saving on the side, in case the rent freeze is eventually overturned in court.

The rent freeze, which was implemented by Berlin’s left-leaning coalition government, has been strongly criticized by Chancellor Angela Merkel’s more conservative Christian Democrats, who are in the opposition in Berlin’s city-state government.

In a statement Sunday, the Berlin faction of the Christian Democrats wrote that, “the law is not a solution for the continuing housing shortage ...The freeze does not help anybody if, in the end, saved rent has to possibly be paid back.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/rib2vo/article30895239.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BERLINAPARTMENTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/berlin-starts-controversial-rent-freeze-on-15-million-homes/article30895240.ece
50,2020/02/23,COVID-19 | Iran says ‘enemies’ used virus to sabotage vote as death toll rises,"The final results of the parliamentary election are due on Sunday

Iran confirmed eight deaths from the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) on Sunday, the highest toll of any country outside China, as the Supreme Leader accused foreign media of trying to use the outbreak to sabotage a general election.

The final results of the parliamentary election are due on Sunday, two days after it was held on the heels of the confirmation of COVID-19 cases in the country.

Explained | When can people transmit the novel coronavirus?

A low turnout had been widely forecast, as a conservative-dominated electoral watchdog disqualified about half the 16,000-odd candidates, mostly moderates and reformists.

Voter apathy marked the polls, but Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Sunday lauded the people’s “huge participation” despite what he termed “this negative propaganda”.

It “began a few months ago and grew larger approaching the election and in the past two days, under the pretext of this illness,” he said, according to a televised extract of his speech.

“Their media did not miss the slightest opportunity to discourage people from voting. [Our enemies] are even opposed to any election by the Iranian people,” the leader was quoted as saying on his official website.

The latest three deaths Iran reported on Sunday were among 15 new confirmed cases of the COVID-19 virus, bringing the overall number of infections to 43 and fatalities to eight — the highest death toll outside of China, the epicentre of the epidemic.

Four new infections surfaced in the capital Tehran, seven in the holy city of Qom, two in Gilan and one each in Markazi and Tonekabon, Health Ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said.

Authorities have ordered as a “preventive measure” the closure of schools, universities and other educational centres in 14 provinces across Iran from Sunday.

They include Tehran and Qom, where the first cases emerged, as well as Markazi, Gilan, Ardabil, Kermanshah, Qazvin, Zanjan, Mazandaran, Golestan, Hamedan, Alborz, Semnan and Kurdistan.

Art events, concerts and film shows have been banned for a week.

“We are on the frontlines, we need help,” the head of Qom’s medical sciences university, Mohammadreza Ghadir, said on state television. “If I can say one thing, it is help Qom.”

Iran’s neighbours have started to take precautions against the spread of the virus.

The Kuwait Port Authority on Sunday announced a ban on the entry of all ships from the Islamic republic.

Free treatment

Iran’s Health Minister Saeed Namaki said the treatment of COVID-19 cases would be free.

“In every city, one hospital will be dedicated to treating coronavirus cases,” he said, adding that this number would be greater in bigger cities like the capital.

Tehran’s city hall has ordered the closure of snack shops and water fountains in metro stations, officials said.

Tehran municipality spokesman Gholamreza Mohammadi said buses and underground trains were being disinfected.

Mohsen Hashemi, head of Tehran's municipal council, said, “If the number of infections increases in Tehran, the whole city will be quarantined.”

Posters were also being put up across the sprawling city on Sunday, asking people not to shake hands as part of a COVID-19 prevention campaign.

Iran's cyberpolice, meanwhile, warned that anyone putting “fake clips” online related to the virus would be punished.

The World Health Organization has expressed concern over the speed at which COVID-19 has spread in Iran, as well as it being exported from the Islamic republic to other countries, including Lebanon.

Iran has yet to confirm the origin of the outbreak, but one official had speculated that it was brought in by Chinese workers.

52,2020/02/23,Debris found in fuel tanks of 70% of inspected 737 Max jets,"On February 18 Boeing had said debris was found in several planes but it did not give a precise number

Debris has been found in the fuel tanks of 70% of grounded Boeing 737 Max jets that have been inspected by the company, Boeing confirmed on February 22.

Inspectors found the debris in 35 out of about 50 jets that were inspected. They are among 400 built in the past year that Boeing hasn’t been able to deliver to airline customers.

Boeing temporarily halted production last month because the planes were grounded after crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia that killed 346 people.

Also Read Boeing finds a new issue with Max, debris in fuel tanks

Although debris hasn’t been linked to those crashes, metal shavings, tools and other objects left in planes during assembly can raise the risk of electrical short-circuiting and fires.

On February 18 the company had said debris was found in several planes but it did not give a precise number.

The debris was discovered during maintenance on parked planes, and Boeing said it immediately made corrections in its production system to prevent a recurrence. Those steps include more inspections before fuel tanks are sealed.

“This is unacceptable and won’t be tolerated on any Boeing aircraft when it’s delivered to the customer,” the company said in a statement on February 22.

Boeing previously said the issue does not change the company’s belief that the Federal Aviation Administration will certify the plane to fly again this summer.

A Boeing spokesman cautioned against applying the 70% to all 400 jets, saying there’s no way to know how many have the same problem until they’re all inspected.

An FAA spokesman said the agency knows that Boeing is inspecting undelivered Max planes and said the agency has increased surveillance.

The number of planes with debris was reported on February 21 night by The Wall Street Journal.

Max jets were grounded around the world last March. Boeing is testing updated flight control software that will replace a system that has been implicated as a cause of the crashes.

The system activated before the crashes based on faulty signals from sensors outside the planes. It pushed the noses of the aircraft down, triggering spirals that pilots were unable to stop.

While investigators examining the Max accidents have not pointed to production problems at the assembly plant near Seattle, Boeing has faced concerns about debris left in other finished planes including the 787 Dreamliner, which is built in South Carolina.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/r17rbj/article27410599.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THNAKETHIOPIAN-AIRPLANECHINA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/debris-found-in-fuel-tanks-of-70-of-inspected-737-max-jets/article30894665.ece

Sri Lanka co-sponsored the resolution along with 11 other countries, including the U.S. and Britain, calling for an investigation into alleged human rights violations during the island nation’s civil war, which ended in 2009.

Mr. Gunawardena will make the announcement on Wednesday during his address at the 43rd Session of the Human Rights Council (HRC) in Geneva.

Ahead of the Session, Foreign Secretary Ravinatha Aryasinha briefed the President of the UNHRC Elisabeth Tichy-Fisslberger in Geneva on Lanka’s decision to withdraw from the resolution, the foreign ministry said on Saturday.

Mr. Gunawardena will also respond to the oral update on Sri Lanka by the UN Human Rights High Commissioner and is scheduled to meet the High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet in Geneva.

Sri Lanka decided to withdraw from co-sponsoring the resolution after the U.S. imposed travel restrictions on Army chief Lt Gen Shavendra Silva and his immediate family members over alleged gross violations of human rights during the final phase of the island nation’s Civil War in 2009.

The resolution 30/1 on promotion on reconciliation in Sri Lanka was co-sponsored in 2015 by the Lankan government headed by then President Maithripala Sirisena.

Sri Lanka’s ruling and opposition parties have strongly opposed the U.S. move to impose the travel ban on Lt Gen Silva, saying America’s decision was based on independently unverified information.

Foreign Minister Gunawardena earlier said that Lt Gen Silva was only conducting a war against a designated terrorist group which was the LTTE.

Lt Gen Silva was appointed as the Sri Lankan Army Commander last year and previously headed the Army’s 58th Division in the final battle against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels of the civil war in 2009.

The UN rights body resolution had blamed Silva’s brigade of committing rights abuses during the final phase of the battle which ended in May 2009. Both government troops and the LTTE were accused of rights violations. The Sri Lanka Army has denied the alleged rights abuses.

The resolution 30/1 called for an independent investigation with foreign judges and prosecutors to probe war crimes allegation.

According to a United Nations report, some 45,000 Tamil civilians were killed in the last months of the war alone.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/8jrw96/article30894649.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DINESHGUNAWARDENA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/sri-lankan-fm-to-officially-announce-colombos-withdrawal-from-un-resolution/article30894650.ece

An earthquake of magnitude 5.7 struck the Turkey-Iran border region early on Sunday, the European Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC) said, although Turkey and Iran said there were no immediate reports of casualties.

The quake had a depth of 5 km (3.1 miles), the EMSC said. Turkish public broadcaster TRT World said it affected about 43 villages in Turkey, which has a history of powerful earthquakes.

“Our rescue teams have been dispatched to the area. So far, we had no reports of damage or fatalities in the area, which is not a populated area in Iran's West Azarbaijan province,” an Iranian official told state TV.

But another local official said “it is very likely that there will be casualties and damages”, Iran's state TV reported.

TRT said damage inspection teams had been dispatched to the region. There were also reports of building collapses in the Turkish city of Van with no immediate reports of casualties.

55,2020/02/23,"Four Indians on board cruise ship test positive for COVID-19, total number of infected Indians rises to 12: Embassy","Earlier, eight Indians were tested positive for the COVID-19. ; “All 12 Indians are responding well to treatment,” the mission said.

Four Indian crew members, who underwent tests for the coronavirus along with others still on board the cruise ship moored off the Japan coast, have tested positive for COVID-19, taking the total number of Indians infected with the virus on the vessel to 12, the Indian embassy said on Sunday.

Passengers showing no signs of the deadly disease started deboarding the ship, Diamond Princess, after the quarantine period ended last week.

Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said that over 1,000 passengers and crew will remain on board the ship after the disembarkations.

On Saturday, around 100 more passengers, who were in close contact with the infected people on board, were allowed the deboard the ship.

“Unfortunately, results received as of 1200 JST (Japan Standard Time) include 4 Indian crew members having tested positive,” the Indian embassy tweeted.

Earlier, eight Indians were tested positive for the COVID-19.

“All 12 Indians are responding well to treatment,” the mission said.

The embassy had on Saturday said that Indians, who are still on board the ship, will be tested for the virus infection along with others after all the healthy passengers have disembarked.

“All Indian nationals, amongst others, on board Diamond Princess will be tested for COVID-19 by Japanese authorities, after all passengers disembarked yesterday (Friday),” it said.

A total of 138 Indians, including 132 crew and 6 passengers, were among the 3,711 people, on board the ship when it docked at the Yokohama port, near Tokyo, on February 3.

It was quarantined after a passenger who disembarked last month in Hong Kong was found to be the carrier of the disease.

The ship has the largest cluster of COVID-19 cases outside China. Two former passengers of the ship have also died.

According to an AP report on Saturday, with the latest disembarkation, a 14-day quarantine is expected to start for those still on board as many of them did not undergo isolation because they were needed to keep the ship running.

Ninety-seven more people died in China due to coronavirus, taking the death toll to 2,442, while the confirmed cases rose to 76,936, officials said on Sunday.

A team of WHO experts also visited the worst-affected Wuhan city in Hubei province to conduct a detailed probe about the virus which reportedly originated from a seafood market in the city in December last year.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/xj7wsx/article30843744.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DIAMONDPRINCESS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/four-indians-on-board-cruise-ship-test-positive-for-covid-19-total-number-of-infected-indians-rises-to-12-embassy/article30894194.ece

Japan's health minister apologised on Saturday after a woman who was allowed to leave a coronavirus-infected cruise ship docked near Tokyo tested positive for the virus.

The woman in her 60s disembarked the Diamond Princess in Yokohama on Wednesday following a two-week quarantine on board, but was found to be positive following another test in Tochigi Prefecture, north of Tokyo.

Health Minister Katsunobu Kato told a news conference in Tokyo on Saturday evening that 23 people who had disembarked on Wednesday and Thursday had not undergone tests since before Feb. 5, and the ministry was trying to reach them for retesting.

“We deeply apologise for the situation caused by our oversight,” Mr. Kato said. “We will take all necessary measures, like double checks, to prevent a recurrence.”

The cruise ship, owned by Carnival Corp, and carrying some 3,700 passengers and crew, has been quarantined in Yokohama since Feb. 3.

Japan's government is facing growing questions about whether it is doing enough to stop the spread of the coronavirus that originated in China and has killed more than 2,400 as Tokyo prepares to host the 2020 Summer Olympics in July.

The U.S. State Department raised its travel advisory for Japan to Level 2 on its four-notch scale on Saturday because of what it termed “sustained community spread.”

The number of confirmed domestic cases grew to 132 after the health ministry said on Saturday it had confirmed 27 new cases of the flu-like illness.

That is separate from the more than 600 cases from the Diamond Princess, the biggest concentration of infections outside China.

Among the new cases on Saturday was a boy under 10 years old in the northern prefecture of Hokkaido, and also a teacher in Chiba Prefecture east of Tokyo who had gone to school while she had symptoms.

Children had been thought to possibly be less vulnerable to the new virus, with far fewer reported infections in much younger people.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/wlwfze/article30894145.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CHINAOUTBREAKFAILEDQUARANTINE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/japan-minister-apologises-after-woman-who-leaves-ship-tests-positive-for-virus/article30894136.ece
57,2020/02/23,Japan emperor’s 60th birthday overshadowed by virus fears,"Sunday’s birthday is a special one for Naruhito, his first since becoming emperor. Sixty is considered a landmark age in the Japanese zodiac calendar.

Japanese Emperor Naruhito, marking his 60th birthday, offered his sympathy to those affected by the new virus, as concerns over infections forced the traditional gathering of tens of thousands of well-wishers outside the royal palace to be cancelled.

Sunday’s birthday is a special one for Naruhito, his first since becoming emperor. Sixty is considered a landmark age in the Japanese zodiac calendar.

Festivities surrounding the emperor’s birthday, however, have been toned down amid concerns about the virus. Plans for Naruhito to wave from the palace balcony to tens of thousands of well-wishers were among the events that were cancelled.

Japan has confirmed more than 750 cases, including 634 from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which was docked and quarantined in Yokohama, near Tokyo.

As we face concerns about the spread of the coronavirus, I offer my sympathy to the patients and their families,” Emperor Naruhito told reporters at a new conference held ahead of his birthday.

I hope that the escalation of the infections will be contained as soon as possible.” While global attention was on the cruise ship, the virus has already made its way into Japan and is gradually spreading in the country, from Okinawa in the south to Hokkaido in the north.

Experts say the infection in Japan is in the early stages of acceleration, prompting the government to prepare for a further spread of the virus.

A series of concerts, athletic events and festivals have been scrapped, with some people starting to question whether Japan can host this summer’s Tokyo Olympics as planned.

Emperor Naruhito, citing his fond memories of Tokyo’s first Olympics, which he saw at age 4, said he hopes to see this summer’s games carried out successfully.

For me, the (1964) Tokyo Olympics was my first encounter with the rest of the world, Naruhito said.

As a young prince, he watched the closing ceremony with his parents. He said watching athletes of all nationalities march together made a strong impression on him.

The scene I was able to see, I believe, became a foundation of my lasting commitment and prayer for world peace, he said.

Emperor Naruhito and his wife, Masako, who is recovering from a stress-induced mental condition, have an 18-year-old daughter, Princess Aiko, who is graduating from high school and will study Japanese literature at Gakushuin University — also Naruhito’s alma mater, where he majored in history.

59,2020/02/23,U.S. to start enforcing regulation that could deny Green Cards to immigrants for availing public benefits,"The move might affect a number of Indians who are on H-1B visas and are in long ques to get permanent legal residency.

The United States on Monday will begin enforcing a regulation that could deny green cards or legal permanent residency to legal immigrants who seek public benefits like food stamps.

The move might affect a number of Indians who are on H-1B visas and are in long ques to get permanent legal residency.

The decision follows the Supreme Court’s ruling on Friday which lifted the final remaining injunction on the ‘public charge’ regulation.

“As a result, the Department of Homeland Security will be able to implement its regulation on Monday,” said White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham.

“This final rule will protect hardworking American taxpayers, safeguard welfare programs for truly needy Americans, reduce the Federal deficit, and re-establish the fundamental legal principle that newcomers to our society should be financially self-reliant and not dependent on the largesse of United States taxpayers,” Grisham said.

The final rule published on August 14, 2019 was originally scheduled to come into effect on October 15, 2019, but could not be implemented due to various court rulings.

The ruling prescribes how the Department of Homeland Security will determine whether an alien is inadmissible, and ineligible to adjust status to that of a lawful permanent resident in the United States because the alien is likely at any time in the future to become a public charge.

According to US Citizenship and Immigration Services, the new rule includes a requirement that individuals seeking an extension, stay or change of status demonstrate that they have not received public benefits over the allowed amount since obtaining the non-immigrant status that they are seeking to extend or change.

According to a 2018 Migration Policy Institute Report, 61 per cent of non-citizen Bangladeshi families, 48 per cent of non-citizen Pakistani and 11 per cent of non-citizen Indian families receive public benefits that would be scrutinised under the rule.

As per SAALT (Strengthening South Asian Communities in America) organisation, the impact of the rule would be felt across the South Asian American community, as over 10 per cent of green card recipients in financial year 2016 were from South Asian countries.

Nearly 472,000 or 1 per cent of the approximately 5 million South Asians in the United States live in poverty, according to a Pew Research Center study.

In 2015, eight of 19 Asian American groups had poverty rates higher than the US average.

Among those, Pakistani Americans (15.8 %), Nepali Americans (23.9 %), Bangladeshi Americans (24.2 %), and Bhutanese Americans (33.3 %) had the highest poverty rates among South Asian American groups, the SAALT said.

The White House had said last year that this action will help ensure that if aliens want to enter or remain in the United States they must support themselves, and not rely on public benefits.

An alien who receives public benefits above a certain threshold is known as a “public charge.”

Foreign nationals will be barred from entering the United States if they are found likely to become public charges.

Those migrants in the United States who are found likely to become public charges will also be barred from adjusting their immigration status, the White House.

“President Trump is enforcing this longstanding law to prevent aliens from depending on public benefit programs,” the White House said, adding that the Immigration and Nationality Act makes clear that those seeking to come to the United States cannot be a public charge.

For many years, this clear legal requirement went largely unenforced, imposing vast burdens on American taxpayers.

The new rule would “have the long-term benefit of protecting taxpayers by ensuring people who are immigrating to this country don’t become public burdens, that they can stand on their own two feet, as immigrants in years past have done,” Ken Cuccinelli, Acting Director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services, had then told Fox News.

In a fact sheet last year, the White House said the Congress passed and President Bill Clinton signed two bipartisan bills in 1996 to help stop aliens from exploiting public benefits.

This included the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act.

As Congress made clear at the time, it is our national policy that aliens should “not depend on public resources to meet their needs.”

Americans widely agree that individuals coming to our country should be self-sufficient, with 73 % in favour of requiring immigrants to be able to support themselves financially, it said.

“We must ensure that non-citizens do not abuse our public benefit programs and jeopardise the social safety net needed by vulnerable Americans,” the White House said.

Large numbers of non-citizens and their families have taken advantage of its generous public benefits, limited resources that could otherwise go to vulnerable Americans, it said.

As many as 78 per cent of households headed by a non-citizen with no more than a high school education use at least one welfare program.

Fifty eight per cent of all households headed by a non-citizen use at least one welfare program.

Half of all non-citizen-headed households include at least one person who uses the Medicaid health programme, the White House said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/sf5yxa/article30038299.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22-varghese-H-1G7S4NKGUA3,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-to-start-enforcing-regulation-that-could-deny-green-cards-to-immigrants-for-availing-public-benefits/article30894047.ece

Sol in one of her previous posts, dated January 23, writes she was inspired by a video of Bahubali sent to her by a friend, which is the story of ‘good defeating evil.’

This inspired Sol to create her first Bahubali-theme meme. The video, lasting 93 seconds, is titled “Jiyo Re Baahu Trump”, in which the First Lady is seen wearing a saree. “Jiyo Re Bahubali,” is the theme song of the video.

“I just loved this video when I saw it! A friend sent it to me and he told me that it is the story of Good defeating evil... it was so fitting I had to make it (meme)...” Sol wrote in her post.

62,2020/02/23,"Bernie Sanders wins Nevada caucuses, takes national Democratic lead","The win built on Sanders’ win earlier this month in the New Hampshire primary.

Bernie Sanders scored a resounding victory in Nevada’s presidential caucuses on Saturday, cementing his status as the Democrats’ national front-runner amid escalating tensions over whether he’s too liberal to defeat President Donald Trump.

The 78-year-old Vermont senator successfully rallied his fiercely loyal base and tapped into support from Nevada’s large Latino community as the Democratic contest moved for the first time into a state with a significant minority population.

The win built on Sanders’ win earlier this month in the New Hampshire primary. He essentially tied for first place in the Iowa caucuses with Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who has sought to position himself as an ideological counter to Sanders’ unabashed progressive politics, but was fighting for a distant second place in Nevada.

The victory, while encouraging for Sanders supporters, only deepens concern among establishment-minded Democratic leaders who fear that the self-described democratic socialist is too extreme to defeat Trump. Sanders for decades has been calling for transformative policies to address inequities in politics and the economy, none bigger than his signature “Medicare for All” health care plan that would replace the private insurance system with a government-run universal system.

Despite establishment anxiety, moderates are struggling to unify behind a single candidate, and the vote on Saturday was again split between several centrists, including Buttigieg and former Vice President Joe Biden.

Also in the mix: Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who desperately needed a spark to revive her stalled bid; billionaire Tom Steyer, who spent more than $12 million on Nevada television, and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who hoped to prove her strong New Hampshire finish was no fluke.

After the chaos of Iowa’s caucuses, there were concerns about Nevada’s similar setup. But no major problems were in sight.

At noon, under sunny skies, dozens of uniformed housekeepers and casino workers cast ballots in the Bellagio, one of seven casino-resorts on the Las Vegas Strip among 200 locations statewide that hosted caucuses. Nevada is the third contest on a 2020 election calendar marked by chaos and uncertainty after the opening votes in Iowa and New Hampshire, overwhelmingly white, rural states.

The first presidential contest in the West is testing the candidates’ strength with black and Latino voters for the first time in 2020. Nevada’s population aligns more with the U.S. as a whole, compared with Iowa and New Hampshire — 29% Latino, 10% black and 9% Asian American and Pacific Islander.

Self-described democratic socialist Bernie Sanders has emerged as the front-runner in the race so far as a half-dozen more-moderate candidates criticise one another. Each wants to be the preferred alternative to the Vermont senator in the race to take on President Donald Trump in November.

In a show of confidence, Sanders left Nevada early to rally supporters in Texas, which offers one of the biggest delegate troves in just 10 days on Super Tuesday. The progressive senator told cheering supporters in El Paso that Trump is “a pathological liar running a corrupt administration.”

""When we come together there is nothing we can’t accomplish,” Sanders declared.

The Nevada verdict represents the third in a primary season that will span all 50 states and several U.S. territories, ending only at the party’s national convention in July. But with two more rounds of voting scheduled over the next 10 days — including Super Tuesday’s massive delegate haul — the party may identify a consensus candidate long before the convention.

Sanders and his allies were increasingly confident about his strength in the race. In Nevada, he has strong support from Latinos and rank-and-file union workers who have warmed to his calls to transform the nation’s economy and political system to help the working class.

There was skepticism about Pete Buttigieg’s ability to win over a more diverse set of voters after strong finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire. Joe Biden, who struggled in those early states, looked to Nevada’s voters of colour to prove he still has a viable path to the nomination.

Elizabeth Warren and Klobuchar were fighting for momentum, hoping to benefit from a sudden surge of outside money from newly created super PACs.

Klobuchar, campaigning in her home state of Minnesota Saturday night, claimed Nevada success no matter what. “As usual I think we have exceeded expectations.”

New York billionaire Mike Bloomberg, who dominated the political conversation this week after a poor debate-stage debut, wasn’t on the ballot. He’s betting everything on a series of delegate-rich states that begin voting next month.

Billionaire Tom Steyer spent more than $12 million of his own money on television advertising in Nevada, according to data obtained by .

Trump weighed in on social media, continuing his weeks-long push to sow discord between Sanders and his Democratic rivals.

""Looks like Crazy Bernie is doing well in the Great State of Nevada. Biden & the rest look weak,” Trump tweeted. “Congratulations Bernie, & don’t let them take it away from you!”

The stakes were high for Nevada Democrats to avoid a repeat of the chaos in Iowa, and it appeared Saturday’s caucuses were largely successful.

The developer the Nevada Democrats had planned to use had its mobile app fail spectacularly in Iowa. Nearly three weeks later, Iowa Democratic officials have yet to post final results. But resources poured into Nevada, as Democrats realized they could ill afford another poorly executed election.

Unlike state primaries and the November election, which are run by government officials, caucuses are overseen by state parties.

Nevada Democrats sought to minimise problems by creating multiple redundancies in their reporting system, relying on results called in by phone, a paper worksheet filled out by caucus organizers, a photo of that worksheet sent in by text message and electronic results captured with a Google form. They relied on trusted commercial tech that appeared to smooth the process.

In addition, it appeared Nevada Democrats were able to successfully navigate a complicated process for adding early voting to the caucus process. Nearly 75,000 people cast early ballots over a four-day period, and the party was able to process those in time for Saturday so they could be integrated into the in-person vote.

At the Bellagio caucus site, 41-year-old Christian Nielsen, a scuba diver for the Cirque du Soleil show “O,” said he backed Sanders because he believes the country needs a “major change in the White House.”

""We need somebody in the White House who has been on the right side of history for their entire career, somebody who stands with the working class, and will make things more fair for everybody,” Nielsen said.

The Democrats’ 2020 nomination fight shifted beyond Nevada even before the final results were known.

Only Biden, Buttigieg and Steyer were still in the state when news of Sanders’ victory was announced.

Sanders and Klobuchar spent the night in Super Tuesday states. And Warren, who began Saturday in Las Vegas, was to finish the day in Washington state, which hosts its election on March 10 but has already begun offering early voting.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/8y3y4z/article30893902.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THNAKELECTION2020BERNIESANDERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/bernie-sanders-wins-nevada-caucuses-takes-national-democratic-lead/article30893903.ece

Earlier on Saturday, Iranian health authorities reported a fifth death from the new virus and said the fatality was among 10 new confirmed cases of the virus in Iran.

So far, 28 cases have been confirmed in Iran, including at least five of the six who died.

64,2020/02/23,L’Arche charity founder sexually abused women,"Vanier had a ‘spiritual hold’ on them

A report reveals that L’Arche founder Jean Vanier, a respected Canadian religious figure whose charity work helped improve conditions for the disabled in multiple countries, sexually abused at least six women. Vanier died last year at age 90.

According to the report seen by the AP on Saturday, the women’s descriptions provide evidence enough to show that Vanier engaged in “manipulative sexual relationships” over a period from 1970 to 2005.

During the inquiry, commissioned by L’Arche last year and carried out by the independent, U.K.-based GCPS Consulting group, six adult, non-disabled women said Vanier had engaged in sexual relations with them as they were seeking spiritual direction. According to the report, the women, who have no links to each other, reported similar facts and Vanier’s sexual misconduct was often associated with alleged “spiritual and mystical justifications.”

‘Deep wounds’

A statement released by L’Arche France on Saturday stressed that some women still have “deep wounds.” Vanier’s actions show “he had a psychological and spiritual hold on these women,” the statement said, adding that nothing suggests that disabled people may have been involved.

Vanier founded the Catholic-inspired charity L’Arche in 1964 as an alternative living environment where those with developmental disabilities could be full-fledged participants in the community instead of patients. The charity now has facilities in 38 countries that are home to thousands of people both with and without disabilities.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/larche-charity-founder-sexually-abused-women/article30890815.ece
65,2020/02/23,‘Campaign spreading false alarm on COVID-19’,"U.S. blames Russia-linked accounts

Thousands of Russia-linked social media accounts have launched a coordinated effort to spread alarm about the coronavirus, disrupting global efforts to fight the epidemic, U.S. officials said.

The disinformation campaign promotes unfounded conspiracy theories that the U.S. is behind the COVID-19 outbreak. State Department officials tasked with combating Russian disinformation said that false personas are being used on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to advance Russian talking points in multiple languages.

“By spreading disinformation about coronavirus, Russian malign actors are once again choosing to threaten public safety by distracting from the global health response,” said Philip Reeker, the acting Assistant Secretary of State for Europe and Eurasia.

‘Economic war’

The claims circulating in recent weeks include allegations that the virus is a U.S. effort to “wage economic war on China,” that it is a biological weapon manufactured by the CIA or part of a Western-led effort “to push anti-China messages.”

66,2020/02/23,Is the endgame near in Syria’s civil war?,"How significant is the advancement of government forces in Idlib? Why is Turkey upset?

The story so far: Recent advances by Syrian government forces in Idlib, the last major rebel-held territory in the war-torn country, have triggered a massive displacement besides raising the possibility of a wider conflict with neighbouring Turkey. The Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad is backed by Russia and Iran in the operation to recapture Idlib, while some rebel factions within the province get support from Turkey. Ankara’s protests have also threatened to disrupt the delicate Turkish-Russian cooperation, which had gained traction in recent years. However, despite Turkey’s protests and mounting international concerns, the Syrian government seems determined to press ahead with the operation.

Why is Idlib strategically important?

The province in northwestern Syria that borders Turkey fell into rebel hands in 2015 at the height of the Syrian civil war. The Assad regime at that time was on the verge of defeat. Rebels and jihadists had captured huge swathes of the country from the regime, including parts of Aleppo, Hama, Homs, the outskirts of Damascus, the capital, and several towns in the south near the Jordan border. But since the arrival of the Russians in September 2015, the regime forces have recaptured almost all of these territories from the rebels. The Kurdish region in northern Syria is run by an autonomous government but the Kurdish rebels, under attack by Turkish forces and pro-Turkish rebels, recently bought peace with Damascus. So in effect, Idlib is the last rebel stronghold, which is also the seat of the Syrian Salvation Government, the rebel administration that claims to represent the whole of Syria. If the government forces recapture Idlib, the Syrian civil war would practically be over, handing final victory to Mr. Assad. With Idlib under control, the regime can also take over, or come close to taking over, the 130-km border the province shares with Turkey. The government will also have control over the key highways that run through Idlib connecting Aleppo, which before the civil war was the commercial capital of Syria, to Damascus. The government version is that it wants to “liberate” Idlib from terrorists.

Who controls Idlib?

There have been several rival rebel and jihadist factions present in Idlib ever since it fell from government control. The dominant group among them is Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) whose roots go back to al-Qaeda’s Syria branch. The group is commanded by Abu Mohammad al-Joulani, who was originally sent to Syria in the early years of the civil war by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the then chief of the Islamic State in Iraq (ISI), to establish an al-Qaeda branch in Syria. Joulani set up Jabhat al-Nusra, which emerged as the most ferocious jihadist group in the Syrian theatre. When Baghdadi announced the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), Joulani broke links with him and continued to command the Nusra Front, which remained the official Qaeda unit. Al-Nusra later rechristened itself a few times to shed the al-Qaeda tag and operate as a Syrian nationalist front. In January 2017, the Jabhat Fateh al-Sham (another name for al-Nusra) and a few other Salafi-jihadist groups merged to create the HTS. The group has implemented a strict Sharia code in Idlib and has been ruling the province through fear and force ever since. Though the HTS has renounced al-Qaeda ties, it is still widely seen as the Syrian front of the transnational jihadist group. The Free Syrian Army and other pro-Turkish rebel groups are also part of the alternative government in Idlib, in an uneasy alliance with the HTS.

Why is Turkey protesting?

There are largely two aspects to Turkey’s strong opposition to the Syrian government’s bid to take Idlib. First, the humanitarian angle. Turkey already hosts more than three million Syrian refugees. It always feared that an attack on Idlib would trigger another refugee exodus towards its borders. The UN estimates that about one million people have already been displaced in Idlib over the past three months. Turkey has now shut its border with the province. But the pressure on Turkey will mount to open the border if more and more displaced people move towards it. Ankara does not want that situation to arise. The second is strategic. Turkey has made it clear that it wants the Syria-Turkish border to be controlled by pro-Turkish rebels, not by the Syrian government, nor by the Syrian Kurds. It had launched a few military offensives in the past to carve out buffer zones on the border. If the Syrian government recaptures Idlib, it will alter the balance of power in the border region, giving an upper hand to the Syrians, and of course, the Russians. The pro-Turkish rebels will be weakened, which means Turkey’s ability to manoeuvre in the Syrian conflict will be enfeebled. Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan wants to prevent such an outcome.

What is Putin’s game plan?

Russian President Vladimir Putin, the main backer of the Syrian regime, has always maintained that his single most priority in the Syrian civil war is to help the government win the war. The Russians had taken tactical retreats in the past, like the de-escalation agreement they reached with Turkey to reduce violence in Idlib in 2017 or the pact reached between the two sides to neutralise Kurdish rebels in northern Syria. But Mr. Putin, it seems, never backed off from recapturing Idlib, and seal off the civil war. With the focus of the United States turning towards domestic issues in an election year, Mr. Putin and Mr. Assad have a window of one year to achieve this goal. This explains the timing of the attack. Turkey’s protests were predictable. But the question is whether Mr. Erdoğan has the wherewithal to stave off the Russians within Syria. Even if Turkey makes a limited intervention along with the rebels, it may be able to delay the Syrian-Russian advances, not deter them. And if Turkey launches a full-scale war, the consequences would be disastrous for all sides.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/s87km4/article30891382.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23THSYRIA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/is-the-endgame-near-in-syrias-civil-war/article30891383.ece
67,2020/02/23,Diesel and his engine,"Rudolf Diesel was granted the patent DRP 67 207 “on a principle of operation and construction for internal combustion engines” on February 23, 1893. A German inventor and mechanical engineer, Diesel was the inventor of the engine that now bears his name. A.S.Ganesh takes a look at the man and his machine...

What all have you seen during a visit to a fuel station? You would have seen motorbikes and cars, and maybe even bigger vehicles on some occasions. You would have seen people attending to these vehicles, filling them up with the desired fuel. If you had noticed closely, you would have observed that the fuel station mainly provides two kinds of fuels – petrol and diesel.

While all the two-wheelers and some four-wheelers get their tanks filled up with petrol, other four-wheelers and certain bigger vehicles get their tanks filled with diesel. The type of fuel used by the vehicle is determined by the engine that it houses. While those with petrol engines use petrol, those with diesel engines use diesel as their fuel.

The “diesel” in these diesel engines comes from Rudolf Diesel, a German inventor and mechanical engineer. Born in Paris in 1858, Diesel decided on a career in engineering at the age of 14. He went to the Munich Technical University (Polytechnic Institute), and by the time he completed his studies there in 1880, he had received the highest grades the university had ever given in an examination since it was founded.

Inspired by Linde

Apart from his brilliant record as a student, Diesel was also drawn towards the thermodynamics lectures of German refrigeration engineer Carl von Linde during his time at Munich. This meant that Diesel not only went to work in the Linde refrigeration machine factory after his studies, but was also inspired to develop a new engine with increased thermal efficiency.

After a year of traineeship, Diesel was hired in Linde’s ice factory in Paris in 1881. By the end of the year, Diesel received his first patent – regarding the manufacture of transparent ice. As the years passed by, Diesel started devoting more time to his self-imposed task of developing a more efficient internal combustion engine.

By 1890, the year he moved to Berlin for a new post with the Linde firm, Diesel had conceived his idea for the engine. His concept of a “new, rational heat engine” was patented in 1892 and in the following year, on February 23, 1893, Diesel was granted the patent DRP 67 207 “on a principle of operation and construction for internal combustion engines”.

No external ignition

As opposed to the spark-ignition engine that requires an externally applied ignition to a mixture of air and fuel, Diesel’s compression-ignition engine relied on compressing air. The ignition was to be achieved by introducing the fuel to a cylinder full of air that is highly compressed, thereby reaching high pressures and hence, extreme heat.

Having built the first prototype of his engine in 1897, Diesel kept improving it over the years. Even though the engines he built never quite hit the efficiency he had predicted through his theoretical calculations, they were still way better than the peers. This meant that there were over 70,000 diesel engines – mainly in factories and generators – that were working by 1912.

Death remains a mystery

On September 29, 1913, Diesel disappeared from the steamship Dresden while travelling to Harwich, England from Antwerp, Belgium. A body floating in water and spotted on October 10 was identified to be Diesel.

Even though Diesel’s death continues to be a mystery, it was officially judged to be a suicide. Despite making a lot of money through his engines, Diesel was facing financial ruin during this voyage and was nearly broke. Conspiracy theories, however, suggest that Diesel’s death could well have been a murder.

In the year of his death, Diesel wrote that “I am firmly convinced that the automobile engine will come, and then I consider my life’s work complete.” He didn’t live to see it, but almost all vehicular diesel engines, till this day, continue to follow the basic principles that were set forth by Diesel.",children,https://www.thehindu.com/children/mcpf6m/article30834645.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23istbDiesel2jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/children/diesel-and-his-engine/article30834648.ece

69,2020/02/23,Rare Andaman plant found to have anti-cancer properties,"Piper sarmentosum has found a new home at JNTBGRI after the 2004 tsunami

An extremely rare plant of the pepper family that received a fresh lease of life at the Jawaharlal Nehru Tropical Botanic Garden and Research Institute (JNTBGRI), Palode, after being wiped out from the South Andaman Island by the 2004 tsunami has now been found to have anti-cancer properties.

A phytochemical analysis of Piper sarmentosum revealed the presence of myristicin, a naturally occurring phenolic compound known for its anti-cancer role, JNTBGRI scientists said. The analysis revealed the occurrence of pharmacologically important compounds including myristicin (77%), hydrocinnamic acid, and caryphyllene.

Moreover, a nutritional analysis of the plant — which now thrives in its new home at the JNTBGRI — has revealed that it can be used as a substitute for Thippali (Long Pepper - Piper longum) in Ayurvedic preparations. For want of a name in Malayalam since the plant has not been reported elsewhere on Indian territory except the North Bay area on South Andaman, the TBGRI staff have informally started calling it the Andaman Thippali!

Collaborative studies with the Department of Botany of the University of Kerala have also enabled the JNTBGRI to standardise protocols for the mass multiplication of Piper sarmentosum through tissue culture.

The importance of its restoration at the JNTBGRI Field Gene Bank using pre-tsunami germ plasm from the Andamans cannot be overstated, JNTBGRI scientists said. “From a floristic point of view, Piper sarmentosum is an ‘extra Indian species’, meaning it is not found in mainland India. While it is not reported elsewhere in India, it occurs in south-east Asian countries like Malaysia where it is cultivated and used in cuisines and for treating ailments,” said Dr. Sam Mathew, senior scientist, Plant Genetic Resource Division, JNTBGRI, who was instrumental in the discovery of Piper sarmentosum in the South Andaman and its subsequent restoration at the JNTBGRI.

The way to discovery

Scientific significance apart, there is an interesting story behind the plant’s discovery and subsequent identification. Dr. Sam Mathew had stumbled upon the species on South Andaman in 1992 during his days as a botanist with the Botanical Survey of India (BSI). Though he located it, he took it for Piper longum which it resembles. Anyhow, he brought back samples for the BSI and the JNTBGRI that he joined in 1993. In 2004, the JNTBGRI formally reported Piper sarmentosum as a new addition to Indian flora.

The same year, the tsunami devastated the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. On his return to the South Andaman after the catastrophe, Dr. Mathew found the entire Piper sarmentosum population to have been washed away. Both the BSI and the JNTBGRI were alerted of the loss after which conservation efforts gained renewed vigour.

“Its restoration here is highly significant, especially in the context of environmental changes. It reflects the need to conserve such plants not in any one place alone, but in multiple locations exhibiting similar agro-climatic conditions. If, for an example, an ecosystem gets destroyed, the diverse life forms that depend on it should not be lost to us,” JNTBGRI Director Dr. R. Prakashkumar told The Hindu.

Structurally, Piper sarmentosum resembles the long pepper (Piper longum). It has long ‘stolons’ or runners with procumbent fruit-bearing branches. JNTBGRI also plans to re-introduce the species in its original habitat in collaboration with the Department of Botany.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/ybmau4/article30900690.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Pipersarmentosum-fruit,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/cancer-has-a-foe-in-this-andaman-native/article30896600.ece
70,2020/02/23,Minister seeks report,"The issue centres on a disused temple within the land identified for the project

Water Resources Minister K. Krishnankutty has sought reports from the Irrigation Department and Kerala Water Authority (KWA) regarding the dispute over the land identified for the 120-mld water supply project at Neyyar that led to tension in the region on Friday.

The issue centres on a disused temple within the land identified for the project. According to revenue and irrigation department officials, the land in question was cleared of all encroachments years ago. On Friday, the dispute assumed religious and political overtones when people led by Hindu Aikya Vedi leaders forcibly organised a pooja at the temple ignoring the warnings of the police and revenue officials. This had led to tension in the region till Friday afternoon.

On Saturday, the Neyyar dam police registered cases against four Aikya Vedi activists. Following the tension on Friday, CPI(M) district secretary Anavoor Nagappan had accused the BJP and RSS of attempting to scuttle the ₹60-crore, 120-mld project that envisages water supply to Thiruvananthapuram city and four grama panchayats.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/minister-seeks-report/article30891860.ece
71,2020/02/23,A space where summer adapts itself to life,"Zoo has methods to keep animals cool as mercury soars

A hotter-than-usual January and a couple of heat alerts this month already have people groaning at the prospect of a long and draining summer ahead.

At the city zoo, though, the clear skies that followed a pretty long monsoon season have been quite welcome.

Unlike the rains that trouble the animals more, not to mention the increased possibility of spread of diseases, the summer is the time for them to play and have fun and even increase their numbers.

They naturally adapt to the rising mercury, reducing their activities when the heat peaks during the day.

What helps is the vast green cover on the zoo premises, keeping temperatures lower than what is outside with the sun beating down relentlessly.

The massive trees provide cool shade, making the animals quite comfortable even when they move about.

The lion-tailed macaques particularly seem to having a great time, frolicking high up in the branches.

Animals living in enclosures shaded by trees too seem be unaffected by the heat.

It is only in enclosures, such as that of the deer and antelope, where the green cover has been decimated by them that there is cause for concern. Here, the animals’ instinct to reduce activity and take rest as the mercury peaks kicks in.Even the carnivores feed less and become less active during the summer.

The zoo authorities have taken steps to green the enclosures for future.

At the enclosures

Small trees with ring guards have been planted in the giraffe, sambar and swamp deer and black buck enclosures.

After the renovation of the tiger cages, fast-growing golden bamboo has been planted between the cages to provide the big cats a little respite from the sun’s rays.

A shed of palm fronds has been set up in the ostrich enclosure.

A group of sambar deer has been moved elsewhere to promote the growth of vegetation.

The increasing concrete cover in the zoo though does pose some worries. Summer is also the time the birds lay eggs and incubate them.

Snakes, which are cold-blooded creatures, too find the warm temperatures suitable for reproduction.

The animals which are already present in great numbers such as the sambar and spotted deer have been segregated, as have been the hippos.

Supply of water

A steady supply of water in the enclosures keeps the animals hydrated.

The moats in enclosures such as that of the hippo, rhino, the big cats, and bears are filled regularly so that the animals can take a dip and cool down whenever needed.

Closed enclosures are hosed down so that they remain cool while in open enclosures, it allows grass to grow.

The animals’ diet has been tweaked to include a lot of fresh fruits and greens, besides lots of icy fruit punch.

Zoo veterinarian Jacob Alexander says the ambience at the city zoo is very different from zoos elsewhere that that have very few trees or not large enough ones.

However, a lot more needs to be done. An inventory of trees should be prepared and the lifespan of the oldest and biggest trees ascertained so that they can be replaced without any harm to the green lung of the city.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/a-space-where-summer-adapts-itself-to-life/article30891851.ece
72,2020/02/23,Formation of water literacy centre mooted,"The Tamil Nadu River Retrieval Movement on Sunday mooted the formation of water literacy centre in the State so as to maximise the efficient utilisation of river, tank and groundwater sources.

Briefing about the resolutions adopted at the two-day colloquium on ‘Cauvery-Strategies to Rejuvenate River Basin Resources and Water Bodies’ at Ramakrishna Thapovanam, Thirupparaithurai, Rajeendar Singh, Water Conservationist and Environmentalist, said that groundwater extraction in Tamil Nadu had reached an alarming level. The indiscriminate extraction of groundwater was a big threat to the environment and humankind. The groundwater had to be recharged at regular intervals. Hence, the need of the hour was to establish water literacy centres at the State, district and area-specific levels with the mandate of carrying out water auditing and budgeting with the farmers.

Stressing the importance of protecting the lower riparian rights of Cauvery river, Mr. Singh said the stakeholders and the States concerned should ensure the riparian rights. It was the responsibility of the States to ensure water ethics and water justice. “The water rights should be dealt equivalent to human rights and conflicts,” he said.

Mr. Singh said that the impact of global warming and climate had been clearly felt in the country. Change in rainfall pattern has been witnessed across the country, including Tamil Nadu. Farmers need to have a good knowledge regarding the rainfall pattern. Depending on the change, the farmers should adapt to new crop pattern so as to maximise the output with minimum water usage.

It has been noted that the course of several major rivers and their tributaries have been encroached upon. The State does not seem to have an efficient mechanism to evict the encroachments, he said, calling for a widespread campaign to identify, demarcate and declare the boundaries of all waterbodies so as to inform the public about them.

Stating that several rivers were facing extinction due to various factors, Mr. Singh said that the Tamil Nadu River Retrieval Movement had decided to launch an awareness campaign across the State. It would start with ‘Save the Vaigai’ river and its tributaries. Volunteers and farmers would walk along the river to create awareness on the need to protect and rejuvenate the Vaigai, he added.

The protest, which began following what they described as police brutality on protesters in Washermanpet in Chennai, will end only after revocation of the Act, they said.

Nearly 5,000 women and children most of whom have been continuing their protest at Uzhavar Santhai ground for over a week say that they will not return to their homes until the ‘discriminatory Act’ is revoked. The women and children spend all day at the ground while the men go to work. The men stay there at night, and young women and those with children are sent home, said S. Nisha, one of the protesters.

“Volunteers and some older women stay round the clock,” she said. “The registry of birth certificates only became a norm in the '90s. Neither my parents nor parents-in-law have any birth certificates. However, that’s not an issue solely for Muslims. What will they do with all the people without birth certificates?” she asked.

Another protester, Mumtaz Begum demanded an explanation from the Central government, apprehending that Muslims were being left out of citizenship. “Some of us have bought land, been doing businesses, constructed houses and have been paying taxes for years. They will keep taking our money as taxes; how then do they suddenly decide we are not citizens?” she wondered.

“Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K Palanisamy has sought to know which minority community has been being affected in Tamil Nadu. We would like to say that each and every member of minority communities has been affected. Has he not seen the effect in Assam? People are dying in detention camps,” she said.

The protest is not solely by Muslims but by all those who are worried for the future of the country, said S. Haseena. “Students have been pouring in here since last week and giving us their support. Some good Samaritans provide meals, snacks and milk for children. This is not a Muslim-only fight. This is a fight for justice. We do not want the new Citizenship Amendment, the country must remain secular, like the way our forefathers intended,” she said.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/8wci49/article30895546.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY24CAATRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/seventh-day-and-protest-against-caa-still-going-strong/article30895547.ece

75,2020/02/23,‘Step up banana production’,"Four mobile applications developed by NRCB launched at meet

Launch of mobile applications providing information on banana and its cultivation, presentation of awards to banana farmers, scientists, and entrepreneurs, release of postal cover and inauguration of a banana expo marked the opening of a four-day international conference on banana here on Saturday.

Organised by the National Research Centre for Banana (NRCB), an institution under the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), in association with Bioversity International, the meet is being organised on the theme, ‘Innovations in sustainable production and value chain management in banana.’ The meet will also focus on invasive fusarium wilt tropical race 4 (Foc TR4) disease in banana.

Four mobile applications developed by NRCB for the benefit of stakeholders such as farmers, extension workers, entrepreneurs, tissue culture companies, exporters, consumers, students and scientists were formally launched on the occasion. The Apps on banana information (providing A to Z details on the fruit), production technology, banana export and value addition, and pest and disease management have been developed separately in English and Tamil. The Apps would be available for public in the next few days after some fine-tuning. The Apps were launched by A.K. Singh, Deputy Director General (Horticulture), ICAR.

Earlier, Collector S.Sivarasu declared open a banana expo, featuring an array of banana bunches of different varieties, including hill and wild bananas, from across the country. The exhibition, at the Kalaiarangam complex, also featured stalls displaying value added products made out of banana including biscuits, pickles, juice and other edible products, and cloth material made of banana fibre.

Speaking at the inaugural ceremony of the conference, Mr. Singh underlined the need for increasing banana production and productivity in the country to meet the anticipated rise in demand in the coming decades. Banana was a significant crop in the country and cultivation of the fruit has made rapid strides. Productivity has improved thanks to technologies developed by the research institutions which upon successful field demonstration had given the confidence to farmers to adopt them on a large scale, he said. He also called for steps to ensure that there was no dominance of single variety such as Grand Naine in the total cultivated area in the country.

K. Alagusundaram, Deputy Director General (Engineering), ICAR, laid emphasis on adopting proper post harvest technology to ensure the harvested fruits were properly handled, transported and stored till it reaches the consumer.

N. Kumar, Vice-Chancellor, Tamil Nadu Agricultural University; W.S. Dhillon, Assistant Deputy Director (Horticulture), ICAR; N.K. Krishnakumar, Country Representative, The Alliance Bioversity International-CIAT; S. Uma, Director, NRCB; and B. Padmanaban, Principal Scientist, spoke.

76,2020/02/23,"Unity of farmers must to save Cauvery delta, says expert","‘Government must first address basic challenges of the region and farmers’

Though Cauvery delta districts have been declared a protected agricultural zone by the State government, farmers have to work unitedly and cautiously to protect the delta on a sustainable basis, said S. Janakarajan, a water management expert.

Delivering the keynote address at a two-day Colloquium on ‘Cauvery - strategies to retrieve and rejuvenate river basin resources and waterbodies,’ organised by Tamil Nadu Rivers Retrieval Movement here on Saturday, Mr. Janakarajan said that under the protected zone scheme of things, the government, in consultation with stakeholders, must first address certain basic challenges that were seriously affecting the delta region and farmers.

Pollution of the river, rampant mining of sand from riverbeds and erratic rains were seriously eroding the economic status of the farmers, with serious social implications. About 30% of the delta population were landless labourers and people belonging to the marginalised and weaker sections of society. Over exploitation of groundwater was seriously affecting Nagapattinam and Tiruvarur districts. This would have serious repercussions if not immediately addressed by the new legislation brought in by the State government, he said.

He also appealed to representatives of farmers’ organisations and environmentalists to come out with a joint action plan to protect the delta.

S. Ranganathan, general secretary, Cauvery Delta Farmers Welfare Association, said that the Cauvery was a deficit river and the demand for water for various purposes had been steadily increasing and the situation had worsened with politicisation of the water sharing dispute in both Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. Depletion of sand from the river had vastly reduced the holding capacity of dams during the very few surplus years. Farmers should think of adopting newer technologies and cropping pattern, depending upon availability of water in Mettur dam, he added.

T. Guruswamy, organising president of the colloquium, while outlining the objectives of the meet, said that farmers in the southern States were at loggerheads often with regard to distribution of water in the Krishna, Godavari, Cauvery and other rivers. A sense of unanimity on the importance of increasing demand for water, for irrigation, drinking and industrial development, would help them to come on a common platform to demand their rights.

Subramanian, organising secretary; Puliyur Nagarajan, president, farmers’ wing of Tamil Maanila Congress; senior retired officials and representatives of various farmers’ organisations participated in the meeting.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/yeg64k/article24098294.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Janakarajan-Srinivasa-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/unity-of-farmers-must-to-protect-cauvery-delta-says-expert/article30893657.ece

78,2020/02/23,Indian Super League | Odisha FC draws with Kerala Blasters,"Manuel Onwu stars with a hat-trick for the hosts

Odisha FC and Kerala Blasters played out an entertaining 4-4 draw in the Indian Super League (ISL) here on Sunday.

Manuel Onwu scored a hat-trick for the hosts, while Bartholomew Ogbeche netted twice to lead the Golden Boot standings with 15 to his name.

Odisha FC ended its league stage campaign with 25 points, while Kerala Blasters finished seventh with 19 points in their kitty.

Early lead

Odisha FC took the lead through Manuel Onwu in the very first attack of the game. Jerry Mawihmingthanga’s cross saw Onwu head it first time as he left Bilal Khan stranded to his position to make it 1-0.

However, Kerala equalised soon after as Messi Bouli crossed into the box which saw Narayan Das slam the ball into the back of his own net.

Kerala came close to scoring again as Jessel Carneiro’s corner-kick found Ogbeche in space and the Nigerian’s strike ended up on the side-netting.

The visitors eventually went ahead 2-1 when Carneiro’s cross was comfortably controlled by Messi and with his second touch, he slammed it home to beat the goalkeeper.

In the 36th minute, Onwu scored his second of the evening; this time from a set-piece as his free-kick sailed into the back of the net.

Odisha could have made it 3-2 as Jerry went on a mazy run before he laid the ball for Daniel Lalhimpuia whose shot was fisted out for a corner by the goalkeeper.

Costly mistake

Raju Gaikwad’s foul cost Kerala as he brought down Onwu inside the box which left the referee with no option but point at the spot.

Martin Guedes converted from the penalty spot, despite Khan diving to his right to make it 3-2 for the home side.

Onwu completed his hat-trick in the 51st minute as his free-kick went straight into the far corner to take his goals tally for Odisha to seven from four matches.

Around the hour mark, Lalhimpuia had a chance to add his name to the score-sheet but his attempt went inches wide.

Xisco Hernandez was denied by the crossbar as he got on the end of a Nandhakumar pull back and his first time shot came off the woodwork.

Nandhakumar too could have joined the party as his effort came off the crossbar as Kerala Blasters’s defence once again was found wanting.

Shubham Sarangi was guilty of bringing down Ogbeche inside the box and the Blasters skipper beat Dorronsoro from the spot.

Penalty

Deep into injury time, Ogbeche was caught on his neck by Dorronsoro.

The subsequent penalty was dispatched in style by the Nigerian player as he scored his 15th goal of the campaign.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/yoqywb/article30900396.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/odishajpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/odisha-fc-draws-with-kerala-blasters/article30897129.ece
79,2020/02/23,CCFC lets match slip out of grasp,"Chennai City FC (CCFC) had the match pretty much in its grasp but let go rather tamely to draw with Aizawl FC 1-1 in the Hero I-League here on Sunday.

As has been the story in the tournament, CCFC’s conversion in the final third continued to be poor, and it paid the price for it.

CCFC moved up two places to sixth with 16 points from 13 matches while Aizawl remains in 10th position with 15 from 13.

CCFC’s next home match is on March 29. In its next match, CCFC will meet Indian Arrows on February 28 in Mumbai.

80,2020/02/23,"United climbs to fifth, City edges Leicester","Real not so lucky against Levante

Bruno Fernandes opened his goalscoring account at Manchester United on Sunday as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side climbed to fifth place in the Premier League table with a 3-0 win against lowly Watford. Victory at Old Trafford lifts it to 41 points, just three behind fourth-placed Chelsea. Midfielder Fernandes scored from the penalty spot shortly before half-time and Anthony Martial and Mason Greenwood also found the net.

As it stands, fifth place could be enough to earn a Champions League spot because second-placed Manchester City has been banned from Europe’s elite competition for two seasons, pending an appeal.

On Saturday, Gabriel Jesus struck late to give Manchester City a 1-0 win at Leicester, strengthening its hold on second place despite more woe from the penalty spot.

A second-half winner from substitute Jesus after Sergio Aguero had failed to convert a penalty put it 17 points clear of fifth-placed Tottenham and sends it into its midweek match against Real Madrid in good spirits.

There was no joy, however, for Real as its hold on the LaLiga top spot was loosened after a 1-0 loss away to Levante. This followed yet another Lionel Messi master-class, as the Argentine shrugged off all talk of goal drought by scoring four in a 5-0 thumping of Eibar. To add to Real’s woes star summer signing Eden Hazard limped off with yet another injury in the second half.

Real on Sunday confirmed that the Belgian had broken his ankle. “Following the tests carried out today on our player Eden Hazard... he has been diagnosed with a fracture to his right distal fibula,” Real said in a statement.

The results: Premier League: Manchester United 3 (Fernandes 42-pen, Martial 58, Greenwood 75) bt Watford 0; Wolves 3 (Jota 19, 30, Jimenez 50) bt Norwich 0.

LaLiga: Osasuna 0 lost to Granada 3 (Machis 4, 28, Foulquier 41); Alaves 2 (Perez 28-pen, Ely 90+1) bt Athletic Bilbao 1 (Garcia 17).

Serie A: Genoa 2 (Cassata 57, Criscito 89-pen) lost to Lazio 3 (Marusic 2, Immobile 51, Cataldi 71).

Saturday: Premier League: Burnley 3 (Vydra 53, Rodriguez 61-pen, McNeil 87) bt Bournemouth 0; Crystal Palace 1 (Van Aanholt 44) bt Newcastle 0; Leicester 0 lost to Manchester City 1 (Jesus 80); Sheffield United 1 (Stevens 26) drew with Brighton 1 (Maupay 30); Southampton 2 (Long 8, Armstrong 90+5) bt Aston Villa 0.

Real Madrid said on Sunday that Belgium forward Eden Hazard has fractured his right lower leg, putting him in danger of missing the rest of the season.

Madrid’s medical report said that he had a “fracture to his right distal fibula,” but did not specify if it was in the same place.

Nor did the club say how long it expects him to be out. Hazard missed almost three months due to his previous injury.

Madrid hosts Manchester City in the Champions League on Wednesday. It then hosts Barcelona on Sunday with the Spanish league lead up for grabs.

Goa had last hosted the league final in 2015 between Chennaiyin FC, coached by Marco Materazi, and FC Goa, coached by Zico, at the Nehru Stadium.

FSDL Founding-Chairperson, Nita Ambani, said: “Goa deserves to host the ISL final. There is no denying that the state loves its football and we would like to bring the most crucial football event to the city.”

83,2020/02/23,Barcelona takes over Spanish league lead after Madrid loss,"Barcelona fans protesting club president Josep Bartomeu were also given reason to cheer as Lionel Messi scored four goals and the team went back on top of the Spanish league on Saturday.

Bartomeu was jeered by part of the crowd at the Camp Nou. Fans, who also called for his resignation, have not been happy with his administration amid one of the club’s worst institutional crises, which includes a controversial coaching change and public conflicts between players and club directors.

Messi has been one of those critical of the club officials, but on Saturday he was his old self as he poured four goals past Eibar in a 5-0 rout.

Combined with Real Madrid losing to Levante 1-0, and Barcelona will take a two-point lead of the league into their clasico next weekend at Santiago Bernabşu Stadium.

Before the clasico, Barcelona and Madrid have round-of-16 matches in the Champions League — Barcelona visits Napoli on Tuesday and Real Madrid hosts Manchester City on Wednesday.

Messi led Barcelona to victory with a hat trick in the first 40 minutes and another goal near fulltime, ending a four-game scoreless streak that marked his worst run in six years in the Spanish league.

Arthur also scored for Barcelona after an assist from debuting striker Martin Braithwaite.

""We needed a game like this, when we did things well and everything went our way,” Barcelona coach Quique Setişn said.

It was the seventh time Messi scored four or more goals in a game with Barcelona.

Eibar tweeted — “All we can do is give you a standing ovation (at) team messi”

Another Real Madrid stumble

Real Madrid wasted a dominating performance against mid-table Levante.

Eden Hazard and Karim Benzema went close in one-on-one situations in the second half, but Benzema missed wide and Hazard’s shot was saved. Benzema, Lucas Vŕzquez and Luka Modric already missed good chances in the first half at Ciudad de Valencia Stadium.

""We can’t look back now,” Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane said. “We are going through a difficult moment, having lost five points in two matches. We know everything will be on the line for us this next week. We have to keep our heads high and keep fighting to try to overcome this bad moment.”

""It doesn’t look good,” he said, adding that the player was expected to undergo tests on Sunday.

Josş Luis Morales scored the 79th-minute winner, a powerful left-footed shot from inside the area, hitting the top corner of Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois.

Levante had won only one of its last 14 league games against Real Madrid. Levante moved to 10th place with the win, its second in three matches.

Champions League battle

Real Sociedad routed Valencia 3-0 to jump from eighth to fourth in the standings, grabbing a qualification spot for the Champions League.

It was the fifth winless game for Valencia, which on Wednesday was routed by Atalanta 4-1 in the first leg of the round of 16 of the Champions League.

Valencia dropped to eighth place, two points behind Sociedad.

Aspas heroics

Striker Iago Aspas scored in the second half to give 10-man Celta Vigo a crucial 1-0 victory over relegation rival Leganes.

The hosts won despite playing most of the match with 10 men because of a straight red card shown to Croatian midfielder Filip Bradaric for a hard foul in the 21st.

It was Leganes’ first game since losing Braithwaite to Barcelona. The modest club from southern Madrid was not given permission to replace him outside the transfer window.

Second-placed Olympique de Marseille slumped to a 3-1 home defeat against Nantes as their 14-game unbeaten run in Ligue 1 ended after almost four months on Saturday.

Kader Bamba's goal and Alvaro's own goal, both in the second half, earned Nantes all three points after OM midfielder Morgan Sanson had cancelled out Anthony Limbombe's opener as the Provence side suffered their first defeat since they lost 4-0 at Paris St Germain on Oct. 27.

Marseille trail leaders Paris St Germain, who host Girondins de Bordeaux on Sunday, by 10 points, but still lead third-placed Stade Rennais by 11 points before the Brittany side host Nimes on Sunday.

Nantes, who are 10th on 37 points, went ahead in the 35th minute when Limbombe beat Steve Mandanda with a diving header from Bamba's cross.

Sanson levelled four minutes later with a superb volley from just outside the box in a highly disputed first half.

Bamba curled a splendid effort past Mandanda from the edge of the area to put the visitors back on top eight minutes into the second half.

One minute into stoppage time, Alvaro deflected Moses Simon's attempt into his own goal.

89,2020/02/23,The Huddle 2020 | Comparing Kambala athlete with Bolt is unfair: Ashwini,"‘Social media-driven zeal is disservice to both’

Asian Games medallist Ashwini Nachappa termed the social media driven zeal to equate Kambala athlete Srinivasa Gowda’s performance to that of Usain Bolt a disservice to both. In conversation with The Hindu’s Sports Editor K.C. Vijaya Kumar at The Huddle, the Arjuna Awardee and Olympian said: “Both are about sprinting and speed, but to compare is not fair. As a Kambala sport, he needs to be recognised and commended for the remarkable achievement. But to call for an athletics trial is just unfair. Suppose he had gone in and failed to perform, everyone would have put him down. Athletes have been training for years to just shave off 0.01 seconds. It’s an unfair comparison.”

It’s perhaps a reflection of the desire of the populace to have more sporting heroes to look up to. This lack of sporting achievement can only be bettered if sports federations clean up their acts and money is invested in the right areas, she said.

“It’s time we revisit and re-look how we run sport,” she said. “Except cricket, no other sport has created pathways for its athletes. It requires the will of the government to hold the federations accountable. The amount of money spent is enormous. But at the grassroots it’s zero. So the real change is to be seen in the federations. Their mandate is not to become event managers.”

Investment in technology

Investment in technology and improving sports science were the need of the hour, she felt. “Between the 10.3 seconds Jessie Owens took to run 100m in 1936 to Bolt’s 9.58s, what has changed? We have not become super-humans. It’s science and technology.”

“The synthetic surfaces of today are way better than the cinder tracks that Jessie ran on. Spikes are customised to your weight and the way you run. The science of performance is something India needs to invest in.”

Doping problem

Also high on her list of focus areas was India’s mammoth doping problem. “It’s alarming. We are high up in the WADA list [of offenders]. Look, there is enough education today about doping. I don’t agree when athletes [after getting caught] say they didn’t know. And, it’s not just the athlete. There is a nexus; the coach and the federation should also be accountable.”

As a woman athlete, Ashwini felt strongly about the need for more gender sensitisation, especially in light of what happened to Santhi Soundarajan, who was stripped of her 2006 Asian Games gold after failing a gender test, and South Africa’s Caster Semenya.

“There needs to be more education on that. There are medical conditions that can be addressed. Nobody is looking at it in a manner that is sensitive to the athlete. In Santhi’s case, it was very unfortunate. She had to undergo such trauma and the federation just washed its hands of. For Semenya both her federation and the government fought for her. That sensitivity is key.”",the huddle,https://www.thehindu.com/the-huddle/wbzcld/article30896653.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH24ASHWINIa,https://www.thehindu.com/the-huddle/the-huddle-2020-comparing-kambala-athlete-with-bolt-is-unfair-ashwini-nachappa/article30896654.ece
90,2020/02/23,"The Huddle 2020 | Little Things, Upstarts and the rise of the digital stars","Actors discussed the way the market for films has changed for better

For Manisha Koirala, an actor who ruled Bollywood in the 1990s, getting back to the showbiz after a sabbatical, specially on an OTT (over-the-top media service) platform like Netflix, was all about reinventing herself. “I studied what was working in the market, what the young generation was liking, the new directors to work with… It was a new setting. I was trying a short film [Lust Stories]… I was apprehensive about how people will perceive and accept me,” she said in ‘The Netflix Session’ on the second day of The Huddle.

Digital stardom

Ms. Koirala, along with actors Mithila Palkar and Priyanshu Painyuli, and Srishti Arya, Netflix’s Director for International Film, India, was in conversation with Rosella Stephen, Associate Editor, The Hindu, on creating stars in the digital age.

The “Internet sensation” that she is often called, Ms. Palkar spoke about how her web series, Little Things, got propelled in an unfathomable way when it was acquired by Netflix. “With a click of a button, we could reach 190 countries and millions of subscribers. There were so many watching and liking it,” she said.

For someone who wanted to be an actor but didn’t know how to go about it, Internet was one of the many experiments she dabbled in. She feels her growth in it happened organically: “It was emerging as a legitimate medium of entertainment and I was part of that change.”

For Bengaluru boy Priyanshu Painyuli, known for his performance in Vikramaditya Motwane’s Bhavesh Joshi Superhero, the gates to digital stardom opened with the Netflix film Upstarts. He found himself being recognised in Taiwan and getting a free acupuncture treatment. He will soon be seen in the company of Chris Hemsworth in Extraction, a Russo Brothers’ production for Netflix. “One day, you are watching Avengers and second day, you are in a Russo Brothers film… Suddenly, you find the stakes going up and your audience going global… My next dream is to get an Oscar… I can now think that Martin Scorsese will see my work and cast me in The Irishman 2,” he said.

Ms. Arya spoke about Netflix’s commitment to telling an authentic story in the best possible way, in a language that it needs to be told in. She gave the example of a forthcoming Hindi film about a family living in Kerala where the parents are from Maharashtra and so they speak to each other in Marathi. The kids have grown up in Kerala and can talk in Malayalam and are also shown speaking English in school.

“Netflix is all about enabling creative people to come and do their best work. People may tend to remember the pedigreed names but the platform has also been about new female and male voices. Maska, Chopsticks, Upstarts have come from new people. It’s a healthy mix,” Ms. Arya stressed.

According to Ms. Palkar, Netflix has democratised opportunities for stories and storytellers. “Different content and narratives would not have been possible if it had not happened,” she said. Ms. Koirala spoke of how it had liberated film professionals from the fear of the market and ticket sales: “It’s about excelling, not missing a chance… It’s very precious, makes us put our best foot forward.”

‘Right-sizing budgets’

In response to an audience question, Ms. Arya said that the doors of Netflix were never closed to ideas and makers. On the question of whether the budgets are equivalent to those of the big screen films, she said: “We right size all our budgets…what [amount] the material needs to be effective.”

Mr. Painyuli spoke about the change in stardom in the times of social media. “People connect with you more intimately,” he said. For Ms. Palkar, it was about instant gratification and interactiveness, as it happens backstage after a theatre performance. “People watch the video and respond immediately,” she said.

Ms. Koirala spoke about the limited time she spends on social media, and of being on a learning curve there. “Time is precious to me and I focus on my craft,” she said, also underlining the importance of occasional digital detox.",the huddle,https://www.thehindu.com/the-huddle/h8m7p6/article30896548.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH24ACTORS,https://www.thehindu.com/the-huddle/the-huddle-2020-we-could-reach-190-countries-and-millions-of-subscribers-says-mithila-parker/article30896549.ece
91,2020/02/23,"The Huddle 2020 | Immense self-belief, the hallmark of Kumble","‘If you keep the institution and the sport in the larger interest then I think you tend to take the right decision’

Anil Kumble has always left a mark; as a bowler, as a captain, as an administrator, as a coach, as a sports entrepreneur and as a wildlife photographer. On a crisp winter morning on Sunday, the cricketing legend, in conversation with K.C. Vijaya Kumar, The Hindu’s Sports Editor, seamlessly straddled across all these areas. By the end of the hour-long session, he had left his mark on the audience too.

What has stood out, apart from his meticulousness, is his immense self-belief and ability to not be shackled by the various orthodoxies. “There were a lot of doubts from the time I walked into the team,” Kumble said. “When you see someone bowling leg break with an off-spinners grip …. reports suggested that at best I could just restrict a batsman and I needed doctored pitches. In fact, the first question after my final match in Delhi was ‘how does it feel to retire after taking 600 plus wickets without actually spinning the ball!”

Sticking to USP

“But I always went back to someone who I idolised and looked up to, B.S. Chandrasekhar. He would just tell me ‘as long as your nip is there.. the pace at which the ball goes in at the batsman after pitching, don’t worry. That was my USP and I stuck to it.”

With the advent of T20 cricket, such non-conformity has been mainstreamed, Kumble felt. “I was glad that there were not too many coaches who looked to change the style that I bowled. Now, with [Jasprit] Bumrah, if he had to conform to what we believe is the way a fast bowler should bowl, then I don’t think he would have emerged as a leading fast bowler.”

Four-day match

For today’s generation, the five-day Test match too seems like an anachronism that needs to be shed, but Kumble, who is the Chairman of the ICC Cricket Committee, said he was not keen on the idea.

“The players don’t want a four-day match. It’s a Test only if it is five days, not four. I am very clear on that. It was discussed a couple of years ago. The experiment was done with South Africa and Zimbabwe I think and maybe some boards have that idea. But I don’t think in the Committee or within the ICC there is immediate thinking on having a four-day Test that is mandatory.”

If there is one trait that has defined Kumble right through, it is his ability to put the game and the institutions above individuals; be it during the infamous ‘Monkeygate’ incident during the 2007-08 tour of Australia, or when he stepped down as India coach in mid 2017 following a hugely successful one-year stint.

Bedi’s suggestion

“If you keep the institution and the sport in the larger interest then I think you tend to take the right decision. In Australia, one of our former captains sent me a message saying ‘son, take a decision as to how history will look at you.’ It was a very great suggestion from Bishen Singh Bedi. Yes, we had to take Harbhajan Singh, the player affected the most, into confidence. But the stance of continuing with the tour helped.”

“And if I could walk away from being captain of India and retire from the sport, I think anything after that is easy. [Resigning as coach] was the right decision that needed to be done in the interest of the team. Coaches are there to enable the players, to create an environment where the team could be successful. I was really glad that we were able to achieve that over a period of one year. I don’t regret stepping away.”",the huddle,https://www.thehindu.com/the-huddle/ho6z0p/article30896490.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH24NEWKUMBLEa,https://www.thehindu.com/the-huddle/the-huddle-2020-immense-self-belief-the-hallmark-of-kumble/article30896493.ece
92,2020/02/23,The Huddle 2020 | Only a “a microscopic minority” protesting against CAA: BJP MP Tejaswi Surya,"The majority gave political capital to “fix civilisational problems” like Article 370, he says

BJP MP Tejaswi Surya termed the sedition law “a hangover of Victorian morality” like blasphemy and adultery laws and acknowledged it was being abused at the local police station level.

He called for a rethink “at both the police station and Parliament” regarding the use of law. He was speaking at The Huddle session “Tomorrow’s leaders: Youth as a force in Politics” on Sunday.

On the question of the government engaging with youth protesting against the CAA, 2019, he claimed Indian youth were not a monolith and termed those protesting “a microscopic minority” while a majority of youth had voted them in to do exactly what they were doing. He also said today’s youth were a “problem solving generation” that had given political capital to “fix civilisational problems” like Article 370 and the CAA, which were key issues.

However, this was countered by Ritesh Pandey, BSP MP, and Congress leader Nivedith Alva, who argued young leaders should look ahead and raise issues concerning youth like education, jobs and development. Mr. Alva said at least the young must “move beyond looking at politics from the prism of religion and caste”.

Mr. Pandey said there was a need for the youth to unite and launch a mass movement to hold the government accountable over jobs. Mr. Surya’s suggestion that the youth were probably not taking to streets as there was “employment generation happening” was met with laughter from the audience, even as moderator Palki Sharma, Executive Editor, WION, pointed out that unemployment levels were the highest in 45 years.

But are youngsters more successful today? “The youth are not necessarily voting the young. While a large chunk of the electorate is young, only 12% of members of Lok Sabha are younger than 40 years. For instance Kanhaiya Kumar was defeated. With hero worship and caste loyalties not going away, dynasty politics cannot be wished away,” Mr. Pandey said.

Mr. Surya said elections becoming “a very expensive affair” was also one of the entry barriers for youngsters to win and said introduction of electoral bonds was a step in the “right direction”, though this was objected to by others on the panel.

Mr. Pandey suggested state-funding of elections. But Mr. Alva argued that more youth, particularly at the panchayat level, are entering politics today. “Not everyone need to become MP or MLAs,” he said.",the huddle,https://www.thehindu.com/the-huddle/fxfx2e/article30896395.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH24MPS,https://www.thehindu.com/the-huddle/only-a-a-microscopic-minority-protesting-against-caa-bjp-mp-tejaswi-surya/article30896396.ece
93,2020/02/23,"The Huddle 2020 | Rise of strongmen changing conduct of foreign policy across nations, says Nirupama Rao","The discussion looked at the specific challenges that the institutions in democratic countries faced in dealing with the rise of strongmen leaders.

The rise of strongmen leaders in democracies not only challenges their domestic institutions but is also changing the way nations conduct foreign policy, former Foreign Secretary Nirupama Rao, said.

Speaking on Sunday at The Huddle, the annual thought conclave of The Hindu in Bengaluru, Ms. Rao said: “In foreign policy, muscularity has a certain premium today. What is happening is you are creating this ‘other’ that you somehow need to consolidate public sentiment against, and you see this happening in the foreign policy of many countries ruled today by so-called strongmen.”

The former Ambassador to the U.S. and China cited the example of American politics and the “othering” of Mexicans, for instance, by President Donald Trump, who, as a presidential candidate in June 2015, famously referred to some Mexican immigrants as “rapists”.

“What strongmen try to do is create ‘otherisation’ and create fear among the majority,” she said, noting it was creating “a whole [new] concept of how threat is being defined and how you deal with that threat”.

The session discussing the “Age of the Strongman” also included the South Asia correspondent of New York Times, Maria Abi-Habib, South Asia bureau chief of The Economist Max Rodenbeck, and Publisher of The Hindu Group of newspapers N. Ravi.

The discussion looked at the specific challenges that the institutions in democratic countries faced in dealing with the rise of strongmen leaders. Suhasini Haidar, Diplomatic Editor, The Hindu, who moderated the session, noted that it is a phenomenon seen in several populous democracies today including India, the U.S., Brazil and the Philippines.

That institutions even in the U.S., the world’s oldest democracy, were coming under strain despite some of the most robust checks and balances, underlined the challenge other countries faced in protecting their institutions when they come under stress, noted Ms. Rao.

Other trends that democracies with strongmen rulers were seeing included majoritarianism and pushing affirmative action for the majority which was “somehow being portrayed as being shortchanged by history”, a ‘mythification’ of history, and an accompanying vilification of a country’s past leadership, even those who played key roles in founding it, the former diplomat said.

The simultaneous rise of strongmen across the world did not have a singular explanation and was in some ways a coincidence, said Mr. Rodenbeck. “Sometimes we look too much on personalities and less on the specific conditions that made [their rise] possible, whether it was a vacuum, public anger, or technological change,” he said. The best balance, he suggested, was maintaining strong institutions.

Constitutional checks, however, work only to a limited degree, argued Mr. Ravi.

“Beyond that, you also need democratic norms to be followed, recognition of the opposition as equally legitimate, and restraint in using instruments of power. The best balance is to follow these unwritten rules and safeguards, as well as to have a diversity of States and political parties so that the writ of no one party runs across the country.”

An independent media and citizen journalists were an important check on strongmen leaders who seek to restrain opposing voices, according to Ms. Abi-Habib. “That is why one of the first things you see is [strongmen rulers] going after the media,” she said.

“Ultimately,” Ms. Rao said, “we have to create checks and balances in a democracy. Ultimately, you cannot appeal to the angels in us, because we are not angels.”",the huddle,https://www.thehindu.com/the-huddle/gfpgld/article30895925.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH24NIRUPAMARAO,https://www.thehindu.com/the-huddle/the-huddle-2020-rise-of-strongmen-changing-conduct-of-foreign-policy-across-nations-says-nirupama-rao/article30895926.ece
94,2020/02/23,"The Huddle 2020 | Regional integration pegged to SAARC revival, says Ranil Wickremesinghe","Former Sri Lankan premier calls for economic links between south India and Colombo

Successful regional integration — both economic and security — depends on the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) becoming fully functional at the highest levels, Sri Lanka’s former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.

Emphasising the need for countries in the region to link up both strategically and economically, Mr. Wickremesinghe said the postponement of the Kathmandu SAARC Summit in 2017 due to heightened tensions between India and Pakistan had brought the regional grouping “to a standstill”.

Read the full text of Ranil Wickremesinghe's keynote address

Urging the neighbours to iron out differences — including on cross-border terrorism — he said, “Otherwise you may find outsiders coming and telling [you] sort it out...not us in South Asia.”

“SAARC is deadlocked. While BIMSTEC is not a substitute for SAARC, it is, nevertheless a starting point for integration,” he said, in his keynote address at The Huddle, a two-day thought conclave organised by The Hindu in Bengaluru.

Integration road map

Proposing an ‘Economic Integration Road Map (EIRM)’, Mr. Wickremesinghe said it was important to conceptualise a “sub-region”, consisting of the five southern states of India, and Sri Lanka, to tap the total population of 300 million people and a combined GDP of over $500 billion.

Addressing para-tariffs and non-tariff barriers for successful regional integration, tapping e-commerce and enhancing tourism were crucial to such a road map, Mr. Wickremesinghe said.

“The Bay of Bengal is the largest bay in the world, dotted with famous cities and scenic beaches including the Andaman Islands and Phuket. Cruise tourism catering to millions of the emerging Asian middle classes, is a new commercial opening for the region,” he said.

The EIRM, he said, must not only be market-driven and but also be able to provide a deeper integration than the ASEAN-led RCEP ((Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership) agreement, Mr. Wickremesinghe said. “I would suggest that the negotiations for such an agreement be concluded in two years,” he added.

Deep-pocket diplomacy

Responding to a question from the audience, in a discussion moderated by The Hindu Group Publishing Chairman N. Ram, on Sri Lanka leasing out its southern Hambantota Port to China for 99 years, the former Premier spoke of his government then mulling options to deal with the debt on the project.

Mr. Wickremesinghe’s government, which rose to power in 2015, tried renegotiating the deal [that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had originally signed] with China, and President Xi Jinping “didn’t take a hard-line stand”.

In turn, the Sri Lankan government ensured that all security aspects were under its control. “We won’t allow our soil to be used for any action that is deemed to be hostile to India,” he told the audience, invoking instant applause. “I feel that the Chinese at the moment cannot bring their big ships [to our region]. It is basically very strong economic diplomacy that they are into, and it is a question of how to respond,” Mr. Wickremesinghe said.

India cannot respond unless it opens up, he observed. “If you want a deep pocket like China, you have to carry out these changes.”",the huddle,https://www.thehindu.com/the-huddle/41kx3p/article30895692.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23THRANIL1,https://www.thehindu.com/the-huddle/the-huddle-2020-regional-integration-pegged-to-saarc-revival-says-ranil-wickremesinghe/article30895693.ece
95,2020/02/23,"Parties in J&K can start political process, says Ram Madhav","BJP leader gives example of Indira Gandhi calling for elections at the end of the Emergency period

BJP general secretary Ram Madhav said the party was in favour of early restoration of political activity in Jammu and Kashmir and that despite the continued incarceration of top political leaders including three ex-Chief Ministers, political parties could start the process.

He was speaking at a session entitled “India’s Political Future: Looking at 2024 and Beyond” at The Hindu’s thought conclave, The Huddle, being held at the ITC Gardenia in Bengaluru. The session was moderated by Narayan Lakshman, Associate Editor at The Hindu.

Mr. Madhav said the release of the “remaining six to seven” top political leaders would only be possible after a security assessment favoured such an action, but said political activity could be restarted by other leaders of parties like the National Conference and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and that both had at least taken the decision (pending release of their top leaders) to start political activity at the district level. Significantly, he gave the example of late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi calling for elections at the end of the Emergency period, when almost the entire Opposition was in jail.

“At that time too people said how could the Opposition hope to fight elections when the leaders had been jailed, but the Opposition went on to win the polls,” he said. He said the Union Territory status for Jammu and Kashmir was a temporary measure and that statehood would be restored at some point.

NRC not in the pipeline

Answering a question from N. Ram, chairman of The Hindu Group Publishing Private Ltd., on the Citizenship Amendment Act and its linkages with the National Population Register (NPR) and an eventual National Register of Citizenship (NRC), Mr. Madhav said the NPR was a routine exercise agreed upon by all States. “No State government has the constitutional right to refuse to carry it out,” he said, adding however that States with specific issues with the questionnaire for the NPR could take it up with the Home Ministry.

A countrywide NRC, he said, had not been discussed at any level in the government and discussing it in the context of the CAA was not needed. “As and when it happens, all stakeholders will be consulted,” he said. He did not however clarify the status of Clause Six of the Assam Accord after the passage of the CAA. “The NRC in Assam was done under the aegis of the Supreme Court and was an unfinished business of the Assam Accord,” he said.

The BJP’s defeat in the Delhi Assembly polls, its fifth after the thumping Lok Sabha victory of 2019, said Mr. Madhav was a reflection that the electorate was looking at performance and confidence in leadership, something a challenge for current political parties. Citing the example of Odisha where the Assembly and the Lok Sabha polls were coterminous, he said it was most clearly demonstrated by the voting pattern that the BJP, which won eight Lok Sabha seats, had lost many of the Assembly seats within those very constituencies to the Biju Janata Dal (BJD). “This demonstrates the agility and vibrancy of Indian democracy and that it is safe, secure and vibrant.”

Ram Janmabhoomi Temple

Responding to questions about the Ayodhya verdict, Mr. Madhav said all parties, including the Babri Masjid Action Committee, had accepted the verdict and were ready to move on. He said Lord Ram and the Ramayana are “an integral part of the cultural ethos of not just India but entire Southeast Asia”.

The BJP leader said while enough efforts had been made to resolve the issue via mediation and failed under the premiership of late Prime Ministers Chandra Shekhar and P.V. Narasimha Rao, the verdict from the Supreme Court was accepted by all, and that there was “no need to reinvent the issue”.

On the eve of U.S. president Donald Trump’s visit, Mr. Madhav also answered questions on foreign policy and the eye-catching events planned including a civic reception at the Motera stadium in Gujarat.

“While by and large foreign policy is a continuum, Prime Minister Modi’s unique contribution has been his ability to strike good relationships with world leaders. “As for the civic reception for Mr. Trump in Gujarat, [late Prime Minister] Vajpayeeji called India and the U.S. natural allies, and Gujaratis in particular have a special connect with the U.S. and a civic reception of this kind by the people of Ahmedabad is an expression of that.”",the huddle,https://www.thehindu.com/the-huddle/7uz4dr/article30895526.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RamMadhav-Narayan,https://www.thehindu.com/the-huddle/parties-in-jk-can-start-political-process-says-ram-madhav/article30895527.ece

The fourth edition of The Huddle, The Hindu’s annual thought conclave, began at the ITC Gardenia in Bengaluru on Saturday. President Ram Nath Kovind inaugurated the event and Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa delivered the inaugural address.

The two-day event will feature 15 sessions and 32 speakers, showcasing some of the best minds from the world of politics, business, academics, sports, entertainment and the arts. The sessions are designed to be interactive, and they take place before an invited audience.

Here is the full text of his speech

Friends from media, ladies and Gentlemen,

It is indeed a great pleasure to be part of this coveted event, The Huddle, conversation about Change. I congratulate the Hindu group of Publications for organising such a meaningful, thought provoking program, which would give some new insight into the sustainable and overall development of the country and especially, our State of Karnataka.

It is also heartening to note that the Bangalore edition of The Hindu marks the 50th anniversary this March and hence this event is very special for all of us. I congratulate The Hindu on crossing the mile stone.

Karnataka is one of the foremost States in the country in terms of economy and development. With GSDP of 9.6 per cent during last year Karnataka is second state in the country to attract highest investments to the tune of Rs. 71,476 crore. Our Transparent Policy Initiatives are aimed at providing extensive support to new industries and entrepreneurs.

Today we have more than 20 policies for diverse sectors. Our Government is all set to announce a new industrial policy giving thrust on tier 2 and tier 3 cities in the State. I hope this would address the issue of imbalance in the development.

Karnataka, especially Bengaluru is known to be the IT capital of the country, recording highest software export in the country. We are also known as knowledge hub, start up capital of the country.

Niti Ayog has ranked us number one in promoting innovation and Our Government has set up Innovation Authority of Karnataka, adding one more feather to the cap.

Apart from economic growth, our Government is also focussed on enhancing the farmers’ income, providing good infrastructure facilities to Rural as well as urban areas and irrigation sector.

I am going to present my budget for 2020-21, which I aspire to reflect my vision of the overall development of the State.

We are very well aware of the regional imbalance in development and intend to address this issue by giving thrust on education, skill development, eradication of malnutrition, improving healthcare services along with the economic growth of these areas.

Our focus is also on providing good governance, bring in transparency and in improving the services we provide, with the help of technology.

But I believe, the programmes and the schemes of the Government would succeed with the active participation of people.

This conclave has interaction with who’s who of the various sectors, I hope this event would throw light upon various issues that needs to be addressed and we would take home some new thoughts and ideas.

I wish this conclave a great success and I thank the organisers for giving me the opportunity to address this august gathering.

Thank you.",the huddle,https://www.thehindu.com/the-huddle/tn996m/article30894799.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/yeddiyurappa,https://www.thehindu.com/the-huddle/karnataka-chief-minister-bs-yediyurappas-address-at-the-huddle/article30894806.ece
97,2020/02/23,Ranil Wickremesinghe's keynote address at The Huddle 2020,"Former Sri Lanka PM stressed on the India's role in South Asian politics.

Former Prime Minister of Sri Lanka Ranil Wickremesinghe opened the second day of The Huddle 2020, The Hindu’s annual thought conclave, at the ITC Gardenia in Bengaluru on Sunday.

The two-day event will feature 15 sessions and 32 speakers, showcasing some of the best minds from the world of politics, business, academics, sports, entertainment and the arts. The sessions are designed to be interactive, and they take place before an invited audience.

Here is the full text of his keynote speech.

Starting with the Mohenjo-dara Harappa civilization over 4 millennia ago, trade and commerce have played a decisive role in the integration of the Indian subcontinent and South East Asia. The Mauryan Empire became a catalyst for promoting regional trade. Buddhism removed the restriction on sea travel. Though kingdoms rose and fell, trade remained consistent. Political alliances were made and broken on the basis of trade. In the Ninth Century, the Pallavas came to an agreement with the Anuradhapura Kingdom in Sri Lankan and the Sumatran Sri Vijaya empire to control trading in the Bay of Bengal. This was challenged by their commercial rivals the Chola who defeated the Pallavas, the Sri Lankans, and finally Sri Vijaya.

With the traders, travelled the missionaries, taking with them the cultures, languages and religions of the Indian sub-continent including Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. During the time of the Buddha, Tapassu and Bhallika the first trader-converts to Buddhism carried the message of the new faith to Sri Lanka. Kaundinya, a Brahman, commenced the Indianisation of the Funan kingdom formed around the Mekong River in Southeast Asia. The proliferation of culture alongside trade led to the creation of robust networks. A good example of that was the multinational network of the Nattukottai Chettiars which spanned Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, and South Vietnam until the mid 20th Century. They had over 1500 businesses in Myanmar before World War II. The integrated financial network of the Nattukottai Chettiars has yet to be matched in the ASEAN and the BIMSTEC countries.

The total geographical extent of this region was never clearly defined. The South and the South East Asia are social constructs of recent origin – invented mainly by UK and USA. For instance, the World War II allies created the South East Asia Command (comprising Myanmar, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and Thailand) to better conduct the war in Asia.

The term South Asia was first used by the US State Department in 1950, to refer to former British colonies, in the Indian sub-continent. Thus arose the political construction of two regional groups which now dominates, and perhaps divides, the Bay of Bengal region.

The request for regional groupings in the region have emerged from time to time. Sixty years ago, the leaders of India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Myanmar and Indonesia met in April 1954 for the Colombo Powers meeting, to discuss cooperation within their common region.

Within the Indian sub-continent, an initiative for a regional grouping was first taken up by President Ziaur Rahman of Bangladesh in December 1977. I remember questioning President Jayewardene as to whether the proposed association will be a success. “If we can get India and Pakistan to the table, keep them talking - and avoid a war, that will be sufficient.” He replied.

Finally, the Heads of the 7 Governments of the sub-continent countries met in Dhaka in 1985 and formed SAARC – South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation. From this arose the South Asia Preferential Trade Agreement in 1995, followed by the South Asia Free Trade Agreement in 2006. However, you will agree with me, that neither of these agreements has resulted in a meaningful degree of economic integration. With an intra-regional trade amounting to only 5% of the total trade, today both agreements have been unsuccessful in promoting trade.

In 1997, India and Thailand took the initiative to form BIMSTEC – the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation. The first summit was held only in 2004 and subsequent summits held intermittently. BIMSTEC has neither a clear vision nor actionable goals. It took 10 years after the first summit to establish the BIMSTEC Secretariat, which is still underfunded. The BIMSTEC trade record on Economic Integration is also insignificant. An agreement in 2004 to conclude an FTA by 2006 is still pending.

On the other hand, South East Asia started a slow but successful march towards regional integration - starting with ASEAN – The Association of South East Asian Nations. The ASEAN Free Trade Area was established in 1992. The ultimate goal is an ASEAN Economic Community.

Thereafter, the broader constellation of the Asia Pacific Economic Community (APEC) was formed in 1989 consisting of 21-member economies including ASEAN, China, Japan, Republic of Korea, Australia, USA, Canada, Mexico and Chile to promote multilateralism and trade integration in the Asia Pacific.

The first Asia Pacific trade agreement, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership - one of the most transformational trade agreements with inter-locking commitments was signed by 11 of the Asia Pacific countries. Ratification by Singapore, Japan, Vietnam, Australia, New Zealand and Mexico has now activated the CPAPP.

The most recent agreement is the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) - an Asian-dominated trade agreement that brings together ASEAN, the 3 East Asian nations, as well as Australia and New Zealand. Though shallower than CPATPP, it enables China to join the non-American members of the CPATPP in a trade integration scheme. As a result of these successive agreements, tariffs have fallen substantially, and remain low; services in many sectors have been liberalized; and market access conditions substantially improved.

However, overarching all these groupings is the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which the HSBC has referred to as “Globalisations’ Next Chapter”. As you know, this China-centric multilateral globalisation framework promotes both physical and economic connectivity and thereby significantly increases the economic presence of the Chinese.

Current large-scale infrastructure projects funded under BRI in the South Asian region include 3 ports and the 3 Economic Corridors which connect China with Pakistan, with Nepal and with Myanmar. The BRI projects in our region will thus recast regional connectivity while giving China access to the Indian Ocean via Gwadar and Kyaukphyu ports. Parallel to the BRI are the Chinese Free Trade Agreements expanding Chinese economic partnerships beyond the RCEP.

Today the Asia-Pacific is the largest economically-integrated region in the world. A series of trade agreements covering four continents forms its integration architecture. These cover Australia, New Zealand, the whole of East Asia (other than North Korea), and the entirety of the America Pacific coast (excluding the USA). The BRI can be seen as dovetailing into the RCEP. What remains is for the USA to join the CPATPP - which is likely to happen within a decade.

These agreements also affect us, in the subcontinent. For example, the CPATT reduced tariff on apparel export between members. In particular, tariff reductions on items such as (1) Male trousers HS 620342 (2) Brassieres HS621210 may lead to exporters like Sri Lanka and Bangladesh losing their staple markets in Canada, Australia and Japan to Vietnam - a fellow member of CPATT.

Unfortunately for us, South Asia remains the least economically-assimilated region in Asia. And it faces a dilemma: to be connected or to be left out of these new and expanding Asia Pacific configurations of productivity and trade.

Effective integration in trade and security within our region gives us, the members, the ability to determine our architecture for the next few decades. As an integrated regional grouping we will have the strength to negotiate agreements favourable to us with the RCEP and other trade groupings.

We were the first to gain independence during the first phase of British decolonization. This, combined with our strategic location in the subcontinent enabled our nations to punch above our weight in the global fora.

Yet today, we are at the risk of being left out of this productivity network. No doubt, individual nations can bargain for admission to RCEP; but, becoming an appendage in that forum will mean the loss of voice and weight in this region. Moreover, our region will also lose its identity and the leading position amongst the Indian Ocean nations.

The consequences for India will be even greater - a loss of prestige and predominance - especially if BIMSTEC and SAARC loses its economic importance – and therefore its political relevance. If India loses its clout in this region, then it will be a critical setback to its aspirations for a global role. Therefore, all of us require an outcome which enables us to control our destiny. Consequently, Regional Economic and Security Integration continues to be the best option.

As noted earlier, our two regional groupings have hitherto made no headway. The postponement of the Kathmandu SAARC Summit in 2017 due to heightened Indo-Pakistan tension has brought SAARC to a standstill. But SAARC’s stagnation is not entirely due to the Uri terrorist attack. There have been similar periods of acrimonious relations between members previously. And these were not confined to India and Pakistan.

I believe that the core issue holding us back from a regional grouping is the inertia towards regional integration. We wish for trade agreements based solely on reducing tariff rates - without the required economic restructuring. This is an outlook starting from the Bombay Plan prepared by 8 leading industrialists in pre-Independent India in 1944. The plan was based on the premise that indigenous industries could not compete in a free market and 7 required government intervention. Hence the development of a supportive government economic bureaucracy. But nearly 80 years later, Indian companies themselves have proved this to be a false premise - by their ability to compete both in the domestic and export markets.

These inward-looking theories and political stances have led to South Asia has less than 1% of the net worth of the world’s total production of exports while South East Asia has 8%. You will agree that 1% is a figure that is not sufficient to sustain South Asian economic growth.

The growth in our countries are driven by domestic demand. Therefore, our imports far outstrip our exports leading to increasing trade deficits. It is doubtful as to whether this scenario is sustainable in a highly competitive world.

More to the point, an energetic growth scenario is required if the 150 million young people entering the job market in the region by 2030 are to be found employment. Therefore, in the medium term, we need to transit into exportled growth to galvanise regional economic development and dynamism.

It is worthwhile noting that IMF reports estimate a productivity boost of 20% over 20 years for India if it accelerates structural reforms including the elimination of trade and investments barrier. In such a scenario, the spill-over effect in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka will possibly see GDP increases by 3%. Furthermore, the total region would contribute 35% to global growth by 2040.

At least three recent reports by multilateral agencies have dealt exhaustively with the subject of integrating regional economies and making them competitive. These are (i) South Asia Ready for Take-Off - IMF (ii) A Glass Half Full – The Promise of Regional Trade in South Asia – World Bank and (iii) Exports Wanted – World Bank

As noted earlier, SAARC is deadlocked. While BIMSTEC is not a substitute for SAARC, it is, nevertheless a starting point for integration.

Furthermore, it has immense untapped potential. By 2030, the entire BIMSTEC population will exceed 1.7 billion. At present, BIMSTEC has 3.7% of global trade. The current intra-regional trade is US$ 40 billion. According to the report ‘Reinvigorating BIMSTEC’ by The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, it is estimated that the actual trade potential of regional integration by BIMSTEC countries could be US$ 250 billion. BIMSTEC also has the added advantage of being a bridge to ASEAN.

Unlike ASEAN, the BIMSTEC countries of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Thailand are asymmetrical to one another. No doubt, this could be construed as a hurdle to integration. The population, the land area and the GDP of India exceeds the combined equivalent of the other countries many times over. Furthermore, economic unevenness between members prevent the uniform restructuring that is required for genuine economic reintegration.

Therefore, if regional integration is to succeed in BIMSTEC, the initial effort should be confined to a core group of nations which have complementary economies - India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Thailand - which have a combined GDP of US$ 3.5 trillion. Having a deeper assimilation will not be disadvantageous to India. In 2018, India had a surplus of US$ 9 billion in the trading transactions with the other three partners. Therefore, a four-pronged Economic Integration Road Map (EIRM) is proposed below, to accelerate this integration.

First, it is imperative that the four countries come to grips with economic structural reforms. Traditionally, our countries have been averse to competition. In South Asia, the indexes for tariff and non-tariff barriers on imports are two to nine times higher than for imports from the rest of the world. Even the average of cost of trade within South Asia is much higher than the corresponding figure for ASEAN and NAFT/AMCTA. Therefore, any successful regional trade integration has to address the issues of para-tariffs and non-tariff barriers.

When our government came into power in 2015, Sri Lanka had over 6,000 tariffs line - effected by para-tariff. By 2018 we had eliminated over 2000 such tariff lines. Similarly, one third of the South Asian inter-regional trade is governed by a sensitive list which has to be reduced drastically.

Other pertinent issues to be addressed include those relating to Rules of Origin and the Norms of Value Addition, Anti-dumping Rules and countervailing measures for subsidies and common national regulations.

The removal of tariffs is a more complex process - needing the examination of adjustment costs vs. efficiency costs. In some sectors, domestic stakeholders will require time for adjustment. A series of Trade Adjustment Programmes must provide technical and financial assistance for any affected enterprises. These sectors can be held up until the end while trade-creating sectors and complementary sectors can be given priority to begin with.

Second, E-Commerce exceeds 10% of retail sales in many countries; yet it was below 2% in our region. Commercial Internet transactions have been identified as a fast growing sector in World Bank’s “Unleashing E-Commerce for South Asian Integration” a 3-stage regional strategy. It is a vital part of this initial Road Map so as to utilise its potential for regional integration.

Third, it may also be important to conceptualise an economic sub region consisting of the five Southern Indian states and Sri Lanka, which has a population of 300 million people and a combined GDP of over US$ 500 billion – more than Sweden.

An Economic sub region including a broad band corridor will optimise the complementarities accelerating regional economic integration. Kerala is building a new port near Trivandrum. An ADB funded feasibility study is proposing a further expansion of the Colombo Port with an extension to the North that can make it the largest trans-shipment port in the region. An Offshore Financial Centre is also planned for Colombo. Therefore, the proposed sub-region will be attractive for shipping, logistics, offshore finance, IT and for maximising on the opportunities of the global value chain. A similar sub region is currently being planned between India and Bangladesh. Coronavirus has 11 highlighted the need for a second “workshops of the world”. These two Economic Sub Regions together with Thailand are ideally suited for this purpose. Bangalore as an IT Centre will also enable the transition to the 4th Industrial Revolution.

The fourth leg of the four-pronged EIRM is Tourism – a sector which can animate the integration process.

The Bay of Bengal is the largest bay in the world, dotted with famous cities and scenic beaches including the Andaman Islands and Phuket. Cruise tourism catering to millions of the emerging Asian middle classes, is a new commercial opening for the region. The Bay of Bengal has the potential to rival both the Caribbean and the Mediterranean. Of course, the implementation of the Bay of Bengal Cruise Tourism will require detailed planning, financing and efficient coordination. In addition to BIMSTEC members, Maldives, Malaysia and Singapore are other cruise destinations, that must be invited to join such an initiative.

This EIRM must be, (i) market driven and (ii) able to provide a deeper integration than the RCEP. I would suggest that the negotiations for such an agreement be concluded in 2 years. If not, the talks should be abandoned - a signal in that we have failed.

If we are to succeed, a mechanism with the apex body meeting bi-annually, should be instituted with the mandate of preparing the EIRM. The apex body should consist of the Heads of Governments of the 4 participating countries, the 12 Secretary General of BIMSTEC and the high-level Head of EIRM Task Force consisting of Special Representatives appointed by member governments.

This apex mechanism will need to have a sunset clause leading to the dismantling of the mechanism on a specified date. By then, provisions will be made for a new permanent mechanism in charge of the EIRM.

Once the EIRM agreements are signed, it should then allow for other members of BIMSTEC and SAARC to become signatories to the agreements.

Expanding regional connectivity is a pre-requisite for the success of the EIRM. Conversely, it is anticipated that the enactment of EIRM would accelerate and cement the networks of regional connectivity.

Clearly, the pressing need for regional cooperation and connectivity, cannot be met by one single country or one single institution. We must also take note of the other connectivity enterprises in the region.

In addition to the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative, India herself has undertaken two ambitious connectivity projects as you know – the Kaladan Multimodal Transport Project and the India - Myanmar - Thailand Trilateral Highway.

Japan’s Quality Infrastructure Investment (QII) Partnership has also funded a number of projects including: (i) The East-West Economic Corridor (ii) The Thilawa and Dawei Special Economic Zone 13 (iii) The Bay of Bengal Industrial Growth Belt (iv) The Delhi-Mumbai and Chennai-Bangalore Industrial Corridors (v) The Mumbai-Ahmadabad High Speed Rail (vi) The Colombo Port Development.

The Asian Development Bank has also taken the initiative with the 10-year South Asia Sub-Regional Economic Cooperation Programme for infrastructure, which is anticipated to (a) strengthen multimodal cross border transport networks, (b) improve trade facilitation and (c) enhance electricity trading.

However, it must be recognised that the present BIMSTEC Secretariat is too bureaucratic, understaffed and not equipped for monitoring this type of undertakings. Therefore, the Secretariat will have to be restructured and upgraded with the Head of the Secretariat being equivalent to Ministerial level. The Secretariat could then be in a position to coordinate and fast-track the connectivity plans and projects within ‘BIMSTEC’.

There is no doubt that Asia’s huge appetite for connectivity and related infrastructure merges with the critical issue of Asian security. This has resulted in the polarization of two conceptualisations of security strategies for the Asian region.

One is centred on BRI, China’s Asia for Asians strategy and the PLA Far Sea Forces concept is based on a network of partnerships which is poised to tilt the balance of power in Asia.

The USA and its allies have responded to this with the Indo-Pacific and the Quad - in an attempt to safeguard the existing balance of power. Consequently, today, the Asia Pacific has to contend, somewhat paradoxically, with a security architecture linked to USA and an economic architecture involving China.

Unlike the Asia Pacific whose security structure has been based on military alliances, our region has avoided such alliances. Consequently, the security structure of the Asia Pacific cannot be duplicated in the Indian Ocean.

Moreover, there are difference of opinion as to the exact definition and demarcation of the Indo-Pacific. The US concept of the Indo-Pacific extend only up to the west coast of the Indian sub-continent. In contrast, our countries stand by the IORA definition of the Indian Ocean and envisage an Indo-Pacific starting from East Africa to the Pacific coast of the Americas.

When it comes to security, a major source of concern to the littoral states of the Indian Ocean is, the increasing presence of naval ships belonging to outside stakeholders.

The sea lines of communication in the Indian Ocean, the lifelines of global commerce, must be open for peaceful use. The Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, is advocating an open and inclusive Indo-Pacific.

Sri Lanka has taken the initiative in promoting a Code of Conduct on the Freedom of Navigation in the Indian Ocean based on UNCLOS – the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. We have also proposed the need to formulate an enforcement machinery. These proposals include the 15 safeguarding of undersea cables - a lifeline as vital as the sea lanes. The first 1.5 Diplomatic Track Meeting was held in Colombo on 11 October 2018.

On the whole, there is a need to avoid security polarization within our region. Security cooperation need to be based on agreed threats within the region rather than political posturing. The mounting multi-dimensional regional trade arising from economic integration should not be thwarted by war or other security disruptions.

Consequently, terrorism, piracy, human smuggling, narcotics and the presence of non-state actors are recognised as regional threats and have become the basis for security cooperation in the region.

Progress has already been made on security coordination in the Bay of Bengal. BIMSTEC members have agreed to cooperate on the BIMSTEC Convention on Cooperation in Combating International Terrorism, Transnational Organised Crime and Illicit Drug Trafficking and have established a joint working group. However, to become effective, BIMSTEC members must overcome their indifferences and ratify the convention in addition to the Convention on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters.

Maritime security has also been added to the agenda of the BIMSTEC National Security Chiefs annual meetings.

India has also hosted the first BIMSTEC Military Exercise on boosting inter operationality amongst intranational forces to contain terrorism.

Another security initiative – the Trilateral Maritime Security Cooperation between India, Sri Lanka and Maldives provide joint cooperation in patrolling the Exclusive Economic Zone and combating piracy. The Bay of Bengal littoral states have also participated in the MILAN Naval exercises hosted by the Indian Navy. The biennial Indian Ocean Naval symposium and the annual Galle Dialogue also provide opportunities for Navy chiefs of BIMSTEC and SAARC littoral states to discuss maritime security threats. At least, the building blocks for regional security in BIMSTEC are falling in to place.

Nevertheless, SAARC is not fully functional and will not be so until the summit meetings are held. Moreover, the Indo-Pakistan tensions have led to our region being identified as a possible site for nuclear conflict. This itself indicates the urgent necessity to restore normalcy. Hence the Indo-Pakistan disputes affecting the SAARC though a bilateral issue need to be resolved by the two countries at a level which permits the Summits to take place. This also requires solutions to the underlying issues of terrorism including cross border terrorism.

Here, we must reflect on how economic integration in the Asia and Pacific has acted as a disincentive for conflict. The outstanding issues are still retained 17 within the present architectures available. For example, our region should follow a similar approach.

Only regional integration both economic and security leading to a linkage with the existing Asia Pacific network will enable us to create rapid economic growth to escape the middle income trap and lead us to prosperity. This will also make us the first economically integrated region in the Indian Ocean. Hence we will be able to take leadership in promoting trade integration in the Indian Ocean and ensure security of the Sea Lines of Communications.

In conclusion then, let us be bold in conceptualising one vast global productivity and connectivity network - from East Africa to the shores of the Pacific region of the Americas.

We have the possibility of becoming the 4th global trading bloc and increasing our voice and weight in the global fora.

100,2020/02/23,Screening camp for cervical cancer held,"Cervical cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in India. A mother’s awareness about the symptoms and risk factors has an immense impact on her daughter’s knowledge and attitude towards the cancer, according to Dr. D. Leela, gynaecology oncologist of Homi Bhabha Cancer Hospital and Research Centre (HBCH&RC).

As key decision-makers, mothers play an important role in health interventions to promote both cervical cancer screening and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination, Dr. Leela said at an ongoing initiative for screening mother-daughter pairs of Visakha Vimala Vidyalayam at Pedagantyada here on Friday.

Women and their adolescent daughters were selected for screening as they form a target population at high risk of contracting cervical cancer.

The women, aged 30 years and above, were screened for breast and cervical cancer.

Their daughters, in the age group of 10 to 14 years, were given two doses of HPV vaccination, at an interval of six months while those above 15 were given three doses at 0, 2 and 6 month-intervals to protect them against HPV infection, thereby preventing cervical cancer, Dr. D. Leela said.

Dr. D.

102,2020/02/23,NHAI collects ₹20 crore from 18 lakh defaulters entering FASTag lanes,"Till now, a total number of 18 lakh vehicles defaulted by encroaching FASTag lanes across India has resulted in a double charge cash toll accumulation of about ₹20 crore, an NHAI statement said.

National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) on Sunday said it has collected ₹20 crore from 18 lakh defaulters who entered the FASTag lanes at electronic toll plazas on National Highways without the tag.

Rolling out the electronic toll collection programme across India in December, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways had said that double toll charge would be collected from the vehicles entering FASTag lanes without the tag.

In order to give prime importance to existing FASTag users, dissuade defaulters and further encourage adoption of FASTags by national highways commuters, vehicles without FASTags entering the FASTag lane are being charged double the toll fee, NHAI said in a statement.

Also read: How will the FASTag toll collection programme help cut delays and losses on India’s highways?

Till now, a total number of 18 lakh vehicles defaulted by encroaching FASTag lanes across India has resulted in a double charge cash toll accumulation of about ₹20 crore, it said.

RFID based FASTag, an electronic toll collection system implemented by the NHAI, has proved to be instrumental in easing the lives of commuters on national highways within two months of its nationwide implementation, it said.

Over 1.55 crore FASTags have been issued through multiple Point of Sale (PoS) locations.

NHAI has been observing increased sale rate of FASTags which is a clear indication of this digital system being accepted well, the statement said.

As a result, FASTag transaction has crossed a landmark count of 4 million per day, it added.

The statement said FASTag resulted in smooth and hassle-free movement of FASTag users on highways.

The implementation of FASTags across the country has met with the desired response so far, it said adding the adoption of FASTags also means that it has brought in the much-needed transparency in collection at toll booths.

In order to further increase digital collection of user fee via FASTag at national highways fee plazas, NHAI has recently waived off the FASTag cost of ₹100 for NHAI FASTag from February 15, 2020 to February 29, 2020.

103,2020/02/23,Parties got proportional share of time to raise issues in Rajya Sabha,"RS Secretariat readies MPs’ performance report

At the end of each Parliament session, a performance report detailing participation of all members should be prepared, Chairman Venkaiah Naidu has told the Rajya Sabha Secretariat, according to sources.

The first edition of the report analysing the MPs’ performance on party lines reportedly reveals that each political party got proportional share of time, with the Opposition getting a little more.

The BJP, with 82 members accounting for 34% of the strength of 239 of the House, got 480 opportunities amounting to 33% of the total. The Congress, with 46 members constituting 19% of the strength, got 345 opportunities which comes to 24% share of the total. The 10 recognised parties in the House with five members and above each with a total of 190 members — accounting for 80% of the strength of the Council — got about 81% of the total opportunities. Others, including regional parties and Independents amounting to 20% of the membership of the House, got 19% share of participation indicating broad correspondence between the strength and share of opportunities.

The RS Secretariat has come up with this analysis in the backdrop of the recently concluded Parliament session that was marked by acrimonious exchange between the Opposition parties and the Rajya Sabha Chairman. The Opposition parties had held a press conference decrying the Chairman’s decision to not allow a debate on the ongoing nationwide protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

The analysis shows that among the Opposition and non-NDA parties, the Congress, the Trinamool Congress, the AIADMK got proportionally higher opportunities while the BJD, the DMK, the TRS and the CPI(M) got their due share. Only the SP got a lesser share.

The Opposition is none too impressed with the numbers. Deputy Leader of the Opposition and Congress MP Anand Sharma said the Parliament in a democracy belonged to the Opposition as it was the only platform available for them to voice people’s issues and concerns. It can’t be a government-run House even if they are in a majority. “ It’s fair that we have had an opportunity to participate in debate and articulate our view, at the same time the House belongs to the Opposition in a democracy,” Mr. Sharma told The Hindu.

‘Not an indicator’

Rajya Sabha leader of Trinamool Congress Derek O’ Brien said time alone could not be the criteria of success of a session. The Trinamool is the third largest party in Rajya Sabha.

“It’s not about the time, it’s about the quality of the issues discussed. Parliament cannot be measured in minutes and hours, it has to be measured in the quality of subjects we take up. How many of the issues raised by the Opposition were allowed to be discussed by this government in Parliament?” Mr. O’ Brien questioned.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/a6jfka/article30825611.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH14NAIDU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/parties-got-proportional-share-of-time-to-raise-issues-in-rajya-sabha/article30897317.ece
104,2020/02/23,President Ram Nath Kovind lauds Supreme Court for pursuing gender justice,"With its verdicts, it has led a social transformation, says President

President Ram Nath Kovind on Sunday praised the judiciary for pursuing the “cherished goal of gender justice” and appreciated the Supreme Court for being always “pro-active and progressive”.

Delivering the valedictory address at the International Judicial Conference 2020-‘Judiciary and the Changing World’, he noted that the the Supreme Court had led a “progressive social transformation”. “In pursuing the cherished goal of gender justice, to mention one example, the Supreme Court of India has always been pro-active and progressive.”

“From issuing guidelines for preventing sexual harassment at the workplace two decades ago to providing directives for granting equal status to women in the Army this month, the Supreme Court of India has led a progressive social transformation,” he said.

The President expressed satisfaction with the court’s “extraordinary effort” to make its judgments more accessible to the common man by making them available in nine vernacular languages, keeping in mind the nation’s linguistic diversity.

Mr. Kovind referred to the judiciary’s role in harmonising environmental protection and sustainable development, as well as the challenges arising from the evolution of information technology and the emergence of such issues as data protection and right to privacy.

Besides landmark verdicts to strengthen the legal and constitutional framework, the Supreme Court’s Bench and Bar were known for their legal scholarship and intellectual wisdom, he said.

“The recent move towards an alternative dispute resolution mechanism is expected to reduce the burden on the court to a considerable extent,” he said. Indian courts were adopting new technologies, including artificial intelligence, to speed up justice delivery.

“I am sure that the deliberations of the conference will help to strengthen the judicial system not only in India but also in other countries,” he said.

Chief Justice of India S.A. Bobde referred to the positive outcome of the deliberations and pointed out that the common thread binding judges of various jurisdictions was “a commitment to dispensation of justice”.

He said the Supreme Court’s judgments were cited by courts of other countries and had served as a “beacon of hope” to independent and developing nations. He said the judiciary’s task was not only to check those in power but also to empower the deprived citizens.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/xtot3a/article30651543.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PTI1252020000086B,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/president-ram-nath-kovind-lauds-sc-for-pursuing-gender-justice/article30897301.ece
105,2020/02/23,Justice Arun Mishra draws flak for praising Prime Minister,"Concern over judicial impartiality

Several retired judges, senior lawyers and politicians have been sharply critical of sitting Supreme Court Judge Arun Mishra’s remarks at an event on Saturday, describing Prime Minister Narendra Modi as an “internationally acclaimed visionary” and a “versatile genius.” Terming his remarks sychophantic, atrocious and a threat to the independence of the apex court, some even called for him to recuse himself from all cases against the government.

‘Astonishing, atrocious’

“This is astonishing and atrocious, what this judge is doing,” former Supreme Court judge Justice A.P. Shah told The Hindu on Sunday. Another former Supreme Court judge Markandey Katju offered a sarcastic comment on Twitter, in Hindi. “Supreme Court ka judge kaisa ho? Arun Mishra jaisa ho,” he tweeted.

Some senior lawyers also expressed unease with the judge’s remarks. “J Misra has left no stone unturned in giving an impression that Indian higher judiciary has truly changed in the last 5 years. What a speech by a sitting judge,” said Rahul Mehra, a standing counsel for the Delhi government. Noting that Justice Mishra was all praise for the Prime Minister, Supreme Court lawyer Prashant Bhushan said, “Do you wonder why the SC is not protecting your rights?” Activist-musician T.M. Krishna echoed his concerns, tweeting: “Such public display of sycophancy and we still expect the Supreme Court to be fair and untainted! We are all fools.”

Congress leader Digvijaya Singh also worried about the judge’s impartiality. “Sorry to hear this comment from a sitting Judge of the Supreme Court. After this comment he should recuse himself from all cases against the Govt as the Petitioner stands no chance of Justice from him. Sad. I never expected him to make such a comment as a sitting Judge of SC,” he tweeted.

Former Navy chief Admiral Arun Prakash (Retd) noted that Justice Mishra’s comments went against what is expected of the judiciary. “Disappointing & very disturbing. The dignity, gravitas & detachment that people expect from serving judges of the country’s apex court require them to refrain from appearing obsequious to ANYONE in public,” he said.

Guha’s comparison

With U.S. President Donald Trump set to visit India on Monday, historian Ramachandra Guha contrasted the judge’s remarks with those of American judges. “If President Trump was to hear of what Justice Mishra said he’d be madly envious. He has more Twitter and Facebook followers than Prime Minister Modi, he gets to appoint his own Supreme Court Justices, and yet they don’t praise him in public in quite the same way,” he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/8yw201/article30897286.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23THDIGVIJAYASINGH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/justice-arun-mishra-draws-flak-for-praising-prime-minister/article30897287.ece
106,2020/02/23,India's export restrictions on medical items in line with WHO rules,"India has already evacuated around 640 Indians from Wuhan, the epicentre of COVID-19 outbreak, in two separate flights.

India has restricted export of certain medical items that are necessary for fighting the COVID-19 (coronavirus) crisis. Officials in New Delhi said the step is in line with the guidelines of the World Health Organisation (WHO) to combat the virus.

“Some restrictions have been imposed on the export of certain medical equipment in view of the fact that these items are in short supply here too,” said Raveesh Kumar Official Spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs.

India had made a one time exemption for export of the necessary items in view of China's needs, said the official. He also maintained that an aircraft carrying relief items are waiting to take the necessary material to China to help Beijing deal with the crisis.

With massive decorations and elaborate security arrangements, Ahmedabad is ready to welcome U.S. President Donald Trump, who will be attending ‘Namaste Trump’, a mega event at the cricket stadium.

He will make a brief halt at the Sabarmati Ashram and attend a roadshow from the airport to the stadium.

Playing host, Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani tweeted a video in which people from all languages spoke excitedly about the Trump visit, drawing a parallel between Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Make in India’ and Mr. Trump’s ‘Make America Great Again’ slogans. The video was aimed at showcasing India’s rich diversity.

Mr. Rupani said: “Entire Gujarat speaks in one voice-#NamasteTrump!”

Hours before the arrival of U.S. President Donald Trump for his first visit to India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said their joint rally in Ahmedabad’s Motera Stadium will be a “historic” event.

Mr. Trump will arrive in Ahmedabad just before noon on Monday at the start of a 36-hour visit that is expected to see the signing of several defence agreements and MoUs on homeland security, space and medical cooperation.

American officials have said Mr. Trump will raise the situation in Kashmir and the on-going protests over the Citizenship Amendment Act during talks.

“India looks forward to welcoming President Donald Trump. It is an honour that he will be with us tomorrow, starting with the historic programme in Ahmedabad,” said Mr. Modi in a tweet on Sunday.

The message echoed the earlier comment by Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani who also sent out a social media message welcoming the American head of state.

U.S. Ambassador Ken Juster also made a formal announcement on the visit, saying, “Big week coming up for the U.S.-India partnership.

“This is the first time any U.S. President will connect with the Indian people at large, an acknowledgement of the important space that people-to-people ties have played,” a senior official involved in the planning of the visit told The Hindu.

While this is the first such public rally in Ahmedabad, US President Dwight Eisenhower did address a joint rally with PM Jawaharlal Nehru at Delhi's Ramlila Grounds in 1959, which an estimated crowd of 5 lakh people had attended.

The Ministry of External Affairs brushed off suggestions that U.S. government statements on Kashmir and CAA as well as allegations that Indian negotiators had held up the trade deal expected to have been signed during the Trump visit.

An official said despite comments from a senior administration official that Mr. Trump would particularly raise “religious freedom” issues, as well as the trouble in trade ties, the important message was that “Mr. Trump is coming to India, one of the very few visits he will make in election year, accompanied by his closest family members, and reflects how strong India-U.S. ties are.”

President Trump will reach Ahmedabad and will begin his trip with a visit to the Sabarmati Ashram. He will then address the “Namaste Trump” event at the Motera stadium, accompanied by Prime Minister Modi. Thereafter, U.S. leader will leave for Agra’s Taj Mahal, where he is expected to be greeted by U.P. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. Mr Trump will then fly to Delhi later in the evening.

Mr. Modi will meet President Trump in the front lawns of Hyderabad House on Tuesday morning. This will be a continuation of a tradition that Mr Modi had attempted during President Barack Obama's visit in January 2019.

Both sides are expected to fast track the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA), to be discussed during defence talks in March. Once sealed, BECA, the third logistic agreement between the militaries, will ensure smooth flow of high end technology from the U.S. to India.

Apart from the strategic and military aspect, both sides are expected to take up trade relationship especially since President Trump himself has announced that he will seal a big trade deal with India later this year. There are Indian concerns about the agriculture and dairy sectors in such a scenario that are yet to be clarified by the officials.

Reflecting the trade interests, Director General of the Confederation of Indian Industries (CII) Chandrajit Banerjee emphasised on the “future growth sectors” and said, “We must build upon and consider new frontiers for business and trade.”

110,2020/02/23,Services finalising requirements for armed drones from the U.S.,"The proposal for 10 High Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) drones for each Service is on, defence sources said

As India and the U.S. look to announce defence deals worth around $3 billion during President Donald Trump’s visit beginning on Monday, the proposal to procure armed drones from the U.S. for the three services is very much under way and the qualitative requirements (QR) are currently being finalised, defence sources said.

Also Read US President Donald Trump leaves for maiden visit to India

“The proposal for 10 High Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) drones for each Service is on. The qualitative requirements (QR) are currently being finalised,” a defence source told The Hindu. “The pricing and availability (P&A) data has been obtained from the U.S. and joint QRs are being formulated, while the payloads will be different for each service,” the source added.

The Navy’s QRs are ready and that of the Army and the Air Force should be ready by the next meeting of the Chiefs of Staff Committee (CoSC), likely within 40 days, the source said.

The CoSC consists of the three chiefs and is headed by the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), who is also the permanent Chairman of CoSC.

This week during Mr. Trump’s visit to New Delhi, the two sides are expected to announce deals for 24 MH-60R Multi-Role Helicopters for the Navy and six AH-64E Apache attack helicopters for the Army worth around $3 billion. The two deals got the final approval from the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) last week. There are several other big ticket deals in the pipeline, which includes the armed drones, air defence system to protect Delhi, MK-45 127mm naval guns and six more P-8I long patrol maritime patrol aircraft.

The issue of procuring armed drones from the U.S.— the MQ-9 Reaper or Predator-B built by General Atomics — has been long under discussion, with questions being raised over its necessity given the steep cost and also the operational requirement in the Indian context. With a vast ocean space to monitor and increasing profile in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR), the Navy has been the one pushing for High Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) drones to beef up surveillance.

“There is a drive towards fleet rationalisation,” a Navy source said, adding that they are at a point where in place of manned platforms they should look at unmanned ones. “As we look at unmanned platforms, the number of minesweepers has been reduced from 12 to eight and requirement for additional P-8Is has been reduced from 10 to six, the Navy source explained.

The HALE drones can conduct surveillance, while the P-8Is will be for Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) role, the source stated, adding that the Navy is looking for Seaguardian drones armed with missile and radars for maritime reconnaissance.

“If the process goes as per plan, then we expect to issue the Acceptance of Necessity (AoN) by first half of this year,” another source said. The U.S. has in principle approved the sale of these armed drones to India following which the P&A data was made available.

Expensive platforms

For the Navy, the Seaguardian can fly in sync with its P-8Is, which are also from the U.S. With India signing the Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement(COMCASA) in 2018, U.S. origin platforms will also get encrypted systems which will further improve their capabilities. The unmanned platforms reduce the number of personnel, their turnaround and associated costs, officials said.

While the Navy has a different requirement, there have been questions on the need of armed drones for the Army and the IAF due to which the deal has been delayed for a long time. Each drone with its load of weapons and sensors is expected to cost around $200 million. “It is more expensive than a fighter aircraft,” a defence source said.

According to General Atomics, Seaguardian, the maritime variant of Predator-B, can fly at an altitude of over 40,000 feet and has a maximum endurance of 35 hours. It can carry an external payload of 2.1 tonnes across nine hard points.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/w0duxn/article30896975.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH2424MH-60RMULTI-ROLEHELICOPTERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/services-finalising-requirements-for-armed-drones-from-the-us/article30896976.ece

With the hearing pertaining to Shaheen Bagh likely to come up before the Supreme Court on Monday, women who have been on a sit-in since December 16, said they are not willing to vacate the protest site till the Citizenship (Amendment) Act is revoked by the Centre.

While one of the several routes blocked was opened by authorities on Saturday for traffic after several rounds of meetings between the demonstrators and mediators, protesters maintained that the route was never barricaded by protesters in the first place.

“People are saying that Shaheen Bagh protesters have opened the road towards Kalindi Kunj. But we never blocked it in the first place. The barricades over there were put by the police just like they have blocked other roads. We have been blocking only one stretch which is where the women are sitting. So how can we open a road which we haven’t even closed?” said Prakash Devi, one of the protesters.

When they came for a second time, they went for an inspection and saw how the barricades were not put by us. In fact, we are ensuring that we allow ambulances and school buses to pass through this particular stretch so that no hindrance is caused to them.”

114,2020/02/23,"COVID-19 likely to push air travellers to Europe, West Asia, say experts","They will benefit from discounts as airlines are redeploying capacity withdrawn from routes to China, say experts

Those planning international trips in the immediate future are likely to benefit from discounts for travel to European and West Asian destinations as airlines redeploy capacity withdrawn from routes to China, according to airlines and aviation experts.

Air India and IndiGo have announced that they were extending the suspension of their flights to Shanghai, Hong Kong, Guangzhou and Chengdu into June. SpiceJet's suspension of service to Hong Kong is in place until February 27. This means airlines have surplus aircraft that need to be redeployed on other routes.

“Whatever aircraft get freed up will be deployed elsewhere. These will be mostly on domestic routes but we are also trying to put them on international routes such as Abu Dhabi, but are yet to start selling them”, said a senior Air India official.

Slump in demand

When asked whether there was a spurt in demand for destinations in the Middle East, he said there was a general slump in demand for international travel.

Another airline executive said: “While we will gain in destinations in West Asia and Europe, that will not be enough to make up for weakness on routes to South East Asia.” He added that routes to China were doing very well before airlines had to suspend them. This is despite the fact the China accounts for less than 2% of international seat capacity for Indian airlines.

This shifting of airline capacity in a season that traditionally sees poor demand means passengers may benefit from discounts for destinations such as Abu Dhabi, Dubai, and Turkey.

“We have seen a 20-25% year-on-year increase in search queries to travel to Amsterdam, London, Zurich, Rome, Prague and Budapest from Chennai, Bangalore and Hyderabad this year”, according to Aloke Bajpai, Co-founder of ixigo.

“Capacity to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates is up. Seats to Saudi Arabia have grown 35% in Q4 of the current fiscal, as compared to the same period last financial year. Overall, the international market has grown capacity by 3%. However, the real test will be to see the passenger numbers for January once they are available”, Lewis Burroughs, analyst at aviation consultancy ICF told The Hindu.

If the spread of COVID-19 is not curtailed, key markets such as Thailand and Singapore may see further capacity cuts at which point airlines will see a much severe impact on revenue as they will struggle to redeploy capacity, cautioned Mr. Burroughs.

Traffic demand into India may also see a fall.

“There will be a drastic drop in Chinese outbound tourists to European and other Asian tourist hot spots. There is a high possibility of European travellers changing their vacation destinations from Asia to Europe. This trend was observed by European carriers during past outbreaks such as SARS and bird flu”, said Abhilash Varkey Abraham, Research Analyst, Aerospace & Defense Practice, Frost & Sullivan.

Apart from the hit on passenger revenue, airlines could also be impacted by delay in aircraft deliveries, as China is a key supplier of multiple aircraft components used across Airbus family of aircraft, explains Mr. Abraham.

Airbus’ completion center for its A320 and A330 models in Tianjin was closed for a short period. IndiGo is the biggest customer globally of Airbus A320 neo family of aircraft. French aviation giant Safran, which supplies engines, avionics, safety and landing systems has also closed all of its manufacturing facilities across more than 20 Chinese cities.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/dvejt8/article30896752.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH23SHANGHAI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/covid-19-likely-to-push-air-travellers-to-europe-west-asia-say-experts/article30896753.ece

116,2020/02/23,Over 10 lakh Kashmir students to don school uniforms after seven months,"Schools reopen on Monday after remaining closed since August 2019

Over 10 lakh students of the Kashmir Valley will don their school uniforms for the first time in seven months, as schools will reopen on Monday after a three-month-long winter break and a seven-month-long disruption in the wake of the Centre’s decision to end Jammu & Kashmir’s special status in August last year.

Daneen Shah, a Class VII student of the Kashmir Valley School, Humhama, is excited, and said: “I wore my uniform on August 3, 2019 last. Since then, I visited my school without uniform, either to pick up e-assignments or submit assignments to qualify for examinations. It will be after a long, long time that I will sit with my friends to study again.”

Gripped by uncertainty

The uncertainty that gripped J&K forced hundreds of Valley schools to shut classes and stop bus services in the absence of communication services and the fear of street clashes. The J&K administration did try to re-start class work in phases from October last year, but failed to see a healthy attendance due to tension on the streets.

“Like other schools, we directed our students too to appear for the final examination in November last year without wearing uniforms. We did not want any trouble for the students,” said Rukhsan-ul-Nisa Qureshi, vice principal of the S.S. Islamia High School, located in Srinagar’s Malaratta area.

“Students visiting the campus again in uniform will be a good omen for the education sector. No society can compromise with the education of their kids. There can’t be anything more regressive than denying education to students. We pray the Internet is restored and access to all websites is allowed again so that Kashmir’s children have equal access to the knowledge available online,” said Ms. Qureshi.

Internet needed

Several teachers pointed out that the lack of high-speed Internet remained an area of concern. “From organising smart classes to alerting parents of students in closed WhatsApp groups to posting assignments on Facebook pages, the lack of full access to Internet will hamper teaching tools as well as the teacher-parent link,” she added.

All social media platforms, fast emerging as a major tool for school administrations across the world, remain banned in J&K.

‘Arrangements made’

“All arrangements have been put in place to restart the session. Teachers have been directed to work with dedication for building capacities of students for the betterment of their future.

Congress leader Shatrughan Sinha on Sunday rejected Pakistan President Arif Alvi’s claim that the actor-turned-politician “endorsed” his concerns over the restrictions in Jammu and Kashmir imposed after India revoked its special status.

Mr. Sinha, 74, who was on a “personal” visit to Pakistan to attend a wedding there, met President Alvi after receiving a “surprise” invitation from him at the Governor’s House in Lahore on Saturday.

“We were very touched by this gesture of the President of Pakistan and we reciprocated it with love, warmth, thanksgiving and an attitude of gratitude. I had attended the Honorable President’s son’s wedding a few years back in Karachi, so I have known the family very well,” Mr. Sinha said in a tweet.

Terming it a “great meeting of minds”, Mr. Sinha said they discussed social and cultural issues but not politics.

”...Though the meeting lasted for quite some time, it was purely social, personal and purely a courtesy call to give profound regards. We discussed so many things on social and cultural issues but no politics was discussed,” he said.

“Nothing political or official about it. My friends, well-wishers and supporters and of course the media should realise that one shouldn’t discuss the politics or policies of countries on foreign soil when one isn’t competent, qualified & authorised by the Govt,” he said.

Mr. Sinha’s remarks came after Alvi’s office said in a tweet that Mr. Sinha had “endorsed” concern of the Pakistan President over the “lockdown” in Kashmir, following the Indian government’s August 5 decision to abrogate Article 370 of the Constitution and bifurcate the state into two union territories.

The maiden visit to India is expected to significantly ramp up bilateral defence and strategic ties but unlikely to produce tangible outcome in resolving thorny issues like trade tariffs.

The nearly 36-hour-long visit by Mr. Trump is also set to send across a clear message of growing congruence of interests on major geopolitical developments in the region and beyond, particularly when China has been expanding its military might and economic clout.

Mr. Trump, who is seeking re-election in the US presidential elections in November, will arrive on Monday around noon in Ahmedabad in Prime Minister Modi’s home state of Gujarat.

Prime Minister Modi is expected to receive him at the airport.

Hundreds of thousands of people are expected to greet Mr. Trump in a massive road show in Ahmedabad before he arrives at the newly-built Motera cricket stadium, which has a capacity of over 1,00,000 people, for the ‘Namaste Trump’ event.

‘Namaste Trump’ will be similar to the landmark ‘Howdy, Modi!’ event hosted by the Indian-American community in honour of Prime Minister Modi during his visit to Houston in September 2019.

From Ahmedabad, the US president will travel to Agra to have a glimpse of the iconic Taj Mahal. The Trump family will spend about an hour at the Taj Mahal before sunset. Then they will leave for Delhi for the main leg of the visit.

On the morning of February 25, Mr. Trump and the First Lady would be accorded a ceremonial welcome at the forecourt of the Rashtrapati Bhavan.

From there, they would go to Rajghat to pay homage at the ‘samadhi’ of Mahatma Gandhi.

It would be followed by restricted and delegation-level talks between Mr. Trump and Mr. Modi at Hyderabad House. Prime Minister Modi would host a lunch for the US president following the bilateral talks.

In the afternoon, Mr. Trump is expected to attend certain private events at the US Embassy, including a roundtable with industry representatives.

In the evening, the US president will meet President Ram Nath Kovind at the Rashtrapati Bhavan.

A banquet will be hosted by Mr. Kovind. President Trump would depart from India later that evening.

In their talks on Tuesday, Mr. Trump and Mr. Modi are likely to focus on a wide variety of bilateral and regional issues including trade and investment, defence and security, counter-terrorism, energy security, religious freedom, proposed peace deal with Taliban in Afghanistan and situation in the Indo-Pacific, according to Indian and US officials.

Mr. Trump’s visit to India comes at a time when the country has been witnessing wide-spread protests against a new citizenship law and strain in New Delhi’s ties with Islamabad over the Kashmir issue.

The visiting American delegation includes Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette, Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and National Security Advisor Robert O’ Brien.

Senior advisors to the President Stephen Miller, Dan Scavino, Chief of Staff to the First Lady Lindsay Reynolds, Assistant to the President and Special Representative for International Telecommunication Policy and Senior Advisor to the Chief of Staff Robert Blair, and White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham are the other members of the delegation.

119,2020/02/23,"Police barricaded many roads with no link to Shaheen Bagh protests, says former CIC","Focus should be on who is the power behind it, ex-CIC tells Supreme Court

The police have barricaded a number of roads with no connection to the peaceful protests at Shaheen Bagh against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, former Central Information Commissioner and former Chairperson of the National Commission for Minorities Wajahat Habibullah said in his ground report to the Supreme Court.

“Shaheen Bagh stands tall as a firm example of a peaceful, dignified dissent, more so, in the face of various instances of State-sponsored violence on similar dissents across India. We have been sad and mute witnesses to police brutality and negative typecasting of a particular community across the country. Crushing dissent instead of entering into a dialogue is the new norm, but it is alien to our Constitution,” Mr. Habibullah said in an affidavit.

Mr. Habibullah said focus should be on who was the power behind blocking these arterial and parallel roads. It is these unnecessary blockades of thoroughfares by the police which has led to a chaotic situation. Why does the police block roads in and around Shaheen Bagh, rather than regulate traffic to avert chaos?

Thousands of accesses in Delhi are blocked by residents of various colonies and by the privileged and the powerful, but the police take no action against them.

The Supreme Court had recently reached out to the protesters, asking them if they could move their agitation to an alternative site to free traffic flow. The court had upheld their right to protest but said it should not inconvenience public movement. It had appointed interlocutors, senior advocate Sanjay Hegde and advocate Sadhana Ramachandran, to talk with the protesters. Though Mr. Habibullah is an intervenor in the case, the court had agreed to a suggestion made by his counsel to ask him to engage in a dialogue with the protesters.

Mr. Habibullah’s affidavit, filed in the Supreme Court, details what he saw at the protest site during his visit on February 19.

Mr. Habibullah said the protesters are a strongly bonded community of people from all faiths. They are composed of children, women, middle-aged and the old who have faced “blatant threats” to their lives, been shot at and abused as “anti-national and Pakistanis” for expressing their united dissent against the CAA-NPR-NRC. He described the protest ‘iconic’.

The affidavit said the protesters wanted to convey to the Supreme Court that they are terrified that the CAA would sound the death-knell for the survival and existence of their future generations.

They said the intentions voiced by those in power through the CAA-NPR-NRC has “struck deep fear into the hearts of many poor and underprivileged citizens of India”.

120,2020/02/23,Book on BJP to become part of curriculum in Indonesia’s Islamic University,"The book will become a part of the syllabus for undergraduate students of South Asian studies in the Department of International Relations

A book on the history of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will become a part of a course in the Islamic University of Indonesia, as the party’s two consecutive victories in India’s general elections has evoked interest among academicians, a faculty member said.

The book, titled Bhartiya Janata Party — Past, Present & Future, Story of World’s Largest Political Party and written by Shantanu Gupta, will become a part of the syllabus for undergraduate students of South Asian studies in the Department of International Relations.

Hadza Min Fadhli, a faculty member at the university, said there was a rising interest in the BJP’s rise among academicians in Indonesia, especially after the party won two general elections in India.

He said the book would be part of the syllabus for undergraduate courses in South Asian studies in the Department of International Relations.

Mr. Hadza said he got to know about the book during a recent visit to India as part of the Kautilya Fellowship programme, organised by the India Foundation. “We in Indonesia intend to further strengthen our relations with India. Therefore, it is important to understand its ruling party. We expect the BJP would also intend to do the same,” Mr. Hadza said.

When asked about the book being selected to be a part of a course in an Indonesian university, Mr. Gupta said global recognition of his work is immensely satisfying.

This book chronicles the history of the BJP which, Mr. Gupta said, described the saffron party as the latest political manifestation of the various nationalist movements that the country has seen.

Mr. Gupta has authored five other books, including a biography of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and a book on football in India.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/book-on-bjp-to-become-part-of-curriculum-in-indonesias-islamic-university/article30895706.ece
121,2020/02/23,Chhattisgarh govt may bring anti-CAA resolution in budget session,"In a cabinet meeting held on January 30 here, the state government decided to request the Centre to repeal the CAA

The Congress government in Chhattisgarh might bring a resolution against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in the budget session of the state Legislative Assembly beginning on February 24.

In a cabinet meeting held on January 30 here, the state government decided to request the Centre to repeal the CAA in view of protests to the new citizenship law.

Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel had even written a letter to this effect to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

During the budget session of the Assembly, the state government is likely to table an anti-CAA resolution, parliamentary affairs minister Ravindra Choubey had said.

Governments of Kerala, Punjab, West Bengal and Rajasthan had already adopted resolutions against the CAA, which provides Indian citizenship to non-Muslim migrants from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh.

Meanwhile, the opposition BJP on Sunday said that it would raise issues concerning farmers as well as the “failure” of the state government in fulfilling the poll promises during the session.

Governor Anusuiya Uikey will address the House on the first day of the session.

The session will conclude on April 1 and will have 22 sittings.

“The BJP would raise issues like the alleged irregularities in procurement of paddy from farmers and alleged lathicharge on farmers by police early this week in Kondagaon district,” a BJP leader said.

He said the opposition party would also highlight the ruling Congress’ “failure” to fulfill electoral promises like providing employment to youths and ban liquor.

“Farmers are bearing the brunt of the poor paddy procurement policy of the state government. Due to the loopholes in the entire process, several farmers could not sell their produce before the procurement date on February 20,” he said, adding that the issue of deteriorating law and order would also be raised.

The exact date for tabling the state Budget for FY 2020-21 is yet to be officially announced.

However, official sources have informed that the budget is likely to be presented by chief minister Bhupesh Baghel, who also holds Finance portfolio, either on February 28 or 29.

In the 90-member House, the Congress has 69 MLAs, followed by the BJP (14), the Janata Congress Chhattisgarh (J) 5, and the BSP (2).",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/hd91t3/article30895649.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BHUPESHBAGHEL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/chhattisgarh-govt-may-bring-anti-caa-resolution-in-budget-session/article30895651.ece
122,2020/02/23,"No single country is adequately protecting children’s health, future: report","They face existential threats from climate change and commercial pressures, say experts

No single country is adequately protecting children’s health, their environment and their future, according to a recently released report by a Commission of more than 40 child and adolescent health experts from around the world. The Commission was convened by the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF and The Lancet.

The report, “A Future for the World’s Children?’’ finds that the health and future of every child and adolescent worldwide is under immediate threat from ecological degradation, climate change and exploitative marketing practices that push heavily processed fast food, sugary drinks, alcohol and tobacco at them.

The index shows that children in Norway, the Republic of Korea and the Netherlands have the best chance at survival and well-being, while children in the Central African Republic, Chad, Somalia, Niger and Mali face the worst odds.

In the report assessing the capacity of 180 countries, India stands 77th (sustainability index) and is at 131st on a ranking that measures the best chance at survival and well-being for children.

The report says India has improved in health and sanitation but has to increase its spending on health. It also cautions that world-wide the number of obese children and adolescents has increased from 11 million in 1975 to 124 million in 2016 — an 11-fold increase, with dire individual and societal costs.

“Despite improvements in child and adolescent health over the past 20 years, progress has stalled and is set to reverse,” said co-chiar of the Commission, Helen Clark, adding that it has been estimated that around 250 million children under five in low- and middle-income countries are at risk of not reaching their developmental potential, based on proxy measures of stunting and poverty. But of even greater concern, every child worldwide now faces existential threats from climate change and commercial pressures.

“Countries need to overhaul their approach to child and adolescent health, to ensure that we not only look after our children today but protect the world they will inherit,” she said.

According to the report, while the poorest countries need to do more to support their children’s ability to live healthy lives, excessive carbon emissions — disproportionately from wealthier countries — threaten the future of all children. If global warming exceeds 4°C by 2100 in line with current projections, this would lead to devastating health consequences for children, due to rising ocean levels, heatwaves, proliferation of diseases like malaria and dengue and malnutrition.

“More than 2 billion people live in countries where development is hampered by humanitarian crises, conflicts and natural disasters, problems increasingly linked with climate change,” said Minister Awa, co-chair of the Commission. “While some of the poorest countries have among the lowest CO2 emissions, many are exposed to the harshest impacts of a rapidly changing climate. Promoting better conditions today for children to survive and thrive nationally does not have to come at the cost of eroding children’s future globally.”

The only countries on track to beat the CO2 emission per capita targets by 2030, while also performing fairly (within the top 70) on child flourishing measures are: Albania, Armenia, Grenada, Jordan, Moldova, Sri Lanka, Tunisia, Uruguay and Vietnam.

“This report shows that the world’s decision makers are, too often, failing today’s children and youth: failing to protect their health, failing to protect their rights and failing to protect their planet,” said Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organisation said. “This must be a wakeup call for countries to invest in child health and development, ensure their voices are heard, protect their rights, and build a future that is fit for children,” he added.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/i96gsd/article29899946.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11THLTGRETATHUNBERG-YOUTHPROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/no-single-country-is-adequately-protecting-childrens-health-future-report/article30895539.ece
123,2020/02/23,Growing perception that Congress ‘adrift’; party must resolve leadership issue for revival: Shashi Tharoor,"“The immediate cause of worry for many of us is that there appears to be a growing perception in the eyes of the public that we, as a political entity, are adrift,” says Shashi Tharoor

The Congress must fix its leadership issues on top priority to address the growing perception among the people that the party is “adrift”, senior leader Shashi Tharoor said on February 23 and asserted that resolving the uncertainty over a long-term president was crucial for the party’s revival.

In an interview to PTI, Mr. Tharoor also said that it was up to Rahul Gandhi to take a call if he wishes to return as Congress chief, but if he does not change his earlier stance then the party needs to find an “active and full-time leadership” so that the party can move forward as the nation expects.

The Thiruvananthapuram MP, who last week renewed his call for elections for the Congress Working Committee (CWC), said the process of electing some members of the party’s highest decision-making body will usher in a dynamic leadership team with a credible mandate to work together to address the organisational challenges.

Asserting that the Congress is the indispensable national alternative to the “divisive policies” of the BJP, Mr. Tharoor said, “The immediate cause of worry for many of us is that there appears to be a growing perception in the eyes of the public that we, as a political entity, are adrift.”

This is naturally driving some voters towards considering other political options and the most recent example of this was seen in Delhi, where the voters chose to side primarily with the AAP and to a smaller extent with the BJP, leaving the Congress with naught, he said.

“This is where the compelling case for urgently addressing this perception in the eyes of the public comes from — and for that matter, changing the attitude of the media, which is repeatedly writing us off dismissively,” Mr. Tharoor said.

“But for us to do so, we do need to fix our current leadership issues. We need to start with a longer-term, as opposed to interim, Congress president, as well as the ‘elected’ membership of the Working Committee,” the former Union Minister said.

Mr. Tharoor said he is an advocate for free and transparent elections within the party for these positions as such a process would significantly add to their credibility and legitimacy.

The CWC found an excellent interim solution in Sonia Gandhi, but the party cannot indefinitely keep depending on and burdening a president who had only just relinquished the job less than two years ago, he said, adding that it is neither fair to her, nor to the voters.

He also said the repeated question of ‘Gandhi or non-Gandhi’ as party president was “missing the wood for the trees”.

“The larger concern and the need of the hour is to find a new president and leadership, and I am confident that if we do so through a participatory, transparent and democratic electoral process internally, the workers will at the end of the day throw their might and energy behind whoever emerges as the winning candidate,” he said.

Asked if the problem remains that of “who will bell the cat” and raise leadership issues with the Gandhi family, Mr. Tharoor said, “I don’t think the issue at hand is specifically about not being able to raise these concerns with members of the Gandhi family.”

“It is of critical importance that we delay no further and work together to move forward. Resolving the uncertainty about long-term leadership is an indispensable aspect of our process of revival. It must be given foremost priority,” Mr. Tharoor said.

Talking about the party’s conundrum over whether to convince Mr. Rahul Gandhi to come back or move on, Mr. Tharoor said Mr. Rahul Gandhi will always hold a special place at the core of the party and the rank and file of the party are pretty unanimous in their belief that he has the vision to rally the party together and take it forward.

“This is why most of us were keen for him to continue and stay on in this role after the elections, because while we respected his desire to publicly offer accountability for our defeat, we still felt that there is no one better to ensure the much needed process of revival that is needed for the party,” he said.

At the end of the day, just as his resignation was a personal decision, the question of his return is one as well, he said.

Pitching for election of CWC members, Mr. Tharoor pointed out there are three categories of members — elected members, permanent invitees and special invitees.

“All three are currently named by the high command, but I believe it would be healthy for the party if the ‘elected members’ were actually elected,” he said.

Mr. Tharoor hoped that those who are currently against the idea of elections for CWC recognise that a participatory electoral process, which channels the wishes of the members of the AICC plus PCC delegates — some 10,000 workers in all — is an exercise in inner-party democracy that will strengthen the party.

It could also have other beneficial effects such as increasing the national interest in the party, he said.

Asked if Mr. Rahul Gandhi is not convinced on coming back as chief should Priyanka Gandhi Vadra take on the leadership role, Mr. Tharoor said he was neither for nor against any Congress leader who might want to put their name forward.

“I certainly hope that she will throw her name in the ring when the call for elections for the post of party president are officially declared,” Mr. Tharoor said.

Ms. Vadra has a natural charisma and also comes with organisational experience, he said.

“But at the end of the day this will be her personal decision and we must respect that,” he said.

Mr. Tharoor had backed Sandeep Dikshit last week in asserting that the leadership issue needs to be laid to rest immediately.

U.S. President Donald Trump will visit Sabarmati Ashram in Ahmedabad on Monday before heading towards a cricket stadium where he will address over 1,00,000 people.

Sabarmati Ashram was a key base of Mahatma Gandhi during the freedom struggle. He lived there between 1917 and 1930.

Official sources confirmed to PTI that Mr. Trump will spend some time in the Sabarmati Ashram before heading towards the Motera stadium to participate in the ‘Namaste Trump’ event.

There was confusion over whether Mr. Trump will visit Sabarmati Ashram or not.

Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik on February 23 filed nomination papers seeking his re- election as the BJD president — the post he had been holding since the regional outfit was formed on December 26, 1997.

Accompanied by senior leaders, MPs and MLAs, Mr. Patnaik arrived at the State headquarters of the Biju Janata Dal, a party he founded and named after former CM and his father Biju Patnaik, and submitted papers before returning officer P.K. Deb for the February 26 elections, party sources said.

130,2020/02/23,President Kovind hails efforts of judiciary in pursuing goal of gender justice,"Speaking at the International Judicial Conference 2020 - ‘Judiciary and the Changing World’, the President said the apex court has led “progressive social transformation” and referred to the over two decades old Vishaka guidelines for preventing sexual harassment of women at workplace.

President Ram Nath Kovind on February 23 hailed the efforts of the Indian judiciary in pursuing the “cherished goal of gender justice” and said that the Supreme Court has always been “pro-active and progressive”.

Speaking at the International Judicial Conference 2020 — ‘Judiciary and the Changing World’, the President said the apex court has led “progressive social transformation” and referred to the over two decades-old Vishaka guidelines for preventing sexual harassment of women at workplace.

“In pursuing the cherished goal of gender justice, to mention one example, the Supreme Court of India has always been pro-active and progressive,” Mr. Kovind said.

“From issuing guidelines on preventing sexual harassment in the workplace two decades ago to providing directives for granting equal status to women in the Army this month, the Supreme Court of India has led progressive social transformation,” the President said.

Mr. Kovind expressed happiness that judgments of the Supreme Court are being now made available in nine vernacular languages to make them accessible to common people and termed the effort as “extraordinary” keeping in mind the linguistic diversity of the nation.

“The Supreme Court of India also deserves admiration for carrying out many radical reforms that made justice more accessible to common people,” Mr. Kovind said.

He referred to the role of the judiciary in harmonising environmental protection and sustainable development, which get a lot of attention in various countries.

Dealing with the challenges faced by the judiciary in the wake of evolution of information technology, the president said that new questions like data protection and right to privacy have emerged.

He said landmark verdicts of the Supreme Court have strengthened the legal and constitutional framework of India and its bench and bar are known for their legal scholarship and intellectual wisdom.

“The recent move towards introducing an alternative dispute resolution mechanism is expected to reduce the burden on the court to a considerable extent,” he said, adding, “Dispute resolution through mediation and conciliation would help resolve the problem amicably in an effective manner instead of resorting to a lengthy litigation process.”

He said that courts in India have been adapting to new technologies and also considering the potential of artificial intelligence to speed up justice delivery.

“I am sure that the deliberations of the conference will help strengthen the judicial system not only in India but also in other countries,” he said during the conference at the Supreme Court.

Speaking on the occasion, Chief Justice of India S.A. Bobde referred to the positive outcome of deliberations in the conference and said there has been a common thread which bind judges of various jurisdictions which is “a commitment to dispensation of justice”.

He said the judgments of the Supreme Court of India have been cited by other courts of the world and as a result, India has served as a “beacon of hope” to independent and developing nations.

The CJI also said that as per the desire of the President, the apex court has taken initiative to make available its judgments in nine vernacular languages to ensure that poor and deprived citizens are imparted justice.

He further said that job of the judiciary is not only to check who are in power but to empower deprived citizens.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/xtot3a/article30651543.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PTI1252020000086B,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/president-kovind-hails-efforts-of-judiciary-in-pursuing-goal-of-gender-justice/article30894802.ece

A MiG-29K fighter jet of the Indian Navy crashed near Goa on Sunday morning. The pilot ejected safely.

“Today morning at around 1030h a MiG-29K aircraft on a routine training sortie crashed off Goa. The pilot of the aircraft ejected safely and has been recovered,” a Navy spokesperson said in a statement. An enquiry to investigate the incident had been ordered, he added.

132,2020/02/23,Contractual teachers’ demands to be included in LJP’s manifesto: Chirag Paswan,"“I completely agree with you and will not only give this [charter of demands] to Chief Minister Nitish Kumar but also include in our party’s manifesto,” said Chirag Paswan

LJP national president Chirag Paswan has said that demands of contractual teachers of the government schools in Bihar, who have been on an indefinite strike since February 17, will be included in the party’s manifesto for the upcoming Assembly elections due later this year.

Around 4.5 lakh contractual teachers of the government schools have been observing the strike with their eight-point charter of demands — ’equal pay for equal work’ being the primary one.

“I completely agree with you and will not only give this [charter of demands] to Chief Minister Nitish Kumar but also include in our party’s manifesto,” Mr. Paswan said after meeting with a group of protesting teachers in Sheohar.

He was in Sheohar on February 22 as a part of his “Bihar First, Bihari First” yatra.

With the promise of pulling the State out of its long history of backwardness, the party chief, who recently took the mantle from his father and LJP founder Ram Vilas Paswan, had launched the programme on February 21. His State-wide ‘yatra’ will culminate in a rally at Gandhi Maidan in Patna on April 14.

However, the State government has threatened to take stern action against those participating in the strike.

Education Minister Krishnandan Prasad Verma had condemned the teachers’ strike, saying that the government will “not fulfill their demands as it is following the apex court’s verdict”.

In a setback to the contractual teachers, the Supreme Court, in May last year, had refused to regularise their services and set aside the Patna High Court ruling that they were eligible to get equal pay for equal work.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/knz9v4/article30822848.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CHIRAGPASWAN-NKV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/contractual-teachers-demands-to-be-included-in-ljps-manifesto-chirag-paswan/article30894578.ece

India’s biodiversity was a “unique treasure” for the entire humankind, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Sunday in his monthly edition of Mann ki Baat. He referred to Tamil poetess Avvaiyar to underscore his point.

“What we know is just a handful of sand. What we do not know is like a universe in itself,” he said quoting her. Similar was the case with the biodiversity of this country, Mr. Modi said pointing out the recent discovery of new species of fish in caves of Meghalaya. The fish, believed to be the largest among aquatic species found under the surface of caves, is blind and lives in deep dark underground caves. “It is a matter of joy that our India, and especially Meghalaya is home to a rare species. It lends a new facet to India’s biodiversity. We are surrounded by many such mysteries, which are still undiscovered. To discover such a phenomenal enigma calls for fierce detective passion,” Mr. Modi said.

He mentioned the recently concluded Conference of Parties of the Convention on the conservation of migratory species of wild animals in Gandhinagar, Gujarat. It was a matter of pride that India would chair the COP Convention on migratory birds for the next three years.

He encouraged schools and parents to take students to avail of the newly introduced facility in Sriharikota to see first hand the launch of rockets and satellites by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). He also exhorted the students to enrol in ISRO’s Yuvika programme that arranged visits to different ISRO centres and held workshops on astronomy.

Mr. Modi hailed the take-off of an Indian Air Force’s AN 32 aircraft from Leh’s Kushok Bakula Rimpoche Airport. The aircraft for the first time ever used a mixture of 10% Indian bio-jet fuel. “These efforts will not only reduce carbon emissions but may also reduce India’s dependence on crude oil imports. I congratulate all the people involved in this significant mission, especially the scientists of the CSIR and Indian Institute of Petroleum, Dehradun, who made it possible to develop the technology to fly an aircraft with bio-fuel. Their efforts also empower the ‘Make in India’ mission,” Mr. Modi said.

He also mentioned his surprise trip to Hunar Haat in Delhi and urged others to visit the exhibition organised by the Minority Affairs Ministry. The Delhi edition of the exhibition ends on Sunday, but it will be held in other cities in coming months. “I witnessed hues of our country’s diverse expanse, cultures, traditions, cuisines and the warmth of emotions,” he said about his visit.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/4i8dw3/article30887446.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MODIFILE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/preserve-conserve-indias-biodiversity-says-pm-modi-in-mann-ki-baat/article30894453.ece

Hours before U.S. President Donald Trump is scheduled to land in India, the Congress on Sunday asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi if he will seek a clarification on the restrictive H-1B visa policy of the American government and question the U.S. decision to sign a deal with Taliban.

Posing a series of questions on Twitter and a video message, Congress’s communication in-charge Randeep Surjewala asked why Mr. Modi was silent about “India First” even as Mr. Trump continues to talk about “America First.”

Mr. Surjewala pointed out that the Trump government’s restrictive immigration policies have hit H-1B visas. Indians usually get 70% of 85,000 H-1B Visas. Now, the rejection rate for India has increased from 6% in 2015 to 24% in 2019, especially for IT professionals. “Will PM Modi ask for easing of H-1B visas?” he asked.

IC 814 hijacking

The Congress also questioned the government’s mute response to U.S.-Taliban deal scheduled to be signed on February 29. “What about India’s red lines. Have we forgotten the IC 814 hijacking and release of terrorist Masood Azhar in Kandahar. Azhar led Jaish-e-Mohammad then attacked Parliament and Pulwama? As gala bash unfolds, will Modi ji raise our national security concerns?” he asked.

GSP list

The Congress demanded to know if the Modi government will raise the issue of removing India from duty-free imports or Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) list. India had been on this list since 1974. It has affected the $5.6 billion Indian exports to the U.S., especially gems, jewellery, rice and leather. “Post ‘Howdy Modi’ and ‘Namaste Trump’ gala events, Will PM ensure restoration of GSP status?” Mr. Surjewala asked.

The Congress also put the blame of increased oil prices at U.S.’s doors, thanks to Iran sanctions. India till 2018 used to buy 250 crore tonnes of crude oil each month from Iran. Mr. Surjewala asked if Mr. Modi will find time during Mr. Trump’s visit to secure cheaper oil for India.

Steel exports

Mr. Surjewala also raised the issue of steep fall in India’s steel exports to the U.S. that have fallen by 50% due to the hike in import tariffs by nearly 25%.

135,2020/02/23,Pak. must act on terror for talks with India: U.S.,"Although Mr. Trump offered to mediate on the Kashmir issue in the past, New Delhi has told Washington that it is a bilateral matter between India and Pakistan

U.S President Donald Trump is encouraging a reduction in tensions between India and Pakistan, the White House said on Friday, saying that dialogue between the two neighbours depends on Pakistan cracking down on terrorists. Tensions between India and Pakistan spiked after New Delhi ended the special status of Jammu and Kashmir on August 5 last year. India’s decision evoked strong reactions from Pakistan, which downgraded its diplomatic ties with New Delhi and expelled the Indian envoy.

“I think what you’ll hear from the President is very much encouraging a reduction in tensions between India and Pakistan, encouraging the two countries to engage in bilateral dialogue with each other to resolve their differences,” a senior administration official said, when asked whether Trump would offer to mediate on the Kashmir issue again during his upcoming maiden visit to India.

Mr. Trump had last month again offered to “help” resolve the dispute between India and Pakistan, saying that the US was watching the developments between the two countries over Kashmir “very closely“.

Although Mr. Trump offered to mediate on the Kashmir issue in the past, New Delhi has told Washington that it is a bilateral matter between India and Pakistan and there is no scope for any third-party mediation.

“We continue to believe a core foundation of any successful dialogue between the two (Indian and Pakistan) is based on continued momentum in Pakistan’s efforts to crack down on terrorists...,” a senior White House official said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pak-must-act-on-terror-for-talks-with-india-us/article30892697.ece
136,2020/02/23,"Dalit shot by M.P. foresters, kin allege caste crime","Victim’s family claim he was killed after they drew water from a hand pump, official says he died in a scuffle over missing rifle cartridges

At Fatehpur village in Shivpuri district, access to water too appears riven by caste fault lines. Just as the village’s roads, shops, playgrounds and trees are all split along caste hierarchies, a mutual pact forbids a Dalit from drawing water from pumps and wells located in land controlled by the Thakurs, an upper caste that enjoys the rare luxury of piped connections.

On February 16, more than 50 members of a Mehtar family, which has had to face decades of untouchability, lost their only potable water source — a hand pump near a forest post — as forest guards shot dead Madan Balmik while his family drew water from there.

“They said we were polluting the water source as we were lowly,” alleged the 38-year-old victim’s aunt Mamata Balmik.“Where do we go to fetch water now?”

On the fateful day, Ms. Mamata along with Madan’s wife and two daughters had trudged to the pump located about 200 metres from their homes, carrying steel pots to fetch water for cooking and drinking in the afternoon. According to the family’s version of events, as Nandini, one of the daughters, rinsed a pot, some water splashed on a forester, who, enraged, hurled casteist slurs at them, and shot at Madan when he rushed to the spot in a bid to calm tensions.

The family alleges that after thrashing the women and hitting the victim’s brother Pankaj Balmik with rifle butts, the foresters, and even villagers, left Madan, who was writhing with pain from the multiple pellet wounds he had sustained, unattended on the road. “Thakurs, who have vehicles, refused to take him to hospital as they said touching him would pollute them,” asserts another aunt Babita Balmik. And by the time the family, which only owns two wheelers, could arrange for a vehicle to take the victim to a hospital in Karera, 25 km away, it was too late. The police have seized two rifles, registered a case against 14 officials under the Indian Penal Code and the The Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, and arrested six people so far.

From four brothers brought to the village in the early 20th century to serve upper castes — cleaning human excreta and skinning animal carcasses — to seeing their children complete primary school and taking up stable jobs in the cities, and having grandchildren even graduate from colleges, the Balmik family’s tale is one of resilience and constant struggle to overcome a repressive social predicament.

“Our father made sure we study,” said Ms. Babita, who does domestic work at an MLA’s residence in Uttar Pradesh. “Now, our assertion in the village has riled the upper castes, which are denying us even water. We refuse to serve them. Most accused foresters belong to the upper castes. They know us well,” she asserted.

Even though they left manual scavenging years ago, six members of the family still remain in the clutches of sanitation work, jobs they were able to secure more easily owing to their caste. But Madan’s 61-year-old father, Mahattam Balmik, the eldest sibling, became the first to land a government job — as a forest guard — 40 years ago, causing upheaval in the village. Despite this, the family still doesn’t have a toilet at home, and defecate in the open.

A fourth generation member, Ms. Nandini, 12, who studies in Class 7, said the teacher still made Dalit children spruce up the school. “She hands us brooms as soon as we reach saying we’re destined to do such work, while Thakur children study in classrooms. Also, we’ve been asked to carry separate utensils so that the mid-day meal isn’t polluted for other children who get utensils at the school,” she said, sheepishly, showing a steel glass and a tumbler she takes to school.

“After bhaisaheb (brother) was killed, we had to travel to Karera to get tonsured,” said Mr. Pankaj. “The barber here, who belongs to the nai caste, says if he cuts our hair, no other customer will ever seek his service,” claimed Mr. Pankaj.

Bimal, 16, the victim’s eldest son, now fears he would have to abandon his Class 10 board examinations starting March 3, to support the family. His father earned ₹3,000 a month by selling chicken and worked as an agricultural labourer for ₹250 a day. “Even in the past I went to the fields with my father. I may take that up again,” he said.

A forest official, speaking on condition of anonymity, claimed that Madan had encroached upon the Fatehpur forest post. Foresters, he contended, had come to serve an eviction notice on the family, when they were waylaid and a rifle was snatched from them. After securing the weapon back, the forest officials noticed that some cartridges were missing, and in an ensuing scuffle the victim had been shot, he asserted. “In the past, he even burnt a motorcycle when his father was employed at the Madhav National Park,” said the official, who claimed Mr. Mahattam had encroached upon another post in the past, and even sold it.

137,2020/02/23,BJP ally faces stronger opposition in Bodoland council polls,"Ex-student leader Pramod Boro joins UPPL giving it a boost

For the first time since 2003, an ally of the BJP is expected to face a strong opposition in the Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC) polls in Assam.

Elections to the 40-seat tribal council are scheduled in April. The council, established under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution and headquartered in western Assam’s Kokrajhar town, covers four districts where the Bodo community has a sizeable population.

On Friday evening, ex-student leader Pramod Boro joined the United People’s Party Liberal (UPPL) headed by former Rajya Sabha MP Urkhao Gwra Brahma. The former was immediately made the party’s working president.

Mr. Boro had resigned as the president of the influential All Bodo Students’ Union (ABSU) soon after signing the third Bodo Peace Accord on January 27 along with leaders of all the factions of the disbanded extremist group National Democratic Front of Boroland (NDFB).

Mr. Brahma has been one of the most vocal critics of the Bodoland People’s Front (BPF) and its chief Hagrama Mohilary, who is also the chairman of the BTC. The BPF is one of the two regional constituents of the BJP-led alliance government in Assam.

The UPPL’s inability in becoming a major political force all these years has made Mr. Boro more of an opposition leader in the BTC areas while spearheading the Bodoland statehood movement — shelved after the January accord — during his prolonged stint as the ABSU chief. He had several run-ins with the BTC leadership during that phase.

Political analysts said Mr. Boro’s joining the UPPL in the presence of several former NDFB leaders has made it clear that the BTC polls would be one of the most keenly contested. There are indications that some NDFB leaders would join the UPPL in the run-up to the polls.

The NDFB had been the rival of the Bodo Liberation Tigers, an erstwhile extremist group that primarily metamorphosed into the BPF. Mr. Mohilary was the Tigers’ chairman until declaring truce before the formation of the BTC.

What has given an impetus to the UPPL was the BJP’s indication that it was open to tying up with either the BPF or any other party that controls the BTC. A few days ago, the BPF reacted strongly when Assam BJP president Ranjit Kumar Dass said his party was keen on expanding its footprint in the BTC areas.

“Things do not happen according to the wishes of Ranjit Dass,” Mr. Mohilary said.

Mr. Boro said he was not thinking in terms of capturing power. “Our objective is to ensure the implementation of all the clauses of the new peace accord for permanent peace, stability and development in the Bodo areas,” he said.

The BTC areas have been lagging due to faulty governance, he said and added that the UPPL would work out its electoral strategy soon.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bjp-ally-faces-stronger-opposition-in-bodoland-council-polls/article30891084.ece
138,2020/02/23,Trump's India visit: No clarity yet on Ahmedabad roadshow,"The lack of clarity on the roadshow’s distance and route stems from uncertainty about whether President Trump will visit Mahatma Gandhi’s Sabarmati Ashram during his brief trip to Ahmedabad.

Amid claims about ‘millions’ of people turning out during U.S. President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s roadshow in Ahmedabad on Monday, there is no clarity as yet on whether the roadshow is going to be 22 km long, as the authorities had claimed earlier, or just 6 km as per a schedule shared by the White House that shows Mr. Trump going directly to the stadium from the airport.

The lack of clarity on the roadshow’s distance and route stems from uncertainty about whether President Trump will visit Mahatma Gandhi’s Sabarmati Ashram during his brief trip to Ahmedabad.

‘Sabarmati ashram’

Indian authorities maintain that the U.S. President would visit the Gandhi Ashram before heading to the Motera stadium to attend the ‘Namaste Trump’ event.

Accordingly, Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has designed the route for the roadshow from the airport to the Sabarmati Ashram and then on to the Motera stadium, a 22 km route.

However, the tentative schedule shared by the White House about the President’s brief visit to Ahmedabad does not include a visit to the Ashram, leaving just one engagement for Mr. Trump at the stadium.

“PMO and MEA are still trying to include a brief halt at Sabarmati Ashram but U.S. officials and agencies involved in preparations for the President’s visit are adamant on skipping it,” a key official involved in the preparations in Gujarat, speaking on condition of anonymity, told The Hindu.

Now, without Sabarmati Ashram, the distance from the airport to the stadium is about 6-7 km, which means the roadshow will be significantly shorter than the 22 km route envisaged earlier. And over a 6 km-long route, it is difficult to fit in even one lakh people.

On Friday, Gujarat’s Chief Minister told media persons that the White House would decide about President Trump’s visit to Sabarmati Ashram.

Officials at Ahmedabad’s civic body, the organiser of the roadshow, are struggling for clarity on the distance and route with just over a day to go for the event even as President Trump and Gujarat’s Chief Minister have publicly claimed that ‘millions’ will show up when the convoy of the President and PM passes by.

On Saturday, in a 55-second promotional video posted on Twitter, Chief Minister Rupani claimed that “millions” will witness a monumental roadshow.

Earlier, the U.S. President had said that Mr. Modi told him that 10 million people would show up in Ahmedabad.

“They say anywhere from six to 10 million people are going to be showing up along the route to one of the largest stadiums in the world, the largest cricket stadium in the world, which is brand new and beautiful,” the Mr. Trump had tweeted.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/llz5ow/article30891032.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk--Trump-Modi-vijay-soneji,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/no-clarity-yet-on-trumps-roadshow/article30891011.ece

140,2020/02/23,One in three payments for maternity benefit scheme credited to wrong account,"Sometimes, the money is untraceable by beneficiaries and field functionaries, says NITI Aayog report

One in three Aadhaar-based payments for the Centre’s maternity benefit scheme, or Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY), was credited to a wrong bank account, according to a progress report on Poshan Abhiyaan (Nutrition Mission) released by the NITI Aayog on Saturday.

“A substantial number of payments (28% of all Aadhaar-based payments, of 31.29 lakh) are going to different bank accounts than what had been provided by the beneficiaries. Sometimes these are even untraceable by beneficiaries and field functionaries. It is a prime cause for dissatisfaction among beneficiaries, which needs to be addressed on an urgent basis,” the report says about the implementation of the scheme on the basis of the data collected until March 31, 2019. 66% of the direct benefit transfers were based on Aadhaar.

The report says a telephone survey of 5,525 beneficiaries, conducted by the Ministry of Women and Child Development, revealed that only 60% were aware of the receipt of the benefits and the bank accounts to which the money was transferred. Under the PMMVY, pregnant women and lactating mothers receive ₹5,000 for their first child in three instalments. Each tranche is released upon the beneficiaries meeting some conditions. The money is meant to compensate women for loss of wages, and is aimed at ensuring a healthy nutritional development of the newborn.

The NITI Aayog has called for “simplification in documentation and operational rules” to avoid delays. It has proposed to “rationalise” the mandatory waiting period of 180 days before the second instalment is released as well as the compulsory birth certificate for the release of the third instalment. It calls for the training of auxiliary midwives who fill up the mother-child protection card, which is among the documents needed to get the benefit, and data entry operators so that application details are entered online and payments and complaints are processed on time.

A report in The Hindu, ‘The long wait for maternity benefits: How red tape drowned a central scheme in Gujrat’s Dahod district’ (February 8), had highlighted how some beneficiaries had to wait for two years to receive the benefit under the scheme and how a claimant’s application was pending for over a year because it had not been processed by the data entry operator at the taluk level since the computer at the office had not been repaired for months. The report highlighted the problems faced by beneficiaries in filling up the 32-page application form and providing nine identity documents.

How States scored

This is the second report released by the government on the implementation of Poshan Abhiyaan. It scores the States and Union Territories to measure their readiness to execute the programme across four themes: governance and institutional mechanism; strategy and planning; service delivery and capacities; and programme activities and intervention coverage. The States were divided into large and small categories for a better comparison.

Among the 19 large States, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh scored the top three ranks, followed by Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra. All these States had an implementation score of over 70%. Karnataka, Assam and Kerala were at the bottom, with a score below 55%.

Among the eight small States, Mizoram and Sikkim scored above 75%. Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura, Manipur and Goa were at the bottom, with scores below 60%. However, all small States had a score above 55%, displaying a fairly good level of readiness and implementation.

Four of the seven Union Territories had a score of over 70%. Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Chandigarh, and Daman and Diu scored above 75% and were ranked among the top three Union Territories. Delhi, and Lakshadweep were at the bottom, with scores below 50%.

The report calls for improving funds utilisation, which was at 20% in large States, 42% in small States and 5% in Haryana, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Kerala, Delhi and Goa. It also highlights the need to address gaps in growth- monitoring devices at anganwadis, pointing out that only 27.6% anganwadi workers were given smartphones to record data and only 35% had devices like weighing scales to measure important nutritional parameters. “It is imperative to ensure that the basic equipment required to conduct growth monitoring is procured and distributed urgently,” the report says.

The third main recommendation is on filling of vacancies in the supervisory cadre of Lady Supervisors Child Development Project Officer (CDPO) and District Programme Officer (DPO). According to the report, at the national level, the vacancy rates are in the range of 25% for the CDPO.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/dp3zut/article30891110.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-Pregnant-woman,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/one-in-three-payments-for-maternity-benefit-scheme-credited-to-wrong-account/article30891111.ece
141,2020/02/23,Bodo accord and rifts,"Why have the terms offered by the Centre not gone down well with several tribal groups in Assam?

The story so far: The Ministry of Home Affairs, Assam government and Bodo groups including the All Bodo Students’ Union and militant outfits signed an agreement on January 27, New Delhi’s third attempt at conflict resolution after the 1993 and 2003 accords. The new deal offers more hope than the earlier accords; some of the most potent factions of the National Democratic Front of Boroland that had stayed away from earlier agreements are now on board. More significantly, the stakeholders have agreed that the updated political arrangements would remain confined to the realm of wider autonomy within the State of Assam, giving statehood and Union Territory demands a final burial.

Is all well with the peace accord?

The third peace accord with the Bodos threatens to intensify the sociopolitical contestation among groups in the State not just in the expanded area, which will be renamed as Bodoland Territorial Region, but also regions where the so-called Scheduled Hill Tribes reside in large numbers. While greater contiguity of Bodo-populated areas would aid more efficient governance in the Sixth Schedule administrative unit, it has deepened insecurity among other groups such as Koch Rajbongshis, Adivasis and Muslims in the existing Bodoland Territorial Area Districts of Kokrajhar, Chirang, Baksa and Udalguri. The local Kokrajhar MP, a non-Bodo, has appealed to the government to ensure that a Bodo solution does not engender a non-Bodo problem. The Bodoland Peoples Front, which has dominated the Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC) since inception in 2003, is also not pleased with newer claimants to power in the council elections due soon. BTC chief Hagrama Mohilary, himself a former Bodo Liberation Tigers militant, has threatened to reject the accord and refused to use BTR as part of the new vocabulary. There are also rumblings elsewhere. The agreement stipulates that Bodos living in the hill areas outside the BTAD will be conferred Scheduled Tribe (Hills) status, something that has not gone down well with tribes such as the Karbis.

Why are the hill tribes up in arms?

In Assam, there are as many as 14 recognised plains tribe communities, 15 hill tribe communities and 16 Scheduled Caste communities. The plains tribes are Barmans in Cachar, Bodos, Deoris, Hojais, Kacharis, Sonowals, Lalungs, Mechs, Misings, Rabhas, Dimasas, Singphos, Khamtis and Garos. The ST (Hills) status is primarily reserved for tribes residing in the two autonomous hill districts of Karbi Anglong and Dima Hasao, where the Karbis and Dimasas are the most dominant in their respective areas. At present, while 16 seats are reserved for STs in the 126-member Assam Assembly, two are reserved for existing tribes in the 14 Lok Sabha seats of the State. Students’ bodies of the hill districts, chiefly the Karbi Students’ Association and the Dimasa Students’ Union, have risen in unison against the Centre’s assurance of granting ST (Hills) status to the Bodos living in the hill areas. Militant group Karbi Longri and North Cachar Hills Liberation Front (KLNLF), which signed a ceasefire with the Centre in 2009, has also opposed the move saying it would adversely impact the “identity of the Karbis”. While political configurations at the State level will not be largely altered because of the measure in the five Assembly seats of the hill districts, elections to the local autonomous tribal councils in Karbi Anglong and Dima Hasao, which also enjoy Sixth Schedule protections, could witness realignments. The Karbi Anglong Autonomous Council, which has 26 seats, is due for elections in 2022. The Dima Hasao Autonomous District Council has 30 seats. The Karbis comprise over 46% of the population in the KAAC area and the Dimasas around 35% in the DHADC.

Will it have a ripple effect?

Other insurgent groups at the talks table with the Centre, including the KLNLF, have taken note of the Bodo pact and are likely to push for similarly generous terms. The pot is likely to be stirred further in Assam if the plan to accord ST status to six communities from the State — Tai Ahom, Koch Rajbongshi, Sootea, Moran, Matak and 36 different Adivasi groups clubbed together as ‘Tea Tribes’ — gets the final nod. The communities are estimated to make up almost 27% of Assam’s population. The impending Naga peace accord, in the works in its latest iteration since 2015, could also spur a demand for territorial and administrative rights in the Naga territories of Manipur even as the dominant Meiteis of the valley push their own agenda of inclusion in the ST category.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/31jy9w/article30891355.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23THINDIAINSURGENCY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bodo-accord-and-rifts/article30891356.ece
142,2020/02/23,Dedicated cargo flights from Vizag from tomorrow,"SpiceJet gets nod from the Naval Headquarters

SpiceJet is all set to operate its cargo flights from Visakhapatnam airport from February 25. A schedule for the SpiceJet freighter, connecting Visakhapatnam with Surat and Kolkata, has been approved by the Director-General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) and the Airports Authority of India (AAI) after clearance from the Naval Headquarters in Delhi. The first cargo flight -- SG 7051 -- will land in Vizag at 11.50 a.m. from Chennai and take off for Surat at 1.05 p.m. This flight will operate on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. The second freighter -- SG 7050 -- will arrive here at 11.50 a.m. from Chennai and take off at 1.05 p.m. for Kolkata.

This flight will operate on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, according to Airport Director M. Raja Kishore.

Impressive growth

Both domestic and international air cargo from Visakhapatnam, registered an increase during the last four years, and an impressive growth during the last two years.

The exports from Vizag include seafood, auto parts, diamonds and textiles. Following is the break-up of the domestic and international cargo handled by Vizag Airport: 2015-16 (2,935 tons and 25 tons); 2016-17 (3,579 tons and 54 tons); 2017-18 (3,386 tons and 297 tons); and 2018-19 (5,241 tons and 498 tons).

SpiceJet initially planned to operate dedicated cargo flights on the same routes with arrival at 11.50 a.m. and departure at 12.50 p.m., with effect from February 15. The plan, however, failed to take off due to non-availability of slots. Visakhapatnam MP M.V.V. Satyanarayana took up the issue with the Defence Minister and the move has finally yielded a positive result.

These flights will be a boon to cargo exporters, especially seafood exporters, who have to export their products in the shortest possible time, say AP Air Travellers’ Association leaders K. Kumar Raja, D.S. Varma and O. Naresh Kumar.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/dedicated-cargo-flights-from-vizag-from-tomorrow/article30897180.ece
143,2020/02/23,Gutka worth ₹1.5 crore seized,"Seven, including kingpin of the operation, held

In a major haul, the Chittoor police seized gutka stocks worth about ₹1.5 crore from an illegally operated godown at Satyavedu in the district, located just a few km away from the Tamil Nadu border, in the wee hours of Sunday. The police nabbed seven persons, including the kingpin of the clandestine operation, and seized a container, a truck, and an SUV.

Acting on information from Superintendent of Police S. Senthil Kumar, a special party was formed with Circle Inspectors B. Srinivasulu (Satyavedu), K. Maddachari (Nagari), and K. Rajasekhar (Nindra). The team rushed to Satyavedu on Saturday midnight and completed the operation in a couple of hours.

Modus operandi

Inspector Rajasekhar said that the prime accused was operating a godown at Satyavedu to process the loading of stocks to Tamil Nadu. “The modus operandi of the accused is to procure guta stocks in bulk from Karnataka, where there is no ban on the products, and to stock them at Satyavedu, before suppying them to the clients in Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu, the states where the tobacco products are banned. He would act cleverly by using the vehicles with registration numbers of the neighbouring States during transit to avoid being suspected by the police at check-posts,” the police officer said.

Apart from Satyavedu, the special police party also raided a couple of locations at Badur and Uttukottai, the border towns in Tamil Nadu, and seized small quantum of gutka stocks there.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ig3dq3/article30897159.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24ONGGANJA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/gutka-worth-15-crore-seized/article30897160.ece

149,2020/02/23,Opposition parties allege forcible land acquisition,"We stick to norms, say officials

Opposition parties have alleged that the government is forcibly acquiring lands of Dalits and converting tank lands and those of D. Patta as layouts for distribution of sites to the landless poor.

The government’s decision to distribute land was a good initiative, but it should not cause agony to others, leaders of Opposition parties said on Saturday.

The Srikakulam district administration has planned to ensure house sites to 60, 603 persons in the district. It required 1,380 acres of land for the purpose, but it has only 1,130 acres. The remaining piece of land is being acquired as per the Land Acquisition Act, 2013.

However, Srikakulam TDP MP Kinjarapu Rammohan Naidu alleged that Water, Land and Trees Act was being violated for the acquisition of land in many places. He said that the lands on hillocks and river beds should not be touched as it would harm environment.

In the backdrop of allegations, Srikakulam In-charge Collector K. Srinivasulu clarified that many farmers were willing to come forward to surrender their lands since they were getting decent rate for their properties.

Vizianagaram

As far as Vizianagaram is concerned, the government planned to distribute house sites to 56,935 persons in the district. Vizianagaram Collector M.Hari Jawaharlal said that there was no chance for violation of norms in distribution of house sites to the landless poor. However, the TDP leaders argued that lands under the control of Dalits were forcibly taken as they were not having valid documents. They decided to bring the issue to the notice of former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu who is expected to come to Vizianagaram on February 27 to participate in Praja Chaitnya Yatra aimed at exposing alleged anti-people policies of the government.

The YSR Congress Government has forcibly taken away land belonging to the supporters of Telugu Desam Party in various mandals of Anantapur district, alleged TDP leader Kalava Srinivasulu and party district president B.K. Parthasarathy.

At a press conference here on Saturday, the TDP leaders alleged that the revenue officials were seizing the land at the behest of the MLAs and they also threatened to start a massive agitation against it.

They claimed that the pattas allocated by the TDP government during its rule in Guntakal and Rayadurg have been cancelled and the land is being given to fresh beneficiaries.

“If the government wishes to provide houses to each and everyone, let them first sanction funds for the completion of the ongoing houses and let the YSRCP take the credit for it,” said Mr. Srinivasulu.

Some people have been using the village common land/ government land for sheltering cattle, stacking hay or fertilizer, which is being taken away and given to the YSRCP supporters, he alleged.

Mr. Parthasarathy questioned as to why only the land owned by the TDP supporters were taken, whereas those that were owned by the YSRCP leaders were left untouched.

Referring to the housing scheme that aims to offer one cent of land to 1.02 lakh beneficiaries, he said, “What kind of house can anyone build on ‘one cent’ of land?”

Land allocated for ITI College and a government residential school at D. Hirehal and Bommanahal have also been cancelled, he alleged.

151,2020/02/23,Courts should not be allowed to falter: former SC judge,"Concerted effort needed to protect fundamental rights, says Aftab Alam

Supreme Court former judge Justice Aftab Alam said the Constitution of India remained the same since its adoption but radical changes took place in the way people led their lives and some worrying developments created deep anxiety and fear among various sections. People would look to courts for justice and if they falter in discharging their constitutional obligation, the legal fraternity should ensure that the rule of law prevailed, he observed, calling for a concerted effort to protect Part-III of the Constitution which enshrined the ‘precious fundamental rights’.

Inaugurating the 10th National Conference of Indian Association of Lawyers (IAL) here on Saturday, Justice Alam said the National Register of Citizens (NRC) of Assam became a major controversy as the concerns of the affected sections appeared to be brushed aside while the exercise was said to be flawed due to infrastructure constraints.

Serious implications

He observed that for the first time an element of religion was added to the definition of citizenship, going by the declarations that the exercise was meant to weed out a certain section of society and it did not pose any harm to members of the majority religious group.

The idea of secularism had, therefore, not just been redefined but it was pulled inside out in the form of Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), 2019. This project would have far-reaching implications due to the ample scope for errors in registering the details of vast populations, which a study said could be up to 5%, he opined.

‘Unhealthy trend’

Justice Alam said the word protest had become ugly as those raising their voices were being branded as anti-nationals and there were instances of Chief Ministers exhorting the police to liquidate the anti-social elements, which amounted to telling them not to follow the law.

The situation came to such a pass that common people were being charged with sedition, the retired apex court judge said, adding that lawyers and people at large should not let the hallowed institution of Indian judiciary crumble. He also observed that people were being introduced to the new virtue of ‘nationalism which demands a malicious enemy’.

152,2020/02/23,Amaravati ryots meted ‘inhuman’ treatment: Cong.,"28 farmers in the capital villages had died due to harassment, alleges Tulasi Reddy

Andhra Pradesh Congress Committee working president N. Tulasi Reddy on Saturday launched a scathing attack on the Jagan Mohan Reddy government for the “inhuman” treatment meted out to the protesting farmers in the Amaravati region.

Speaking to reporters here, he alleged that 28 farmers in the capital villages had died due to an onslaught of humiliations, harassment and false cases filed against them.

He said of the 28 farmer deaths during the 66-day-long protest, 26 had died due to cardiac arrest and two committed suicide. Terming them “State-abetted murders”, he said none from the government thought it necessary to console the bereaved families.

The Congress leader said the protesting farmers were stressed out and were under tremendous duress. In this situation, they were being further subjected to harassment and unable to bear it, many of them died of heart attacks. He said people in the State responded favourably to Mr. Jagan’s plea to give him one chance and gave his party a huge majority in the elections. But, after assuming power, he ditched the same people, he alleged.

Mr. Tulasi Reddy said a State where farmer was unhappy would never prosper. The Chief Minister had taken farmers for a ride by announcing his decision to shift the capital out of Amaravati and this was contrary to his stand on location of the capital when he was in the Opposition.

Tributes to Maulana

Earlier, Mr. Tulasi Reddy, along with other Congress leaders, paid glowing tributes to freedom fighter, Gandhian and the first Union Education Minister of the country Maulana Abul Kalam Azad by garlanding his portrait on the occasion of his 62nd death anniversary.

Owner of one-acre of land, Naikula Raju had sunk three borewells, but they did not yield water this year to irrigate tomato and brinjal crops in his field. He had reportedly taken loan close to ₹5 lakh. The Rayadurg police said that the farmer allegedly consumed poison in his own house in the early hours of Saturday.

He is survived by wife and two daughters. His wife said he was worried about the repayment of debt as the lenders constantly pestered him. His tomato crop too did not fetch him remunerative price, the family members said.

154,2020/02/23,SCPCR seeks action as videos of Nuzvid IIIT students surface on social media,"Four students removed from hostel, handed over to parents, said SP

Members of the Andhra Pradesh State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (APSCPCR), Child Welfare Committee (CWC), RGUKT Nuzvid IIIT and the police expressed concern over posting of video footages of some students and the dormitories of girl students on social media sites.

A student of the university allegedly sneaked into the girls’ hostel, located on the campus a few days ago and stayed there for a few hours. The security personnel caught the boy and the girl and handed them to the college principal, who ordered an inquiry.

Some unidentified persons, who reportedly recorded the scenes while breaking the locks and taking the students into custody, posted the clippings on social media groups, for which the SCPCR and the child rights bodies reacted sharply.

IIIT Director S.S.S.V. Gopala Raju said that a criminal case would be filed against those who videographed and posted the footage on the social media groups. “A detailed inquiry on posting the video footage is under progress,” the Director said.

Four suspended

Krishna district Superintendent of Police (SP) M. Ravindranath Babu said the police would file a case against the accused under IT Act and other relevant sections, once they receive complaint from the college authorities.

“The boy and the girl who were caught in the hostel room and two other students who helped them were removed from the hostel. They were handed over to their parents,” the SP told The Hindu on Saturday.

Concern expressed

APSCPCR Member V.S.V. Krishna Kumar expressed concern over exposing the students and dormitories of the girls’ hostel on social media groups.

“It is a crime. No one can enter the girls’ hostel, videograph the rooms and make them public. RGUKT and the police should respond immediately and take action against those responsible,” Mr. Krishna Kumar said.

Krishna district Child Welfare Committee (CWC) Chairman B.V.S. Kumar said the committee members would visit the university campus and inquire into the incident and also on disrupting the privacy of other students in the hostel.

“We have not received any complaint from the IIIT officials. Police will act as per the law and book the culprits,” Nuzvid Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) B. Srinivasulu said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/scpcr-seeks-action-as-videos-of-nuzvid-iiit-students-surface-on-social-media/article30892076.ece
155,2020/02/23,Bandaru dares YSRCP to release report on ESI scam,"Ruling party pursuing vendetta politics, alleges former Minister

Former Minister Bandaru Satyanarayana Murthy accused the YSRCP Government of being vindictive against TDP leaders, at a press conference held in the city on Saturday.

Mr. Murthy dared the ruling party to release the report of the Vigilance and Enforcement Department on the alleged ESI scam involving the purchase of medicines and medical equipment, and the charges levelled against former Minister K. Atchannaidu.

“Ministers forward many proposals and notes and it is for the officials to frame the rules and implement them. In this particular instance, the former Minister recommended the implementation of the successful Telangana model. The report did not name Mr. Naidu or another former Minister Pithani Satyanarayana,” he said at the press conference which he addressed along with MLC Duvvarapu Rama Rao and former MLA Palla Srinivasa Rao here.

Mr. Murthy alleged bias on the part of the YSRCP Government in favour of one particular section, and said any vindictive action against backward class leaders would be countered. He added that the campaign against an institution run by MLA Vasupalli Ganesh Kumar was also politically motivated.

Mr. Murthy also found fault with the formation of a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe a host of issues and wondered how a DIG-rank official would investigate charges against his senior police officers. “The spate of inquiries is merely a ploy to divert attention from cases filed against Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy,” he alleged.

Mr. Rama Rao said BCs were being meted out a raw deal and funds from BC, SC and ST welfare were being diverted to the flagship ‘Ammavodi’ scheme. The promise of forming corporations for 139 backward castes also did not materialise, he said.

Mr. Srinivasa Rao condemned the charges against Mr. Atchannaidu and Mr. Ganesh Kumar and said vendetta politics would be countered collectively. The YSRCP Government should instead focus on development and try to beat the TDP on that front, he said.

MLA V. Ramakrishna Babu and party urban general secretary Ch.V.

157,2020/02/23,GVMC warns parking fee violators of hefty penalties,"Grievances can be filed through a toll-free number

Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) on Saturday issued a notice regulating parking fees for all shopping malls, movie theatres and multiplexes, reiterating that hefty penalties would be slapped on those not implementing the revised guidelines.

In an order issued by the Commissioner of GVMC, the penalty for first-time violation will be ₹10,000. Violating the rule for a second time will draw a penalty of ₹50,000. For repeated violations, GVMC can seal the premises or impose any penalty as desired by the Commissioner.

The order also indicated that ward planning secretaries shall maintain a database of commercial establishments and parking tariffs that the malls, theatres and multiplexes are collecting in their respective jurisdiction.

The grievances pertaining to the parking fee collection can be filed at ward sachivalayas or through the toll-free number of GVMC. The grievances will be monitored by the ACP of the respective zones on a regular basis.

Commercial establishments have also been asked to maintain details of parked vehicles and the fee collected by them, and the record of which shall be made available to the supervisory officers as and when demanded during surprise checks.

The Traffic Police Department has also been empowered to conduct joint inspections with zonal commissioners of GVMC.

As per the new regulatory order, no parking fee will be collected for the first 30 minutes. For those parking their vehicles for more than 30 minutes up to an hour, no fee will be charged if there is any purchase. For an hour and above, no fee will be charged if the value of purchase at the establishment is higher than the parking fee.

The prescribed fee can be charged only if the person does not fit in any of these categories.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/is3nys/article30892011.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23-VZ-GVMC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/gvmc-warns-parking-fee-violators-of-hefty-penalties/article30892012.ece
158,2020/02/23,Coronavirus fears lead to steep fall in chicken prices,"Rumour-mongering has led to thousands of foodies chickening out of eating poultry

Chicken is no longer on the menu for thousands of gastronomes in the city, as fears abound that those eating the meat will end up contracting the dreaded COVID-19.

The latest myth to be spun out of rumour mills on social media has taken a heavy toll on the fortunes of poultry farms as prices crashed by over 50% within a span of seven days. Reports of mass deaths of thousands of hens in poultry farms of adjoining Godavari districts a few weeks ago have also added grist to the rumours.

One kg of broiler chicken, which sold for ₹160 two weeks ago, is now selling for ₹90 (with skin) and ₹100 (without skin), according to latest rates fixed by the Visakha Broiler Poultry Association (VBPA).

Members of VBPA said that the rumours have led to a decline in chicken consumption by over 50% in the city.

“Earlier on Sundays, we would register sales of about 2-2.5 lakh birds/hens. But this Sunday, we could not even sell one lakh birds,” said VBPA president T. Adinarayana.

According to Mr. Adinarayana, there were neither any deaths of chicken in poultry farms nor any cases of COVID-19 in Visakhapatnam district. “The rumours circulating on WhatsApp and Facebook, warning people that consumption of chicken will result in coronavirus, has affected our sales a lot. Even sales of eggs have been hit,” Mr. Adinarayana said.

The rumours began surfacing on messaging apps and social media platforms within a few days of the outbreak of COVID-19 in China. The false campaign seems to have been carefully crafted, with old videos of mass culling of hens now being circulated again as ‘evidence’ that the COVID-19 virus is also affecting poultry markets.

The rumours seem to have been successful in creating the desired outcome, with thousands of people across the State now deciding to observe a ‘no non-veg week’.

Busting myths

The members of Visakha Broiler Poultry Association said that if birds are not vaccinated properly, there are chances of their death. But it does not mean, the bird is affected with COVID-19. The members hope that the situation would be normal soon.

District Health & Medical Officer (DMHO) S Tirupathi Rao also made it clear that there are no signs of COVID-19 in Visakhapatnam district. He also ruled out the rumours that consumption of chicken, eggs could cause COVID-19.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/snzslt/article30891975.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23-VZ-CHICKENSHOPS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/coronavirus-fears-lead-to-steep-fall-in-chicken-prices/article30891976.ece
159,2020/02/23,Authorities spice up prisoners’ lives in Vizag,"To launch processing unit tomorrow to help them learn and earn

With an intention to rehabilitate and reform prisoners and train them to earn a livelihood after their release, the Visakhapatnam Central Jail is going to start a spice processing unit on its premises at Adavivaram.

Claimed to be the first of its kind in prisons in South India, the unit is scheduled to be inaugurated by Director General of Prisons & Correctional Homes, Andhra Pradesh, Md. Ahsan Reza on February 24.

The idea was proposed by the Superintendent of Visakhapatnam Central Jail, S Rahul, a few months ago. After the higher authorities approved the project, work for the unit has started. The jail authorities have selected an old building block lying vacant on the premises and revamped it.

“We have tied up with the Visakhapatnam-based iFuture Globistic Enterprise Limited, which has decades of experience in this field. Their team is not only helping in installing machinery at the unit, but will also train prisoners on operating it,” said Mr. Rahul.

The unit had cost ₹32 lakh besides ₹3 lakh for building renovation. The production of turmeric and red chilli powder was likely to commence on April 1. The processing of other spices would be taken up in a phased manner.

“Turmeric will be procured from Narsipatnam and red chilli from Khammam, Warangal and Guntur. The unit has the capacity to meet the internal needs of prisons across the State. Excess production will be marketed through our brand Sudhar,” Mr. Rahul said.

Skilling initiative

The initiative, planned as part of the prisoners’ rehabilitation programme, would equip prisoners with skills required for food processing and packing industry, and help them get jobs after their release.

“The prisoners will not only get to earn wages to support their family but also be benefited by having unadulterated spice powders in their food,” he said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/nzg7fp/article30891861.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23VJVZSPICE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/authorities-spice-up-prisoners-lives-in-vizag/article30891863.ece
160,2020/02/23,RTA detects 154 BS-III vehicles in State,"Notices served on owners of 66 of them; information on remaining awaited

When the deadline for enforcing the new emission norms is nearing, the Andhra Pradesh Road Transport Authority has detected that 154 trailer-lorries of Bharat Stage III are operating in the State.

These lorries have allegedly been registered illegally at Kohima (Nagaland) and later transferred to A.P. and sold here as BS IV vehicles.

Fake documents

The lorries, having 10 to 18 wheels, were allegedly purchased in scrap (unregisterable ones) from Ashok Leyland in 2018. Later, fake documents were created to show that they were of BS-IV standard and purchased from various dealers in India.

The RTA detected 66 such vehicles in the first week of this month.

The RTA obtained complete information pertaining to such vehicles allegedly purchased by the family members of former MP J.C. Diwakar Reddy and sold to different persons after re-registering them in A.P. in August 2018.

Deputy Transport Commissioner N. Siva Rama Prasad told The Hindu that the department seized 16 vehicles operating in four districts of the State. Notices were issued to all the 66 vehicle owners, who, he said, had agreed to surrender the vehicles to the department soon.

Joint Commissioner, Transport, S.A.V. Prasad Rao (Road Safety), said on February 8 that police cases had been filed in the One Town police station here regarding the fraud.

While scouting for information on such vehicles, the RTA detected 88 more vehicles in the State on Saturday. The chassis and engine numbers of these matched with those sold as scrap by Ashok Leyland.

The department is now trying to know as to who got them registered first and who sold them to different people in Andhra Pradesh.

The department is expecting some information on this soon, after which it will serve notices on those involved.

Cases against sellers

Meanwhile, persons whose vehicles were seized – Anantapur (7); Chittoor (4); Nellore (1); and Kurnool and Guntur (2 each) – have filed cases against the sellers (family members of J.C. Prabhakar Reddy and others).

An association of the buyers is making efforts to get the money back from the sellers. As some of them have taken bank loan and the financiers are after them to pay instalments, they have approached the Anantapur police seeking help.

Information about vehicles registered at Kohima is awaited. The 88 vehicles detected afresh too may have been registered in Nagaland, sources say.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/5un21x/article30891835.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23VJPG4-LORRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/rta-detects-154-bs-iii-vehicles-in-state/article30891836.ece
161,2020/02/23,"There needs to be aggressive screening for GI cancer, say experts","Experts participating in a workshop on gastroenterology and gastrointestinal surgery in Mysuru have emphasised the need for aggressive screening for gastrointestinal cancer.

Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of GI Update 2020, a workshop organised by Apollo BGS Hospitals, noted gastroenterologist and head of Asian Institute of Gastroenterology D. Nageshwar Reddy advocated screening in everyone above the age of 50.

He said gastrointestinal ailments were neglected by society, which is more concerned about cardiac problems and diabetes. Gastrointestinal ailments afflict about 30% of the population in the country, as opposed to cardiac problems and diabetes, which afflict 10-15% of the population.

In many parts of Karnataka, such as Shivamogga, the rate of oesophagus cancer is high, he said. “Everyone over the age of 50 should undergo GI endoscopy screening to rule out cancer. Early-stage cancer can be cured, but not last-stage cancer,” he said.

The rate of mortality in cases of late detection of gastrointestinal cancer is high. “If cancer is detected in the mucosa, it can be cured 100%. When it spreads to the sub-mucosa, it can be cured 70%. But when it spreads to the muscular layer, the chances of cure are only 10%,” he said.

In countries such as Japan, the rate of gastrointestinal cancer is very low because of mandatory screening, said Kazuo Hara, chairman of Aichi Cancer Centre, Japan, who was also present on the occasion.

He complimented Indian doctors for their skill in the use of endoscopy in advanced treatment of gastrointestinal cancer.

Meanwhile, Dr. Reddy said ailments such as diabetes and cancer were also linked to gastrointestinal issues. Studies to find a cure to diabetes by using a special endoscopic procedure called DMR technique, which addresses the duodenum, are in advanced stages, Dr. Reddy said.

Using AI for detection

Detection of gastrointestinal cancer at an early stage will soon be possible in India through Artificial Intelligence (AI) in endoscopy, according to Dr. Reddy.

He said AI would enable the software in endoscopes to point to early stage cancer and remove it. He described AI in endoscopy as a major advancement in the field of GI endoscopy, which will be available in India in the coming few months. “Even if regular screening shows negative, the AI will point to the cancer,” he said. Endoscopy can detect cancers early. Gatric and colon cancer can be detected at Stage 1 and removed immediately, he said.

The purpose of the conference was to create awareness about the availability of advanced technology to treat gastrointestinal problems.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ry5pi9/article30897604.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24BGMYSGIUPDATE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/there-needs-to-be-aggressive-screening-for-gi-cancer-say-experts/article30897605.ece
162,2020/02/23,"Reserve 50% of KIADB plots for MSMEs, say industry stakeholders","Stakeholders representing micro, small and medium enterprise (MSMEs) have urged the government to reserve 50% of Karnataka Industrial Area Development Board (KIADB) plots for MSME and Small-Scale Industry units.

Submitting a memorandum to Minister for Large and Medium Industries Jagadish Shettar here on Sunday, the stakeholders said though the quantum of investment was small in MSMEs and SSIs, the jobs generated were more in number and hence they should be encouraged. “These industries are not capital-intensive, but are labour-intensive,” they said.

Mysore Industries Association (MIA) said KIADB used to allot at least 60% of the industrial plots to MSMEs though there was no policy stipulating it. The remaining 40% used to be allotted to medium and large industries, as per the statistical details of the past 50 years.

However, the board resolved in one of its meetings last year that only 10% of the development plots should be earmarked for MSMEs now. This, it was pointed out, would hit the growth of MSMEs. The contribution of MSMEs to the country’s GDP and export is 45% of all industrial output, and they should be encouraged, said Mr. Vasu, president of MIA.

Mysore Chamber of Commerce and Industry (MCCI) said some of the approach roads to industrial areas were in pathetic condition. It urged the KIADB to pay attention to improving the infrastructure. The MCCI said transportation of materials had become a major issue. It also urged the Minister to reduce the KIADB land rates to make things more industry-friendly.

The KIADB was also faulted for charging penalty for delay in project implementation even if the entrepreneurs could not be held responsible for legal hurdles in starting of projects. Such cases need to be sympathetically considered and penalty should be waived, said representatives of MCCI.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/reserve-50-of-kiadb-plots-for-msmes-say-industry-stakeholders/article30897598.ece
163,2020/02/23,Government will promote industrial growth in tier II and III cities: Shettar,"Minister for Large and Medium Industries Jagadish Shettar said on Sunday that the government would focus on industrial development in tier II and III cities in the State, including Mysuru.

Speaking to mediapersons here, Mr. Shettar said that Bengaluru was saturated now and it was imperative to disperse industries to the rest of Karnataka. He said it was in this connection that an investors’ meeting was conducted in Hubballi-Dharwad for the north Karnataka region. The response to the meeting was good, he added.

Among tier II cities, he said Mysuru was important and had scope for growth. “Given its proximity to Bengaluru, the city’s industrial growth should have been rapid, but it failed to take off for various reasons,” Mr. Shettar said. “There will be an outreach programme to drum up support for investment in Mysuru and other cities.”

The Minister also said the government was serious about dispersing industries to the rest of the State and has held several meetings with stakeholders and investors. A meeting was held in Mumbai in which the country’s top industrialists participated, and it transpired that a majority had no awareness about cities other than Bengaluru in Karnataka,” Mr. Shettar said. “We highlighted the potential of Hubballi-Dharwad, Belagavi, Mysuru, Mangaluru, Vijayapura etc., and the investors were surprised as they knew only about Bengaluru. Mysuru is only synonymous with Dasara and culture in their perception,” he said.

Referring to his visit to Davos, Switzerland, with the Chief Minister, he said the outcome was encouraging and he had meetings with 50 investors and industrialists who were keen to come to Karnataka. “They expressed certain inhibitions, and these issues are being resolved now,” said Mr. Shettar.

He also said the next global investors’ meeting in Bengaluru would be held from November 3 to 5, and the expectation was that stakeholders and investors would see beyond Bengaluru. Later in the day, participating in a private programme, he said the government was pro-business, but it did not mean that all investors were from abroad. “There are a sizeable number of investors with deep pockets in the State we are are encouraging.”",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/b8mvoj/article30897593.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24BGSHETTARSTAKEHOLDERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/government-will-promote-industrial-growth-in-tier-ii-and-iii-cities-shettar/article30897594.ece

Participating in an interaction with industry bodies in Mysuru on Sunday, Mr. Shettar sought the status of the demand. When it was pointed out that the representation for according Township Authority status for Hebbal Industrial Area, which is spread across 650 acres in Mysuru, had already been submitted to the government, Mr. Shettar promised to include it in the list of proposed industrial townships he would be submitting to Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa ahead of the State Budget. “I am always for industrial townships. I want to declare four or five industrial areas as townships,” he said.

As of now, Karnataka has only one industrial township authority — Electronics City in Bengaluru. Recently, Mr. Shettar said a delegation from Peenya Industrial Area in Bengaluru also had met him with a request for township status.

The Minister’s reaction comes in the wake of the Opposition taking a strong stand against having casinos in Karnataka. Mr. Ravi tweeted on Sunday: “During my interaction with FKCCI, I had mentioned that many countries have promoted tourism through casinos. Isn’t it a fact that lakhs of Indians go abroad to play in casinos? Can anyone stop them? At the moment, there is no proposal before our government to set up casinos here.”

Criticising the proposal, however, the Karnataka Kisan Congress threatened to have card game in front of the Minister’s residence as a mark of protest.

167,2020/02/23,"Police investigating ‘conspiracy’ to instigate youth, says Home Minister","Police and Intelligence wing directed to intensity vigil on anti-CAA protests and their organisers

Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai on Sunday said the police and Intelligence agencies were investigating into the “conspiracy” of instigating youth to indulge in anti-national activities.

Speaking to reporters here, he referred to the case of Amulya Leona, who raised pro-Pakistan slogans during an anti-CAA rally, and said that a team led by top officials were probing all angles and even the CID had spread its dragnet.

Some NGOs involved in transfer of funds to a few organisations have been blacklisted and the investigating agencies were unravelling the connection between them. Even the Enforcement Directorate was alert on these developments, he said.

Mr. Bommai said certain forces were on an overdrive ever since the BJP came to the power at the Centre, but the government would thwart their designs.

Meanwhile, sources said that Mr. Bommai, who held a meeting in Bengaluru with senior police officers, sought details on the progress of investigation into the episodes of shouting pro-Pakistan slogans and displaying free-Kashmir placard.

The police and the Intelligence wing of the State police have been directed to intensity vigil on the anti-CAA protests and their organisers following the cases of Amulya and Ardra Narayanan, sources said. A special team was investigating to know if Amulya and Ardra had links with other organisations. The police are verifying their social media accounts and mobile phones.

Sources said that the police have been asked to enforce law in a stringent manner to ensure that the protests are conducted within the legal framework. The protest in Freedom Park, Bengaluru, where Amulya raised pro-Pakistan slogans, had caught both the organisers and the police off guard and led to a major embarrassment.

Mr. Bommai directed the police to take necessary measures to prevent recurrence of such incidents.

People in large numbers gathered at the taluk stadium at Basavakalyan in Bidar district on Sunday evening to oppose the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), the National Register of Citizens (NCR), and the National Population Register (NPR).

The demonstration was addressed by many leaders, including former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, activists Richa Singh from Uttar Pradesh and Mustaba Farooq from Delhi, seer Basavaprabhu Swami, MLAs Eshwar Khandre, Rahim Khan, Kaneez Fatima, Bandeppa Kashempur, B. Narayanrao, writer Ramzan Darga, and religious leaders and social activists. They criticised the Union government and said that they were targeting the poor and marginalised sections of the country.

“Right-wing forces are targeting Muslims today and they will target Christians, Dalits, Adivasis, and others. They want to replace the Constitution that offers an equal opportunity with the Manu Smriti that advocates discrimination among people.

169,2020/02/23,State police team in Senegal to bring back Ravi Pujari,"Officials are completing legal formalities: Bommai

After over a year’s struggle, the State police will soon be bringing fugitive underworld operative Ravi Pujari to Bengaluru.

Praveen Sood, DG&IGP, confirmed to The Hindu that a team of police had gone to Senegal to secure his custody and will be back soon to probe the pending cases.

The team has gone to Senegal to complete the extradition procedure. Once it is completed, he would be brought to the city, he said.

Pujari, wanted in many criminal cases, including extortion and murder, has been on the run for the last 15 years. The police had issued several red corner notices against him, following which he was arrested in Senegal last year. But owing to a technical problem, the court granted him bail.

However, he was arrested again recently by the Senegal police and handed over to the police team that went to complete the extradition formalities.

The accused, who was earlier working with Chhota Rajan and Dawood Ibrahim, split up and started his own gang. The gang, which operated in Bengaluru and Mangaluru, would gather information about wealthy people and hand it over to Pujari. He would then call the businessmen demanding protection money by dropping details of their property, business, and family members. He would also threaten them by opening fire.

In a similar modus operandi, in February 2007, a gunman wearing helmet walked into the office of Shabnam Developers owned by the then Tilak Nagar councillor Samillulla after he refused to pay ransom and fired indiscriminately killing an office assistant and a receptionist on the spot. The city police had arrested 11 persons and charged Pujari as the prime accused in the case.

Bommai confirms

Meanwhile, Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai said in Mysuru on Sunday that efforts were on to bring Pujari to Bengaluru.

He said the State officials along with their counterparts from the Centre were completing legal formalities. The top court of Senegal recently upheld the extradition of Pujari, who was on the run to evade the law in India where cases are pending against him.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/tlwm6i/article30897449.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23BGRP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/state-police-team-in-senegal-to-bring-back-ravi-pujari/article30897451.ece
170,2020/02/23,"Let there be no hurry, says DKS on Amulya episode","Former Minister says it is not right to silence others voices

Congress leader and former Minister D.K. Shivakumar on Sunday said that he would like to wait and watch before coming to a conclusion on the issue of 19-year-old student Amulya Leona raising pro-Pakistan slogans at an event in Bengaluru recently.

“I do not know what she wanted to say. I have seen her in the past. She has her own ideals. I think they are talking based on Vishwa Manava ideals. I have observed her,” he told reporters here on Sunday.

Ms. Amulya has been booked on the charge of sedition for raising pro-Pakistan slogans at a protest meeting against CAA, at Freedom Park, in which AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi was present.

“I’m against pro-Pakistan slogans and not ready to encourage this. I’m not ready to encourage any action or insult against our country. We also have to observe what has been spoken about other nations elsewhere by Ms. Amulya. Let us see and let us not be in a hurry,” Mr. Shivakumar said.

The former Minister also said that it was not right to silence others voices. Further, in an indirect reference to the BJP, he said that politics has to be done, but it is also important to understand how and when to do it. “This pertains to our country.” Regarding accusations that the Congress was behind the protests here, he said that the BJP leaders could not see beyond the Congress. “This matter pertains to the country. This is not a Congress issue.

Mr. Jarkiholi had told presspersons on Saturday that he would resign if Mr. Kumathalli said that he had betrayed him or that he had suffered injustice at his hands.

“Mr. Kumathalli has not been neglected. He will get a responsible position in the government soon. Rumours that I had betrayed him, by forcing him to resign so that I would become Minister, are false. If he tells me that I betrayed him, I will resign from the ministry,” he had said.

172,2020/02/23,Day of high drama near Moorusavir Mutt,"Two seers come with followers and hold public meetings regarding succession row

High drama prevailed near the Moorusavir Mutt here on Sunday as two seers — Dingaleshwar Swami of Balehonnur Mutt and Mallikarjun Swami of Ghataprabha — arrived with their supporters and held public meetings in connection with the Moorisavir Mutt’s succession row.

Both seers have claimed that they are the legitimate claimants to head the mutt.

Dingaleshwar Swami took out a procession from Nehru Maidan grounds and held a public meeting in front of the main entrance of the mutt as he was denied permission to hold the meeting inside the mutt premises.

Addressing the gathering, he claimed that the current seer, Gurusiddha Rajayogindra Swami, and 52 senior devotees selected him as successor to the Moorusavir Mutt in 2014.

Dingaleshwar Swami claimed that upon a request by the present seer, he had helped him sort out several issues and also helped him clear a debt of ₹1 crore.

Later, the seer put pressure on him to become his successor to the mutt, Dingaleshwar Swami further claimed.

He said he had wanted to release some documents which will support his claims at a meeting that was planned to be held in the presence of Gurusiddha Rajayogindra Swami at the mutt.

However, the meeting did not happen and he added that it was not appropriate to release such documents at a public meeting.

Challenging those making allegations against him, Dingaleshwar Swami said he would relinquish his claim if Gurusiddha Rajayogindra Swami pledges that he had not selected him as his sucessor. He also alleged that some politicians and seers are trying to prevent him from becoming the successor. The issue could be resolved soon if senior leaders like Jagadish Shettar and seers make up their minds, he said.

After the meeting, Dingaleshwar Swami entered the mutt and paid obeisance at the tombs of saints on the premises. Later, he told presspersons that he would give 45 days to resolve this issue.

Afterwards, Mallikarjun Swami also arrived with his supporters and said that he was pained by the developments. “Some elements are playing behind-the-screen tactics on the succession issue, even as the present seer still has good health and is capable of running the mutt. I was nominated as successor by the then mutt head Gangadhareshwara Swami in 1998. A case in this regard is pending in the court and let the court resolve the matter,” he added.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ltsx07/article30895809.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24BGSEER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/day-of-high-drama-near-moorusavir-mutt/article30895810.ece

Yediyurappa, will meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking the inclusion of the Koli/Kabbaliga community into the Scheduled Tribes list, chairman of Nijasharana Ambigara Chowdaiah Development Board Baburao Chinchansur said.

Addressing a press conference here on Sunday, Mr. Chinchansur said that the delegation will meet Mr. Modi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah, and Union Tribal Affairs Minister Arjun Munda and urge them to include all sub-groups of the community in the Scheduled Tribes.

An earlier proposal to accord ST status to the community was rejected by the Union government, he said, and added that the delegation will approach the Centre with additional information.

Mr. Yediyurappa, during his campaign for the Assembly and the Lok Sabha elections, had promised the voters that he will pressure the Union government and make all efforts to include the Koli/Kabbaliga community in the Scheduled Tribes list.

Mr. Modi at an election rally in Kalaburagi also gave an assurance of resolving the issue.

Recalling the long-drawn struggle of the late leader Vital Herur, for the inclusion of the Kabbaliga, the Koli, the Ambiga, the Bestha, and the Gangamatha communities into Scheduled Tribes list, Mr. Chinchansur said that his dream would become a reality.

The birth anniversary of social reformer and poet Nijasharana Ambigara Chowdaiah will be celebrated on a grand scale at Hagaragundagi village in Kalaburagi district on March 8.

He said that Deputy Chief Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan will unveil the statue of the poet on the occasion.

174,2020/02/23,Breaking barriers with Yakshagana,"A young Muslim woman overcame resistance to acquire prowess in the art form

Unlike Mohammed Ghouse, Jokatte Mohammed and Jabbar Samo, who are well-known Yakshagana artistes in coastal Karnataka, Arshiya is a relatively new entrant to the art form. But she is growing in popularity.

There are far fewer women Yakshagana artistes compared to men, and a Muslim woman exponent is rare. At one time, this traditional art form was forbidden for women.

Arshiya, in her 20s, and working in an automobile company, was fascinated by it as a child and performed her first ‘prasangas’ (episodes) when she was 10 in her village, Okkethur Mada, near Vitla in Dakshina Kannada. She is perfecting her skills at Kadali Kala Kendra in Mangaluru.

She grew up in an atmosphere where Yakshagana was all pervasive but it was a teacher of this traditional style, Jayaram, at Jaycees English Medium School in Vitla, who kindled her interest. “The role of Mahishasura in a Devi Mahatme episode which I watched during childhood mesmerised me. I got addicted to bannada vesha (villain roles),” she said.

Many characters

“The most enthralling part of Yakshagana is the pravesha (entry) of bannada vesha. I still love it and enjoy performing,” she said, recalling her portrayal of Nishambhasura, Raktha Beejasura and Mahishasura in Devi Mahatme.

Going by the stage name of Tanu Vitla, she is also learning to play the ‘chende’, a percussion instrument, under Ramesh Bhat of Kadali Kala Kendra.

Mr. Bhat said Ms. Arshiya was “in the process of learning to use complicated Yakshagana make–up”. She is also likely the first woman from the Muslim community in Yakshagana.

Entry into the field was not a cake walk. Though family members were supportive, some other members of the community were not. Overcoming such resistance and against all odds, she has performed in Mangaluru, Udupi, Karwar and Belagavi.

Her colleague in the automobile company, Prakruthi, said that Ms. Arshiya prompted her also to learn Yakshagana and she has been taking lessons for four months. Senior artiste S.N. Bhat Bayar said the country’s heritage and culture recognised no religious barriers.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/fgnyc1/article30891126.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH23ASHRIYA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/breaking-barriers-with-yakshagana/article30891127.ece

Had he lost his balance, he would have fallen onto the ground, eye-witnesses said.The alert was sent by a few people in the area who woke up to a disturbance and went to investigate.

At 6.15 a.m., Jagadeesh, a tenant of a flat in the building, heard a commotion on the third floor. When he went to investigate, he saw the man sitting on the outer ledge. Jagadeesh alerted the police control room as people began gathering on the street below. “In order to prevent the man from falling, the police tied his hands and body to the window grille and alerted the Fire Department who rescued him after an hour-long operation.

176,2020/02/23,How the tribals in Karnataka fought against prejudice to get their land,"The order on grant of land cites The Hindu report (June 23, 2019), highlighting their plight

The Hassan district administration has reserved 20 guntas of land for 13 families of Sudugadu Sidda, a semi-nomadic tribe, settled at Bettada Sathenahalli in Holenarasipur taluk.

Deputy Commissioner R. Girish has issued an order reserving the grazing land in survey number 138 in the village, as per section 71 of the Karnataka Land Revenue Act, 1964. Earlier, the community’s plea for land was rejected by the taluk administration, referring to the community as people ‘prone to stealing’. The Hindu carried a report on June, 23, 2019, on the plight of the tribals and the tahsildar’s objectionable comments.

KSHRC case

Following the report, Karnataka State Human Rights Commission registered a suo-motu case and directed the district administration to file a report. Later, K.R. Srinivas, the tahsildar visited the place and submitted a report after looking for suitable land for the families. He recommended the district administration reserving 20 guntas of land for the community. The same was forwarded by the Assistant Commissioner of Hassan. The DC, in his final order, referred to the news report published in The Hindu.

The Sudagadu Sidda families have been living in thatched huts here for eight years. While their children hardly go to school, elders go around the villages to collect hair and sell utensils. Youth take up construction work and agriculture labour.They had applied for the land, but other residents of the village complained to the taluk administration that Sudugadu Sidda people steal crops and urged the officers not to grant them land near the village.

Mr. Srinivas had rejected the application for land citing the objections of residents. He had also stated that the tribal people did not require land as they kept moving from place to place.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ocgh7t/article30892427.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22BGHASSANTRIBALFAMILY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/tribals-get-land-after-fight-against-prejudice/article30892428.ece

However, as teachers and lecturers, employees serving with Department of Health and Family Welfare and other departments considered as essential services work on fourth Saturdays, they had demanded a restoration of their CL.

178,2020/02/23,Buses for cancer detection to roll out in rural areas,"Health Department to launch 8 fully-equipped buses this year

To help in early detection of cancer in rural areas, the State Health Department is set to launch eight fully-equipped cancer detection buses under the ‘Pink Bus’ project this year.

Sources in the department told The Hindu that the proposal had been included in the State Budget to be presented on March 5. As early diagnosis of cancer generally increases the chances of successful treatment, the focus is on detecting symptomatic patients as early as possible. Delays in accessing cancer care are common with late-stage presentation, particularly in lower resource settings and vulnerable populations.

Pink Bus project

The ‘Pink Bus’ project is an extension of the two cancer detection buses run by the State-run Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology. The buses, equipped with cancer detection equipment, including ultrasound, X-ray, mammogram for breast examination, and colposcope for cervix examination, have been donated to the institute by Bharat Electroncis Ltd. (BEL) and the Association of Kannada Kootas of America (AKKA).

Although the proposal was chalked out during the tenure of the previous JD(S)–Congress coalition government headed by H.D. Kumaraswamy, it did not materialise.

“The eight buses will be procured under the National Health Mission funds and will be manned by a team of doctors, paramedical staff, and technicians. The buses will also have a laboratory for collecting blood and biopsy samples. They will be stationed in different districts based on the need,” sources said.

Early detection is key

The sources said that the buses would also be used to create awareness specifically on early detection of cancer.

Kidwai director C. Ramachandra said the consequences of delayed or inaccessible cancer care are lower likelihood of survival, greater morbidity of treatment, and higher costs of care. “Early diagnosis improves cancer outcomes and is therefore an important public health strategy,” he said.

Dr. Ramachandra said early detection is the key, especially in breast cancer that has seen the highest rise in incidence in the last two decades.

“The goal of screening for early breast cancer detection is to identify breast abnormalities as early as possible. A mammogram can find breast cancer before it can be felt,” he said.

“The incidence of breast cancer was 26 per 1 lakh people two decades ago. Now it has gone up to 34 per 1 lakh people. This trend is more prevalent among younger women. While hormonal imbalance is one of the causes, late marriage, late conception, early menarche and menopause are also contributing factors,” he added.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/q5f7be/article30892366.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22BGCANCERDETECTIONUNITBUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/buses-for-cancer-detection-to-roll-out-in-rural-areas/article30892368.ece
179,2020/02/23,Mutt row: ‘Satya Darshana’ meeting unlikely to happen,"Incumbent seer has opposed event called by claimant

Even as the dust over the succession row of Moorusavir Mutt refuses to settle down, Sunday’s ‘Satya Darshana’ meeting, called by one of the claimants Dingaleshwar Swami, is unlikely to happen after opposition by the current seer, Gurusiddha Rajayogindra Swami, and a large section of his followers, including leaders from various political parties.

While district in-charge Minister Jagadish Shettar and the former Minister Basavaraj Horatti have already distanced themselves from the issue and ruled out attending the meeting, the police are taking every measure to prevent any law and order problem. Mr. Shettar has said that as the matter is before the court, the question of appointing a successor should not be discussed at present and should be decided after the verdict.

Dingaleshwar Swami had thrown a challenge to enter the mutt on Sunday [February 23] and hold the ‘Satya Darshana’ meeting to “reveal the truth” about the succession row.

He had invited his followers and followers of the mutt to come to the mutt premises on Sunday and had already announced that he would take out a padayatra from Nehru stadium to the mutt on Sunday before holding the meeting.

What has added to the confusion among devotees is that there is a division among the BJP leaders over the issue.

While the former MP from BJP Vijay Sankeshwar, who has resigned from the core committee, has extended his support to make Dingaleshwar Swami the successor, his partymen and members of the core committee, Mohan Limbikai and Shankranna Munavalli, have stood in support of the incumbent seer. “How can one who has no authority over the mutt convene a meeting at the mutt without the consent of the current seer. It will not be allowed,” Mr. Limbikai has said.

Interestingly, Mr. Sankeshwar clarified that he would not be in town on Sunday as he has some prior engagements.

Most of the other members of the core committee and some of the seers have chosen not to speak on the issue publicly.

Meanwhile, followers of the present seer are also up in arms against holding any such meeting. Amid all these developments, another claimant for mutt’s succession Mallikarjun Swami of Ghataprabha too has sought police permission for holding a meeting at the mutt on Sunday.

As this is likely to generate much heat, there is no clarity on whether the police would permit the meeting.

When contacted, Police Commissioner R. Dileep said that they had been only asked to provide requisite security and accordingly they would take steps.

By Saturday evening, the security around Moorusavir Mutt had been further increased with barricades being put and a posse of police personnel being deployed for bandobast.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mutt-row-satya-darshana-meeting-unlikely-to-happen/article30892283.ece
180,2020/02/23,Hard-coated grains tough to process: Farmers,"One of the problems faced by millet farmers is of processing. Some millets like korale are hard-coated grains requiring processing multiple times. Unprocessed millets are difficult to sell.

Unlike ragi and jowar, popular millets requiring least processing and are part of staple diets, other millets require processing before they can be consumed.

Traditionally, these millets were pounded using stones to make them fit for consumption. Those in the industry say Proso millet (Baragu), Brown Top millet (Korale), Kodo millet (Arka), Barn Yard millet (Udalu), Little Millet (Save) and Fox-tailed millet (Navane) all require intense processing.

For example, farmer leader G. Narasimha Reddy said we need to make korale rice, from korale in specially designed flour mills. According to him, while farmers of Andhra Pradesh have such mills, similar ones are not present in Pavagada taluk.

A Haveri-based millet owner said that with limited millet mills, farmers will be in a difficult position to sell unprocessed millets directly.

“There has to be a purchase agreement,” the miller said.

Krupa T., president, Karnataka State Cooperative Organic Agriculture Produce Marketing Federation, said that running a millet mill was expensive compared to a normal rice mill.

“The millets have to be processed five to six times to be fit for consumption. There are local mills in the cooperative sector that are running on single machine where the level of manual intervention is high. We have to be careful during processing else the product can be rejected in the market,” said Mr. Krupa, who also heads one of the largest millet mills in the State.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/fmidlu/article30892279.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23BGMILLET,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/hard-coated-grains-tough-to-process-farmers/article30892280.ece

Home Minister and district in charge of Haveri Basavaraj Bommai has called on youngsters not to limit themselves to a single degree or a course, but make efforts to develop soft skills required for the competitive world in order to get job offers.

He inaugurated the district-level job fair, organised at Hukkeri Mutt’s Shivalingeshwar College for Women, by various government departments in Haveri on Saturday. The Minister said that he would suggest the departments to organise district-level job fairs once in six months.

This will provide job opportunities to candidates possessing various certificates in different skills apart from those who had undergone regular couses, he said.

“In a country with 45% of the population young, there is a need to utilise the youth power to develop the country’s economy. There is also need for job opportunities that help youth to build their lives and for that to happen, they have to develop soft skills in accordance with the changed global scenario,” he said.

Admitting that there is still a lot of difference in the schooling in urban and rural areas, he emphasised the need for the younger generation from rural areas to make efforts to develop the required skills in compete in the global market.

Shivakumar Udasi, MP, called on the youth to accept the offer given to them and work without any inhibitions about the nature of the work. “Skill-based education has become a necessity in the changed global scenario now. The governments are contemplating introducing skill-based curriculum right from the primary education level,” he said.

Presiding over the function, Nehru Olekar, MLA, concurred with what Mr. Udasi had said and called on the candidates to accept the initial offers, work, gain experience, and look for better opportunities based on the experience. Deputy Commissioner of Haveri Krishna Bajpai briefed about the job fair. As many as 7,000 candidates had registered at the fair where 3,500 jobs were on offer. On the first day of the job fair 2,154 candidates appeared for the interview.

182,2020/02/23,Return not beneficial,"Farmers in the perennially drought-hit Pavagada taluk, who had stopped cultivating millets for over three decades in favour of groundnuts, have grown korale this year owing to a steep rise in price last year. However, the lack of mills, continued drought and poor marketing facilities have hit them hard.

Sathyarayana, a farmer in Arsikere in Pavagada taluk, said: “The korale I grow is not in demand in the market whereas the korale rice got from the mill has a lot of demand in the market.” He said the korale he has grown has a market price of ₹2,000 ₹2,200 per quintal in the wholesale market. According to him, with the prevailing cost, it is difficult recover investment. “I had spent ₹15,000 to grow korale on my three acres of land for seeds, fertilizers, labour cost and the yield is just two quintals due to lack of rains.”

Ramanji, a farmer in Chikkathimmanahatti of Pavagada taluk, recalled that his father and grandfather had grown millets. “But owing to poor returns, they shifted to groundnuts.

To equip students with digital readiness, Andhra Pradesh Social Welfare Residential Education Society (APSWRES) collaborated with Intel India for a series of Atal Tinkering Lab (ATL) bootcamps.

Nine engineering students mentored 528 students of 52 social welfare schools in seven districts of the state at the end of which, the young learners presented projects that included a servo-controlled robotic hand, a device to detect alcohol and gas, tools to test moisture in soil, an earthquake indicator, joy stick with an LED blinking circuit, and a rain-detector. They did this using the Arduino Uno software and Internet of Things and different sensors.

The mentors, Mayuresh Shelke, M.Gayathri, G. Amarendra, B Prasuna, A. Pavan Rahul, PVVGRN Sai Lokesh, Durga Prasad, S. Siva and KVV Satya Naresh, were all praise for the young students who they said were quick on the uptake. They also urged the students to build their skills and find indigenous technology-based solutions to problems around them.

“This is an attempt to bridge the digital divide and close the technology gap between the rich and the pooras most children in our schools are from low income families who may not have access to computers and other electronic devices at home,” said K. Nagamani, Principal of AP Balayogi School at Maluguru in Anantapur district.

Students took away various things from the bootcamp. M.V. Jignasha and KLSP Varshini, students of class nine said that equipped now with the knowledge, they would continue to explore new things at ATL. K. Deepika went away feeling more confident about her coding skills and Devika swore that her self confidence was several notches up.

The Secretary of the Society V. Ramulu sounded pleased when he said these events not only changed the students’ perspective towards education but also helped the teachers in preparing dynamic multi-media educational lessons, which in turn would keep students interested. He believed that students preferred visually-stimulating and interactive educational material and enjoyed collaborating with peers and using an inquiry-based approach. “We want our children to use technology in a healthy way and pick up skills needed to be successful digital citizens,” he concluded.",education,https://www.thehindu.com/education/lqwcit/article30897537.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BZ22DIGITAL,https://www.thehindu.com/education/building-bridges/article30897541.ece
184,2020/02/23,A few notches short of an absolute entertainer,"Glitches in script and editing, a major let-down of Paapam Cheyyathavar...

In the Gospel of John, it is Jesus Christ who challenges the Pharisees by asking the one without sin to cast the first stone when they bring in an adulteress to be punished. But in Paapam Cheyyathavar Kalleriyatte it is a zonked out Madhupal who utters the profound statement, his only task in the film other than looking lost and smoking weed.

The film, Shambhu Purushothaman’s second outing after the highly underrated Vedivazhipadu, is a satire in which nobody is spared from the disgrace of dark humour.

It is a film where each character is a caricature, each scene part of a freakish chain reaction. At the same time it lacks the unbridled hilarity of Purushothaman’s first film and seems contrived and less edgier when it comes to taunting morality and misogyny.

Betrothal and afterwards

The film centres around a Christian betrothal and a major part of the film unravels during the post-event celebrations.

In the very opening scene we are introduced to two elite families and an alliance being arranged.

The groom’s family is broke following some business misadventures, but they show so sign of it and have their hopes pinned on the ₹10-crore dowry.

On the other hand, the bride’s family is not squeaky clean either with their own skeletons in the cupboard. But both the parties believe in family status and the unbeatable merit of affluence. Though the ceremony takes place as planned, the situation spirals out of control due to some unforeseen developments.

The film addresses a whole bunch of issues, but it lacks that tongue-firmly-in-cheek candour, mainly due to a script that misses spontaneity and brevity at parts. Though the film is able to engage you in one level, you easily identify the flaws in comic timing and attempts at concocting a surreal flavour towards the climax. The film has an array of smile-inducing moments, but there are times when you can feel blandness seeping straight in. One major let-down of the film is its soundscape that does absolutely nothing to salvage the narrative while editing is another problem area.

The film has an impressive cast with Vinay Forrt, Tini Tom, Santhy Balachandran, Srinda and Arun Kurian playing the key roles along with a bunch of talented actors in supporting roles. But Paapam Cheyyathavar Kalleriyatte never outgrows their performances and the glitches in the script stop the film from hitting the mark of an absolute entertainer.

185,2020/02/23,BSNL staff readying for hunger strike,"₹69,000-crore revival package for BSNL and MTNL not fully implemented

The employees of Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd. (BSNL) are gearing up for yet another protest against the delay in implementation of the revival package promised by the Central government, which includes allotment of 4G spectrum.

On Monday, the employees, under the aegis of the All Unions and Associations of BSNL, will be organising hunger strikes across major BSNL offices in the State as part of a countrywide protest. The Union Cabinet had, in September 2019, approved a ₹69,000-crore revival package for both BSNL and MTNL.

The promises in this package included the allotment of 4G spectrum, the issuing of sovereign guarantee for raising funds to the tune of ₹15,000 crore (₹8,500 crore for BSNL and ₹6,500 crore for MTNL) by way of issuing long-term bonds, monetisation of assets, and implementation of a voluntary retirement scheme (VRS).

Employees’ unions allege that out of these, only the VRS had been implemented, through which 78,569 BSNL employees left the company earlier this month.

But, no step had been taken to allot 4G spectrum or issuing the sovereign guarantee, despite four months elapsing after the Cabinet decision.

Cash crunch

Union leaders said that the recent Supreme Court judgement, ordering private telecom companies to pay thousands of crores of rupees in adjusted gross revenue (AGR), had caused uncertainties in the telecom sector, owing to which banks were also unwilling to extend the much-needed loans to BSNL.

Because of the delay in the allotment of 4G spectrum and also due to the non-availability of funds, BSNL’s 4G service was unlikely to be launched before the end of 2020. In these circumstances, BSNL was not able to improve revenue generation and was suffering from acute cash crunch.

The employees were not getting salary on time and the wages of the contract workers had not been paid for the past 10 months.

The deductions made from employees’ salaries, on account of GPF, bank loan EMI, society dues, and LIC premium had not been remitted by the BSNL management to the organisations concerned. As a result of this, the employees were unable to get GPF and society loans.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/bsnl-staff-readying-for-hunger-strike/article30897519.ece

189,2020/02/23,Bridge reconstruction plan gains ground in Alappuzha,"SIA study of the ₹98.90-crore project to be submitted soon

The plan to reconstruct the District Court bridge in Alappuzha has gained momentum.

A report based on the Social Impact Assessment (SIA) study being conducted by the Rajagiri Educational Alternatives and Community Health (outREACH) Service Society, a wing of the Rajagiri College of Social Sciences, Kalamassery, will be submitted to authorities soon.

Last week, as part of the SIA, a public hearing was organised. As per the assessment, around 200 people, a majority of them traders, will be affected by the project. Besides, eight classrooms, toilets, and a portion of the compound wall of the SDV school will have to be demolished. A total of 2.8 acres of land will have to be acquired for the project.

The existing court bridge across the Vada canal has a length of 33 m and a width of 7.5 m. Six roads merge at the two approaches to the bridge and heavy traffic congestion affects the smooth flow of traffic on the Alappuzha-Madurai State Highway.

The proposal is to build a new elevated bridge, a set of underpasses, ramp roads and flyovers on either side of the canal, which is expected to help ease traffic congestion in Alappuzha town.

No signals

As per the detailed project report prepared by the Public Work Department’s (PWD) bridges design unit, the flyover is designed as a roundabout with no signals. Vehicles from YMCA Junction will pass through the underpass to reach the KSRTC bus station, Punnamada, Changanassery Road, and Kollam and vehicles going to Mullakkal and Vaikom can use the flyover.

Vehicles from Thiruvananthapuram side can use both the flyover and underpass to reach Punnamada. Those coming from Mullakkal may use the flyover to reach Vaikom, YMCA Junction, and the KSRTC bus station.

On the Mullakkal side, a few box-type structures of size 5.8 m x 5.2 m under the ramp road have been proposed to rehabilitate the existing shops on the same side. Reconstruction of the Alappuzha boat jetty is also proposed.

The project will be implemented by the Kerala Road Fund Board at a cost of ₹98.90 crore. It will be funded by the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB).",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/bridge-reconstruction-plan-gains-ground-in-alappuzha/article30897437.ece
190,2020/02/23,Strawberry park to open today,"Agriculture Minister V.S. Sunilkumar to open park at Munnar

A strawberry park has been set up at Munnar, which will be made a strawberry hub. Agriculture Minister V.S. Sunilkumar will inaugurate the park on Monday.

The Agriculture Department, Horticulture Mission, Horticorp, and Haritha Keralam Mission, with the support of the United Nations Development Project (UNDP), have drawn up a plan to make Munnar a centre of strawberry cultivation.

The fruit was first cultivated in the Kanan Devan Hills Plantation (KDHP) areas on a trial basis over a decade ago and the crop spread slowly to nearby Kanthallur and Vattavada.

Farmers in the two villages largely shifted to strawberry cultivation in 2012-13 and model strawberry farms were set up by the Agriculture Department at Kanthallur in 2015. However, lack of processing units proved a dampener as the fruit is easily perishable. The farmers were forced to sell the fruit at ₹85 a kg with many abandoning the cultivation altogether.

Now, a processing unit has been opened by the Horticorp at the strawberry park.

200 farmers

Prince Mathew, deputy director, State Horticulture Mission, told The Hindu on Saturday that 200 farmers of Devikulam taluk were engaged in strawberry cultivation in 70 ha of land. The plan was to increase the cultivation to 100 ha of land. Climatic conditions in Devikulam was most favourable for the crop, he said, adding that tourists would be allowed to pluck the fruit from the farm at the park.

In addition, all value-added products, including strawberry jam, squash, honey preserve, and strawberry preserve are made available at the unit.

The Horticulture Mission provided 1.5 lakh saplings free of cost to the farmers last year and the harvest has already begun.

The processing unit directly procure strawberry from the farmers at ₹400 a kg. After the ripe fruit is harvested, it takes the plant five days to be ready for the next bout.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/pa94m6/article30897427.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/tv24stawberr,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/strawberry-park-to-open-today/article30897418.ece

The ritualistic ‘Pantheerayirom vazhipadu’ in connection with the 10-day annual festival at the centuries’ old Sreevallabha Temple at Thiruvalla was held with religious fervour on Sunday.

Hundreds of devotees, including women and children, took part in the procession, carrying the special variety of `kaali’ plantains, to the Sreevallabha Temple from the Sree Mahadevar Temple in the adjoining village of Thukalasserry in the morning.

Renowned Chenda exponent, Thiruvalla Radhakrishnan, led the Panchavadyam team.

As is the custom and ritualistic tradition, a total of 12,001 plantains were offered to the presiding deity as part of the ritual held as a prelude to the 10-day temple festival that begins on Thursday.

The plantains offered to the deity were distributed as prasadom among the devotees after the auspicious ‘Pantheeradipuja’ at the temple, later.

The temple chief priest (Tantri), Prameswaran Vasudevan Bhattathirippad of Thekkedathu Kuzhikkattu Illom, will lead the Kodiyettu ceremony, marking the beginning of the annual festival.

195,2020/02/23,Water hyacinth hits boat services,"Cruises, water distribution disrupted in Kottayam backwaters

Even as the water level in all rivers across the region has begun to drop with the rising temperature, the bobbing green sheets of water hyacinth is gradually bringing life to a halt in the backwater landscape of Kottayam.

According to officials with the State Water Transport Department (SWTD), the water transport system in the region, especially in areas beyond the R-block, has been thrown into complete disarray as the entire canals and rivers adjoining the Vembanad Lake are clogged up with the floating plant.

More time

For instance, it takes the SWTD boats at least 20 minutes to negotiate the two-km-long stretch from Panchikadavu to Kanjiram, which is occupied by thick mats of the water plant. The rapid proliferation of the weed has also forced the department to cut short the services to locations like Kumarakom and Changanassery.

“The timings of our services in the Kottayam-Alappuzha sector, which enjoys patronage from the commuters and tourists alike, have been severely affected. Though no cancellations have been made so far, we cannot operate through these plants for long as it will damage the shaft or leaf of the boat engines. Similarly, logs or other debris are often hidden within the weeds and the boat crew will not be able to identify such hazards during service,” said Rajan, SWTD Senior Superintendent in Kottayam.

According to him, any disruption in the operation of these boats is bound to affect hundreds of commuters, including school students, from the low-lying western interiors of the district, especially during the upcoming examination season.

Besides the passenger services, these densely intertwined carpets have taken a toll on the tourism industry as well. “These plants keep gently rolling in the winds and can chock an entire canal in a matter of few hours. Taking this into consideration, we have now rescheduled the houseboat cruises to the morning hours though it is the sunset cruise that remains the most- favourite package,” explained K. Arun Kumar, secretary, Chamber of Vembanad Hotels and Resorts (CVHR).

Meanwhile, the weeds have also affected transporting of drinking water to the Upper Kuttanad area and movement of paddy from fields, in addition to the inland fisheries sector.

Clearing weeds

The Kottayam District administration, in coordination with the local bodies have launched a drive to clear the weeds near the Kumarakom jetty, the operation is yet to gather steam due to shortage of wee harvesting machines . At present, the operations are being carried out using only one machine while a second one, which is undergoing repairs, will join the fleet in the next couple of days.

“The weeds keep coming in from the lake even as we clear the canals. Taking note of this, the local bodies have been requested to mark the boundaries of these canals using nets and the matter will be taken up with the District Collector for scaling up the operation,” said Muhammad Sheriff, Assistant Engineer of the Department of Agriculture, who coordinates the weed-harvesting initiative.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/8z5ei/article30897368.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/tv24shoues,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/water-hyacinth-hits-boat-services/article30897362.ece

Different Central agencies including Military Intelligence and National Investigation Agency (NIA) will join Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) to probe the discovery of foreign make bullets suspected to be manufactured in Pakistan from Kulathupuzha.

The live bullets wrapped in a newspaper were found abandoned near Muppathadipalam on Saturday and it was civilians who spotted the package and alerted the police.

POF markings

Reportedly, the bullets have the initials POF (Pakistan Ordnance Factories) inscribed on them hinting at the possibility of their Pakistan origin.

Since POF is Pakistan's largest arms and ammunition supplier headquartered in Wah Cantonment, the case has been handed over to ATS and ATS Deputy Inspector General of Police Anoop Kuruvila will be in charge of the probe.

According to ballistics experts, the 7.62x51 mm bullets are not used by any forces in India and their specifications show that they were made in 1980-81. “None of the bullets are made in India, though they can be used to feed machine guns like AK47. Indian Armed Forces do not use such bullets in their assault weapons,” said an official.

No connection

Meanwhile, Crime Branch officials who inspected the bullets confirmed that they have no connection with the ones missing from the Special Armed Police camp.

Major Mukesh from Military Intelligence and officials Vinod Kumar and Ashok from NIA Kochi unit visited the spot on Sunday and collected details related to the case.

The detailed statement of Joshy, a lorry driver, who found the bullets and alerted the police, was also recorded by the different teams.

Reportedly, the police retrieved a receipt in Tamil from the location which is also very near to the border. “In this case we require assistance from other States and we have already started coordinating with them. Central agencies were contacted after we found the markings and preliminary investigation revealed that the bullets were foreign make,” said Director General of Police Lokanath Behera.

The bullets are currently kept at Kulathupuzha police station while police and forest officials have been put on a high alert since the discovery of the bullets.

Forest officials had conducted an extensive search in the area on Saturday night with the help of bomb squad from Kollam using metal detectors. “ATS will be handling the case and currently it is a joint investigation and many agencies are involved.

The government recently voiced its intention to adjust class hours in colleges from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. in place of the current practice of 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. While citing the possible advantages of the move, Higher Education Minister K.T. Jaleel had pointed out that the reform could enable students to engage in part-time jobs or internships so as to earn while studying. Besides, the change would provide ample time for extra-curricular and research activities. It could also usher in other benefits, including reduce traffic congestions during peak hours.

However, the proposal has not gone down well with the teaching community, particularly the pro-Left organisations, which cited several hurdles. Though well-intentioned, the move could create a major disruption for large sections, they said.

Flatly opposing the move, All Kerala Private College Teachers’ Association general secretary P.N. Harikumar said the change in timings was not feasible in the State, considering the inadequacies that existed in allied facilities.

“We have several students who travel long distances from the high ranges and remote areas to reach their colleges. For instance, the Catholicate College in Pathanamthitta has numerous day scholars who travel from far-off places at Thannithode, Thekkuthode and Seethathode. Similar is the situation that existed for colleges at Mananthavady, Attappady and Kattappana, With very few bus services commencing before 7 a.m., it would be extremely difficult for students to reach classes on time.” he said.

While echoing the view, Association of Kerala Government College Teachers general secretary N. Manoj highlighted the inconvenience that could be faced by teachers who would be forced to reorient their activities in accordance to the modified work timings.

Proposing an alternative, Dr. Harikumar called for trialling the reform in the study departments of universities, considering most postgraduate students and research scholars resided in hostels.

The Students Federation of India (SFI) has termed the idea a progressive reform and extended full support to the proposal. The opportunity to intern in institutions or companies would equip students to enhance their employability, SFI State secretary Sachin Dev said.

Kerala Students Union (KSU) State president K.M. Abhijith, however, adopted a guarded view by pointing out that the proposed move offered both advantages and disadvantages. Pointing out that the organisation was yet to form an opinion, he said the suggestions of students would be generated to explore its feasibility.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/mixed-response-to-change-in-college-timings/article30896511.ece
199,2020/02/23,VACB to probe PSC insider links,"Raids on coaching centres yield evidence

The Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB) will verify whether any insider had let drop hints about questions likely to figure in Kerala Public Service Commission (PSC) tests to managers of private coaching centres that offer instruction to candidates to get government jobs.

Investigators are verifying whether the government officials who moonlighted as teachers for the training centres had any contact with those in the classified section of the PSC, which is primarily responsible for framing questions papers and setting answer keys.

They will also interview subject experts who aid the PSC frame question papers for tests to see whether any pattern of collusion emerges. The agency also caught a Fire and Rescue Services Department official red-handed for taking classes after having allegedly bunked work.

Investigators said two Secretariat officers in the General Administration Department were the prime movers behind the two coaching centres now under the ambit of their inquiry. There could be more officers who financially benefited from the coaching centres. The suspect officers had employed several of their colleagues as teachers at their institutions.

Their presence of Secretariat officials as trainers had helped shore-up the word-of-mouth campaign that job aspirants stood a higher chance of landing a government job if they enrolled in the coaching centres at a sizeable fee.

An official said that some of the officials posed to enrol candidates with uncanny confidence that they knew the contours of upcoming PSC tests and likely questions. The agency has earmarked several students on the attendance rolls for questioning.

The VACB seized scores of documents in the surprise raids. Importantly, they included voucher payments made to government officials who stand in as trainers during office hours.

Kerala's unemployment rate is higher than the national average. PSC coaching centres have mushroomed across the State, attracting job aspirants in droves. The government is deeply concerned about the PSC's integrity and has asked the body to warn coaching centres from using its name on billboards to lure students.

It is also worried that the Opposition will use the scandal to turn public opinion against the current disposition.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/vacb-to-probe-psc-insider-links/article30896291.ece
200,2020/02/23,Noose tightens around Sivakumar in assets case,"VACB to expedite steps to open bank locker of the former Minister

The Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB) will approach the Vigilance Special Court here on Monday for a search warrant to open the bank locker of former Health Minister and Congress legislator V.S. Sivakumar who is facing prosecution for “illegal amassment of wealth.”

The VACB team had already asked the bank authorities not to allow Mr. Sivakumar to open the bank locker. The investigating team will be formally putting a formal request in writing to this effect to the bank authorities on Monday even as they move the court for a search warrant to open the locker.

The VACB move comes in the wake of Mr. Sivakumar informing the VACB sleuths that the key of the locker is not in his possession and that the locker was not being used by him for several years. The details of the locker were unearthed by the VACB during the 13-hour raid on his residence at Sasthamangalam on Wednesday.

The VACB, which had seized 56 documents during the raid, will also be submitting a detailed report on the raid and the remaining documents to the Special Court on Monday.

Some of the documents seized in the raid from the residence of three other persons, including Mr. Sivakumar's personal chauffeur and a lawyer, had already been submitted in the court. The VACB had simultaneously raided the residences of the other three persons named as accused along with Mr. Sivakumar.

The agency also decided to have a close look into the bank accounts of Mr. Sivakumar in the State Bank of India and Canara Bank. The VACB will approach the two banks for details.

The VACB also expanded the investigating team by including an account audit officer and more policemen. Superintendent of Police, Special Cell, VACB, V.S.

201,2020/02/23,Move to drop ivory case against Mohanlal comes under cloud,"NOC for withdrawing wildlife crime case against actor Mohanlal

The State government, which issued a no objection certificate (NOC) for withdrawing the wildlife crime case booked against actor Mohanlal, will have a lot of explaining to do regarding the public interest involved in the decision.

The withdrawal of the prosecution in a case by invoking Section 321 of the Criminal Procedure Code is the discretion of the Public Prosecutor. However, the prosecutor needs to convince the court that the withdrawal is in the interest of the administration of justice. The court should also appreciate the reasons cited for withdrawal and convince itself that the application was not made under pressure or any other extraneous considerations, said a former public prosecutor.

Cases should be withdrawn with the consent of the court, only if the prosecutor felt that it would serve the larger public interest, he said.

While considering the application for withdrawal, the court also had to find out whether the prosecutor had applied his mind in deciding to withdraw the case and he was not merely carrying out the decision of the government. The Supreme Court had recently pointed out that the Public Prosecutors should act as independent persons and should not be guided by the instructions of the government. The court also suggested that Public Prosecutors should not act like post offices, a senior lawyer said.

The judicial officer can reject the application for withdrawal of the case if he is not convinced about the public interest involved in the decision. Recently, the Special Court trying cases against MLAs and MPs had rejected the State government’s plea to withdraw a case booked against V.K.C. Mammad Koya, MLA, sources said.

Earlier, the Vigilance Special Court, Thrissur, had rejected the UDF government's decision to withdraw the palmolein import case against former Chief Minister K. Karunakaran, judicial sources pointed out.

While considering the withdrawal application, the court may send notices to the petitioners concerned in the case. It can even permit public-spirited persons to implead themselves in cases, judicial sources pointed out.

CPI(M) leader V.S. Achuthanandan had thus successfully challenged a decision of the UDF government to withdraw a case booked against Kerala Congress (B) leader R. Balakrishna Pillai, legal sources pointed out.

Since the offence committed was against a central law, the Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972, only a prosecutor appointed by the Central government or a State prosecutor authorised by the Central government could move the application for withdrawal of prosecution, pointed out judicial sources.

The Hindu had on Friday reported that the State government had issued an NOC for withdrawing the case against the actor. Mr. Mohanlal was arraigned as first accused in the case for procurement and keeping elephant tusks.

The trial of the case is being held at the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Perumbavoor.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/5vfbom/article30877480.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH20KRAMOHANLAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ivory-case-govt-should-explain-stand/article30895765.ece
202,2020/02/23,PSC coaching centres in Kerala on Vigilance radar,"Coaching centres may have aided students to cheat in exams

The Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB) on Sunday targeted at least three ‘Public Service Commission (PSC) coaching centres’ on the suspicion their managements had aided students on their rolls to cheat in the examinations for government jobs.

Investigators said they suspected that the managements had used a WhatsApp group created for their trainees to indicate the questions and topics likely to figure in PSC tests, including the Kerala Administrative Service (KAS) examinations held on Saturday. More than 3.82 lakh students had appeared for the KAS exams.

Whistleblowers

The alleged scam came to light when a set of candidates had informed PSC chairman M.K. Sakeer that they suspected a bid to rig PSC tests by the private centres.

Mr. Sakeer informed the government, which ordered the VACB enquiry.

Investigators said the scandal was likely to sweep up several government Secretariat staff.

The complainants had alleged that the officials owned and operated the coaching centres in the name of other persons.

They alleged that the officials had access to those who prepared probable questions for PSC tests. A secret cell at the PSC finalised the question paper from a set of drafts sourced from experts.

The VACB inspected the office of ‘Lakshya and Vito’ PSC coaching centres in Thampanoor. Investigators said the centres had branches across the State and Lakshya was headquartered in Venjaramoodu. It has got two other PSC coaching institutions on its radar.

The VACB is verifying whether the set of suspect officers had any stakes in these institutions. It is checking their mobile call records, bank accounts, investments and wealth.

Exam fraud

A top official said that if the allegations were found to be accurate, then the agency would have uncovered a brazen examination fraud attempt remarkable in its extent and boldness.

The PSC’s credibility had taken a beating last year when two Students Federation of India (SFI) leaders duped their way into the police constable rank list by cheating in the examination.

The then Governor P. Sathasivam had summoned the chairman and sought a report after job seekers cried foul.

A police enquiry revealed that the accused had used a combination of smartwatches and mobile phones to seek the help of a test proficient person, a police officer, to write the examination.

Subsequently, the PSC had claimed that it had plugged the loopholes and its future tests would be fraud-proof.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/ogt3ws/article30569033.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH14BOOKS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/psc-coaching-centres-on-vigilance-radar/article30895360.ece

204,2020/02/23,CM lays stone for LIFE Mission housing complex at Kadambur,"36 places in Kannur identified for constructing flats

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Saturday laid the foundation stone for the first housing complex in the State to be built with prefab technology under the Livelihood Inclusion and Financial Empowerment (LIFE) Mission Housing Project, at Kadambur here.

Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Vijayan said such residential complexes were being built across the State to house landless families. The complex at Kadambur will be built using state-of-the-art prefab technology, and the government plans to make the technology widely available for constructing buildings. It will lend a boost to the construction sector. Presiding over the function, Minister for Industries E.P. Jayarajan said two lakh houses had been completed under LIFE Mission. With the completion of Phase 3 of the mission, more than 5 lakh persons will get houses. The construction of houses was delayed for the past two years owing to floods.

The LIFE Mission Housing Scheme had become a model not only for the rest of the country but also for the world. He said even experts from abroad were visiting Kerala to study the project. Besides providing housing facilities, all necessary amenities will be made available, the Minister said.

At Kadambur, as many as 44 houses are being constructed in four floors in 41 cents donated by the grama panchayat in Pannonneri West. The district has 2,815 beneficiaries in Phase 3 of Life Mission.

District Collector T.V. Subhash said 36 places had been identified for construction of housing complexes under the mission in Kannur. The construction of the complexes will begin in April in the grama panchayats of Chirakkal, Kannapuram, and Pattuvam, and the municipalities of Anthoor and Payyannur.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cm-lays-stone-for-life-mission-housing-complex-at-kadambur/article30892470.ece

The Road Safety Council has decided to set up free black-tea and coffee vending machines in accident-prone areas in Kasaragod district to keep drivers refreshed and to prevent them falling asleep during late-night trips.

The machines will be set up in 15 high-risk areas on National Highway 66 and Kerala State Transport Project (KSTP) roads, which witnessed 58 deaths in 215 road accidents between 2016 and 2018. The council has identified Manjeswaram, Hidayat Nagar, Uduma Lalit Resort, Poinachi, Palakkunnu, Kunjathur Mada, Uppala Gate, Periya Bazaar, Cheruvathoor, Thrikkannadu, Karuvacherry, Mangalpadi, Hosangadi Vamanchur, Cherkala and Neeleswaram as the high-risk areas, where most accidents occur during the night.

The council decided to set up the vending machines based on an initiative taken by the Kasaragod District Printing and Publishing Cooperative Society, which has established free tea and coffee vending machines at Vidya Nagar.

T.K. Rajan, national secretary of the All India Road Transport Workers Federation and president of the Society, said many accidents took place due to the carelessness of drivers who fell asleep at the wheel. However, having black tea or coffee from the vending machines would leave them refreshed and ready for the rest of the journey, he added.

The vending unit contains two flasks with 30 cups of black tea and coffee. There is also a water tank with 250 litres of purified drinking water, which the drivers could use for drinking or washing their faces.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/tea-coffee-kiosks-to-be-set-up-at-accident-prone-spots/article30891891.ece

Makkal Needhi Maiam founder Kamal Haasan has criticised private milk companies for hiking the price of milk.

In a statement, he said private companies had increased the price of milk to nearly ₹28 per litre between 2014 and 2019. “It is shocking that they have again increased the price by ₹2 a litre. This should not just be condemned but also stopped,” he said.

While the private milk companies used to say that they were forced to increase the prices because of cost of procurement, they have now added a new reason that there was a shortage of milk.

211,2020/02/23,Dept. head in police force has suo motu power of review: HC,"Full Bench settles matter after conflicting judgments by Division Benches

The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has ruled that under Rule 15 A of the Tamil Nadu Police Subordinate Service (Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1955, the Head of the Department has the authority to exercise suo motu power of review after an order is passed by a subordinate authority.

After a larger Bench was constituted by the Chief Justice to resolve the issue following conflicting judgments by different Division Benches of the High Court, a Full Bench, comprising Justices S.S. Sundar, R. Subramanian and N. Sathish Kumar, answered the referred question in the affirmative.

The court was hearing an appeal preferred by the State government against a Single Bench order.

A charge memo was issued by the Chennai Joint Commissioner of Police (South), against C. Vijaya Baskar, a policeman, under the Rules for serious charges in 2011. An inquiry was conducted and the charges were said to be proven.

A punishment of censure by order was imposed on the policeman.

Later, the punishment of censure was deferred for six months. Subsequently, the Commissioner of Police, Chennai, set aside the order of punishment.

The Commissioner used his power of review without any appeal having been filed by the policeman. Under these circumstances, about eight months later, the Director General of Police issued a show cause notice, asking why a penalty should not be imposed on the policeman.

It was said that the show cause notice was issued using the power of suo motu review under Rule 15 A of the Tamil Nadu Police Subordinate Service (Discipline and Appeal) Rules.

The policeman filed a petition before the court, and a single judge ruled that the DGP had no power under Rule 15 A to review the punishment for the second time.

The State preferred an appeal against the order of the Single Bench. The issue in contention was whether there can be a review of a review.

The court said that in the present case, the inquiry officer had found the charges against the policeman to be proven. The disciplinary authority had imposed a punishment.

However, this order was set aside without considering the merits by exercising the power of suo motu review.

Confirming that the DGP had the power to review this order, the court said that it cannot be concluded that the Head of Department had no authority to exercise the suo motu review after an order was passed by a subordinate, exercising such a power. The court allowed the appeal.

The court also gave an opportunity to the policeman to reply to the show cause notice within a period of three weeks. On receiving the explanation from the policeman, the DGP shall pass orders on merits and in accordance with the law within a period of six weeks, the court said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/8it30b/article30892330.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH23MADURAIBENCHOFMADRASHIGHCOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/dept-head-in-police-force-has-suo-motu-power-of-review-hc/article30892331.ece

213,2020/02/23,Tamil University told to translate NCERT books into Tamil,"Information Commission says it will benefit those writing competitive exams

The Tamil Nadu Information Commission has directed the Tamil University, Thanjavur, to translate into Tamil the Physics, Chemistry, History, Geography, Economics and Mathematics books published by the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) in English and Hindi from 6th to 12th Standards.

If implemented, the order is expected to go a long way in benefiting students from Tamil medium appearing for the national competitive examinations like the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET), the Railway Recruitment Board (RRB) and the Staff Selection Commission (SSC) for which question papers are based on NCERT syllabus.

Passing orders on a petition filed by R. Chander of Chennai, State Information Commissioner S. Muthuraj directed the varsity to translate the books of six subjects from 6th to 12th into Tamil and upload the content on its website under the provisions of Section 4 of the Right to Information Act. The Public Information Officer was asked to send a compliance report to the Secretary, Tamil Development Department, and Secretary, School Education Department, Chennai.

In his petition, Mr. Chander contended that most of the competitive examinations for admissions or recruitment conducted by the Centre were based on the NCERT syllabus of Physics, Chemistry, History, Geography, Economics, Mathematics subjects from 6th Standard to 12th Standard, for which books were available only in English and Hindi.

Translation errors

Students from Tamil Nadu who completed their school education with Tamil as a medium of instruction and aspiring to get into Central government jobs or educational institutions were finding it difficult to study NCERT books as they were not available in Tamil. Though most of these examinations were conducted in Tamil as well, students found it difficult to score owing to translation errors in question papers. He petitioned the Tamil University under the RTI Act to take steps for translating the NCERT books into Tamil. Since there was no reply from the Public Information Officer and the First Appellate Authority, he moved the Commission.

Appearing for the university, the PIO/Deputy Registrar stated that under Section 2(f) of the Act, information could be provided as available in the records and that there was no provision of translating the information and providing the translated version to the applicant.

After hearing both sides, Mr. Muthuraj and considering the larger interest of students who had Tamil as their medium of instruction at school, Mr Muthuraj said the Preamble of the Act authorised promotion of transparency and accountability of every public authority.

The main objective of the Tamil University’ Department of Translation was to translate Tamil literature into other languages and vice-versa. Hence, the Department of Translation was accountable to translating the NCERT books under the Act, Mr. Muthuraj said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tamil-university-told-to-translate-ncert-books-into-tamil/article30892192.ece

In the light of Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami having written to the Centre highlighting certain concerns over the NPR questionnaire, DMK president M.K. Stalin on Saturday said the CM should have adopted a resolution against the exercise in the Assembly.

In a statement, Mr. Stalin wondered why the CM did not make the contents of the letter public.

“By writing a letter seeking details about the NPR, the Chief Minister has acknowledged the questions I had raised in the Assembly. In the Assembly, he reiterated that the NPR will not affect anyone and rejected my demand. Now, he has written a letter. Who does he want to take for a ride?

Recalling Mr. Palaniswami’s assertion in the Assembly, the DMK president wondered what had now prompted him to write to the Centre, requesting it to avoid asking for details of residents’ mother tongue, Aadhaar card number, voter identity card, driving licence and the date of birth of their parents and spouses.

“Revenue Minister R.B. Udhayakumar has said the NPR will be carried out without the need for certain details. But the Chief Minister has written to the Centre, seeking to avoid the need for certain details. It is clear that there is no consensus between the Chief Minister and the Revenue Minister on the NPR,” he said.

Mr. Stalin said the AIADMK government should declare that it will not allow NPR and adopt a resolution in the Assembly.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/cms-statement-on-npr-a-drama-says-stalin/article30892114.ece
215,2020/02/23,‘My govt. makes only realistic promises’,"CM unveils memorial for B. Sivanthi Adityan, ex-director of Daily Thanthi Group

Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Saturday said his government was only making promises that were feasible and ensuring that they were fulfilled, instead of hoodwinking the voters with assurances that were impossible to implement.

Unveiling a memorial for B. Sivanthi Adityan, former director of the Daily Thanthi Group, which was constructed by the government at a cost of ₹1.34 crore on 60 cents of land at Veerapandianpattinam, Mr. Palaniswami said the AIADMK government was delivering more than it had promised.

“While addressing the centenary celebrations of party founder MGR in Thoothukudi on November 22, 2017, I announced 35 development projects for the district. Fifteen of these have been completed and the remaining 20 are about to be completed. We don’t believe in making unrealistic promises, unlike a few, whose fake promises gave them instant victory in the last Parliamentary election,” he said, without naming any individual or political party. “However, the people realised that those promises (made by the others) were fake, and taught them a fitting lesson in the Assembly byelections and the civic polls. They will continue to punish those people in future elections as well,” he said.

He listed 15 development projects that had been implemented in Thoothukudi district at a cost of ₹71.90 crore, and laid the foundation for 47 projects, to be executed at a cost of ₹260.06 crore.

Mr. Palaniswami recalled the contributions of Sivanthi Adityan to journalism, sports, education and philanthropy.

On his way back to Thoothukudi, Mr. Palaniswami visited an orphanage run by Roman Catholic priests at Adaikkalapuram, which houses around 1,000 children, and distributed welfare measures sponsored by Information Minister Kadambur Raju to mark the 72nd birth anniversary of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/mphdi1/article30892109.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH23EPS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/my-govt-makes-only-realistic-promises/article30892110.ece
216,2020/02/23,"BJP trying to redraft Constitution, says VCK","CAA-NPR-NRC have created a sense of insecurity among minorities, says Thirumavalavan at ‘Save the Nation’ rally

VCK leader Thol. Thirumavalavan on Saturday alleged that the BJP government at the Centre was attempting to weaken the Constitution and dilute the provisions guaranteeing equality for all, irrespective of religion, caste and creed.

Addressing a mammoth ‘Save the Nation’ rally organised by the party in Tiruchi, Mr. Thirumavalavan alleged that the BJP, which made a failed attempt to redraft the Constitution when Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the Prime Minister, was now making serious attempts to change the character of the Constitution. It was with the objective of destroying the basic tenets of the Constitution that the BJP-led Centre had brought in the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, Mr. Thirumavalavan alleged.

The CAA and the proposed National Register of Citizens and the National Population Register had created a sense of insecurity among minorities, especially Muslims, he said.

Terming the CAA draconian, Mr. Thirumavalavan said the minorities, “hurt by the insensitive law”, had been protesting against the Centre across the country through peaceful means. If the BJP believed in democracy, it would have listened to the genuine demand for repealing the Act. On the contrary, the government had toughened its stand, the VCK chief said. “Several State governments and representatives of most of the political parties, public fora and organisations are up in arms against CAA. But Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said there is no going back on CAA. It shows that he has scant regard for democracy and the Constitution,” he said.

Religious discrimination

“The discrimination of refugees based on religion is against the fundamental tenets of the Constitution. It is unacceptable to the country’s secular fabric and credentials,” the VCK leader said. He warned that NPR would raise a question mark over the citizenship status of those who fail to furnish the required documents.

Coming down heavily on the AIADMK government in Tamil Nadu, he alleged that it had not bothered to respect the sentiments of minorities and Opposition political parties with regard to CAA-NPR-NRC. Several parties which had voted in favour of CAA in Parliament had subsequently passed resolutions against the law in their respective Assemblies. But the AIADMK government, which was blindly following the diktats of the Centre, had refused to adopt a resolution against CAA in the Assembly, and would pay a heavy price for it, he said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/v1rd6d/article30892104.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH23VCK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/bjp-trying-to-redraft-constitution-says-vck/article30892105.ece

218,2020/02/23,Anti-Sterlite protest comments: Rajinikanth seeks exemption from having to appear before panel,"Actor Rajinikanth, who has been summoned by the Justice Aruna Jagadeesan Commission to depose before it on February 25 in connection with the claims he had made about the violence that broke out during the anti-Sterlite protest in 2018, has sought exemption from personal appearance.

“Since law and order problem may break out, as thousands of my fans will gather in Thoothukudi to have a glimpse of me, I may be exempted from appearing in person before the Commission,” Mr. Rajinikanth said in a letter to the Commission.

The actor is learnt to have conveyed that he was prepared to submit his affidavit if the Commission sent him a questionnaire.

On February 4, the Commission probing the police firing in the anti-Sterlite protests summoned Mr. Rajinikanth to appear on February 25 for deposition as the actor had told reporters that anti-socials triggered violence during the agitation that ultimately culminated in police firing, in which 13 were killed.

When he addressed the reporters at a private resort on Thoothukudi outskirts after visiting some of the injured in the violence at Thoothukudi Medical College Hospital eight days after the violence — on May 30, 2018 — Mr. Rajinikanth claimed that anti-social elements who managed to “intrude” into agitation, had unleashed violence that led to police firing.

Though his observations triggered a lot of criticism from various quarters, especially from political parties and the anti-Sterlite protesters, the actor stood firm on his stance.

After appearing before the Commission on October 16 2019, Naam Thamizhar Katchi coordinator Seeman said the actor should be summoned to appear before the panel. The Commission, which has summoned 704 witnesses, has so far inquired 445 persons, including journalists in 18 phases and marked 630 evidences.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/f8qjo/article30738073.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04FEBTH-RAJINI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/rajini-seeks-exemption-from-having-to-appear-before-panel/article30892038.ece
219,2020/02/23,T.N. cancels notification on petrochem investment region,"Decision to scrap project follows delta getting special status

The Tamil Nadu government has cancelled its notification on constituting a Petroleum, Chemical and Petrochemical Investment Region (PCPIR), encompassing 45 villages in Cuddalore and Nagapattinam districts. This follows the Assembly adopting a Bill declaring the Cauvery delta a protected agricultural zone. On Friday, Governor Banwarilal Purohit gave his assent to the Bill.

By its latest action, the government has withdrawn its move to turn 45 villages in the two districts into a local planning area for the PCPIR, according to an official in the Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Department, which issued an order to this effect on Friday. Through two orders issued by the HUD Department in December 2015 and June 2017, the villages were delineated for the PCPIR. Spread over 256.83 sq. km, the proposed project had envisaged an investment of ₹8,100 crore and the generation of 13,950 jobs.

The latest order was, in turn, based on a communication from the office of Director of Town and Country Planning (DTCP), sent to the government on February 10, that “a lot of objections” had been received from the public, “vehemently opposing” the exploration and extraction of hydrocarbons. As the delta region was regarded as the rice bowl of the State and was an “ecologically sensitive agricultural zone,” any further exploration and exploitation, “apart from such activity which already exist[s]”, might be “detrimental” to the environment of the zone, it said. The DTCP’s office requested the government to recall the earlier orders.

The day before the DTCP’s office sent its recommendation to the government, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami announced (on February 9) his government’s decision, at a function in Thalaivasal, that the delta would be made a protected zone.

An official of the Industries Department clarified that the withdrawal of the PCPIR notification would have no bearing on another project proposed by Haldia Petrochemicals to the tune of ₹50,000 crore in Cuddalore district, as the proposed project would be located outside the PCPIR. During the Chief Mnister’s visit to the U.S. in September last year, a memorandum of understanding was signed between the State government and the company, whose representatives met Mr. Palaniswami a few weeks ago in Chennai.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/k95zxj/article30855514.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19THCMEDAPPADI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tn-cancels-notification-on-petrochem-investment-region/article30892028.ece
220,2020/02/23,Border districts where issues spill over,"The recent COVID-19 scare brought to the fore the importance of coordination among States. From smuggling of goods to dumping of medical waste, the issues are many, and need careful handling, by several State governments acting in concert

Border districts of any State have their unique issues, by virtue of being neighbours with another State. In the case of Tamil Nadu, the rather porous border that it shares with its neighbours gives rise to issues involving smuggling (rice, liquor, ganja and red sanders) and trafficking, among others, requiring constant vigil.

With the State sharing borders with Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and the Union Territory of Puducherry, minding them is a full-time occupation.

Recently, with Kerala recording three cases of COVID-19, the Tamil Nadu-Kerala border has become a hot spot, and special surveillance has been mounted on the movement of people to keep the virus from spreading.

Health alert

Every time an infectious disease surfaces in a neighbouring State, Tamil Nadu’s Public Health Department draws up a contingency plan. Among its priority areas are the districts that share border with the State concerned.

Be it the outbreak of leptospirosis, H1N1 influenza, Nipah virus or COVID-19 in Kerala, Tamil Nadu has had to step up surveillance in the districts along the inter-State borders.

There is a standard operating procedure in such cases, say public health officials. The response depends on the nature of outbreak, they add. “When there is an outbreak of a disease in a neighbouring State, surveillance, exchange of information and coordination between the two States, mutual contact tracing and early detection are crucial factors,” says Beela Rajesh, Health Secretary.

“We activate the check-posts in the border districts. We take up sanitation measures in the adjoining villages, and mobile medical teams are deputed to these villages. We take up IEC activities in these areas,” she adds.

The work at the ground-level is intense. A health officer points out that public health teams are deployed at the check-posts, and they board the buses that arrive from the neighbouring State and ask passengers about symptoms of the disease at the entry points. Depending on the disease, vehicles entering the State are also disinfected at the check-posts, he says. In fact, health authorities hold inter-State border district meetings with Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala on an annual basis, he adds.

Liquor and lotteries

In Coimbatore district, which shares a border with Palakkad and portions of Thrissur and Idukki districts of Kerala, some of the main problems are trafficking of non-taxed goods, sale of lotteries and illegal sale of liquor, even on dry days announced by the government.

There are 11 check-posts along the Kerala border, including prominent ones at Velanthavalam, Gopalapuram, Meenakshipuram and Anaikatti.

Sale of lotteries is rampant in all areas of Coimbatore bordering Palakkad, which the police are struggling to curb. On an average, Coimbatore District (Rural) Police register five cases under provisions of the Lotteries (Regulation) Act daily. Though sale of lotteries is banned in Tamil Nadu under the Act, people buy lottery tickets from Kerala and sell them illegally at higher prices. “Nearly 80% of the sales is from Tamil Nadu,” says K. Suresh, employee of a lottery stall near Walayar.

Targeting tipplers from Kerala, several toddy shops are operating illegally in the coconut plantations in Velanthavalam, Meenakshipuram and Gopalapuram. While toddy tapping is banned in Tamil Nadu, the alcoholic beverage is tapped illegally in several coconut plantations lying close to Palakkad district and even smuggled to Kerala. The police and the Excise Department are accused of turning a blind eye to this.

A senior Revenue Department official said that efforts under way to create special teams of the Excise Department to check illegal toddy tapping and operation of Tasmac outlets beyond the permitted time. Joshua G.P.N., a social worker from Anaikatti, explains that after the Kerala government enforced total prohibition in Attapadi tribal belt, tipplers from bordering villages of Kerala come in large numbers to Tasmac outlets near Anaikatti and Mangarai.

On the edge

Every time there is a fresh war of words over the age-old river water dispute, normalcy in Hosur is hit. A significant section of its residents work in Electronics City in Bengaluru, a mere 40 km away, and in other factories in Karnataka. When the inter-State transport network freezes, the daily commute of the workers is derailed. Escalated rentals and real estate prices due to its proximity to Bengaluru are a huge challenge for aspiring home owners. This has also thrown up issues of unapproved layouts for a home-hungry population.

On the one hand, the cost of living is similar to that of Bengaluru because of its proximity, but the pay of workers in the industrial hub falls short, says writer and Hosur resident Aadhavan Deetchanya.

The town has not been able to secure autonomous growth in the form of big hospitals, educational institutions, as it is close to the neighbouring State’s capital.

Crime is a major issue because of a large floating population as are jurisdictional issues, says Bala Siva Prasad, a farmer. Hosur has reported a significant number of murders and crimes, where the offenders and accused take cover across the border. There is also the problem of illicit liquor trade, where liquor from Karnataka is smuggled and sold in the villages of Hosur, says Mr. Prasad.

Cat and mouse game

Notwithstanding the continuous crackdown by the Villupuram and Cuddalore district police, the smuggling of Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) from neighbouring Puducherry through the porous border has become a major headache for the Law enforcement authorities.

The borders are too porous to be managed effectively, despite the Tamil Nadu police coordinating and exchanging information with their counterparts in Puducherry. Most of the smuggling is carried out along the arterial East Coast Road, Pattanur, Kiliyanur, Gengarampalayam and Siruvanthadu.

As many as 1,68,119 bottles of IMFL were seized by the Prohibition Enforcement Wing personnel manning the permanent check-posts on the bordering areas. Police sources said that rowdy elements involved in murder and extortion had also been playing a cat and mouse game with the law enforcement authorities in both regions. In the last few months, the Villupuram district police had detained as many as 20 rowdy elements operating in both regions.

Tiruvallur’s woes

In Tiruvallur, which shares a border with Andhra Pradesh, sand, red sanders and ganja smuggling are the major problems.

At Arambakkam, Pallipattu, Uthukottai and Tiruttani, the major complaints pertain to transportation and sand mining.

Another major problem is smuggling of ganja from Andhra Pradesh to Tamil Nadu, especially through Tiruttani. “People go by bicycle and purchase the drug. They then make small packets and sell it in Tiruvallur district and some even take it to Chennai,” says S. Arumugam, a resident of Tiruttani.

In 2019, the Tiruvallur police booked 30 cases pertaining to ganja smuggling and arrested 55 persons. A total of 72.5 kg ganja was seized. In 2020, till date, five cases have been registered and five persons have been arrested.

Apart from this, red sanders smuggling from Andhra Pradesh is also a major headache. “Every month we register at least four cases. The logs are smuggled into Tamil Nadu, packed in small units located in Tiruvallur and Chennai and then shipped,” says a forest officer.

Sand mining is another major issue in the border areas of Tiruvallur. S. Jayachandran, Tamil Nadu Sugarcane Farmers Association, State Committee Member and a resident of Puniyam village, says: “Every day tractors from Andhra Pradesh take sand from the Kosasthalaiyar river in Tamil Nadu limits. They have dug over 20 feet of sand from the river bed. Some of the villagers have been beaten up by the smugglers.” P. Manikandan, Uthukottai secretary, CPI(M), said that bikes and tractors are used to steal sand from Arani Kosathalayar near Chitapakkam village.

Police said that 1,081 sand mining cases were registered in 2019 and 1,201 persons were arrested. A total of 1,192 vehicles used for transporting the sand were seized. In 2020, a total of 39 cases were registered and 43 persons were arrested. A total of 30 vehicles were seized.

Rice racket

The district shares a border with Kerala at Kaliyakkavilai, on the Thiruvananthapuram highway. The adjacent coastal route via Niththiravilai to the neighbouring State has always witnessed smuggling of rice and kerosene meant for public distribution. While kerosene is sold immediately, the ration rice is polished, repacked and sold at a premium. Whenever security is being beefed up on these two routes following untoward incidents, the latest being the gunning down of Special Sub-Inspector of Police Y. Wilson, the smugglers prefer train services between Nagercoil and Thiruvananthapuram. Some of the smugglers turn the ration rice into rice flour and smuggle it to Kerala in a bid to escape detection. Though around a tonne ration rice is seized every week, none of the smugglers has been arrested by the special flying squads deployed for this purpose.

Another commodity being smuggled to Kerala is river sand, mostly quarried illegally, where the construction material fetches a premium.

Biomedical waste generated in a few hospitals situated close to the border is smuggled from Kerala to Tenkasi district via Puliyarai and Kaliyakkavilai. Truck drivers returning to Tamil Nadu after offloading consignments in Kerala load their vehicles with biomedical waste or broiler waste to be dumped on the roadside in Kaavalkinaru, Valliyoor, Koodankulam, Shencottai, Puliyarai and Tenkasi.

Coordination between the Kanniyakumari police and their counterparts in Kerala is good, the police claim. In fact, Superintendent of Police of Kanniyakumari N. Shreenath said that they were getting useful inputs from the Kerala police in the SSI murder case.

221,2020/02/23,Ground zero for red sanders smugglers,"Vellore shares a border with Andhra Pradesh. Red sanders smuggling is a major issue here with villagers going over to the Seshachalam forests near Tirupati for cutting the logs.

Most often villagers from Jamunamaruthur and Tirupathur are roped in for cutting the red sanders. Agents hire them and give them a hefty amount for chopping the logs. This happens despite a crackdown. In 2015, a total of 20 woodcutters from Tamil Nadu, predominantly from Vellore and Tiruvanamalai, were shot dead.

After chopping the red sanders, the logs are smuggled into Tamil Nadu through Vellore. They are concealed in agricultural land or godowns and then taken to Chennai after some weeks or months. With multiple ways to reach Vellore from Andhra Pradesh, smugglers prefer to operate in the region. Police officers say coordinated surveillance with forest officials is called for at the checkposts to ceck the menace.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/ground-zero-for-red-sanders-smugglers/article30892007.ece
222,2020/02/23,‘Paapam Cheyyathavar Kalleriyatte’ review: An engaging satire let down by an imperfect script,"In Shambhu Purushothaman's second outing as a director, nobody is spared from dark humour.

In the Gospel of John, it is Jesus Christ who challenges the Pharisees by asking the one without sin to cast the first stone when they bring in an adulteress to be punished. But in Paapam Cheyyathavar Kalleriyatte it is a zonked out Madhupal who utters the profound statement, his only task in the film other than looking lost and smoking weed. The film, Shambhu Purushothaman's second outing after the underrated Vedivazhipadu, is a satire in which nobody is spared from dark humour. It is a film where each character is a caricature, each scene part of a freakish chain reaction. At the same time, it lacks the unbridled hilarity of Purushothaman’s first film, and seems contrived and less edgier when it comes to taunting morality and misogyny.

Paapam Cheyyathavar Kalleriyatte (Malayalam) Director: Shambhu Purushothaman

Cast: Vinay Forrt, Tini Tom, Santhy Balachandran, Srinda, Arun Kurian

If Vedivazhipadu was set against the backdrop of Attukal Pongala, in this, we have a Christian betrothal. A major part of the film unravels during the post-event celebrations. In the opening scene, we are introduced to two elite families arranging a marriage alliance. Shiny briefcases exchange hands, bottles are opened, jewellery and finery are decided, and a tacky save-the-date video is canned. The groom's family is broke following some business misadventures, but they show so sign of it, and have their hopes pinned on the ₹10-crore dowry. The bride's family is not squeaky clean either. But both the parties believe in family status and the unbeatable merit of affluence. Though the ceremony takes place as planned, the situation spirals out of control due to some unforeseen developments.

The film addresses a whole bunch of issues, but it lacks a tongue-in-cheek candour, mainly due to a script that misses spontaneity and brevity at parts. Though the film is able to engage you in one level, you easily identify the flaws in comic timing and attempts at concocting a surreal flavour towards the climax. The film has an array of smile-inducing moments, but there are times when you can feel blandness seeping straight in. One major let-down of the film is its soundscape that does absolutely nothing to salvage the narrative. Editing is another problem area, as Paapam Cheyyathavar Kalleriyatte is in need of a lot of trimming.

The film has an impressive ensemble cast starring Vinay Forrt, Tini Tom, Santhy Balachandran, Srinda and Arun Kurian in key roles, along with a bunch of talented actors playing various supporting roles. But Paapam Cheyyathavar Kalleriyatte never stands up to their performances, and the glitches in the script stop the film from hitting the mark of an absolute entertainer.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/2xwc7d/article30819052.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14tvmPCKstill1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/paapam-cheyyathavar-kalleriyatte-review-an-engaging-satire-let-down-by-an-imperfect-script/article30894340.ece
223,2020/02/23,Key revenue reforms in the offing,"New revenue code to be formulated

Some key revenue reforms like creation of revenue code and land disputes redressal tribunal and abolition of the post of District Revenue Officer (DRO) are said to be part of the new revenue legislation of the State government.

Sources said top government officials and law officers were studying revenue code in force in Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh in a bid to replicate it. The code which will require Centre’s approval will be an amalgamation of the 145 existing revenue legislations and rules. As many as 25 legislations and rules had become redundant over the years. The government was also studying constitution of land disputes redressal tribunals in each district to address Record of Rights, tenancy and Inam issues which were hitherto handled by revenue courts conducted by Tahsildars, Revenue Divisional Officers and Joint Collectors.

The government also proposed to abolish the post of DRO as it was felt the incumbents were not of much use after the creation of two posts of additional collectors in every district. Moreover, most of the additional collectors were already discharging duties as DRO. The DROs presently monitors district revenue system, service matters of employees and all other tasks designated by collectors.

The revenue code will be an alternative to the Conclusive Title Act which Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao assured for land ownership in the Assembly, sources said. The conclusive title as envisaged by Mr. Rao will become a part of revenue code. It was felt a separate legislation to confer conclusive title was not feasible in Telangana because the size of land holdings was mostly small and also the actual size differed from the records. The Act was contemplated on the lines of the draft Land Titling Bill, 2011, during UPA II regime. The Bill held the government responsible to ensure land owners got open market value plus a matching solatium in all transactions.

The need for overhaul of revenue administration was felt after the government took up land records updation programme in September - December 2017. Many land related issues came into the open with the implementation of Rytu Bandhu programme in 2018 on the basis of land record updation.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/key-revenue-reforms-in-the-offing/article30897021.ece
224,2020/02/23,Irrigation engineers exempted from non-departmental duties,"Irrigation workload set to increase with higher availability of water, say officials

With the increasing irrigation potential in the State the Telangana government has decided to exempt the engineers and other staff of the Irrigation Department from being drawn for duties other than the departmental work, including duties pertaining to other developmental programmes and election duties by the Revenue Department.

According to officials of the Irrigation Department, the decision has been taken following the request made by the higher authorities of the department. During a recent meeting chaired by Principal Secretary (Irrigation), it was brought to his notice that drafting of the irrigation engineers and other staff by the Revenue Department for other duties of developmental programmes and election duties has been causing severe shortage of hands for effective water regulation and other operation and maintenance works.

“Drafting of irrigation staff, including engineers, for other than the departmental work has been a major handicap in water regulation and related duties when the release of water for irrigation has been in the critical stages of crop cultivation. As a result, we have been finding it difficult to attend to the emergency situations in water regulation in the recent past,” explained a Chief Engineer.

Non-availability of irrigation engineers, particularly the assistant executive engineers and deputy executive engineers for water regulation duties following their drafting by the Revenue Department for other developmental programmes has also been resulting in wastage of water in terms of its release to distributaries beyond requirement sometimes, the irrigation officials pointed out.

Availability of engineers has become necessary as lifting of water through major projects such as Kaleshwaram, Kalwakurthy and Bhakta Ramadasu besides scores of others and also release of water to the ayacut under Nagarjunasagar, Sriramsagar, Kaddam, Jurala and other projects as also minor irrigation tanks is in progress, the senior engineer stated. Accordingly, the Principal Secretary has decided to exempt the irrigation engineers and staff for non-departmental duties.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/irrigation-engineers-exempted-from-non-departmental-duties/article30896960.ece
225,2020/02/23,Sorry state of affairs of coop societies,"Number of voters is less than the posts in Adilabad

Posts eight, voters three

The election of members of managing committees of District Cooperative Central Banks and District Cooperative Marketing Societies threw up an interesting scenario in Adilabad.

For 22 Class ‘A’ posts of twin societies, there are 77 voters but for eight Class ‘B’ posts the voter strength is just three. It effectively meant that five posts will be left vacant. The Class ‘B’ posts are filled with representatives of functional societies for trades like handloom weaving. Even for election to Class ‘A’ posts, the field was wide open for as many as 272 primary agricultural cooperative societies, farmers service cooperative societies and large sized cooperative societies. Since many of the societies were not functioning, the voter base was limited to 77 societies and as many voters.

No paper, pen in enumeration

The census collection after April will be without the use of paper and pen by enumerators. For the first time they will use mobile phone app to fill details. The entire enumeration will be handled by school teachers who will work under supervisors trained by headmasters, statistical and GHMC officers. Interestingly, one or two Group I officers who will not retire till December next year will constitute the master trainers for the entire programme.

Shackling ideas!

District Collectors were given ‘clarity’ on one ‘important’ aspect of their functioning at the recent Collectors’ Conference held here after their reshuffle. They were reportedly told that they should not have any agenda of their own for implementing the development and welfare measures, but simply follow the agenda and procedures formulated by the State government. The ‘orders’ were given following several district collectors conceiving their own interventions to improve the delivery systems. This was in the backdrop of one collector designing a programme involving officials of other departments to improve the functioning of welfare hostels. Another collector thought out ways to improve the marketing of products made by women self-help groups as part of their livelihoods. More recently, when a collector approached higher-ups for taking up a special programme from improving literacy rate, he was said to have been snubbed and told not to think beyond his mandate as he was not a policy maker!

Much awaited ‘change’

Two major political parties in the State that wish to grab power in the next elections from the TRS seem to be sailing in the same boat — that of leadership issue.

Rumours are rife about the change in leadership of the BJP and the Congress for some time and the cadre are eagerly waiting to see if there would be any change, and it at all there is a change, who would be the next one.

After the Huzurnagar byelections, TPCC president N. Uttam Kumar Reddy apparently submitted his resignation while there is a talk of K. Laxman leaving the post soon as he has completes his term. More than the cadre of these two parties, the ruling TRS seem to be anxious too to devise its plans to tackle the new leadership with the GHMC elections in sight.

Knee-jerk reaction

In a swift reaction to an adverse article published in a Telugu daily, the State government swung into troubleshooting mode by arranging half-a-dozen media conferences to condemn the report.

The convening of press conferences rattled the media corps as invitations from the offices of the Director General of Police and police commissioners of Hyderabad, Cyberabad and Rachakonda flashed on their smart phones with barely any gap between each of them. What was even more shocking was that the messages read “top ranking IPS officers want to address the media on issues of utmost importance”.

At 4 p.m. the three urban commissioners condemned the newspaper report, an hour after which Additional Director General of Police (Law and Order) Jitender spoke to media on how the article damaged the reputation of the State Police Department and demoralised over one lakh police personnel. Then, the police officers association also chipped in.

The day ended with none other than Home Minister Mohammed Mahmood Ali addressing the media in which he threatened to slap a ₹1000 crore defamation suit against the daily if it did not tender an unconditional apology.

Senior Congress leader and former minister Ponnala Lakshmaiah has argued that calling only a few chief ministers for a dinner to be hosted in the honour of visiting US President Donald Trump sends a wrong signal to the nation.

In a statement here, he said inviting all the chief ministers in the country would mean respecting different political parties, their philosophies and ideologies, and enhance the prestige of the democracy in the country.

He said Mr. Trump is visiting the country in the capacity of the President of the United States and inviting only a few chief ministers for his programme reflects the narrow-minded politics and egoistic politics being practiced by the BJP government.

Mr. Ponnala said it was unfortunate that the Rashtrapathi Bhavan has invited the chief ministers of Telangana, Assam, Odisha, Haryana, Karnataka, Bihar, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu only and ignored the others, who are also democratically elected by the people.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/only-few-cms-at-trump-dinner-not-proper/article30896440.ece

229,2020/02/23,"Only 3,829 2BHK units allotted in six years: Revanth","Malkajgiri Member of Parliament to launch ‘Patnam Gosa’ on 2 BHKs houses

Just 3,829 double bedroom houses (2BHKs) have been handed over to beneficiaries in the last six years by the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) government and not a single house been allotted in 20 districts of the State so far, TPCC working president and Member of Parliament from Malkajgiri A. Revanth Reddy said.

At a press conference here, he said the figures were revealed by the government itself in the last sessions of the Legislative Council. And now Chief Minister K. Chandrashekar Rao and his government is getting ready to fool people yet again on the 2BHK houses with an eye on the ensuing GHMC elections, he said adding that he would go to the people on the same issue highlighting the failure of the government on its flagship programme.

Mr. Reddy said he would launch ‘Patnam Gosa’ from Monday in the Malkajgiri Parliamentary constituency reaching out to the eligible people who were promised the houses in the 2014 and 2018 Assembly elections. In fact, the Chief Minister promised that it was the flagship programme of the government and he would not seek votes if the houses were not constructed.

‘Failed promise’

Stating that the programme was apolitical and just to highlight how the government has failed in its promised, Mr. Revanth Reddy said more than 10 lakh people had applied for 2 BHKs in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) limits. In the last GHMC elections TRS won on the plank of 2BHKs and but only 128 houses were handed over to the beneficiaries, he said.

During the week-long programme covering all the 7 Assembly constituencies in Malakjgiri, Mr. Reddy would meet the eligible families, visit the places where houses were promised and interact with officials to understand why there was a delay.

Instead of fulfilling its own promise, the government had in fact not allotted the Rajiv Gruhakalpa houses constructed by the then Congress government to anyone and are left unattended. “My Patnam Gosa will also bring in pressure on the government to allott those houses to the beneficiaries.”

Pending bills

Mr. Reddy alleged that the ongoing construction of 2BHKs was stalled because the government had failed to pay ₹900 crore worth bills to the contractors. If the government pays ₹ 90 crore at least 46,000 houses under construction in the GHMC area would be completed and 46,000 families will be benefited.

The TPCC working president also wanted the Chief Minister to provide funds to all the villages as he had done to Eravalli and Chintamadaka.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/q3w0nc/article30895855.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY24AREVANTHREDDY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/only-3829-2bhk-units-allotted-in-six-years-revanth/article30895856.ece
230,2020/02/23,Jodeghat Museum closed for over a month,"Staff leave after heated argument with villagers

The Kumram Bheem Memorial Tribal Museum at the historic Jodeghat village in Kerameri mandal of Kumram Bheem (KB) Asifabad district has remained closed for over a month now inconveniencing the visitors who arrive here everyday. The reason for the closure of the museum is a dispute between Jodeghat villagers and the museum staff over allocation of land for construction of cremation ground and a dumping yard in the village.

In the first week of January, a section of villagers identified a piece of land belonging to the museum for construction of cremation ground. The museum, led by its Assistant Curator Mangam Visham Rao, objected to it which led to arguments.

As the staff insisted on the facilities not coming up on the museum premises the villagers insisted on having their way and allegedly threatened them with dire consequences right in front of officials, including KB Asifabad RDO Pendur Dattu. Following the exchange of words the staff — the Assistant Curator, attender-cum-watchman Kumram Bande Rao and a sweeper — left the place.

No entry

The museum has been locked ever since and the keys to it are with the local school authorities. Visitors are generally being denied a visit unless someone from the school finds time to show them around which is little unlikely.

The issue was brought to the notice of then KB Asifabad Collector Rajeevgandhi Hanumanthu and Project Officer of Utnoor Integrated Tribal Development Agency S. Krishna Aditya. They, nevertheless, were transferred before the issue was resolved.

Disappointed visitors

“It is high time authorities address the problem. It is not good that hundreds of visitors who come from far away places are turned away without a look into the past,” lamented Gedam Mahesh from Kinwat town in Nanded district of Maharashtra who could not visit the museum on February 22 as there was no one to guide him.

There is also the issue of the museum staff not being paid their salaries since the month of May last year though they have represented the matter to appropriate authorities. The Assistant Curator is paid ₹ 20,000 per month while the attender is paid ₹ 8,000 per month and the sweeper is paid ₹ 3,000 per month.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/49xnm9/article30895666.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY24JODEGHAT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/jodeghat-museum-closed-for-over-a-month/article30895661.ece
231,2020/02/23,ZPTC members boycott Panchayati Raj Sammelanam,"MLA accused of giving chance to speak only to public representatives of TRS

Zilla Parishad Territorial Constituency (ZPTC) members from Talamadugu and Utnoor mandals in Adilabad district G. Ganesh Reddy and Charulatha Rathod, on Sunday, walked out of the Panchayati Raj Sammelanam after being denied a chance to speak.

Mr. Ganesh Reddy entered into arguments with Adilabad MLA Jogu Ramanna of the ruling TRS, who was presiding over the programme meant to discuss the action plan for all-round development of villages.

As the discussion progressed, the Talamadugu ZPTC member sought permission of the chair that was promptly denied. He accused the MLA of giving a chance to speak only to public representatives of the ruling party.

Forest Minister A. Indrakaran Reddy and others seemed to be in favour of Mr. Ganesh Reddy speaking but the MLA did not budge. The argument ended in the ZPTC members walking out.

Meanwhile, inaugurating the programme, the Minister underscored the need for cohesion between public representatives and officials for complete development of villages. “It is only through concerted efforts involving all that villages can be provided basic amenities,” he said.

Later, the Pattana Pragathi programme was also held. Boath MLA Rathod Bapu Rao, Zilla Parishad chairman Rathod Janardhan, MLC Puranam Satish, Collector A. Sridevasena and Additional collectors G.

It was launched between Hyderabad and Vemulawada by the Telangana State Tourism Development Corporation in collaboration with the Telangana State Aviation Corporation on February 20. Three packages were on offer — ₹30,000 per person for a round trip between Hyderabad and Vemulawada; ₹3,000 each for a seven-minute aerial tour of Vemulawada and ₹5,500 per head for a bird’s-eye view of the temple town and Mid-Manair Dam with 16 minutes of flying time.

The chopper made nearly 15 trips on Friday and 21 trips on Saturday. The service would be made available on Sunday too and the authorities are expecting a huge rush.

Temple authorities said pilgrims from Hyderabad did not utilise the chopper services as the tourism authorities announced the launch of helicopter services at the last minute and there was no publicity about the initiative.

240,2020/02/23,"Parties, ex-rebels add to Bodoland polls suspense amid violence","An influential citizens’ forum has said three of the four NDFB factions would support the BPF

Political parties and extremist groups have heightened the suspense over alignments as blood has begun spilling ahead of the elections to the Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC) in Assam.

After State Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Ranjeet K. Dass said his party has kept the alliance options often, the factions of disbanded extremist group National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB) appears to be caught between aligning with the Bodoland People’s Front (BPF) and its rival United People’s Party Liberal (UPPL).

The BPF, led by Hagrama Mohilary, has been ruling BTC since 2003. The BPF also runs the Assam government in alliance with the BJP and Asom Gana Parishad.

Scenario changes

Less than a week ago, the NDFB factions — they signed the third Bodo Peace Accord along with the All Bodo Students’ Union (ABSU) in January — were expected to either float a new party or join the UPPL.

The scenario appears to have changed now.

On Saturday, an influential citizens’ forum said three of the four NDFB factions would support the BPF. Ranjan Daimary, B. Saoraigwra and Dhirendra Boro lead these factions.

The fourth faction, led by Gobinda Basumatary, is likely to support UPPL, which has been upbeat after the joining of former ABSU president Pramod Boro.

A UPPL leader, however, said there was no certainty of the three NDFB factions joining or backing the BPF. “These are still early stages,” he said.

Assam Minister Pramila Rani Brahma, a senior BPF leader, said she was unaware of the NDFB factions throwing their weight behind her party. But she was “unhappy” with the BJP.

“It is unfortunate that they are weighing options despite being a long-time ally of BPF,” she said.

Key role

Former extremists have played a key role in the elections to the BTC, many of whose leaders were members of the Bodo Liberation Tigers, an erstwhile outlawed group. In the past elections, the UPPL was alleged to have received support from the NDFB.

A third entity, that of a conglomerate of non-Bodo communities, is led by Naba Kumar Sarania. A former leader of the United Liberation Front of Asom, he represents the Kokrajhar Lok Sabha seat.

The intensity of the Bodoland poll campaign involving former extremists has often led to violence in the past. The run-up to the council polls scheduled in April has been no different.

On Friday night, a BPF member identified as Khairul Haque was gunned down at Bhutiachang in northern Assam’s Udalguri district. This happened less than 24 hours after miscreants had attacked the car of BPF chief Mr. Mohilary’s wife.

The BPF accused Mr. Sarania’s non-Bodo front for the killing of Mr. Haque. The latter said the charges were baseless.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/parties-ex-rebels-add-to-bodoland-polls-suspense-amid-violence/article30895517.ece
241,2020/02/23,"AAP to conduct membership drive in Uttar Pradesh, says will contest panchayat polls this year","AAP spokesperson Sanjay Singh said party workers will visit 1.07 lakh villages in Uttar Pradesh during the next three months.

Buoyed by its decisive victory in Delhi, the Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party has decided to turn its focus on Uttar Pradesh, outlining on Sunday its plans to recruit 25 lakh members in the politically crucial State and contest the panchayat polls later this year.

AAP spokesperson Sanjay Singh said party workers will visit 1.07 lakh villages in Uttar Pradesh during the next three months and gather public opining and information on issues that affect people.

“The entire feedback will be submitted to Kejriwal after three months,” Mr. Singh told reporters.

Analysis | Arvind Kejriwal’s campaign does the trick for AAP | Defeat of BJP in Delhi election points to lack of strong face and local narrative in States | Delay in decision-making, absence of clear strategy and factionalism led to Congress wipeout in Delhi

The Rajya Sabha member said AAP plans to make 25 lakh members in the State and in the next one month, 5,000 posters of the party will be put up in every Assembly constituency. The membership drive will be held from February 24 to March 22 in over 12,000 wards in various cities across the state.

“AAP will contest the panchayat elections (likely in October-November) in U.P.,” he announced.

The renewed focus to diversify AAP outside the national capital comes nearly two weeks after the party, founded in 2012, registered the second decisive win in Delhi polls for a third consecutive term. After its win in Delhi five years ago, the AAP had made moves to expand but did not find much base.

For U.P., the AAP spokesperson said, five Ministers with origins in the State have been made ministers in Delhi government. “They will play a key role in various campaigns by the party,” he added.

Hitting out at the U.P. government of the BJP, which was AAP’s main rival in Delhi, Mr. Singh claimed law and order had ceased to exist in U.P. and the youth is disappointed with the Yogi Adityanath government.

Mr. Adityanath had campaigned for the BJP ahead of the Delhi Assembly election.

“The BJP is a party with a bad mentality (ghatiya maansikta) and is known for its bad remarks. The people have defeated BJP’s politics of hatred, and have given a thumbs up to Kejriwal’s politics of love,” Mr. Singh said, adding the BJP is raising “all the unreal issues” while hiding the issues of inflation.

“People are tired of politics of religion,” he said and stressed that AAP will focus on farmers’ problems.” He also criticised the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister. “The statements made by Adityanath and action on the anti-CAA protestors are a sign of an unsuccessful chief minister.”

Mr. Singh alleged that “gundaraj” (hooliganism) and “arajakta” (anarchy) were at its peak in Uttar Pradesh and attempts were being made under the present dispensation to “harm” democracy.

“All sections of society are fed up with this government. But the CM is busy patting his back and talking falsely about development,” he charged, adding only the AAP can provide a clean governance.

The party, which is eyeing the 2022 UP Assembly polls, said it will seek votes in the name of Delhi government’s “development model”, which, Mr. Singh asserted, was better than BJP’s “Gujarat model“.

“We have started making ground in the politically sensitive Uttar Pradesh. We are sure the 2022 election will be contested on the development agenda and we will seek vote in the name of Delhi’s development model,” Mr. Singh told PTI.

“The Delhi Assembly election has proved people are discarding politics of hatred and preferring politics of development. In Delhi, 15 MLAs belong to UP and they will be given responsibility in the state to strengthen the party’s base,” he added.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/delhi-assembly/obqel4/article30807743.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDGOPALRAI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/aap-turns-focus-on-uttar-pradesh-says-will-contest-panchayat-polls-this-year/article30895245.ece
242,2020/02/23,POCSO cells in Bihar schools to hear sexual harassment,"‘In the first phase, the units would be established in secondary schools’

Schools in Bihar would soon have ‘POCSO cells’ to hear complaints of sexual misconduct and exploitation, a government official said here on Sunday.

Bihar Education Project Council, an organization dedicated to achieving Universal Elementary Education (UEE) in the state, had last week issued direction to all district education officers to set up POCSO cells in schools, with students among others as its members, she said.

“We have given directions to the district education officers (DEOs) to set up POCSO cells in all schools of the state, starting March 1...”

“There will be a committee headed by the headmaster in each school, which will look into the complaints and take necessary action, according to the provisions of POCSO Act,” Kiran Kumari, special project officer, Bihar Education Project Council (BEPC), told PTI.

The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012 aims to punish those engaging in sexual crimes against children, while safeguarding their interests at every stage of the judicial process.

In the first phase, the units would be established in secondary schools, she said, adding that the model would be later replicated in primary and middle schools.

Each committee will have the school principal or headmaster, a senior school teacher, a panchayati raj representative, a girl student, a boy student and a clerk as its members, Ms. Kumari explained.

“A student can either directly submit a written complaint of sexual exploitation or misconduct to the committee or leave it in the complaint box, with or without mentioning his or identity. The complaint box will be opened once every week.”

“If the committee deems fit, the complaint will be forwarded to the nearest police station. It will be the panel’s job to find out the identity of the complainant at the time of lodging of an FIR. As per POCSO rules, confidentiality of the complainant will be maintained,” she said

Noting that the “cells would work at two levels”, the BEPC state programme officer said awareness would be generated about sexual harassment in schools, as part of the initiative.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/pocso-cells-in-bihar-schools-to-hear-sexual-harassment/article30895202.ece

Fugitive gangster Ravi Pujari has been arrested in South Africa and being brought to India by a team of officials, including senior IPS officers from Karnataka, a top police official said on Sunday.

Pujari, wanted in many cases including extortion and murder in different parts of the country, including Karnataka, and been on the run for over 15 years, was deported to Senegal in West Africa following his arrest and later extradited.

He had jumped bail in Senegal last year after being arrested there.

(We are) coming with him from Senegal. Now in Paris. (We are) coming by Air France and (would be) there (in India) by midnight, the police official, part of the team, told PTI.

Pujari, who hails from Karnataka, was likely to be brought here by Monday morning, police sources said.

The National Investigation Agency, the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Research and Analysis Wing would join the investigation, the sources said.

According to police, the gangster, facing over 200 cases including murder and extortion, was arrested in January last year by the Senegal authorities after remaining elusive.

Despite efforts of Indian officials to get him extradited then, a local court had granted him bail and Pujari later fled to South Africa.

Police sources on Sunday said the gangster was nabbed from a village in a joint operation by the South African and Senegal police.

After he was brought to Senegal, the Indian team completed extradition formalities, they added.

244,2020/02/23,Police fire teargas shells as anti-CAA protesters turn violent in Aligarh,"The protesters had taken out the march on a call by Bhim Army chief Chandra Shekhar

Clashes broke out between anti-CAA protesters and police in the old city area here following incidents of arson and stone pelting on late Sunday afternoon.

The police had fired teargas shells to disperse the mob indulging in vandalisation of property and throwing stones at security personnel in upper Kot area of the Kotwali police station, said police sources.

There were reports of injuries to some people but the exact number of those injured in clashes is yet to ascertained, they said.

Reports of brick-batting, arson were still coming in from a spot where some women protesters were holding a dharna since Saturday on the Mohamed Ali Road leading to the Kotwali police station with police trying to evict the protesters from there, they said.

The clashes broke out shortly after a Bhim Army-led march by hundreds of anti-CAA protesters heading to the district collectorate earlier were stopped midway by police and Rapid Action Force jawans.

Stopped by police, the protesters, however, had headed towards the Eidgah area in the city where another group of anti-CAA women protestors had been holding an indefinite dharna for the past three weeks.

As the Bhim Army-led protestors, including women, were stopped by police from moving ahead after they crossed over the Katpula Bridge from the old city, they decided to join the women protesters sitting in Eidgah area.

The protesters had taken out the march on a call by Bhim Army chief Chandra Shekhar.

Shops in some areas near Kotwali had downed their shutters.

Aligarh SSP Rajmuni, who took over the charge as the district police only last night, had earlier told mediapersons that following the abortive march, an FIR has been lodged against three persons at the Delhi Gate police station for trying to violate prohibitory orders and breach peace in the city.

The new SSP said he was monitoring the situation arising out of the anti-CAA protests, going on both at the AMU and the old city area.

He had said our “channels of communications with protesters are going to remain open but it does not mean we will allow anybody disturb the city’s law and order“.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/30ve1z/article30793429.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Chand,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bhim-army-led-anti-caa-protesters-stopped-midway-to-collectorate/article30895103.ece

247,2020/02/23,Prahar Janshakti Party leader shot dead in Akot,"A local leader of the Prahar Janshakti Party (PJP) was allegedly shot dead by two unidentified assailants at Akot town in Akola district, police said on Saturday.

Tushar Pundkar, 33, who was former Akola district chief of the PJP, was shot at around 10 p.m. on Friday, and died in the wee hours of Saturday while undergoing treatment at a hospital in Akola, police said.

Expressing shock over the incident, PJP founder-president and Achalpur MLA Bacchu Kadu, who is also guardian minister of Akola district, demanded immediate action against the perpetrators of the crime.

“It is important to trace the perpetrators of the crime and the people who gave the ‘supari’ (contract) for the murder,” he said.

248,2020/02/23,Chandrashekhar Azad dares RSS chief to contest elections,"Those who are keen to save the nation are not afraid of any punishment, says Bhim Army chief

Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad on Saturday asked RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat to contest direct elections to test the actual public support for the “Manuvadi” agenda of the Sangh.

Addressing a meeting of Bhim Army workers at the Reshimbagh ground, located close to the RSS headquarters here, Mr. Azad demanded the Sangh to end “Manuvad”.

“I want to give a suggestion to the RSS chief...Lift the veil of lies and come to the field. It is democracy.. Contest direct elections with your agenda, and people will tell you if ‘Manusmriti’ or Constitution will run the country,” Mr. Azad said.

He said the new-citizenship law (CAA), the National Register of Citizens and the National Population Register (NPR) are the “agendas” of the RSS. In the Dalit narrative, “Manuvad” is based on a “discriminatory” Manusmriti.

On Friday, the Nagpur Bench of the Bombay High Court allowed the Bhim Army to hold a meeting of its workers at Reshimbagh with certain conditions, after the local police denied permission fearing a law and order issue.

Referring to the Nagpur Police’s contention, Mr. Azad said two ideologies will always clash.

“While we believe in Constitution, they believe in Manusmriti. This country runs only on the Constitution and not on any other ideology. This ‘Manuvad’ will end in the country only if a ban is imposed on the RSS,” said Azad.

Mr. Azad also accused the RSS of trying to end reservation system through backdoor.

“Our people are still to get any positions or posts (in government jobs)...One day, we will have our prime minister and governments in other States. We will give you reservation. We will give reservation to other sections of the society. We will become givers, not takers,” Mr. Azad said.

He dared the Sangh chief to hold a discussion on the reservation system.

Mr. Azad also appealed to the Shiv Sena-headed MVA government in Maharashtra to not allow NPR in the State “in the interest of the people”.

Mr. Azad alleged that governments are not allowing protests even for the right cause.

“If we take to streets to protest we get punished. However, they do not know that those who are keen to save the nation are not afraid of any punishment, be it lathi, jail or court cases,” he said.

Mr. Azad is currently out on bail in the case of allegedly inciting people during an anti-CAA protest at Jama Masjid in New Delhi on December 20.

“In future also if we don’t get permission, we will knock the doors of court. We had asked for eight hours freedom (permission for the Bhim Army meeting on Saturday) and the respected court (the Bombay HC) allowed us three hours. We respect the court, three hours are enough,” he said referring to the HC’s order.

In a letter to Mr. Trump, the outfit has alleged that an anti-Pakistan, anti-Muslim and anti-minority euphoria was on full swing to polarise society along communal lines in India.

“As you would be descending on Indian soil, your friend Narendra Modi and his party — Bharatiya Janata Party — continues its march against minorities and nationalities,” Kanwar Pal Singh wrote in the letter addressed to the U.S. Embassy in Delhi.

The outfit also urged the U.S. to take a lead in playing pro-active role to protect the rights of oppressed people in the region.

“We believe as a leader of the world, the U.S. cannot afford to take sides. Mr. President, your photo opportunities with Narendra Modi were being exploited by India to continue subjugation of a large section of Indian society and repression against Kashmiris in particular,” the letter added.

251,2020/02/23,Odisha activists call for anti-CAA resolution in Assembly,"They allege Act is discriminatory on religious grounds and NPR is a step towards NRC implementation

The Naveen Patnaik Government should tell the Centre that it is not ready to implement the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Population Register (NPR) survey by passing a resolution in the State Assembly, demanded activists and intellectuals here on Saturday.

Activists, who gathered under the banner — ‘We the people of India’ — on the death anniversary of Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, alleged that the CAA is discriminatory on religious grounds and the NPR is a step towards the implementation of the controversial National Register of Citizens (NRC).

“Implementation of CAA, NPR and NRC will not only become a financial burden on the State, but also create divisions in society. Citizens possess different identity proofs such as Aadhaar, voter identity card, driving licence and land records. We do not want NPR, which will lead to NRC,” said Suresh Panigrahi, a CPI(M) leader.

Narendra Mohanty, an activist, said: “Like other non-BJP State governments, Odisha should pass a resolution in the Assembly to oppose NPR survey in the State.”

‘Anti-poor’ exercise

They demanded the withdrawal of CAA, NPR and NRC, which they claimed was against the country’s secular credentials, anti-poor and contrary to the Indian Constitution.

The forum also started a signature campaign on Maulana Azad’s death anniversary and announced that it will continue till March 23. The signatures would be handed over to Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik.

255,2020/02/23,"Maharashtra coalition govt. will last its full term, says Sharad Pawar","The NCP chief’s comments comes after CM Uddhav Thackeray met PM Modi

Nationalist Congress Party president Sharad Pawar on Saturday said the Maha Vikas Aghadi government (comprising of Congress, Shiv Sena and Nationalist Congress Party),will last its full term.

Speaking at the “Vision Maharashtra” event organised by Marathi news channel Abp Majha, Mr. Pawar praised Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, who heads the Sena, for his leadership.

“I have no doubtthat the state government will complete its full tenure of five years,” the NCP chief said.

“Uddhav Thackeray is the kind of person who takes everyone forward with him,” he said.

When asked to rate the performance of Thackeray as CM, Pawar said the former has not yet faced an exam, but he is walking on the right path. “He gives his colleagues chanceto do good work,” Mr. Pawar added.

When asked about the differences in views among the three ruling constituents, Mr. Pawar said, “This is a coalition government. Once a coalition is formed, and it has decided to come together. (It is assumed that) One has agreed to certain terms, then there is no bitterness and discontentin the equation. There are not many hurdles in running the government“.

“The Shiv Sena, the NCP and the Congress know that they have to play a key role in making the MVA successful,” the NCP chief said.

'No remote control'

He refuted the speculation that the remote control of the government is in his hands.

“I have a very clear approach toward this alliance. I will not give my opinions until I am asked. If any decision is affecting the state negatively, then I discuss it at the party level, not in the government. We have a coordination committee now with two representatives from each party to solve contentious issues. I do not interfere in the government,” he said.

Mr. Pawar, however, said if there are some questions related to the Centre and Maharashtra then the ruling parties sit together and deliberate on them.

His comments came on the backdrop of Mr. Thackeray’s statement that he had no problems with the National Population Register (NPR) and that nobody should be afraid over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). The Sena’s stand appeared at variance with that of the NCP and the Congress.

Pawar said the MVA has a decentralised decision-making process.

“If any important decision is to be taken, when it comes to the Sena that it is done in Maharashtra. When it comes to the Congress one has to go to Delhi. If a decision- making process is localised, it is more effective,” Pawar said when asked about the difference in the work culture between the Sena and the Congress.

He said the Congress has nowadopted astand thatthe alliance has to work.

“We all have agreed to the Common Minimum Programme (CMP). So, the Congress has resolved to follow the CMP-based decisions and make the alliance work,” Pawar said.

When asked about MNS chief Raj Thackeray’s attempts to grow closer to the BJP, Pawar said, “Maharashtra needs an aggressive opposition right now. It remains to be seen who will take that role, whether it is the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena or the BJP.

“The MNS has a strong appeal in Maharashtra. People are keen to hear Raj Thackeray’s opinion on various issues.

However, why this appeal does not translate to votes needs to be studied,” he said.

257,2020/02/23,"""They said we were polluting the water source"": in Shivpuri, access to water riven by caste","Upper castes threatened by our assertion, rise in society, says Dalit victim’s family

At Fatehpur village in Shivpuri district, even water is riven by caste fault lines. As with territories — roads, shops, playgrounds and trees — split among groups, a mutual pact forbids a Dalit person from drawing water from gushing pumps and teeming wells held by Thakurs, an upper caste, enjoying piped connection at home, a luxury still a far cry for others.

On February 16, however, more than 50 members of a Mehtar family lost their only potable water source — a hand pump near a forest post — as foresters shot dead Madan Balmik while his family drew water from there. The other pump is used only for washing purposes.

“They said we were polluting the water source as we were lowly,” said Ms. Mamata, aunt-in-law of Madan, 38.“Where do we go to fetch water now?”

Like every day, Ms. Mamata, along with Madan’s wife and two daughters, sauntered to the pump, 200 metres away, clutching steel pots for the second round around 2.30 p.m.. As one of the daughters swilled a pot, some water splashed on a forester, who, enraged, hurled casteist slurs at them, and shot dead Madan when he reached the spot to quell tension.

After thrashing the women and hitting his brother Pankaj with rifle butts, the family alleged, foresters, and even villagers, left Madan, with more than 50 pellet wounds, unattended on the road for three hours. “Thakurs have vehicles but they refused to take him to hospital as they said touching him would pollute them,” said Ms. Babita, another relative. The family, which owns only two wheelers, could finally arrange for a vehicle, but Madan died on the way to the hospital in Karera, 25 km. away.

Two rifles seized

The police have seized two rifles, registered a case against 14 officials under the Indian Penal Code and The Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, and arrested six persons so far.

From four brothers brought to the village in the early 20th century to serve upper castes — carry human excreta on heads and skin carcasses — to their children completing primary school, taking up stable jobs in cities and grandchildren even graduating from college, the family’s tale is that of resilience and rise to overcome a repressive social predicament.

“Our father made sure we study. Now, our assertion in the village has riled the upper castes, which is denying us even water. We refuse to serve them. Most accused foresters belong to the upper castes. They know us well,” said Ms. Babita, a domestic help at an MLA’s residence in Uttar Pradesh.

Despite having left manual scavenging years ago, six siblings are still involved in sanitation work. Madan’s father, Mahattam Balmik, 61, the eldest sibling, became the first to land a government job, as a forest guard, 40 years ago, which caused an upheaval in the village. Despite this, the family doesn’t have toilets at home and still defecate in the open.

A fourth generation member, Madan’s daughter, who goes to Class VII, said the teacher still made Dalit children spruce up the school. “She hands us brooms as soon as we reach saying we’re destined to do such work, while Thakur children study in classrooms. Also, we’ve been asked to carry separate utensils so that the midday meal isn’t polluted for other children who get utensils at the school,” she said.

The family claimed riding a mare during wedding procession is forbidden for them, as is eating meals in plates similar to those used by the upper castes persons during functions.

“After bhaisahab was killed, we had to travel to Karera to get tonsured,” said Mr. Pankaj. Madan’s son Bimal, 16, feared he would not be able to appear for his Class X board examinations starting March 3 in order to support the family.

258,2020/02/23,A tool for every need: app serves as mechanisation guide to farmers,"KhetiGaadi.com is a place where farmers can buy, sell, rent agri equipment and learn about mechanisation

A city-based agritech start-up, founded by two entrepreneurs with roots in agriculture, provides information on the latest agricultural technology in an attempt to empower farmers and optimise their yields.

Since its inception in 2016, KhetiGaadi,com functions like an agricultural version of OLX, giving farmers various product options with detailed specifications to buy, sell and rent agricultural equipment. The brainchild of founder Pravin Shinde and Vishnu Dhas, the co-founder and executive director, it aims to give farmers precise knowledge about mechanisation — helping them, for instance, make the right choices regarding which equipment is best suited to their needs in a particular agricultural cycle — and encourages them to deploy it to maximise yields.

“Thus far, we have managed to connect four million farmers across the country with more than 20 tractor manufacturers and major agri-equipment manufacturers suppliers through our app,” says Mr. Shinde, who hails from an agricultural family in Satara district.

What struck Mr. Shinde during his studies in agriculture was that India’s farm mechanisation rate was less than 45%, less than half of that of countries like the United States and China. That too, when more than half of the country’s economy is dependent on agriculture. He conceived the idea of the start-up in 2013 and started building a team. In the next few years, he traversed the country, meeting farmers, attending agro-events and collecting data from farmers and dealers before forming a partnership with Mr. Dhas.

“We thought of a single platform to bring all stakeholders: farmers, manufacturers, brokers and buyers and sellers of farm mechanisation equipment, and accordingly started commercialisation of this idea in 2017-18,” says Mr. Dhas, whose parents worked on farms.

The challenge was dealing with a paucity of information on and the extent of farm mechanisation. Initially, Mr. Shinde tapped farmers in western Maharashtra owing to some degree of mechanisation there. “Even the executives of a tractor firm were unaware of what a tractor’s horsepower is,” said Mr. Shinde.

In the initial days, he went round ‘purchasing’ data from testing centres and collecting information about farmers from agricultural exhibitions. Later, he put up the consolidated data on the KhetiGaadi platform. “Today, more than 10,000 dealers and 6,500 service stations are associated with KhetiGaadi,” he said. Encouraging farmers to use technology-driven farm mechanisation products and optimum utilisation of technology in agricultural practices is KhetiGaadi’s mission.

The mobile app, available in 10 regional languages, has recorded more than three lakh installations till date. “All top 25 tractor manufacturers in the country, along with thousands of agricultural products are listed on the platform with all kinds of details. A farmer sitting in his village can request the price of any implement or equipment he wishes to use. For instance, if a farmer has a 50 HP tractor which has been used only for three months, he can list it on KhetiGaadi and get enquiries from interested parties,” said Mr. Dhas.

Given that the tractor industry is extremely price-sensitive, Mr. Shinde said the tractor market operates in a way where the dealer will not give the final price to the farmer unless he interacts directly with him.

“KhetiGaadi, which functions as a one-stop shop for agriculture equipment, can be a big help in this case as the farmer can get the lowdown on all agricultural products. Over and above this, if the farmer needs a demonstration or if he wishes the sales executive of a firm to contact him, he can do so through the app,” said Mr. Shinde.

As the agricultural implement market in India is fragmented, the benefit of this app is that it saves farmers the time for hunting implements, he said. “A major challenge in the scattered agriculture implement market in India concerns second-hand and used tractors. Each month, 2,000 to 2,500 tractors get sold in farmer-to-farmer transactions. In the rentals business, farmers require tractors for a specific time frame. So, KhetiGaadi provides for a direct farmer-to-farmer connect,” said Mr. Shinde.

With its larger objective of elevating the farmers’ standard of living by helping them make an informed choice, KhetiGaadi registered a gross merchandise value (GMV) of ₹50 crore in 2019. “Our GMV target by the end of 2021 is ₹100 crore. We are aiming at a GMV figure of ₹500 crore by 2025,” said Mr. Shinde.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/1uaznf/article30892322.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20BM-Khetigaadi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/a-tool-for-every-need-app-serves-as-mechanisation-guide-to-farmers/article30892323.ece

265,2020/02/23,"Explore opportunities in defence sector, MSMEs told","There is a need to indigenise, says Master General of Ordnance

With a slew of reforms and policy decisions in the recent years, the scope is high for the domestic private sector to participate in the defence sector’s Make in India programme, according to speakers at an interactive meeting organised here on Saturday by the CII - Coimbatore and CODISSIA.

S.K. Upadhya, Master General of Ordnance, said India was a huge importer of defence equipment. Subsequent to the imports, for every small need the sector had to look abroad for suppliers for spares and components. This led to delays and huge cost. “So, we had to indigenise.” Be it replacing old equipment, buying new systems, or maintaining the existing equipment and systems, which are huge, there is a need to indigenise.

Earlier, the industry faced issues such as lack of clarity on contacts in the forces to supply to the sector, etc. There has been a major change. Details are provided on Make in India defence website, the processes have been simplified, innovations by startups are supported, the annual plan on what the army proposes to buy from the industry is put out, and the indigenisation requirements are also listed. “We are more than keen to find solutions, work with you - from full systems to components,” he said.

According to Shailendra Malik from the Directorate of Indigenisation (Army), Electronics and Mechanical Engineers, the requirement is huge for development of Indian sources for spares and components for which external sources have dried. These come in different categories, such as armaments, engineering equipment, and electrical and electronics. There is still a large number of components and spares that need to be indigenised. “We interact with the industry and say how they can take part,” he said.

R. Varadarajan, former chairman of Confederation of Indian Industry, Coimbatore, (CII - Coimbatore) said India was a large importer of defence needs till 2018. Though procurement from the private sector is open since 2001, it is only recently that indigenisation has gained momentum. There has been a plethora of reforms in the last five yeas for better private participation and indigenisation. There is scope for more participation, especially from MSMEs, in the defence sector, he said. President of Coimbatore District Small Industries Association (CODISSIA) R. Ramamurthy spoke about the capabilities of Coimbatore MSMEs and the opportunities in the defence sector for these units.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/m43ndz/article30892709.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB23SKUPADHYA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/explore-opportunities-in-defence-sector-msmes-told/article30892710.ece
266,2020/02/23,Leopards use defunct quarries as hideout in Talavadi,"They hide here during the day and enter villages at night to prey on cattle

With many incidents of cattle kills by leopards reported in villages located in Talavadi Forest Range in Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve (STR), a field inspection has revealed that leopards are using seven defunct quarries were used by leopards as a hideout to enter the village and hunt their prey.

In the past three months, leopards killed cows and goats in Soosaipuram and Doddagajanur villages that were located near the Tamil Nadu – Karnataka border, causing panic among the people.

Cages were set up in the two villages to trap a leopard that preyed on livestock and were monitored round-the-clock by forest personnel. Since the animal could not be caught, the cages were relocated. These villages were located five km from the forest area of Talamalai and hence the animal could not have entered from the forest area. This led to personnel inspecting seven defunct quarries near the forest border where they noticed the pug marks of a leopard.

The quarries remained defunct for the last five months.

A team led by S. Sivakumar, Talavadi Forest Ranger, found that leopards from the forests in Karnataka used the quarries as a hideout and hunted their prey during night in these two villages. Huge boulders and bushes in the quarries made it a safe place for leopards, especially with no security personnel posted in these places.

Through the Talavadi Tahsildar, the quarry owners were instructed to remove the bushes and also monitor the quarries. Also, forest personnel continue to patrol the quarries and the areas near the forest border.

Officials have asked the villagers to alert the Forest Department on cattle kills so that compensation could be given to its owners immediately.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/llrja3/article30893580.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ER23PATROLLING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/leopards-use-defunct-quarries-as-hideout-in-talavadi/article30893581.ece

As the Shaheen Bagh-style protest at Aathupalam here entered the fourth day, Naam Tamilar chief coordinator Seeman and CPI(M) leader P. Sampath visited the protest site on Saturday.

Mr. Seeman alleged that the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR) were “distractions intended to keep people in a state of panic.” He challenged Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah, Union Ministers and the MPs who supported CAA, NRC and NPR to first furnish proofs of their respective citizenships.

The Congress and the BJP are equally responsible for CAA, NRC and NPR and condemned the DMK for not criticising the Ayodhya verdict, he said.

CPI(M) Central Committee member Mr. Sampath, in his speech, alleged that the BJP-led Central government was “destroying the Constitution and the economy.” Dismissing Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami’s claims that CAA will not affect Muslims, Mr. Sampath claimed that it was not the voice of the Chief Minister, but that of the “RSS and Sangh Parivar.” The anti-CAA protests were gaining momentum with each day and all “democratic and secular” movements lend their support to the protests, he said.

According to police, nearly 500 people participated in the Aathupalam protest on Saturday.

Coimbatore city police have decided to restrict halting of private omni buses on city roads in the late evening hours to avoid traffic congestion.

On Avinashi Road, the omni buses can halt only at two locations- near Lakhmi Mills junction and airport junction - after they leave Gandhipuram.

At present, omni buses conducting long distance night services make long halts at several places between Lakhmi Mills junction and airport junction from 6.30 p.m. when the vehicle movement is at its peak.

Hope College junction is the worst affected stretch as omni buses are halted for longer duration, before the road over bridge across the railway line.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (Traffic) R. Mutharasu said the restriction would be brought in soon in coordination with owners of omni buses.

Boarding points

He said that bus operators would have to make changes in online booking platforms so that boarding points permitted by the police alone are shown to passengers.

At present, passengers have more locations to choose according to their convenience. Buses are also halted in some locations to load parcels, which also consumes time.

276,2020/02/23,"South Africa holds nerve, beats England","van Niekerk leads from the front with good contributions with bat and ball

South Africa’s batters held their nerve to deliver an upset six-wicket victory over England at the women’s Twenty20 World Cup in Perth on Sunday.

The Proteas have made the early running in Group B along with the West Indies, who beat newcomers Thailand on Saturday. Only the top two from each of the two five-team groups qualify for the knockout phase.

Chasing a modest 124, South Africa appeared in control at 90 for one in the 16th over before the match turned with the wickets of captain Dane van Niekerk (46) and Marizanne Kapp (38) in quick succession.

Needing nine runs off the final over, Mignon du Preez was the heroine with a six off the third ball from Katherine Brunt before hitting the winning runs with a boundary.

It capped an impressive performance from South Africa after van Niekerk’s decision to bowl was vindicated when her accurate attack restricted England to 123 for eight in its 20 overs.

The captain also picked up two for 20 in her four overs, earning her the Player-of-the-Match award.

England was shackled by disciplined bowling until Natalie Sciver (50) upped the ante at the backend of the innings.

The scores:

England 123/8 in 20 overs (Natalie Sciver 50; Ayabonga Khaka 3/25) lost to South Africa 127/4 in 19.4 overs (Dane van Niekerk 46, Marizanne Kapp 38).

277,2020/02/23,"Battling the breeze was tough, says Ashwin","India spinner hopes to have a say in the fourth innings

The breeze almost blew him away, says R. Ashwin, but he continued bowling even as icy winds swept across the Basin Reserve.

“Look, I am not the lightest, but it [the wind] was pushing me across, so it must have been of some significance,” Ashwin said.

Taming the wind

However, he operated well in the tough conditions, invariably bowling against the wind, striving to gain control.

Ashwin said, “On both days, I’ve had to bowl from ends where the breeze was coming against me. And the wind was such that a spinner couldn’t really take any benefit from it.”

The off-spinner added, “So I had to adjust and make the best of what was available. I quite enjoyed the way I bowled and the fourth innings might offer us a little more from the surface.”

Ashwin felt there was plenty of cricket left in the game.

Still time

“There is so much time left. It’s difficult to say what might happen.

“There are six sessions to go and we are not even in a position to say what is a good score to defend.”

On only Mayank Agarwal being able to find the right balance between offence and defence, Ashwin said: “It’s an individual’s gameplan and it’s hard to say that one needs to play in this way in terms of attack and defence. It’s a fine line.”

Plan for Williamson

About having a deep extra-cover for Kane Williamson, Ashwin said, “If you look at Williamson’s wagon wheel, I would have put it right up if it was up to me because Kane, against the off-spinner, always looks to hit through covers. He doesn’t cut or step out much either.”

The Kiwis, he said, comprehended the conditions well. “They hit with the wind.”

At the cold and blustery Basin Reserve, Ashwin has some unfinished business left.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/w0e24f/article30896341.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH24ASH,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/battling-the-breeze-was-tough-says-ashwin/article30896342.ece
278,2020/02/23,‘Getting Kohli to err was nice’,"Flexible gameplan is Boult’s success mantra

Trent Boult is a smooth operator. The left-armer is not just a Sultan of swing, he’s a lot more than that. He can bowl at varying lengths and angles, employ the short-pitched stuff effectively.

A beaming Boult said after the third day’s play on Sunday, “It’s turning into a pretty good wicket. My accuracy was probably better and coming around the wicket was a good option.”

Bowling at the Basin

Talking about the dynamics of bowling at the Basin Reserve, Boult said, “Generally the wind is the biggest thing to deal with. But if I can chop and change those angles and not let a batsman get familiar with what I am trying to do, I can succeed.”

Boult said the luxury of being a left-armer was being able to use those subtle changes.

He said, “The red balls here in New Zealand haven't been swinging as much as they have in the past and if that's not happening for me then it comes down to changing angles and using different parts of the crease.”

The last few weeks have been tough for Boult; he’s had to grapple with fitness concerns. He said, “I’m just happy to be back out there. I’ve been pretty light on Test cricket and it’s been a little frustrating on the sidelines.”

Queried about his creative batting — his thrill-a-minute 38 was among the high points of the day — Boult said, “I enjoy my batting, it looks like I’m laughing and mucking around but nice to make contact with a couple today.”

On bowling short and round the wicket — a line Neil Wagner specialises in — Boult said, “Indian batsmen like to feel the bat on ball and free their hands... I’m not giving you all my secrets, but I’m going to bowl around the wicket to change that angle.""

The ploy works

On his short-ball ploy against Virat Kohli, Boult said, “When he hits he hits well and gets boundaries. From our point of view we were trying to dry that up and for me personally using the wicket and the shorter ball was a good plan to try and control his run rate.

“It was nice to draw the error out of him.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/getting-kohli-to-err-was-nice/article30896287.ece
279,2020/02/23,India in a bind as Boult puts a spanner in the works,"After a fine cameo with the bat, he strikes down three; Mayank does well again, Rahane digs in

In the morning, coming in as the last man, he danced around the crease to whip up a delightful cameo of innovation and unorthodoxy.

The edge

Trent Boult’s enterprising 38 extended New Zealand’s lead to 183, giving the hosts a psychological edge as they entered the Basin Reserve ground again on the third day of the first Test here on Sunday.

Then the left-arm swing bowler, rediscovering his rhythm, bowled a compelling spell, varying his pace, harnessing the angles and the wind, and controlling his movement on a pitch that had eased out.

He prised out Prithvi Shaw with a lifting delivery from round the wicket — a backward square-leg was precisely placed to pluck the fended ball — and then brought the sphere back into Cheteshwar Pujara, who shouldered arms and heard the sound of death.

Boult was not finished yet. Big fish Virat Kohli was just getting into his stride when he attempted to pull a quicker short ball from Boult and only succeeding in nicking to ’keeper B-J. Watling.

India was 144 for four with a fighting Ajinkya Rahane (25), who essayed a couple of scorching cuts but was struck on the helmet by a Tim Southee lifter, battling on with a determined Hanuma Vihari (15).

In the morning, India let the initiative slip, unable to blow away the tail; from 225 for seven, New Zealand recovered to 348 all out, a sizeable lead of 183.

This was the critical phase of the match when Colin de Grandhome, Kyle Jamieson and Boult took the game away from India.

All these extra runs meant India was under pressure when it batted again.

Only Mayank Agarwal (58) was able to put together an innings of substance.

Mayank is an organised batsman with temperament and strokes. Even as he keeps the scoreboard moving without getting into a defensive rut, the opener offers stability.

He has a trigger-movement forward but does not commit himself. Mayank can shift his weight to the back-foot with ease.

A cover-drive off Southee was all about timing; so was the off-drive off Trent Boult. Mayank then whipped out a back-foot punch off Southee.

He was a tad unlucky in his dismissal, getting a faint tickle to a delivery down leg-side from Southee.

Judicious mix

In the morning, Grandhomme (43) held the Kiwi innings together.

There is a grace to de Grandhomme’s batting that is hard to miss.

A big-built man, he has a relaxed stance where the bat is held aloft and his movement, either front or back, is decisive.

Between periods of defence, he blasted Ishant to the long-off fence, whipped Bumrah and flicked Ashwin fine.

Importantly, he built partnerships.

He cleverly played second fiddle to Jamieson as the debutant launched into the Indian bowling during the whirlwind 71-run eighth-wicket stand.

Jamieson, all of 6’8”, is a natural striker who uses his reach. He twice pulled Shami for the maximum, one of them was a top-edge.

And Jamieson (44) clubbed Ashwin for two 6s, both between long-on and mid-wicket.

The off-spinner continued to flight and the dip in his bowling produced the fatal mis-hit from Jamieson.

There was further sting in New Zealand’s tail with Boult assuming centrestage with his brand of strokeplay.

Ishant, who fired out Boult with a short-pitched one for his fifth wicket, was easily the pick with his consistency, off-stump line and bounce.

Turn and bounce

Ashwin also bowled well. He spun one from middle to leg to have Grandhomme — the Kiwi attempted to turn the ball — caught behind.

Whenever he flighted, there was some turn and bounce.

If India sets a reasonable target, Ashwin could be a factor in the fourth innings.

Jasprit Bumrah snared Watling with a short-pitched ball outside off first thing in the morning, but this was an innings where he largely struggled. Bumrah needs to pitch the ball up in these conditions.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/xcquxd/article30896148.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH24BOULT,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/india-in-a-bind-as-boult-puts-a-spanner-in-the-works/article30896149.ece
280,2020/02/23,Gujarat enters semis in style,"Completes a 464 run rout of Goa with a day to spare

Gujarat eventually ended Goa’s misery, completing the 464-run rout minutes before the end of the extended half hour’s play on the penultimate day of their Ranji Trophy quarterfinal at the Sardar Vallabhai Patel Stadium here on Sunday.

Starting at 158 for one in its second essay, Gujarat hoped to give its specialist batsmen an opportunity to pile on the runs ahead of next week’s semifinal. But Lakshay Garg’s four wickets for 14 in six overs forced Gujarat to declare midway through the morning session at 199 for six, setting an insurmountable target of 630.

Promising left-arm spinner Siddharth Desai (5/81) and left-arm pacer Arzan Nagwaswalla (4/18) then ensured that the match finished on Sunday. Desai trapped last-man Vijesh Prabhudesai in front to complete the win 12 minutes before close of play.

Smidgeon of hope

Earlier, Goa lost its openers cheaply yet again along with captain Amit Verma to leave it reeling at 13 for three. However, Suyash Prabhudessai (66, 135b, 11x4, 1x6) and Snehal Kauthankar’s (17, 77b, 2x4) 81-run association for the fourth wicket raised hopes of stretching the match into the last day.

But Kauthankar got a debatable decision from umpire Nandan for the second time in the match, adjudged caught-behind after a long delay despite the batsman indicating the ball had brushed his thigh-pad. Once he departed, the Goa lower order succumbed to the accuracy and pressure built by Gujarat’s attack.

While Desai used the angles well, even managing to exploit the rough on the pitch, Nagwaswalla, the local boy, bowled a heartening spell late in the day that ensured Gujarat has an extra day’s rest before the semifinal in Rajkot.

Gandhi reprimanded

Gujarat’s Chirag Gandhi was reprimanded for breaching the code of conduct — “charging at an umpire” as Gujarat tried to get Goa all out. After being charged by on-field umpires Nandan and C. Ravikanth Reddy, Gandhi accepted his offence and was officially reprimanded by match referee Youraj Singh during a short hearing after the match.

Cracking the whip on illegal occupants of government flats, the Delhi PWD has ordered a door-to-door survey of all the housing units and asked senior officials to submit a report by February 24.

The Public Works Department of the Delhi government has recently communicated to its senior officials concerned, including executive engineers and assistant engineers, to carry out the survey of government-owned flats in their respective jurisdiction.

The move comes days after the Delhi High Court rebuked the Housing Ministry for permitting over 550 accommodation units to be illegally occupied by retired officials and ordered the Centre to get them vacated within two weeks.

In its written communication dated February 19, the PWD said the High Court passed a judgment on February 5 and issued a notice to the government to provide the details of all officials who are illegally occupying government accommodation even after retirement.

“All executive engineers, assistant engineers and junior engineers are directed to carry out a door-to-door survey of all housing units under their jurisdiction and furnish a consolidated report by February 24,” the PWD said.

According to the PWD, officials will have to give details of unauthorised occupants such as their names, department and designation, date of allotment of flat and date of retirement.

On February 5, the court had also said that allowing illegal occupation of government accommodation for several years amounts to “connivance and conspiracy”.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/v1alkp/article30865178.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL20-HC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/delhi-pwd-orders-door-to-door-survey-of-govt-flats-to-find-out-illegal-occupants/article30894473.ece
283,2020/02/23,Pro and anti-CAA groups clash in Delhi,"The incident was reported around 1 km from the Jaffarabad Metro Station, where one side of the carriageway had been blocked by anti-CAA protesters since morning

Tension prevailed in north-east Delhi’s Maujpur area after a clash broke out between pro- and anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) protesters on Sunday.

The incident was reported around 1 km from the Jaffarabad Metro Station, where one side of the carriageway had been blocked by anti-CAA protesters since morning. After slogan shouting from both sides, the groups started pelting each other with stones, leading to chaos in the area.

In the Hauz Rani area of south Delhi, women protesters alleged that policemen brutally thrashed and lathi charged them when they were marching in support of the ‘Bharat bandh’ called by the Bhim Army. They also alleged that many women fainted but the police refused to let them access a hospital nearby.

Bharatiya Janata Party’s Kapil Mishra reached the Maujpur chowk with around 300 people and staged a sit-in in support of the CAA at 4 p.m. A group of anti-CAA protesters also reached the location. Both groups started shouting slogans. Simultaneously, a group came from a narrow lane and hurled stones at the pro-CAA protesters, said a police officer.

The officer added that both sides threw stones at each other for half an hour, till more police personnel reached the location to control the situation. “There were only a handful of policemen and they were outnumbered by the crowd. After reinforcement arrived, we controlled the situation.”

“We used tear gas to disperse the crowd,” added the police officer. A few people suffered injuries in the stone pelting. They had been rushed to a hospital, said the police.

Similar protests, which mirrored the Shaheen Bagh sit-in, started in Khureji Khaas in Karawal Nagar and Chandbagh in northeast Delhi, and Hauz Rani in South Delhi on Sunday, prompting police to step up security.

For security reasons, the entry and exit gates of Jaffrabad and Maujpur-Babarpur Metro were closed. The 400-metre-stretch between Maujpur traffic signal, where a temple is located, to Babarpur station, was strewn with bricks and stones after the clashes.

Blame game

The two groups blamed each other for starting the violence.

Sources said clashes began soon after a gathering called by BJP leader Kapil Mishra who demanded that the police remove anti-CAA protestors within three days. Taking to Twitter, Mr. Mishra said, “We have given a three-day ultimatum to the Delhi Police to get the road cleared. Get the Jaffrabad and Chandbagh road cleared.”

Delhi police personnel later stopped the pro-CAA protestors when they tried to march towards Kardampuri where another anti-CAA protest was underway. The security personnel formed a human-chain to separate the groups and defuse tension.

“We are trying to identify the people behind the incident,” Joint Commissioner of Police (Eastern Range) Alok Kumar told reporters, adding that the situation was under control.

A large number of anti-CAA protesters in Jaffarabad blocked one side of the carriageway outside the Jaffarabad Metro Station.

“We are not going to move from here unless our demands are fulfilled... unless the government takes back CAA and NRC. I have not been able to attend college because of this. How will I focus on making my career when our government is trying to snatch our right to live here peacefully?” said Mahi Khan, a protester.

“We are speaking to local leaders so that peace prevails in the area. We are also requesting protesters to clear the main road,” said Mr. Kumar.

284,2020/02/23,How AAP won the social media battle in Delhi polls,"The party played ‘smart’ by roping in professionals for new-age platforms, opted for online advertisements focusing on age-specific videos; BJP banked on apps and social networking sites for dissemination of content

From advertising on Google, which was never done before by the party, to hiring professional help for advertisements and holding meetings with its social media teams three months before the notification of the elections, the Aam Aadmi Party fought a pitched social media battle in the run-up to the 2020 Delhi Assembly elections.

According to Facebook, AAP spent ₹69 lakh on advertisements from February 2019 to February 2020, during which the party fought the Lok Sabha and Delhi Assembly elections.

“We did Google and Youtube advertisements for the first time and it gave us visibility that was unprecedented for us. One could see our advertisements on different websites while browsing, though we did not have any deal with the sites,” Ankit Lal, social media and information technology head of AAP, told The Hindu.

“In 2019 Lok Sabha election, we spent a small amount on Facebook advertisements. But we never did anything of this scale. Also, the money spent on Facebook advertisements was higher compared with previous elections,” he said.

Though banner advertisements on Google were generic, they had different advertisements for different age groups. “The videos we used were age-specific. We had different videos for senior citizens and youngsters,” he said.

A party volunteer left his job as a digital advertising professional to handle the Facebook and Google advertisements for AAP, he added.

Game changer

Videos were the ultimate game changer this time, Mr. Lal said, adding that the party had for the first time hired professional help for the purpose.

“We operated on two fronts and it was a conscious choice. On one front, we highlighted the work done by the AAP government and on the other, we attacked Manoj Tiwari [Delhi BJP president] as he was the easiest target,” Mr. Lal said.

“We needed help as we did not have the bandwidth to do it. We took help from a professional agency and their team saw hundreds of movies and songs of Manoj Tiwari and also all the Big Boss [TV reality show] episodes. Sometimes, after watching a three-hour-long movie, they would find a five-second clip that we could use. This was their primary work,” Mr. Lal said.

From these clips the team made memes that went viral.

“They were also handling new-age platforms such as ShareChat and TikTok and our teams were handling Facebook and Twitter on which we have a strong presence,” he added.

On the response that they received, he said, “There were two types of responses. One was real time from the party’s Twitter account, which was done by us. But the memes and video content were done by the agency.”

Advertising tactic

When asked whether these online advertisements translated into votes, Mr. Lal, said, “It is very intangible.”

“But there was a lot of conversation around it and stories in mainstream media. When the social media posts spilled onto mainstream media, which was our ultimate goal, it did have an impact. We saved a lot of money by grabbing the same eyeballs without advertising,” Mr. Lal said.

In 2015, no one used these many videos. In the 2020 elections, the concentration was on videos and there was also better Internet penetration.

“Three months ago, we called a meeting of social media teams and gave them a list of works done by the party. We did not have a troll army, it was not [Narendra] Modi versus [Arvind] Kejriwal, but there was a lot of content in it,” an AAP spokesperson said. The leader said that about 25 smaller teams coordinated with the central team.

BJP’s strategy

Leaders associated with the BJP’s social media campaign said the party sought to harness the might of a national team, along with that of as many as 5,800 WhatsApp groups, during the Delhi Assembly elections.

The creation of content for these, however, was not limited to its social media war rooms only. Nukkad nataks, ground surveys and interviews with common citizens also contributed to the content.

“We created a strong Whatsapp network. Videos were made to expose Kejriwal on a regular basis. Counter videos were also created to give a befitting reply to AAP,” said Pratyush Kanth, Delhi BJP in-charge of media, social media and IT cell.

“While videos were made in Bhojpuri to attract the Poorvanchali voters, regular trends on Twitter were not only of this content but also of content generated from the ground through nukkad nataks and campaigns being undertaken by our leaders,” Mr. Kanth said.

This content was then disseminated to over 5,800 Whatsapp groups as soon as possible, he added.

Instant communication

According to Neelkant Bakshi, co-head of Delhi BJP media, social media and IT cell, instant dissemination of content was the key objective of the party.

“There was a lot of content being generated and emphasis was on ensuring that this was made available for downloading and sharing at the earliest,” Mr. Bakshi said.

“We made massive use of Twitter and Instagram and even launched specific apps like ‘Kamal Connect’ with a purpose to disseminate contents of Manoj Tiwari’s campaign, including songs,” he added.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/t9pxa1/article30892666.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL23-AAPWARROOM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/how-aap-won-the-social-media-battle-in-delhi-polls/article30892667.ece

286,2020/02/23,Cleaning Yamuna on AAP’s priority list: Rai,"Tackling water pollution is another one

Environment Minister Gopal Rai on Saturday visited a sewage treatment plant located in Delhi Gate and said that cleaning the Yamuna and eradicating water pollution from Delhi within the next five years are the topmost priorities of his government.

Briefing the media after the visit, Mr. Rai said: “There are around 35 sewage treatment plants [STP] across Delhi that function to eliminate pollutants from waterbodies through technically advanced mechanisms. These plants purify untreated water, generate gases that run the sewage plants, and extract waste from water which can be made into compost for agricultural use. Our focus is solely on eliminating water pollution in the city.”

Cleaning the Yamuna was one of the promises in a 10-point ‘guarantee card’ released by the Aam Aadmi Party chief and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in the run-up to the Assembly elections.

“Our primary focus is on cleaning the Yamuna and eliminating waste from the local waterbodies across the city in the next five years so that effluents from these waterbodies are removed before flowing into the river. Once we are successful in achieving this goal, we will also work on developing the riverfront of the Yamuna,” Mr. Rai said.

Noted scholars and intellectuals under the banner of Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind on Saturday unanimously passed the “Delhi declaration”, a seven-point resolution which calls upon members of the public to refuse cooperation with National Population Registry (NPR) enumerators, a statement read.

The resolution also called upon all State governments to immediately suspend the NPR process, condemned the “targeted killings” of peaceful demonstrators through police firing, especially in Uttar Pradesh, condemned the arrest of people under laws of sedition and other “draconian laws”, gave salute to the protests taking place across the country and called upon all protesters to maintain peace and prevent attempts to sabotage the movement.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/jamiat-asks-people-not-to-cooperate-with-npr-enumerators/article30892658.ece
288,2020/02/23,BJP leaders meet to choose LoP in Delhi Assembly,"Rohini MLA Vijender Gupta and Mohan Singh Bisht both have fair chance of being picked

Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national general secretary Saroj Pandey, who has been appointed a central observer for its affairs in Delhi, met with the eight BJP legislators that the party will send to the Delhi Assembly, on Saturday evening.

Inaugural session

The objective of the meeting, which took place at the party’s State headquarters, was to choose the Leader of Opposition on the heels of the Delhi Assembly’s three-day inaugural session which will commence on Monday.

“Rohini MLA Vijender Gupta, who retained his seat with a significant margin, is expected to be chosen once again as the Leader of Opposition given both his seniority in the party as well as the significance of his win. But another senior leader, Mohan Singh Bisht, who won from Karawal Nagar, cannot be ruled out,” a party insider claimed.

Mr. Gupta, who led the BJP’s four Opposition MLAs in the Delhi Assembly during the previous five-year term of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government, secured 62,174 votes or 53.67% of the vote share.

His closest competitor, the Aam Aadmi Party’s Rajesh Nama Bansiwala, got 49,536 votes or 42.75% of the vote share, translating to a victory margin of 12,648 votes for the former Delhi BJP chief.

“His [Mr. Gupta’s] closest competitor in terms of votes, vote share, winning margin and seniority in the party is Mohan Singh Bisht who has been associated with the BJP for decades and has only lost one election — in 2015 — against his name,” said a party source.

Mr. Bisht secured 96,721 votes or 50.59% of the vote share against 88,498 votes or 46.29% of the vote share in favour of AAP’s Durgesh Pathak on the Karawal Nagar Assembly seat.

“However, the party is of the view that Mr. Gupta’s win was one of the most uphill tasks. The party’s victory in most other seats located in East or North-East Delhi was due to a pro-BJP wave for which he should be rewarded,” the source said further.

The meeting on Saturday evening, however, remained inconclusive with party sources stating that the feedback received by Ms.Pandey from the eight BJP MLAs would be discussed with the party’s seven MPs prior to taking a decision.

This process may continue till Sunday with the party likely to announce its decision latest by Sunday evening, the source said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/8xzlx8/article30892654.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22DELPRIYAVIJENDERGUPTA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/bjp-leaders-meet-to-choose-lop-in-delhi-assembly/article30892655.ece
289,2020/02/23,Happiness curriculum makes students more responsible: Manish Sisodia,"Sisodia drops in at school, his first visit after assuming office

After visiting a government school on Saturday, Education Minister Manish Sisodia said that ‘happiness curriculum’ has been instrumental in making students evolve as good and responsible human beings.

Mr. Sisodia interacted with students of SKV/SBV West Vinod Nagar during ‘happiness class’ and ‘mindfulness class’. This was his first visit to a school after resuming his office for the third time as Education Minister.

“If ‘happiness classes’ are praised then it becomes a moment of pride for me. ‘Happiness classes’ bring about a positive change in children and it is good to note the psychological and emotional development of the students through the curriculum. We started ‘happiness classes’ some 1.5 years ago. We conduct meditation classes and have been teaching emotional stories with a good message to work on the emotional development of children. After introducing ‘happiness classes’,the children have become more aware of the efforts of their parents, have started to treat them with respect, trying to develop healthy relationships with friends and neighbours and growing emotionally strong,” Mr. Sisodia said.

Steady improvement

The Minister said that focus on studies has also improved and apart from providing them with quality education and making them responsible professionals, the Delhi government has also been focusing on holistic development of children as good human beings.

“Happiness curriculum has been instrumental in making our children evolve as good, responsible human beings for the last 1.5 years. It gives me immense happiness and fills me with a huge sense of pride when educators and heads of schools from all over the world reach out to us to understand the ‘happiness curriculum’ and its positive impact,” he added.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/m9xu9i/article30892650.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22DELPRIYASISODIA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/happiness-curriculum-makes-students-more-responsible/article30892651.ece

295,2020/02/23,New Ashok Nagar ‘honour killing’: kin lived normal life after murder,"Employee, neighbours say family was polite to everyone

Employee and neighbours of a family, the members of which have allegedly killed a 25-year-old woman and dumped her body in a canal, said that the Chaudhary’s had lived a “normal life” at their New Ashok Nagar residence after committing the crime.

At the double-storey residence, which has a dairy on the ground floor, Vijay, an employee of the family, claimed that he “did not get a whiff of any disturbance in the last 20 days”.

The family had allegedly killed Sheetal Chaudhary on January 30 for secretly marrying one Ankit Bhati last year. They told the police that they were against the marriage as Mr. Bhati was from the same clan as them. Mr. Bhati runs a dairy and lives with his family in a village close to Dabri.

Mr. Vijay said that he comes to work in the afternoon and leaves in the evening after rearing the cattle. “They all appeared normal after January 30 as well. There was no difference in their behaviour or any visible tension in the family. I just did not see Sheetal in the house,” he said.

Shocked over murder

Neighbours of the Chaudhary’s also said that they “did not appear to be ones who could do something like this”. Many expressed shock after learning about the murder. A neighbour, who did not wish to be identified, said that the Chaudhary’s had been living in the house for more than 20 years and were always nice to others. “The family never had a fight with anyone. They restricted their interaction with people to greeting them with a smile,” said a 70-year-old grocery shop owner in the area who did not wish to be named.

A few women, who were sitting on the street, said Sheetal was a well-behaved and educated woman. “She was my child’s tuitor. She always said she wanted to do a job. She used to play badminton with the kids,” said another person who did not wish to be named.

A police officer said that Sheetal and Mr. Bhati got into a relationship three years ago. They got married in October 2019 in an Arya Samaj temple but continued to live in their own houses. Sheetal’s family came to know about the marriage recently.

Sheetal’s mother, father, two paternal uncles, a cousin and brother-in-law have been arrested for the murder.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/u3e7k6/article30892639.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE23MURDER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/new-ashok-nagar-honour-killing-kin-lived-normal-life-after-murder/article30892641.ece
296,2020/02/23,Scores evacuated for razing six-storey structure near JNU,"Residents leave behind money, valuables, documents; take shelter on streets

Scores of people have been evacuated from their houses in front of JNU main gate on account of a dangerous six-storey construction being demolished.

People left their houses with nothing but clothes. With valuables, jewellery and various documents left behind, many of them, who have taken shelter on the footpath outside their houses for the last three days, are worried about their livelihoods.

‘Ran out to be safe’

Poonam Singh (37), who lived on the top floor of the six-storey building, along with her husband and four children, said that she was sleeping when she heard a loud creaking sound. Residents felt a vibration that shook the building and many woke up. Ms. Singh immediately ran downstairs, leaving behind everything she owned “just to be safe”.

Clothes hung on her floor could be seen as she pointed towards her house. “I haven’t changed, haven’t taken a bath, haven’t even been able to brush my teeth in the last three days,” she said.

Ms. Singh, like other residents here, have been taking help from friends and has been standing outside the house as municipal authorities attempt to bring down the building with heavy machinery.

Ramvati Chauhan, who lived on the third floor of the house, left only with a mobile phone and a water bottle. With her husband being ill, she is the only earning member of the house. Ms. Chauhan said that among other valuables, she had nearly ₹1.5 lakh for her daughter’s marriage kept in the house.

Others, including one Rocky Kumar, were worried about their education certificates that would get “buried” during demolition. Mr. Kumar was scheduled for an interview with a multinational company on Sunday but said that he would not be able to appear for it without his certificates.

Many, including the residents of around eight houses in the vicinity that were evacuated due to safety issues, have been roaming in the street outside JNU for the last few days. They are worried about their belongings and “trying to make ends meet”.

People said they had visited the Chief Minister’s office, the area Sub-Divisional Magistrate and other officials but in vain. They were told that the matter was under the South Delhi Municipal Corporation.

With authorities having failed to demolish the building in the last three days, residents here believe that they could go to their respective rooms and recover some essential items.

Risky matter

A senior corporation official said that it was too dangerous and would be a risk to people’s lives. On being asked by the people if some sort of supporting structure could help temporarily hold up the building, the official said that it would put the lives of the labourers at risk and that was not an option.

On Saturday, authorities worked till evening, trying to bring down the building using earth-moving machines, a crane, and later by attaching metal rods. One of the challenges in bringing down the structure was lack of space to bring in heavy machines, the official said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/1t5w7v/article30892616.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE23COLLAPSE1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/scores-evacuated-for-razing-six-storey-structure-near-jnu/article30892622.ece
297,2020/02/23,"Three killed, one injured in car crash at Saroornagar","All four occupants of the vehicle were said to be in an inebriated condition

Three youngsters, two of them software engineers, were killed and one escaped with minor injuries when their car crashed at Saroornagar in the wee hours of Sunday.

The youth at the wheel, who was a 29-year-old techie, and the three other occupants were in an inebriated condition, police said.

Madupati Vinayaka Mallikarjun (29) from New Saidabad, Daravat Sriram Naik (28) of Santosh Nagar, both techies, and Pebba Sainath (27), a private employee from Saidabad, died on the spot, while Maganti Ramapadma Kalyan (27) suffered minor injuries, as he was wearing the seat belt.

Police said the accident took place around 1.50 a.m. when the four were going towards Malakpet after having liquor at a bar in Gurramguda on the eastern fringes. Even after the bar was closed for the day, the youngsters continued consuming liquor in its parking area.

Around 1.20 a.m., they started to drive to Malakpet for dinner. When the car reached the Karmanghat crossroads, Vinayaka lost control on the vehicle that was moving at high speed.

“The car veered off to the left and hit three telephone poles and a tree, and came to a halt only after ploughing into a tiffin centre between Karmanghat and Champapet,” said Saroornagar inspector E. Srinivas Reddy.

He said passers-by called an ambulance, alerted the police on Dial 100 and pulled out the occupants from the mangled four-wheeler.

“While three occupants died on the spot, Kalyan was rushed to a nearby hospital,” the officer said, adding that two of their friends — Shaik Gulzar Ahmed and Botta Yuvamitra — who were following them on a bike, identified the victims.

The impact of the accident was such that even the air bags that opened after the crash could not save them.

Mr. Srinivas Reddy said that the victims had known each other for the past several years and used to play snooker at a gaming point in Gaddiannaram.

299,2020/02/23,Adding hues to cityscape,"House walls in Filmnagar get an art makeover

As the road from Jubilee Hills rolls down dramatically bringing in view the domes of Qutb Shahi tombs, a splash of colour greets commuters.

The area that had staid pink walls has been transformed over the past 20 days into a work of art. Flowing abstract patterns in tropical colours on a gigantic scale, paintings of icons, temple art and social messages view for the attention of the road-user. The rock formation near Shaikpet nala have also been painted over.

“We like it much better now. The area looks nice and a lot of people stop to have a look before driving on,” says Ellamma, stepping out to dry clothes in the housing block, which has gotten a makeover as part of an art project called ‘Misaal Hyderabad’. Her neighbours are equally interested in talking about the artwork. “They said they will finish this part after a few days,” says Ellamma pointing to a block with fluttering laundry.

“It was a few months back when Suresh Chukkapalli of Phoenix Foundation got in touch with me and we scouted a few locations before settling down for the Filmnagar location,” says Rouble Nagi, the artist, who earlier made a big impact with her work in the slums of Dharavi in Mumbai. “We chose this area as it has a school as well as a neighbourhood which I thought can be spruced up by using art,” says Ms. Nagi.

Many world bodies, including the UNESCO, have touted the case for art and culture as tools for social advancement and achieving sustainable development goals. But the change in the society in the single-bedroom housing blocks built under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission programme will not be overnight. “We don’t expect a miracle. We are creating awareness about cleanliness and hygiene. We are involving the community. One of the women had wanted pink colour on the wall as her daughter was getting married and we did just that,” says Ms. Nagi.

There is a change in the Government School in Filmnagar as well but with a twist. It is more homily-driven as messages are painted within colourful blocks. “We just watched them paint,” says Mohan, a Class VIII student of the school. About 15 volunteers worked on the project. Interestingly, the art project has used some 1,000 litres of colours to transform the area where a shanty town used to exist till 2008.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/1ujbyv/article30891994.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy23art-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/adding-hues-to-cityscape/article30891981.ece

301,2020/02/23,Indians more keen on online courses,"‘Average age of an Indian learner is 28 years while it is 35 years for US learners’

Indian youngsters seem to be more interested in online courses than Americans and also figure much under the global average age hooked to online learning.

Figures available with Coursera, a popular online learning platform founded in 2012 by Stanford professors Andrew Ng and Daphne Koller, shows that the average age of an Indian learner is 28 years while it is 35 years for US learners, and the global average is 32 years.

Coursera offers massive open online courses, specialisations, and degrees. It started with content offered by universities such as Princeton, Stanford, University of Michigan and the University of Pennsylvania, but now, it has partnerships with about 200 institutions in 29 countries, including India.

Managing Director, India and Asia Pacific region (APAC), Coursera, Raghav Gupta said that 93% of learners are in the 18-39 age bracket.

Though male learners from India dominate with 70%, female learners have picked up by 6% compared to last year.

Computer Science with 25% is the most popular domain followed by Data Science (20%) and Business (19%). Indians seem to be more interested in foreign universities, and the Machine Learning course of the Stanford University is the most popular among them followed by Programming for Everybody of University of Michigan, Data Science by IBM, Neural Networks and Deep Learning, AI for Everyone and English for Career Development from University of Pennsylvania.

“Coursera has launched ‘Coursera For Campus’ last year through which universities can now gain access to more than 3,900 high-quality courses that they can use to integrate into their curricula, offer credit-eligible and supplemental learning to their current students, and deliver life-long learning to their alumni, faculty, and staff,” Mr. Raghav said.

“Universities will also be able to use Coursera’s world-class tools to author content and assessments, Coursera Labs for hands-on projects, and Coursera’s learning analytics to improve and track learner outcomes,” he added.

Indian School of Business (ISB) Hyderabad and IIM Calcutta have created content for Coursera. However, all the courses are not free. Some are free but evaluation and certificates come with payment. “Most courses are free and students can take advantage of it,” Mr. Raghav said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/indians-more-keen-on-online-courses/article30891953.ece
302,2020/02/23,City selected for pilot project on beggar rehabilitation,"Central government to provide ₹10 crore for the project

Hyderabad is one among 10 cities chosen by the Central government for a pilot project for rehabilitation of beggars.

Secretary, Social Justice and Empowerment, R. Subramanyam, announced this at a stakeholders’ workshop towards a national campaign for comprehensive rehabilitation of beggars held in the city on Saturday.

In his address, Mr. Subramanyam observed that Hyderabad had earned the project through implementation of schemes such as double-bedroom housing and Annapurna.

“Successful implementation of these schemes has resulted in the Union government choosing the city for the pilot,” he said.

“The Centre will provide ₹10 crore for the project,” he said, and asked officials and stakeholders to prepare a city action plan that may be implemented from April this year.

He suggested deliberations among stakeholders over components such as moving the beggars away from crime and pity, providing shelter, access to medical services, and sustainable livelihoods to the homeless.

Joint secretary Radhika Chakravarthy spoke of the strategy formulated at the national level and underlined the need for convergence of all line departments. She suggested specialised activities for the disabled, senior citizens, and women and children involved in begging.

The city action plan should include survey and identification of beggars, mobilisation, establishment of shelter homes, and comprehensive resettlement. Health care, education to children, and skill development training to take up income generating activities should be incorporated into the resettlement scheme, she said.

Deputy Mayor Fasiuddin, while expressing concern over the problem of beggars in cities, informed that a total of 150 Annapurna centres across the city are providing meals at ₹5 every day.

Delivering the inaugural address, principal secretary, Municipal Administration and Urban Development, Arvind Kumar, remarked that treating beggary as an eyesore does not provide a solution. Assuring support from the State government for the programme, he urged the stakeholders to suggest viable economic options to uplift beggars.

Recalling the previous survey done in 2005-06 profiling beggars, and the subsequent initiatives post the formation of Telangana State towards making the city beggar-free, he said that the city has 17 shelter homes equipped with sufficient infrastructure to serve as short stay homes.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/cdokms/article30891943.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY23BEGGAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/city-selected-for-pilot-project-on-beggar-rehabilitation/article30891935.ece
303,2020/02/23,Dog census in city on the anvil,"Work, to be taken up as per standard procedure by the Animal Welfare Board of India, will be outsourced to an NGO

GHMC veterinary wing is taking up a dog census in the city soon, in order to estimate the canine numbers in various localities and their vaccination and birth control status.

The work will be outsourced to an NGO, officials informed, and assured that the census will be taken up as per the standard procedure prescribed by the Animal Welfare Board of India.

As per the data from previous such exercises, it is estimated that the city has over 7.5 lakh dogs in its various localities.

The corporation is intensifying anti-rabies measures across the city, in view of the oncoming summer season, when dog bite cases are likely to go up.

Officials have informed that the Anti-Rabies Vaccination (ARV) and Animal Birth Control (ABC) programmes are being intensified across the city, with emphasis on vulnerable areas such as slums, and areas where the canine numbers are significantly high.

Providing an insight into why dog bites are more common in summer, GHMC’s Chief Veterinary Officer Abdul Wakeel said deprivation from food and water, besides skin infections make dogs more aggressive. “Street dogs thrive on discarded food items in garbage, and in summer, food becomes dry and inedible within minutes when exposed to Sun. Apart from water scarcity, non-availability of food too makes dogs edgy, increasing the number of bites,” Dr. Wakeel said. Skin infections, rampant among stray dogs, also start to trouble them more during the hot weather. “All dog bites, however, may not lead to rabies,” he said, and added that medicines are well stocked in Fever Hospital and other government clinics for timely treatment.

Confirming that the dog from B.S. Maktha, which went on a biting spree recently was found to be rabies positive, he informed that the corporation has swiftly immunised all the dogs in the vicinity and surrounding areas.

“We administered ARV to 182 dogs from the locality and its surroundings. Teams have been despatched to trace all the victims, and ensure they are administered vaccination and also the Human Rabies Immunoglobulin injections,” he said.

During this year, GHMC has so far performed birth control surgeries on a total of 46,473 dogs, and administered vaccination to 78,822 of them, he said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/dog-census-in-city-on-the-anvil/article30891914.ece

305,2020/02/23,New GHMC Act listed for budget session,"Aimed at providing better civic amenities, transparency in administration

Minister for Municipal Administration and Urban Development K.T. Rama Rao has announced that a new GHMC Act will be introduced in the coming budget session of the Legislative Assembly after incorporation of all rules and regulations from the Telangana Municipal Act.

The objective is to provide better civic amenities and transparency in administration, he said while addressing a review meeting here on Saturday.

The Minister has asked Principal Secretary Arvind Kumar, GHMC Commissioner D.S.Lokesh Kumar and other senior officials to brainstorm and submit a report with items to be included in the new GHMC Act, including the Telangana State Building Permissions and Self Certification System (TS-bPASS).

Several positive changes could be brought about with this Act, apart from improving delivery system, accountability and quality of work, Mr.Rama Rao said.

Reviewing the ongoing works in the city, he asked officials to ensure completion pertaining to link roads and slip roads by April 15.

On land acquisition, he instructed the officials to issue all notices of a particular project in a single day so that it is easy to take action on time. He directed zonal commissioners to be well acquainted with the ongoing works in their jurisdiction and coordinate for early completion.

He also asked the zonal commissioners and engineering officials to prepare a plan of action on grounding and completion of works pertaining to SRDP and CRMP, synchronising all other departments for shifting of utilities. He then issued directions for construction of four burial grounds in each zone and for providing more Basti Dawakhanas.

Mr.Rama Rao reviewed works such as footpath development, public toilets, bus shelters, road development, modernisation of graveyards, sanitation, desilting of nalas, lake protection and development, junction improvement, vending zones, water harvesting, construction waste, among others.

307,2020/02/23,DTPC launches AC bus to link tourist locales,"Sabarimala darshan trip on the first day of each Malayalam month

The Ernakulam District Tourism Promotion Council has launched an air-conditioned bus, to conduct one/two-day tours within the district and to tourist locales in neighbouring districts.

The 24-seater bus would mostly operate city tours during week days, while focusing on trips to tourist destinations like Munnar during weekends. The Kerala Tourism Development Corporation handed over the bus to DTPC as directed by Tourism Director Bala Kiran, said DTPC Secretary S. Vijayakumar.

The bus was formally launched on Saturday by Hibi Eden, MP. It has push-back seats, refrigerator, coffee maker, audio and video systems, wireless microphone and fire extinguisher, apart from a luxurious interior.

Besides places in the city, guided tours will be organised to heritage locales like Fort Kochi and Mattancherry. The 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. tour has been priced ₹1,199 per person. This includes the expenses for food, entry fee to historic buildings and a boat tour of the backwaters. Special discounts are on offer for group bookings, while children aged 5 to 11 years will get 25% discount. Convenient pick up and drop too will be arranged, Mr. Vijayakumar said.

The tour includes visit to Jewish synagogue, Dutch Palace, Santa Cruz Basilica, St. Francis church where Vasco Da Gama was buried, Chinese Fishing nets, Fort Kochi beach, Cochin Port Maritime Heritage Museum, Museum of Kerala History and boating off Marine Drive. The tour generally culminates in front of LuLu Mall.

Apart from Munnar (one or two days), tours to Thekkady (2 days, including Periyar national park and grape farm), Athirapally (including the waterfalls, Kodanad, Ezhattumukham and Malakkapara) and houseboat cruise in Alappuzha (and visit to Marari Beach) too are arranged. Bus tours are arranged, if there are a minimum of 18 guests. Else, the DTPC would arrange cars or other AC vehicles.

Group tours are arranged to other destinations too. A Sabarimala darshan programme is arranged on the first day of each Malayalam month.

Guests can contact the DTPC office or Keralam Tours, a Government-recognised agency, for tours. A special booking counter has begun functioning at Durbar Hall Ground.

308,2020/02/23,Councillors demand probe into recurring fires at Brahmapuram,"Mayor announces special meeting to discuss proposals on the dumping yard

Councillors at the Kochi Corporation on Saturday raised a hue and cry over the recent fire at the Brahmapuram dumping yard and demanded a special council meeting to take important decisions, that the council had delayed for months, regarding the site.

With six instances of fires breaking out at the site in 2019 and one recently this year, both ruling and Opposition councillors called for an inquiry into the incidents.

Mayor Soumini Jain announced that a special council meeting would be held by the end of the month to discuss all Brahmapuram-related proposals.

Biomining

However, the council has not arrived at an agreement over biomining of legacy waste at the site or the setting up of a biomedical waste treatment facility. Councillors opposed the District Collector’s order in January to hand over three acres to Indian Medical Association Goes Eco-Friendly (IMAGE) to set up a biomedical waste treatment plant at Brahmapuram.

“The land belongs to the corporation, but there was no discussion with the council or the people in the area before it was handed over. The people in the area will have to be taken into confidence before any such plant can come up,” Leader of the Opposition K.J. Antony said.

“The corporation’s veterinary hospital lies on part of the land demarcated for the plant. We cannot permit the hospital to be demolished,” said Gracy Joseph, development standing committee chairperson.

Deputy Mayor K.R. Premakumar said the decision to hand over the land was a high-handed one taken by the State government and executed by the district administration. He called for a discussion on the matter.

The council had earlier set aside a proposal to allot legacy waste biomining to the only company that had responded to the tender. “The company had quoted ₹597 per metre cube of waste. Dealing with the over 2 lakh metre cube of waste at the site will require over ₹15 crore. But the proposal has not been submitted to the health or finance standing committees for approval,” councillor C.K. Peter said at the council meeting.

“A liability of ₹15 crore cannot be taken up without the approval of the standing committees,” said Congress councillor A.B. Sabu. Water is regularly being sprinkled over waste to minimise the effect of heat.

CCTV cameras have been installed as per government orders last year, and work on a leachate tank is ongoing, he added.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/rs1jhb/article30892369.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23-KI-BRAHMAPURAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/councillors-demand-probe-into-recurring-fires-at-brahmapuram/article30892370.ece
309,2020/02/23,250 more vehicles to join e-rickshaw fleet in March,"Society of auto drivers signs pact with two manufacturers

The success saga of 15 e-rickshaws that were launched here a year ago has resulted in the Cooperative Society of Auto Drivers’ Unions entering into agreements with two manufacturers to introduce another 250 such vehicles in the city in a month.

The first agreement to launch 50 e-rickshaws was inked on Friday with Kinetic Green, which introduced the 15 e-rickshaws as a pilot project. Yet another agreement was inked with Mahindra and Mahindra to roll out 200 of them.

They will initially operate in a 5-km radius from half-a-dozen metro stations in the Thykoodam-Aluva corridor. They will operate as feeder services to the metro, ensuring first- and last-mile connectivity to commuters.

The three-wheelers from the stable of Kinetic Green will operate on the basis of swapping a pair of drained-out batteries with recharged ones, every 50 km. Their Mahindra counterparts will have provision to recharge batteries every few kilometres, said sources in the cooperative society, which has around 5,000 drivers as members.

Kinetic Green has tied up with five fuel stations in the metro corridor, where fully-charged batteries will be available for being swapped. “The process will take just two minutes. Recharging of batteries will take up to three hours, by which time the driver will lose considerable number of trips. Moreover, fast charging is not advisable since it will affect battery life. The battery swapping method will ensure that they last approximately five years,” sources in the company said.

Earlier this month, the company had entered into a tie-up with BPCL to enable swapping of batteries that power electric three-wheelers. It will ensure hassle-free ownership for drivers since the expenses on batteries are over 30% of the cost of an e-rickshaw. By adopting the swap system, drivers need not bother about warranty or upkeep of batteries. E-rickshaws will be handed over to the cooperative society, for which ₹350 will have to be paid as daily rent to Kinetic Green. The energy cost per kilometre will be less than 50 paise, as compared to over ₹3 for diesel-run autorickshaws, they added.

The Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IIT-M) is the technology partner for the venture.

Unlike e-autorickshaws, e-rickshaws will be one-metre wide and can seat four to five people. They are designed to move through even narrow bylanes. The upper speed limit is 25 kmph. The minimum fare per passenger is ₹10 for the first 2 km.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/y9bi2s/article30892277.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23-KI-E-AUTO-2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/250-more-vehicles-to-join-e-rickshaw-fleet-in-march/article30892278.ece
310,2020/02/23,Stop memo issued to boat that collided with ro-ro ferry,"‘Tourist vessel violated safety norms before and after the incident’

The Kerala Maritime Board (KMB) has issued a stop memo to the double-decked tourist boat that collided with a roll-on roll-off (ro-ro) ferry operating in the Fort Kochi-Vypeen corridor on Friday afternoon.

The stop memo was issued to the vessel named Bay King on finding that it had operated in violation of safety norms, both before and after the collision. Moreover, its srank (driver) did not possess a licence issued under the Kerala Inland Vessel (KIV) Rules.

The action follows an inspection of the boat by a team of Port Department officials including Kerala Maritime Board Chairman V.J. Mathew and Chief Surveyor Ranjith. A formal hearing on the issue will be held on Tuesday.

Endangering lives

A senior Port Department official said the driver had continued to steer the boat, rather than berth at the nearest location, even after the collision near the Fort Kochi Jetty. “The vessel, which had two dozen tourists on board, suffered damage on its right side. The continuation of the trip was very risky since the damage could have worsened, or the side panels worn off, leading to water entering the vessel, endangering the lives of people on board. The vessel could also have been swept towards the sea in the event of any other damage,” the official added.

The department will continue to probe the case. The driver had experience only in steering fishing boats. Moreover, the crew members failed to provide life jackets to the tourists even after the collision.

Communication issues

The registration of the vessel too can be cancelled, depending on the outcome of the probe.

On his part, there was inadequate communication between the driver of the ro-ro vessel (whose cabin is in an elevated position) and the crew members on the deck, he said.

At fault

Quoting KIV Rules, officials of the Kerala Shipping and Inland Navigation Corporation (KSINC) said the tourist boat was duty-bound to keep out of the way of the ro-ro ferry and should have avoided crossing its path. “Despite this, the Fort Kochi Police are dilly-dallying on registering a case based on our complaint.

“They are also not giving us a copy of the FIR filed on a complaint from the boat operator. All this despite the fact that the CCTV footage clearly shows the boat entered our path. It also did not have the mandatory safety equipment on board,” they added.

SPV to be formed

Meanwhile, Mayor Soumini Jain said at the Kochi Corporation council meeting on Saturday that a temporary agreement would have to be arrived at with the KSINC till a special purpose vehicle (SPV) was formed to operate boats.

The civic body is in the process of readying the SPV in accordance with a Government Order issued in January, she said.

Clauses

Since the KSINC and the corporation had not arrived at an official agreement till date, citing differences over clauses, the corporation council will reconsider the clauses so that the KSINC can continue operations till the SPV is formed, Ms. Jain added.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/stop-memo-issued-to-boat-that-collided-with-ro-ro-ferry/article30892212.ece

312,2020/02/23,Mamata should submit accounts of funds spent instead of writing to PM: Dilip Ghosh,"Stating that the Centre gives the State adequate funds, the BJP West Bengal unit president said funds get returned to the Centre owing to a lack of utilisation by the TMC government

Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) West Bengal unit president Dilip Ghosh on Sunday said Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had sent a letter demanding the release of the State’s share of funds instead of attending meetings in Delhi for the purpose, in order to avoid submitting an account of the funds already provided by the Centre.

Stating that the Centre gives the State adequate funds, Mr. Ghosh said funds get returned to the Centre owing to a lack of utilisation by the Trinamool Congress (TMC) government.

Also Read Uncertainty over Amit Shah’s Kolkata public meeting

“The Centre is ready to give the money, but funds given by it are not utilised and goes back. Let them spend the funds given and submit an account of its utilisation,” Mr. Ghosh, also a Lok Sabha MP, said.

He was replying to queries from presspersons on Ms. Banerjee’s letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking the release of funds for the State.

Expressing concern over the “steady reduction” of Central funds to the State and the “inordinate delay” in their release, the Chief Minister had said in the letter sent on Thursday that the State is yet to receive its share of Central funds totalling ₹50,000 crore till January 2020.

Reacting to Mr. Ghosh’s comments, State Minister Firhad Hakim said Ms. Banerjee had met the Prime Minister in Kolkata and also in New Delhi over the demands.

“The Chief Minister will certainly reiterate the demands when she meets the Prime Minister again,” Mr. Hakim said.

On Mr. Ghosh’s claim that Ms. Banerjee sent the letter to the Prime Minister to avoid submitting an account of the funds used, Mr. Hakim said a government does its work in writing so that it is documented.

Civic body polls

When asked whether the ruling Trinamool Congress was in a hurry to hold municipal elections in around 100 civic bodies across the State, the BJP State president said, “What they are attempting to do is to deprive the opposition candidates an opportunity to campaign or get a level playing field in fighting the polls”.

He said the BJP wants the elections to be held as per the rules and asserted that the saffron party would fight the polls with all its might, whenever it is held.

Also Read Congress to have seat-sharing formula with Left for Bengal civic polls

Mr. Hakim said despite being the State’s Municipal Affairs Minister, he himself does not know when the civic body polls would be held.

“How then does Dilip Ghosh know when the polls are to be held? Does he have a spy in the Commission?” he asked.

“The date will be finalised only after the State Election Commission sends its recommendation on it to the government,” Mr. Hakim, who is also the Mayor of Kolkata, said.

Speaking to presspersons at Malda, Mr. Mitra said his party would not form an alliance but enter into a seat-sharing arrangement with the Left. Candidates would be nominated on the “basis of who is strong where” formula.

While in the 2016 Assembly polls the Left and the Congress entered into a seat-sharing pact, in the Lok Sabha elections, they fought separately, resulting in the dismal performance of both.

314,2020/02/23,"Police clean chit to BJP MLA, nephew arrested in rape case","Involvement of only two persons was found, say police

The nephew of a BJP MLA in Uttar Pradesh was arrested on charges of raping a woman on the pretext of marrying her, but charges against the legislator, who had also been named in the FIR, were dropped, the police said on Saturday.

Ravindra Nath Tripathi, BJP MLA from Bhadohi in east U.P., and six others, including his sons and other male relatives, were booked on charges of rape on February 19.

The names were included in the FIR on the basis of the victim’s complaint, in which she alleged that the MLA’s nephew Sandeep Tiwari exploited her sexually on the false pretext of marriage and threatened to kill her if she tried to pressurise him to marry her. She also alleged that the MLA and other male members of his family had raped her repeatedly in a hotel for a month during the 2017 Assembly elections.

Criminal intimidation

Bhadohi Superintendent of Police Ram Badan Singh said after a probe, the involvement of only two persons in the case was found — Sandeep who is accused of raping the woman and threatening her, and another relative Nitesh, who is charged with criminal intimidation.

Sandeep was arrested from a hotel on Friday, the police said.

However, the names of the MLA and his sons were removed from the case as on the basis of the “evidence” provided by the victim, it didn’t appear “from any angle” that they were involved, Mr. Singh said. “Based on the investigation so far, it is clear that the charges against the MLA and his sons could not be established,” he said.

Asked by the reporters why the woman named the MLA in the FIR, the SP said she could have done it to pressure Sandeep into marrying her. The victim has refused to undergo a medical examination, he said.

316,2020/02/23,Three women killed in building fire,"‘A paying guest facility was being run in the house; probe under way’

Three women were killed while two others sustained injures in a fire that broke out in a residential building in Chandigarh, the police said on Saturday.

The police said a preliminary enquiry has revealed that the fire broke out due to short circuit in the house in sector 32 D, where a paying guest accommodation was being run.

“The deceased have been identified as Riya, of Kapurthala in Punjab; Pakshi, from Kotkapura in Punjab and Muskan of Hisar in Haryana. The incident occurred at 3.45 p.m., ” said a police statement.

The women, aged between 19 and 22 years, were staying as paying guests on the first floor of the building.

“A case has been registered under Sections 304, 188, 34 and 336 of the IPC and the investigation was under way. We will seek a report from the civil administration about whether the PG was complying with rules and procedures,” said Chandigarh Superintendent of Police Vineet Kumar.

Station Fire Officer Lal Bahadur said four fire tenders were pressed into service and it took 10-15 minutes to put out the fire. He added that one of the women saved herself by jumping from the first floor.

“There was very low visibility because of smoke and fire,” Mr. Bahadur said. “Two women were found unconscious in a room and another with burn injuries was found in another room.”

Two injured

With the blaze engulfing the first floor of the house, it was a difficult task for the fire fighters to take the women out of the room.

Two women were admitted to a hospital and they are out of danger, Mr. Kumar said.

According to neighbours, around 25-30 women were staying at the PG. At the time of the incident, most of them were out of the PG, the police said.

317,2020/02/23,Dalit groups demand stringent action in Nagaur torture case,"They seek urgent steps for rehabilitation of the victims who are in trauma

After a political storm over the torture of two Dalit youths in Rajasthan’s Nagaur district, Dalit groups here on Saturday demanded stringent action against the accused and urgent steps for rehabilitation of the victims who were in a trauma following the horrific act of caste-based violence by some members of the Rajput community.

The youths were also forced to pay a “fine” of ₹5,100 to the tormentors after the incident.

Bisa Ram, 24, and Panna Ram, 20, were beaten up, stripped and tortured on the suspicion of stealing money from the cash box of an automobile service agency in Naguar district’s Karnu village on February 16. The incident came to light when the videos of the assault went viral on social media earlier this week.

A fact-finding team of the Centre for Dalit Rights, Dalit Mahila Manch and Meghwal Mahasabha visited Karnu and met the victims on Friday. “The youths, who are cousins, were in a state of shock. The boy, who was violated with a screwdriver dipped in petrol, was unable to move because of excruciating pain... Their families are living in fear,” CDR Director Satish Kumar said.

Dalit activists said that the Karnu episode matched Gujarat’s infamous Una flogging incident of July 2016 in its intensity, and the dominant Rajputs were still threatening Dalits in the village.

Section 308 added

After the activists’ demand, the police have added Section 308 (attempt to commit culpable homicide) of the Indian Penal Code in the criminal case registered against the seven accused who have since been arrested.

The team demanded that charges under the Protection of Civil Rights Act and the Information Technology Act be added to the FIR. The victims’ families have been provided with police security under Section 15-A of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act mandating protection against intimidation, threats or violence.

The ruling Congress and the Opposition BJP leaders also met the two youths and their families in Karnu, while a delegation of the Bahujan Samaj Party met Director-General of Police Bhupendra Singh here and demanded compensation and security to the victims. Union Minister of State Arjun Ram Meghwal alleged that the State government had indulged in a cover-up and said the victims were still waiting for financial assistance.

The Congress team, comprising Social Welfare Minister Bhanwar Lal Meghwal, former Nagaur MP Jyoti Mirdha and others, also sought strict action against the accused and hoped that no police officer found involved in the brutality or its cover-up would be spared. The team will submit its report to Pradesh Congress Committee president Sachin Pilot.

318,2020/02/23,AMU students’ panel on hunger strike,"Announcing new phase, they seek action against police for ‘brutality’ on campus

Members of the AMU students’ coordination committee has begun a three-day hunger strike, seeking action against police personnel for alleged brutality during an anti-CAA stir on the campus last December and withdrawal of cases against protesters.

Announcing that their 10-week-long peaceful agitation has entered a new phase, 12 students started the 72-hour hunger strike on Friday night.

Sent notices

The panel said if their demands were not met, a group of students would launch an indefinite hunger strike at the Bab-e-Syed gate of Aligarh Muslim University. They have sent a notice to the University and district authorities.

The panel has also sent copies of their notice to the President, the Prime Minister and the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh.

Committee spokesman Faizul Hasan told media persons that their main demand was that an FIR be registered against the members of the police force who “indulged in violence and vandalism” at the University on December 15.

“We also want withdrawal of all false cases against those students who were exercising their democratic right of peaceful protest and were being pressured by the authorities to end their agitation,” he said.

Mr. Hasan said the Chief Minister held a very important constitutional post and if he had any concrete evidence to support his charge of unprovoked violence against the AMU students, he should place that before the court instead of vilifying the institution.

“On our part, we are placing all the evidence before the court and will also do so if the government orders a judicial probe,” he said.

The students’ coordination panel is also demanding resignations of top University officials, including the Vice-Chancellor and the Registrar, on grounds of moral responsibility with regard to the incident.

They are also demanding that the CCTV footage of all the incidents pertaining to the “police brutalities” be fully secured and protected.

Meanwhile, at the Eidgah grounds in the old city, women protesters, who have been on a strike against the Citizenship Amendment Act for the past three weeks, staged a dharna at the Kotwali police station. They alleged that the police prevented them from putting up a tent at the protest site on Thursday night during a hailstorm.

321,2020/02/23,Role of Ayurveda in epidemics control stressed,"Minister for Excise T.P. Ramakrishnan reasserted on Sunday that Ayurveda should play a vital in the prevention and control of epidemics, lifestyle diseases and nature pollution.

Inaugurating the 41st national meet of the Ayurvedic Medical Association of India (AMAI) at Venniyoor, near Kottakkal, Mr. Ramakrishnan suggested that the Departments of AYUSH and Agriculture work together to expand herbs cultivation.

He said the AMAI could help identify and salvage many herbs facing extinction, by teaming up with the civic bodies and Kudumbashree units.

He said the government would intervene to check quacks and to address other concerns raised by the AMAI.

AMAI State president Raju Thomas presided over the inaugural function. E.T. Mohammed Basheer, MP; P.K. Abdu Rabb, MLA; Syed Abid Husain Thangal, MLA; Tirurangadi Municipal Chairperson K.T. Raheeda, Ayurveda Medical Education Director Jolly Kutty, State Ayurveda Drug Controller Smart P. John, Kottakkal Arya Vaidya Sala Chief Physician P. Madhavankutty Varier, AMAI general secretary Sadat Dinakaran, and organising committee chairman V.G. Udayakumar spoke.

The meet focused on creating employment opportunities in public and private sectors, setting up exclusive clinics for women, pharmacy training programmes, and medicine manufacturing training.

Dr. Raju Thomas said that stringent laws should be enacted to check quackery in Ayurveda.

A session on ‘Ayurveda: safe, simple and scientific’ followed. Dr. Udayakumar said that unhealthy competition in the medical sector had given rise to a propaganda that Ayurveda has harmful effects in spite of it being the safest medicine and the treatment system promoting best lifestyle and eating habits.

He said the AMAI had worked in tandem with the government bodies to help the victims of the floods in the last two years. Ayurveda doctors provided services, including counselling programmes, in Nilambur and neighbouring areas during the floods.

322,2020/02/23,Restoration of check dams yet to begin,"Water level in several sources has come down, signalling tougher days ahead

The restoration of damaged check dams, which is one of the effective measures to fight water scarcity during the summer season, is yet to begin in various local bodies owing to the shortage of funds and the delay in the timely submission of proposals by local administrators for approval.

Water level in several potable water sources, including wells and ponds located closer to such damaged check dams in villages, has already come down signalling tougher days ahead. Farmers who ventured into small-scale vegetable farming projects are the worst hit in villages like Kuttiyadi where the Irrigation Department is yet to take stock of the damaged check dams. After the two previous episodes of floods and landslips, the condition of the majority of check dams is piteous.

The height of the majority of check dams will have to be increased further to improve storage capacity. De-silting too is required in many areas. Though there have been proposals to make use of the labour force under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, only very few local panchayats have finalised such projects.

The latest directive of the government to include all future MGNREGS projects under GIS tagging too is likely to impede the execution of restoration work. Many of the 70 grama panchayats are yet to prepare a list of worksites to be geotagged. The delay is also likely to affect other drought mitigation projects to be executed with the support of MGNREGS workers.

“In Kuttiyadi panchayat alone, there are over 10 small check dams that require maintenance. The wooden panels used to regulate water flow are all in a worn-out condition,” says V. Sajan, a farm organisation leader. He warns that water scarcity will trouble more rural families with poor planning in the area.

Apart from the restoration of old check dams, the demand to construct new ones remain unaddressed in many areas where drought affected potable water sources. Since unscientific constructions without proper study about the terrain and soil quality are likely to affect the proper percolation of water, there is now a restriction on constructing temporary check dams by the local residents, which has again doubled the responsibility of the Irrigation Department to act without delay.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/iv3odi/article30892419.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22KI-CHECKDAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/restoration-of-check-dams-yet-to-begin/article30892420.ece
323,2020/02/23,New water connection norms leave many residents in lurch,"House ownership certificate mandatory for JICA scheme

With ownership certificates of houses being made mandatory for water connection under the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA)-aided drinking water scheme, thousands of people in the city have been left in the lurch with respect to availability of drinking water.

“There are people who are unable to produce an ownership certificate due to several reasons. They are being denied drinking water for no reason,” said CPI(M) councillor Mullaveettil Moideen at a recent meeting of the Kozhikode Corporation Council.

Mr. Moideen said several houses did not even have a number as they were quite old. There were also people who lived in houses that they did not own. It was difficult for such people to procure ownership certificates, issued by local bodies, for the houses, he added.

However, Congress councillor K.C. Shobhita said people in her ward were able to procure water connection on the basis of their residence certificates and ration cards.

325,2020/02/23,Peruvannamoozhi dam site to get ₹3-crore makeover soon,"KIIDC to execute project proposed by District Tourism Promotion Council

A Malampuzha-model tourism development project estimated to cost ₹3 crore is on the anvil for the Peruvannamoozhi dam site. The Kerala Irrigation Infrastructure Development Corporation (KIIDC) will execute the project proposed by the District Tourism Promotion Council (DTPC).

According to DTPC officials, the project has won administrative sanction and is expected to be completed in 18 months.

On completion, there will be a new tourism information centre, spacious parking facility for visitors, space for refreshments and beautified surroundings.

The beautification proposal includes about 10 separate works, which could transform the present look of the destination. A children’s park is one of the highlights of the new project. The proposed information centre will provide details of nearby tourism attractions to visitors.

At present, there is no convenient parking space at the spot. The lack of a proper parking facility has remained a harrowing experience for most tourists. According to Tourism Department officials, entry and exit to the dam site will be easy with the completion of the new parking space.

The DTPC has come up with the new project, considering the increasing number of visitors to the eco-tourism spot and its proximity to other popular tourism destinations in the rural areas of the district. The cooperation of the Irrigation Department has been ensured for the proper development of the space.

Conservation work

Apart from the DTPC scheme, a number of other conservation activities which can support tourism growth in the area, is taking place under the supervision of the Irrigation and Soil Conservation Departments. One of the major works is the strengthening of the Peruvannamoozhi dam.

The State government has already spent ₹10 crore for the emergency dam restoration works.

326,2020/02/23,AIADMK govt. has let down people in all spheres: Stalin,"Former Minister Raja Kannappan rejoins DMK

MADURAI

Accusing the AIADMK government of letting down the people of Tamil Nadu in all spheres, DMK president M.K. Stalin on Sunday called the notification of a part of Cauvery delta region as protected agricultural zone a drama.

Addressing a well-attended public meeting here, in which former AIADMK Minister Raja Kannappan rejoined the DMK with a number of his followers, Mr. Stalin said the AIADMK government had failed on all fronts. There was utter chaos in the State. The budget presented by Finance Minister O. Panneerselvam in the Assembly itself was a reflection of how the Tamil Nadu’s economy was in a state of coma, he said.

The notification of certain delta districts as protected agriculture zone was nothing but a ploy to buy peace with the people in the belt, Mr. Stalin alleged.

“I have a strong suspicion that this is nothing but an attempt to give an impression that the AIADMK was with the people and for the people,” he said.

Mr. Stalin claimed that some media houses were praising the State government on this issue with an ulterior motive, which was unethical. Statements made by the Ministers gave an impression that the DMK was against the announcement.

Taking a dig at the State’s finances, Mr. Stalin said the government borrowings were on the rise. “It simply indulged in raising its liabilities. There was corruption all around and the economy had shrunk due to rise in joblessness,” he said, adding it was mentioned by the Finance Minister in the budget tabled in the Assembly last week.

The Palaniswami government had declared February 24 (the birth anniversary of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa) State Girl Child Protection Day. This, Mr. Stalin said, was yet another drama. When the government did not even condemn the death of software professional Subasri in Pallikaranai in Chennai after a hoarding put up by an AIADMK functionary fell on her or announce any compensation to the family, such announcement was misleading.

On the CAA, NPR and the NRC too, the government played double game. When the party endorsed the Bill in Parliament, the AIADMK government told the people of Tamil Nadu that they had raised a few queries on the NPR with the Centre. Mr. Stalin demanded a white paper on the issue.

Senior DMK leaders K.N. Nehru, I. Periasamy, MPs and MLAs attended the meeting. Party district secretary and MLA P. Moorthy presided.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/aiadmk-govt-has-let-down-people-in-all-spheres-stalin-madurai/article30897332.ece

A Sub-Inspector of Police, R. Sivasubramanian (34) of Masarapatti police station, was killed when his bike hit a container lorry parked on the carriageway of a road here on Saturday night.

Sivasubramanian had got a tip-off on a possible law and order problem at Achankulam around 10.30 p.m. and rushed to the spot on his motorcycle. “Since the lorry had been parked in a dark place on Madurai national highways without any proper warning lamps, the SI did not notice it and his bike hit it. Sivasubramanian died on the spot,” Thoothukudi Superintendent of Police Arun Balagopalan said in a condolence note.

The SP said that Sivasubramanian was very bold and efficient, and he worked effectively in curtailing anti-social elements when he was working in Thattarmadam and Tiruchendur Taluk police stations in the district.

The tip-off the SI had got was on an accused, who was on trial for two criminal cases – a murder case and an attempt to murder case, in which he was later acquitted. The accused and members of his rival gangs figured in the history-sheets maintained by the police, the SP said.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/si-killed-as-bike-hits-stationary-container-lorry-thoothukudi/article30896876.ece
328,2020/02/23,Make your life meaningful by helping others: former SC Judge,"‘Treating a woman as an equal will be the greatest service to womankind’

“If you help others, you will grow without your knowledge ... Life provides us with many opportunities to work for the development of others and make this journey meaningful,” said Shivaraj V. Patil, former Judge of the Supreme Court of India.

Speaking during his 80th birthday celebrations, organised by Justice Shivaraj V. Patil Foundation here on Sunday, Mr. Patil said that treating a woman as an equal would be the greatest service to womankind. Urging girls to be self-confident, he said, “You qualify and become competent. Show the world that you can excel in all walks of life.”

Mr. Patil also stressed the importance of being humble and compassionate towards others.

During the occasion, Justice S.S. Sundar of the Madras High Court released a book titled ‘Speaking for Humanity’, a compilation of select speeches of Justice Shivaraj V. Patil, and the first copy was received by N. Venkatesh Prajna, Director (Medical Education), Aravind Eye Care System.

“From the judgements of Mr. Patil, I can sense his qualities not only as a judge, but also as a human being working for the upliftment of humanity,” said Justice Sundar. He also said that he would like to follow the values stressed by Mr. Patil while serving the people as part of the judiciary.

Ponneelan, Sahitya Akademi award winning writer, praised Mr. Patil for his remarkable judgement ordering compensation for the villagers who were assaulted and tortured by police during the search for sandalwood smuggler Veerappan.

The most striking feature of Mr. Patil was his humility, said Dr. Prajna. “He has invested his life for the upliftment of the people,” he said.

Speaking on the occasion, Vaidehi Vijayakumar, Vice-Chancellor, Mother Teresa Women’s University, Kodaikanal, asked young women to be alert to cyber crimes and seek the help of police in case of an emergency.

Expedite construction

The construction of an omnibus stand appears to be proceeding at a snail’s pace. Though construction has been completed in some parts, there is a need for speedy work to take place. Tirunelveli Corporation authorities need to take steps to expedite the remaining work so that passengers can avail the facility at the earliest. Even now, concrete basement for parking buses is yet to be laid.

Noise pollution

Hospital and school zones are usually earmarked as ‘no horn areas’ with signboards erected nearby. Nowadays, many people with vehicles do not seem to care about the sign boards. In recent times, noise pollution in Tirunelveli is a great menace. Noise pollution causes hypertension, high stress levels, hearing loss and sleep disturbances. As trees play a vital role in reducing noise levels, more trees need to be planted along Tirunelveli and Palayamkottai. Noise regulation policies should be strictly enforced. Air horns should be seized from city buses. The laws should limit the amount of noise in public and private places. More awareness programmes should be conducted about prevention of noise pollution and the remedial measures.

I appeal to the Union Railways Minister and the General Manager of Southern Railway to find ways to introduce the much-awaited Rameswaram-Mangalore service.

Prevent drowning deaths

On February 17, a 15-year-old boy drowned at an irrigation channel-cum-check dam storage facility at Athimarapatti. It is reliably learnt that this is the second death at the same spot. The irrigation channel flows along a length of 40 feet and a depth of 15 feet. Usually, children from the village and in nearby areas take bath at the irrigation channel. However, it is essential to take precautionary measures and place caution boards here to prevent future deaths. The inlet and outlet of the irrigation channel should also be properly barricaded so that accidental falls can be prevented. I appeal to the district authorities to urgently look into the issue.

337,2020/02/23,Construction of fisheries harbour gets govt. nod,"It will be built at a cost of ₹180.2 crore

Kuilady Suresh Nayak, president of the district unit of Bharatiya Janata Party, said on Saturday that the State Cabinet has approved the construction of an all-weather fisheries harbour at Hejmady in Udupi district.

Addressing presspersons here, Mr. Nayak said the fishing harbour will be constructed at an estimated cost of ₹180.2 crore. Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa was expected to lay the foundation stone for the project on February 29. Construction of the fishing harbour was a long-pending demand of the people here, especially fishermen. It will give a fillip to the fisheries sector in the district, he said.

Mr. Nayak said the installation of the new office-bearers of the BJP district unit will be held at a party workers convention at the Sheshashayana Hall here on Monday. Nearly 12,000 party workers from across the district were expected to participate in convention titled ‘Sankalpa Samavesha’.

He said that the convention will be preceded by a procession from Diana Circle to the Sheshashayana Hall. Nalin Kumar Kateel, president of the State unit of BJP, and all legislators of the district will be participating. Since the gram panchayat elections were expected in the State in three to four months, the party has started making preparations for it, he said.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/construction-of-fisheries-harbour-gets-govt-nod/article30891956.ece
338,2020/02/23,On the tax path less trodden,"With the Centre offering two tax regimes, it’s time invest in cost- and tax-efficient options carrying superior returns

Earlier this month, I watched a video of Idina Menzel take the stage at the Oscars to sing “Into the Unknown” — the song from Frozen 2.

Little over a week before the Oscars, when the Finance Minister announced two tax regimes, one with tax exemptions and the other without, there were many questions asked on what would happen now. ‘Everything seems uncertain!’ My response: yes, you will be stepping into lesser known territory, but it might throw newer and better opportunities.

This article is not in defence of or against the Budget proposals. It is more to embrace changes and look for newer opportunities, by stepping into the unknown. I am just taking recent Budget proposals to enumerate my thoughts.

Over the past few years, changes through the Budget and outside of it have been in the following direction: one, the country is set to give you more tax-efficient routes to investing. Whether it is more equity / bond ETFs / sovereign gold bonds, or NPS or InvITs, or REITs, the nation is set to have more regulated, efficient investing in financial instruments across asset classes.

Two, the government has also been signalling that you need to save in your own interest and not merely to get the carrots (read tax benefits). For example, by reducing the high interest deduction and claiming set-off on loss on house property a few years ago, the government signalled that you cannot use tax benefit to invest in any number of properties.

The message overall appears to be: the government will provide you with more regulated, efficient options to invest. You may move to those for your own benefit and not for tax benefit alone.

These options will be tax-efficient, not tax-free. By being tax- efficient, I mean, those that are taxed low (either due to indexation or lower rates) at the time of your exiting.

Yes, at present, you have the option of continuing with the old tax regime and claiming all deductions and exemptions, with status quo being maintained.

But what if tomorrow, this is slowly phased out? Importantly, what should the younger generation coming into the workforce adopt?

Embrace it now

What are the things you can do to ensure your investment path is not troubled by extraneous factors such as tax changes? First, know that not all your investments will turn unattractive when you lose benefits. You must weigh them relatively for their returns.

Will PPF and EPF still provide you with better net returns than a bank FD?

If they do, you may not need to stop investing in them. Similarly, when it comes to covering your life or your medical expenses, tax breaks or not, they are a must.

If you had been paying high- premium, low-yielding money back policies in the name of investment, then this may be a good time for you to do a spot of spring cleaning of your investment portfolio.

Get a financial planner (for a fee) to do this one-time work and eliminate poor products in your basket.

Second, know that the only way to make up for lost tax benefits is to invest in cost-efficient, tax-efficient options that will generate superior long-term returns.

That means you have little choice but to start exploring options such as mutual funds, ETFs and bonds to ensure you make up in the long term.

If you are a starter in these products, the best thing would be for you to not make the same mistakes you made with some insurance products. That is, you don’t buy products because your relationship manager or agent told you.

Understanding benefits

You buy them if you understand their benefit and understand the risks. Bottomline, you will need to do more homework. Earlier, you could take shelter for buying a poor product because it at least gave you tax benefits. You can’t do that under the new regime where no such benefits will be available.

Third, if you are making any major decisions (be it an insurance policy or investing in more properties or upping your NPS) in the future, do not be entirely led by tax benefits that are promised.

They may not be available tomorrow. In other words, the overriding factor influencing your investment decision must be the benefit of the investment itself and not the tax break. Also, do not tell your children (stepping into careers) to do the usual tax-saving options that you did. You can’t be sure what will fit them. Let them start investing in contemporary products, not just driven by taxes.

Lastly, if you have always made decisions based on taxes and invested in products with no uncertainty, think again.

Uncertainty is not new

The gold investments you may have made had little certainty or tax benefit about it. The land or property you bought did not promise you with any fixed returns.

You didn’t even realise you made money out of them. And yet, you embraced the uncertainty of those. Now, it may be time to embrace the uncertainty of good, regulated products that simply need you to be patient and disciplined.

In other words, it is better that you step into the unknown now before you are forced to, later.

339,2020/02/23,Lotteries to attract 28% GST from March 1,"Currently, a state-run lottery attracts 12% GST, while a state-authorised lottery attracts 28% tax.

A 28% Goods and Services Tax (GST) will be levied on lotteries from March 1, according to a notification.

The GST Council had in December last year decided to impose a single rate of 28% on state-run and authorised lotteries.

The revenue department notified the GST rate on supply of lotteries and amended its earlier Central Tax (Rate) notification.

Accordingly, the Central Tax rate for supply of lotteries has been amended to 14% and a similar percentage will be levied by the states. This will take the total GST incidence on lotteries to 28%.

“This notification shall come into force on the 1st day of March, 2020,” the revenue department notification said.

Currently, a state-run lottery attracts 12% GST, while a state-authorised lottery attracts 28% tax.

There were demands that a uniform tax rate should be imposed on lotteries following which a group of ministers were set up to suggest the GST rate. Following this, the GST Council in December voted for a single rate of 28% on supply of lotteries.

AMRG & Associates Senior Partner Rajat Mohan said: “Gambling in the form of Lottery has been allowed in a few states, where it has penetrated at grass root levels, now changing the tax rate from a prospective date would help the dealers in effectively implementing the new tax rate”.

340,2020/02/23,"RBI reviewing monetary policy framework, says Shaktikanta Das","“We have initiated a process of internal review of how the monetary policy framework has worked,” RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is reviewing the retail inflation targeting framework behind monetary policy decision as well as its effectiveness and also plans to hold stakeholders consultations including with the government in June, Governor Shaktikanta Das said.

In a bid to keep inflation under specified level, the government in 2016 had decided to set up Monetary Policy Committee headed by RBI Governor entrusted with the task of fixing the benchmark policy rate (repo rate).

The six-member panel, which had its first meeting in October 2016, was given the mandate to maintain annual inflation at 4% until March 31, 2021 with an upper tolerance of 6% and a lower tolerance of 2%.

“The monetary policy framework is in operation for three and a half years. We have initiated a process of internal review of how the monetary policy framework has worked,” Mr. Das told PTI in an interview.

“We have commenced an internal review of the working of the monetary policy framework, and going forward by the middle of the current calendar year, that’s by June or so, we will be holding a round table with all analysts and experts and other stakeholders to do further consultations including the government at the appropriate time,” he said.

Obviously, the RBI has to interact with the government because the framework is a part of the law, he said, adding, “so, naturally government has to take a view”.

With regard to monetary policy transmission, the Governor said, it is steadily improving and is expected to improve further.

“Transmission is improving. If you see it was 49 basis points transmission for new loans in the December MPC. In February MPC, it has gone up to 69 basis points. So it is steadily improving,” he said.

On February 6, the six member-Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) headed by Mr. Das, for the second meeting in a row, kept repo rate unchanged at 5.15% but maintained accommodative policy stance which implies it was biased in favour of cutting rate to boost growth.

Prior to going for status quo on rates in December, the central bank had slashed rates five consecutive times that resulted in a cumulative 1.35% decline in repo rate.

On the RBI aligning its financial accounting year with that of union government, Mr. Das said, the current financial year will end in June while next financial year starting July one would end on March 31.

“So, the current year will go on till June. It will have 12 months. Next accounting year will start on July 1 and end on March 31,” he said.

So the central bank would prepare a truncated balance sheet for a period of nine months (from July 2020 to March 2021). Following next year, the full fiscal year of the RBI will start from April 1, 2021.

With this move, the RBI will do away with nearly eight decades of practice. The RBI, which was established in April 1935, used to follow January-December as its accounting year before it was changed to July-June in March 1940.

The change in accounting year is in line with the Bimal Jalan Committee on Economic Capital Framework (ECF) suggestion of a change in RBI’s accounting year to April-March from the financial year 2020-21.

It said the RBI would be able to provide better estimates of projected surplus transfers to the government for the financial year for budgeting purposes.",economy,https://www.thehindu.com/business/ml4d2/article28872129.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH08BU-vbk-SHAKTIKANTADAS-1,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/rbi-reviewing-monetary-policy-framework-says-shaktikanta-das/article30894422.ece
341,2020/02/23,The Trump visit as India-U.S. trade booster?,"What is the prospect of cooperation on trade and tariffs, and will the key sticking points be overcome?

The story so far: United States President Donald Trump’s first foreign trip after his acquittal in an impeachment trial in the Senate will also be his first ever official visit to India. The 45th American President will be in India on February 24-25, spending time in Prime Minister Narenda Modi’s home State of Gujarat, and in New Delhi. At stake during Mr. Trump’s visit is the prospect of more cooperation on trade and tariffs, the possibility of major defence deals and the optics of a mass welcome at the just-constructed Motera/Sardar Patel stadium in Ahmedabad, which would hope to mirror the success of the “Howdy Modi!” event in Houston, Texas, in September 2019.

Where do the two countries stand on trade cooperation?

The world’s oldest and largest democracies have been, by and large, stable trading partners to each other, yet this area has not been without wrinkles in recent years, especially since Mr. Trump entered the Oval Office. At a broad level, U.S.-India trade in goods and services has grown at a steady clip from $16-billion to $142-billion during 1999-2018.

As a recent report by the Council on Foreign Relations noted, “U.S. and Indian officials have disagreed for years on tariffs and foreign investment limitations, but also on other complicated issues, particularly within agricultural trade. Concern for intellectual property rights has preoccupied the U.S. for thirty years, while issues concerning medical devices and the fast-growing digital economy have more recently emerged.”

At the heart of Mr. Trump’s foreign policy strategy are concerns about the trade deficit that the U.S. has with its economic partners worldwide. Although India does not rank among the top 10 in this regard — for example, its 2019 trade deficit with the U.S. of $23.3-billion is dwarfed by China’s corresponding figure of $346-billion — there have been a series of skirmishes between Washington and New Delhi over tariffs in specific sectors, and that has destabilised the bilateral balance to a certain extent.

What is the chronology of U.S.-India trade squabbles?

In March 2018, the Trump administration slapped “national security” tariffs of 25% on $761-million worth of steel and of 10% on $382-million of aluminium imported from India. Despite formal World Trade Organisation disputes initiated by India protesting these tariffs, Washington ended a year-long review of the U.S. Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) in June 2019 by removing India from the tariff concession system. This is said to have impacted nearly $5.8 billion of India’s exports, or more than 12% of exports to the U.S. in 2017. India immediately imposed higher retaliatory tariffs on 28 U.S. products including almonds, walnuts, cashews, apples, chickpeas, wheat, and peas.

Besides other agricultural products such as dairy, the Trump administration remains wary of India’s position on intellectual property rights protection, barriers to free-flowing foreign direct investment, symbolically important trade sectors such as Harley-Davidson motorcycles and medical devices.

The U.S. also recently changed the status of India, among other countries, to a “developed” country, to further reduce trade concessions that it could receive from the U.S.

The other side of the coin is the concern that India has expressed on multiple occasions regarding restrictions on visas for highly skilled professionals seeking to take up employment in the U.S. — even though the laws that brought in restrictions, for example by imposing higher visa fees, were passed before Mr. Trump entered office.

Is there any hope for a positive announcement on trade?

While there were initial signs that a “limited trade deal” might be hammered out when Mr. Trump and Mr. Modi meet, that aspiration fell through when it became clear that nothing on that scale would likely be finalised in this space until after the November 2020 U.S. presidential election. Thus U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer’s planned visit to India just prior to Mr. Trump’s was put off to a future date.

What unconfirmed reports point to presently is the possibility of a “mini trade deal” or more simply a smaller trade package announcement. This might include, reports suggest, an increase in India’s LNG imports from the U.S. In a similar vein, The Hindu reported earlier that “An MoU for India’s gas importer Petronet to invest $2.5 billion in U.S. company Tellurian Inc’s LNG project, that was signed during Mr. Modi’s visit to Houston, is likely to be formalised during Mr. Trump’s visit.”

What are the priorities in the defence and strategic spaces?

There is more positive news on the defence cooperation and trade front, with the likely announcement during the visit of Mr. Trump of a deal for 24 Lockheed Martin-built MH-60R Seahawk Multi-Role Helicopters for the Indian Navy; India’s Cabinet Committee on Security has cleared their purchase These 24 helicopters, said to be worth $2.4-billion, are likely to be procured through the Foreign Military Sales route of the U.S. government. India and the U.S. are also said to be in negotiations regarding India’s potential purchase of drones, additional P-8I long-range, multimission maritime patrol aircraft and also Raytheon intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance (ISTAR) aircraft.

On the strategic front, Mr. Trump’s oft-reiterated promise to stop the U.S.’s “endless wars,” particularly by bringing home U.S. troops from Afghanistan, will possibly pose some thorny questions for Indian strategies in its neighbourhood. If the American withdrawal proceeds apace and alongside the possible revival of the Taliban’s influence, Pakistan-based terror elements or the Inter-Services Intelligence gain a stronger foothold in the power vacuum that will inevitably develop there, this could compromise Indian interests considerably. Mr. Modi may privately seek reassurances from his American counterpart to mitigate the fallout of such a scenario.",economy,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/ks6ru/article30891467.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Trump-Modi,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/the-trump-visit-as-india-us-trade-booster/article30891368.ece
342,2020/02/23,Buying health cover for elderly parents is a must,"While buying health insurance cover, do make sure to select a plan that offers extensive coverage.

Healthcare continues to remain a crucial lifeline for elderly citizens who need healthcare as they age. However, as per a recent tudy, over the next two decades, out-of-pocket medical costs for older adults are likely to rise significantly.

Considering the current rate of medical inflation in India, adequate health insurance has become a must-have for each and every individual, and if the individual happens to be your parents, the need for buying a senior citizen health insurance plan becomes all the more important.

We all must accept the fact of life that as we age, it’s not just our experience that increases, the list of medical ailments also witness a substantial increase.

Many studies suggest a majority of senior citizens in India are exposed to one or the other lifestyle diseases, including diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, etc. This eventually increases their chances of facing medical contingencies. Considering the given scenario, buying an individual cover for your elderly parents is a sensible thing to do.

In the event of your parents requiring hospitalisation, the major part of the medical expenses will be taken care of by your parents’ medical cover plan, without burning a hole in your pocket. Most important, even if your parents are adequately covered under a corporate health insurance policy by your employer, the cover provided by your employer would cease to exist post-retirement.

This makes it important for you as caring and responsible children to purchase a separate senior citizen health insurance plan.

Choice of plans

For people looking forward to buy a health insurance plan for their parents, a family floater healthcare plan can be a good option provided the age of parents is not much and they do not have any pre-existing diseases. Such plans are specifically designed to offer insurance coverage to the entire family, including dependent parents. While some of these health insurance covers impose a limit on parents’ age, other insurers charge a high premium.

Fortunately, the Indian insurance market is crammed with numerous health insurance plans that specifically target senior citizens and even those with pre-existing diseases. It is strongly suggested to go for an independent policy rather than group policy as a group cover does not always include pre-existing diseases.

However, in an independent policy, most pre-existing diseases get covered and the chances of claims getting approved are the highest. You can even avail a tax benefit of up to ₹25,000 under Sec. 80D on health insurance premium paid for self, spouse, children and parents. And, in the case of elderly parents (above 60 years of age), the benefit goes up to ₹50,000 with the latest amendment to tax slabs. There are some crucial factors you must consider when planning to buy health insurance for your elderly parents.

Criterion for age at entry

In India, most insurance companies have entry age criteria that must be fulfilled by the individual to be eligible for buying a health insurance cover. However, the entry age guidelines vary from one insurer to another and it is always advised to compare different policies offered by different providers.

It is important to consider the age of the policy-seeker before taking the policy as it plays an important role in deciding the premium. While a particular health insurance cover may look attractive for different factors and features, if the entry age is not matched; it is worthless buying the policy.

Extent of coverage

While buying health insurance cover, do make sure to select a plan that offers extensive coverage.

Pick a plan that promises adequate coverage against various critical illnesses, particularly pre-existing diseases. Though most insurers provide coverage against these diseases after a waiting period, which is typically 2-3 years, it is always advised to review the policy document to understand the conditions carefully.

Sum insured

The total sum insured plays a very important role in any health insurance policy. This is typically the amount that the insurer will reimburse against the expenses incurred for medical treatment.

However, the incurred expenses must be within the total sum insured. While buying a health insurance policy for your elderly parents, it is always advised to go in for a higher sum insured, as you will receive a larger amount for medical emergencies.

343,2020/02/23,Where should my dad invest after retirement? Answers to your personal finance queries,"Readers can send in queries on personal ﬁnance and investing to moneywise@thehindu.co.in

Q. My dad is retiring this month from service. He will get a substantial lump sum in the form of gratuity, provident fund and other dues. How should he invest this money?

Prakash Kumar

A. We assume a key goal, post-retirement, will be to earn regular cash flows to either meet his living expenses or supplement the pension he’s receiving from his employer.

Apart from this, even after retirement, it is important to have a growth component to one’s portfolio that can grow one’s capital to keep up with inflation. Without this, the capital investments may lose value with time, given the bite of inflation. Presently, after sharp cuts in interest rates by the Monetary Policy Committee, fixed deposits from leading banks offer interest rates of 6.1-6.5% (taxable) for 1- to 5-year terms which are quite unattractive. We can suggest three other regular income options that offer a better combination of safety with returns.

Your father can park the first ₹15 lakh of his retirement proceeds in the Senior Citizens Savings Scheme offered by the post office and also available at leading banks. This is a government-backed small savings scheme on which the Centre resets interest rates each quarter. For the current January to March 31 2020 quarter, the rate offered is 8.6% per annum, which is far higher than the rates on bank deposits. Investments are locked in for five years, with extension of the maturity date allowed after five years. Interest is paid out on a quarterly basis to the investor.

A second scheme is the Pradhan Mantri Vaya Vandana Yojana from LIC which allows an upfront investment of up to ₹15 lakh per individual. The scheme pays out guaranteed pensions on a monthly, quarterly, half-yearly or yearly basis at rates of 8%, 8.05%, 8.13% or 8.3% respectively on initial investment. The scheme carries a 10-year lock-in period. If the policy purchaser doesn’t survive the term, the purchase price is refunded to the nominee.

A third option is to invest in GOI Savings Bonds that offer 7.75% interest per annum. The bonds, available on tap from banks, lock in the investor’s money for 7 years and allow you to earn either regular interest payouts or a cumulative value at maturity. The bonds need to be held to maturity and are unlisted and non-transferable. The interest on all of the above options is taxable and the post-tax interest, depending on your father’s tax slab, may be lower than the rates mentioned above. However, these schemes still score for their high interest rates compared with bank deposits despite their high safety as central government-backed schemes.

After deploying 75% of his retirement proceeds in the above three options, your father should invest about 25% of his capital in a multi-cap equity fund with a good track record. This investment should be in the growth option so that it can deliver capital appreciation that will boost his portfolio returns to keep up with inflation.

Apart from these options, your father should also have some money, equal to nine months’ living expenses, parked in a deposit with a leading bank that can be withdrawn at any time for emergencies. It would be wise to get a health insurance cover to protect his finances from medical emergencies.

Q. I'm 22 and earn ₹3 lakh a year. I don't have any expenses as I am staying with my parents. I want to know where to invest the money so that it will give me good returns.

Rishita Bansal

A. Your choice of investment options will depend on what you want to save up towards. It would be a good idea to map out your financial goals over the next one year, 3-5 years and longer time frames. Once you have such goals in place, you’ll need to quantify the target corpus for each.

For 1-year goals, we suggest you use a recurring deposit with a leading bank to invest. For 1-3 year goals, fixed deposits or SIPs in short-duration debt mutual funds would be ideal. For 3-5 year terms, the post office time deposit or corporate bond mutual funds that invest mainly in safe instruments would be good options. Towards more-than-5-year goals, you can invest in SIPs in multi-cap equity funds. When choosing funds, be sure to select those with a good 10-year record of outperforming their benchmarks and category, or take the help of a qualified adviser.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/1bilrn/article30900405.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Th17-BU-INVESTMENTS,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/answers-to-your-personal-finance-queries/article30891083.ece
344,2020/02/23,BSNL employee unions call for nationwide hunger strike on Feb. 24 for delay in relief package,"In October 2019, the central government approved a ₹68,751-crore revival package for loss-making BSNL and MTNL.

State-run telecom firm BSNL’s employee unions have called for a nationwide hunger strike on Monday, to protest against delay in execution of the ₹69,000-crore revival package announced by the government.

“The All Unions and Associations of BSNL (AUAB) is organising a country-wide hunger strike on February 24, 2020. This hunger strike is being organised to demand the expeditious implementation of the Union Cabinet’s revival package in respect of BSNL, as well as to demand settlement of the grievances of the employees,” AUAB said in a statement.

In October 2019, the central government approved a ₹68,751-crore revival package for loss-making BSNL and MTNL, including 4G spectrum allocation and voluntary retirement scheme (VRS), as well as their merger.

AUAB said the salient feature of the revival package is the allotment of 4G spectrum, the issuing of sovereign guarantee for raising funds to the tune of ₹15,000 crore, with share of BSNL at ₹8,500 crore and ₹6,500 crore for MTNL, by way of issuing long-term bonds, monetisation of assets and implementation of a VRS.

Also read | A delayed imperative: On BSNL-MTNL merger

“Out of these, only the VRS has been implemented, through which 78,569 BSNL employees have been sent home. It is extremely disturbing to note that, even after the lapse of nearly 4 months, 4G spectrum has not been allotted to BSNL,” statement said.

It added that the government has not yet issued the sovereign guarantee to BSNL, to enable it to raise ₹8,500 crore, by way of issuing long-term bonds.

“The process of monetisation of BSNL’s assets is also moving at snail’s pace. The Supreme Court of India’s judgment, with regards to the calculation of the AGR, has caused uncertainties in the telecom sector, due to which banks are also unwilling to extend the much-needed loans to BSNL,” the statement said.

The BSNL employees’ body said that due to the delay in the allotment of 4G spectrum and also due to the non-availability of funds, it is understood that BSNL’s 4G service is not likely to be launched before the end of 2020.

“This delay is much against the spirit of the Union Cabinet, in approving the revival package for BSNL. The attention of the Minister of Communications (Ravi Shankar Prasad) has already been drawn to the need to provide BSNL with the much-needed working capital. However, nothing has happened,” the statement said.

AUAB said that despite the relief package, employees are not getting salary on time and the wages of the contract workers have not been paid for the past 10 months.

“Under these circumstances, the AUAB has already organised country-wide lunch-hour demonstrations on February 11, 2020. In continuation of this, hunger strikes are being organised throughout the country on February 24 to urge the Department of Telecommunications and the BSNL management to take expeditious actions,” AUAB said.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/cp1v57/article30755709.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY07BSNL,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/bsnl-employee-unions-call-for-nationwide-hunger-strike-on-feb-24-for-delay-in-relief-package/article30895007.ece
345,2020/02/23,DoT’s test checks on variations in telecom companies AGR dues standard audit procedure: COAI,"The government will conduct ‘test check’ for any one year (of telcos’ dues) to examine variances.

Terming ‘test checks’ proposed by the government on telcos’ AGR arithmetic as standard audit procedure, Industry body COAI has said the DoT needs to ensure consistency among its different circles on calculation of dues to minimise any differences.

Cellular Operators’ Association of India (COAI) also cautioned that any decision to encash bank guarantees will be “disastrous” for the telecom industry, which only has three private players.

“Any move to encash bank guarantees will precipitate an already precarious situation,” COAI Director General, Rajan Mathews told PTI.

Mr. Mathews termed the ‘test checks’ being proposed by the telecom department to examine deviation in calculation of dues by companies as a “standard audit procedure”.

He pointed out that while amounts need to be finalised as soon as possible, operators too should be given a fair opportunity to explain the deviations in calculation.

“There should be consistency amongst all LSAs (Licensed Service Areas) of the DoT (Department of Telecommunications) on how the amounts are calculated, so the differences are minimised,” Mr. Mathews added.

The government has made it clear that it will verify the companies’ claims on AGR math and examine any deviations from its own calculation, through random ‘test checks’ before March 17.

The government will conduct ‘test check’ for any one year (of telcos’ dues) to examine variances between telecom companies’ assessment and the government’s own calculation of AGR liabilities.

The test check will happen for all telecom firms, but could start with those, which have already claimed they have made full and final settlement towards their statutory liabilities, like Tata Teleservices.

In all, as many as 15 entities owe the government ₹ 1.47 lakh crore — ₹ 92,642 crore in unpaid licence fee and another ₹ 55,054 crore in outstanding spectrum usage charges.

These dues arose after the Supreme Court, in October last year, upheld the government’s position on including revenue from non-core businesses in calculating the annual adjusted gross revenue (AGR) of telecom companies, a share of which is paid as licence and spectrum fee to the exchequer.

The Supreme Court earlier this month rejected a plea by mobile carriers such as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea Ltd for extension in the payment schedule and asked them to deposit an estimated Rs 1.47 lakh crore in past dues for spectrum and licences.

The apex court had warned that it will initiate contempt proceedings against top executives of these firms for non-payment.

Some telecom firms are already struggling with mounting losses and debt, and the additional liability has raised concerns of them defaulting on existing loans.

Of the estimated dues that include interest and penalty for late payments, Airtel and Vodafone Idea owe about 60 per cent.

Vodafone Idea is confronted with total AGR dues of over ₹ 53,000 crore. Of this, it has so far paid only ₹ 3,500 crore in two tranches earlier this week.

Airtel has so far paid ₹ 10,000 crore out of its estimated liability of over ₹ 35,000 crore.

Tata Teleservices has paid ₹ 2,197 crore, the entire outstanding it believes to have arisen after the October ruling of the apex court for calculating dues.

Tata Teleservices and Tata Teleservices Maharashtra have submitted to the government the details of calculation in support of its payment, but sources in the DoT said that wide gap between the company’s calculations and the department’s assessment of about ₹ 14,000 crore, will certainly be examined.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/3p0fpe/article30154723.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH03-YUTHIKA-COGLL6Q3B463jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/dots-test-checks-on-variations-in-telecom-companies-agr-dues-standard-audit-procedure-coai/article30894807.ece
