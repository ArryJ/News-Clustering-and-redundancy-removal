0,['19/02/2020'],PL Thenappan awaits response to the intimation mail sent to Parasite team,"We had reported that producer PL Thenappan , who holds the rights of KS Ravikumar’s two-decade-old Minsara Kanna, was planning to sue the makers of Academy Award-winning film Parasite on the grounds of ‘story theft’.And now, we have learnt that, with the help of his lawyer, he had an intimation mail sent last Wednesday to director Bong Joon-ho and the production company of the South Korean movie, seeking an explanation. Easwar Kuppusamy, a Madras High Court advocate, who is appearing for Thenappan, informs us that they will initiate proper legal action against the makers if they fail to get a response to their mail before or by next Wednesday.He says, “We sent them a mail last Wednesday. We’d provided them with details of Minsara Kanna, like its censoring date, star cast, story, etc. They can’t deny that they have lifted the basic plot (from the Tamil film ). There are several films which have similar ideas, but an entire family going to a rich family’s house and deceiving them is Minsara Kanna’s plot. The only difference is that Parasite doesn’t belong to the romantic genre.”So, what if the Parasite team doesn’t respond to the intimation mail? Easwar answers, “We will then send a legal notice to the director and the producer through Korean Embassy. We will also be informing the Academy Awards team about this. If they accept charges of plagiarism, further action will be decided. As this is a dispute between Indian and Korean production companies, we may also involve a forum of foreign advocates.”The lawyer continues, “But I foresee an amicable solution if they admit to having lifted the plot. Then, it’s up to the producer if he wants to demand monetary compensation.”",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74193541,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1328566/74193541.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/movies/news/pl-thenappan-awaits-response-to-the-intimation-mail-sent-to-parasite-team/articleshow/74193541.cms

The ghats, which is among the eight bio-diversity hot spots in the world, is under threat, given the number of proposed development projects in the region. To be held at the St Joseph ’s College (autonomous) today, the conference will highlight the issues plaguing the ghats. Student coordinator of the United Conservation Movement at St Joseph’s, James Hoover , says, “The student community is worried about the issues related to climate change.

Well, Kannan and his team trekked up 70 ft on a snowy day in sub-zero temperatures for a five-minute scene. The director, along with the cast and crew of his romantic entertainer Thalli Pogathey — which stars Atharvaa Anupama Parameswaran and Amitash Pradhan in the lead — shot at Xizi Mountains in Azerbaijan last month. They walked for over six hours to the peak, lugging all the shooting equipment with them.“It’s a scene that will appear for just five minutes in the film, and shows the three lead actors camping on the mountain. We chose Xizi Mountains because the view from there is stunning. We started walking from the base at about 5am, and reached the spot at about 11am. The temperature ranged between -8°C and -11°C, and it was constantly snowing,” tells Kannan.“We were a crew of 45 members and had to dress in multiple layers when we covered the elevation of 70ft. To top it all, we had to carry all the shooting equipment, including cameras and sound consoles. With high-velocity winds none of us could even stand at a place for more than few seconds without swaying.

Popular for her turnout as Gombe in Laxmi Baramma, she says that she really missed the buzz of the set in the brief break that she took from work. “I had been working non-stop for seven years and took only a short break for my wedding two years ago. So, when the serial got done, I was happy to get some time off for myself,” shares Neha. But soon, she began missing the daily routine of being on a TV show set. “That’s when the offer to do a guest role in Mooru Gantu came my way. While there were a few other offers, this one seemed perfect. It’s a cameo and I have about 10 days of shoot. I play myself and am a host of a show in the serial,” explains Neha, adding, “The hero of the serial is looking for bride for himself and enlists a swayamvara to find the right one. I’m the anchor of this swayamvara; it’s a far cry from what I’ve done so far. Anchoring is something I’ve always wanted to try my hand at and Mooru Gantu has made it happen for me.”So, what’s next in store for Neha? “I’ve worked in most languages, now I want to go pan-India,” says the actress. ”Apparently, many people think that I won’t be acting anymore because I’m married and that I’ve chosen to stay home.

And now, Raksh, Bangalore Times Most Desirable Man on TV, 2019, is all set to make his silver screen debut with Naragunda Bandaya . This film, though, is not his first tryst with cinema. The actor had shot for a few other projects, none of which saw the light of day. Not one to mope, Raksh says that his earlier failures taught him what not to do, and is now elated to be making his big-screen debut with a content-oriented yet commercial film, which delves into a historic incident - the revolt of the farmers in Nargund , also known as Naragunda. In this Nagendra Magadi-directorial, Raksh plays the farmer Veerappa Kadlikoppa , who played a pivotal role in the uprising. “It’s a role that has taken up two years of relentless toil, and while it was stressful, it’s been worth the effort,” he shares, in a chat with BT.I came into the entertainment industry in my college days, starting off in theatre and graduating to assistant director for films eventually. I worked on multiple projects, but the experience was not something to talk about, as most of the films either didn’t release or fared badly at the box office. Strangely enough, my stint with cinemas did not pave way for an acting career on the big screen. It took me a few more years and a couple of popular serials to finally get my break. I wanted to start with a good, impactful film for my debut, and believe that I got that with Naragunda Bandaya.The revolution of the farmers in Naragunda has been addressed by many actors, including Shivarajkumar sir and others in public speeches. But a cinematic representation of the events leading to the formation of the Karnataka Raitha Sangha is a first and that is what drew me to the project.Veerappa’s life is not widely chronicled so, researching about him online was not an option. I had to go and meet his family in Naragunda to know more about the life and lifestyle of the man, who at a young age, was at the forefront of a revolution.I learnt the Uttara Karnataka dialect for the role and would converse with the director, who is from Hubli, in the native slang, so that I could play that part convincingly. I also lost 35 kilos for the role, and worked towards getting the physique of a farmer, who toils long and hard, just right. Organically, as I started shooting more, I started resembling Veerappa. So much so, that there is a shot in the trailer in which I am next to his statue, and the resemblance is uncanny.While working on the film, I was juggling it with my TV shoot schedules as well. There was one point at which I worked 20-hour schedules for 13 days at a stretch. My health took a beating and I fell terribly sick. The subject, though, has been close to my heart, so, I was involved in the post-production as well. In fact, with so much going on in my career, I have, honestly, not had much time to spend with my wife in the seven months since we got married. But the effort was worth it and will be for all to see when the film releases next week.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74190990,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-127407/74190990.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/movies/news/my-resemblance-to-veerappa-is-uncanny-says-raksh/articleshow/74190990.cms

A regular day in the safari section of the Bannerghatta Biological Park (BBP) will have visitors witnessing numerous sloth bears in action — some playing with dry leaves and others finding their favourite trees. These sloth bears have all been rescued from various parts of the country and brought to the Bear Rescue and Research Centre at the BBP, where they are treated, cared for and looked after. Reaching a total of 75 in number till now, these bears are expected to live out their entire lives in the vicinity.

Dr Umashekhar KS , Director of Veterinary Services , BBP, says that these animals have mostly been found or rescued from various districts of Karnataka — especially Ballari and Tumakuru. He adds, “Between our team and the organisation Wildlife SOS, we have rescued many bears from captivity and those who were injured and almost killed by poachers. These bears will have to spend the rest of their lives here, as they cannot be let out in the wild again. They cannot grow in numbers as breeding is strictly prohibited, but we do make sure to provide them with the best nutrition and a safe, open environment.”

Know your sloth bears

The name: Their lethargic nature has led them being called sloths.

Diet: “Each sloth bear consumes up to 20 kgs of food in a day. We serve them a combination of fruits, which include banana, grapes, apples, watermelons and guava. Sometimes, we add vegetables too, like carrot and sweet potato, along with sugarcane, maize, groundnuts and milk. Sloth bears are fond of sweets, especially honey. So, we add 10 ml of honey and 4/5 ml of date palm syrup in their food. They also like having small insects like ants and termites,” says Dr Umashankar

Life expectancy: 15-25 years

But for Ramesh Aravind , who was last seen onscreen in Pushpaka Vimana, the time was about making two versions of the Queen remake , his TV show, Weekend with Ramesh , and one season of Kannadada Kotyadhipathi, and planning his return to the big screen with his 101st film. “I am a person who needs to constantly be doing something; in fact, in these last three years, I was almost working every day. But I was also looking for a role that would be a far cry from my 100 earlier films. That came to me with director Akash Srivatsa ’s Shivaji Surathkal: Ranagiri Rahasya . It is very different from all the roles I have done; one that is very challenging for a male protagonist. The story fascinated me, as it transpires in a place called Ranagiri, where a weird murder takes place,” he says.Ramesh adds, “As it turns out, Ranagiri is weirder. And, into that, enters Shivaji Surathkal, a detective , who is the weirdest of them all; it’s such a crazy combination. I’ve always wanted to do a Sherlock Holmes kind of film and Shivaji Surathkal : Ranagiri Rahasya is Akash’s tribute to that genre, so it blended perfectly with what I was looking for. In fact, years ago, I wanted to play Sherlock Holmes, but it never took off. So, when Shivaji Surathkal… came along, I knew it would be just right for me. If Sherlock Holmes was born in Karnataka and speaks Kannada, how will he be? That is what Shivaji Surathkal… is about. This is Sherlock Holmes behind the beard of Ramesh Aravind.”Shivaji, adds the actor, is a very complex guy. “He has a razor-sharp brain, talks fast like a speeding bullet train and has a very assertive body language. But, he also battles insomnia and depression and has his own demons. He is a genius who is wondering if he is going mad. And it is at this point that he has to solve a murder mystery. In all, he is a fabulous character to play and I thoroughly enjoyed getting into the skin of this detective,” says the actor.The film, is still a family entertainer, with clever moments and emotional scenes, asserts Ramesh, adding that it is his character that will be new for audiences. “The Ramesh (as Shivaji) you will see onscreen is a different package, starting with the bearded look, who is unpredictable and rude to people. Yet at the same time, he is very endearing; you will not be put off by his behaviour. In fact, audiences will love him for his flaws, weaknesses and the struggles he goes through. Most importantly, how he solves the case is the biggest highlight,” says Ramesh.And, given that the film has the potential to become a franchise, the actor is hopeful that it does take off in that direction. “We are starting with Ranagiri Rahasya; tomorrow, it could be something else. The character is so strong that we can keep bringing him back for newer mysteries,” Ramesh signs off.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74192313,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-132002/74192313.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/movies/news/ramesh-anand-gets-chatty-about-playing-kannadas-sherlock-holmes/articleshow/74192313.cms

Panaji: FC Goa reserves were left to rue a missed penalty in their 2-2 draw against ARA FC in the Second Division I-League at GMC Athletic Stadium at Bambolim on Tuesday.

Senegal striker Dieye Hamidou scored his fourth goal in as many matches as he put the Ahmedabad side ahead in the first session. FC Goa equalised soon after restart through Kapil Hoble and Lalawmpuia then failed to convert a penalty.

Three minutes from time, Nestor Dias eventually scored FC Goa’s second, but it was not enough as substitute Parminder Singh made it 2-2 in the next minute with a powerful grounder.

ARA continued their unbeaten run and are top of the standings in group C with 10 points. It was FC Goa’s second draw which kept them third in the table with five points.

Dieye led ARA’s attack while their second foreigner, Nigerian Kareem Nurain, kept speedy Lalawmpuia at bay. ARA, which became the first team from Gujarat to participate in the tournament last season, showed promise at the start, but failed to carry on the momentum after they easily lost possession.

Goa had no such trouble as they passed the ball with ease in their own half but couldn’t penetrate through the opposition.

Dieye made an impact just after the half an hour mark when he received a ball from the midfield, turned and unleased a venomous right-footer that left keeper Guidle Syiemlieh stunned.

Goa started the second half with purpose and an unmarked Kapil had all the time to head in off a cross from Sweden Fernandes.

Lalawmpuia soon found Kapil inside the box and rival custodian Iprotip Das brought down the midfielder. However, Iprotip made amends as he blocked Lalawmpuia’s feeble spot kick.

ARA continued to put pressure in the final quarter with Prabin Tigga’s long throw-ins. Once such effort from Prabin found Parminder, whose header hit the post.

But with three minutes left, Nestor gave Goa the lead with a deft placement. However, ARA’s substitutes Austin Jijo combined well in the next minute with Parminder finding the target from distance.

14,['19/02/2020'],It’s all in FC Goa’s hands now,"This story is from February 19, 2020

Margao: If FC Goa were asked to handpick their opponents for a game as decisive as this one, Jamshedpur FC would be their second-last choice.

There is no denying that, psychologically, Goa lose half the battle even before it starts against Bengaluru FC. Jamshedpur are cut from a different cloth, yet Goa have something to fear.

Jamshedpur is the only team to defeat Goa at home this Indian Super League ( ISL ) season and are now on a three-game winless streak against them. The last time they went to the JRD Tata Sports Complex, Goa lost 1-4. Understandably, everyone will be tensed as Clifford Miranda’s side face Jamshedpur in their concluding league clash on Wednesday.

For Goa, it’s their most important match of the season. If they avoid defeat, Goa will finish on top and become the first Indian club to play the high-profile AFC Champions League group stage next season. It’s something that the club has always wanted, and as reward for the team, an out-of-contract bonus of Rs 47 lakh was announced.

After coming so far and doing so well, nobody will want to mess it up for the last 90 minutes. Jamshedpur are out of the playoff race, are on a five-game winless run and are mired in the eighth position with just 18 points from 17 games. They will be desperate for a win in front of their home fans.

On paper and form, Goa should be able to get at least a point, even though not everything has gone according to plan.

Brandon Fernandes, an important creative outlet for the team on the left, will miss the game through suspension. Seriton Fernandes is also suspended. This will be the first ISL game that the right-back will miss after making 46 consecutive appearances in the competition. Their replacements – Seiminlen Doungel and Amey Ranawade – have hardly featured this season.

“Just because they haven’t had a good season doesn’t mean it will be an easy game for us. I am sure we are going to face an equally competitive team that will want to win. This is the same team which beat us back in Goa.

Margao: Israil Gurung has been with Churchill Brothers long enough to know what the club and the owner expects, every season.

“When you play for Churchill, you don’t expect anything less than a championship. That is because of the history of the club. The owner doesn’t like to lose. When you are playing for the club, you have to keep that in mind. Every game you have to fight,” said Gurung, while coach Bernardo Tavares, seated next to him at the pre-match interaction, listened attentively.

What Tavares heard from Gurung, surely, he’s heard that before from everyone at the club. So, despite Mohun Bagan leaving everyone behind in the race for the I-League title, Churchill cannot afford to give up. At least for now, they are still in the game and their aspirations will be clear depending on what happens in their clash against Real Kashmir FC at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda on Wednesday.

Mathematically, Churchill (16 points from 10 matches) and Kashmir (15 points from 10 matches) are closest to Mohun Bagan (29 points from 12 matches). But whether they can catch up with the Kolkata giants is a different story altogether.

“The last game (against Aizawl FC) was an important win for us. It gives us confidence. It was also important for Plaza to score. A striker lives for goals,” said Tavares.

Plaza was benched for the last game due to his erratic form in front of goal.

Against Kashmir, Churchill in general and Plaza in particular will have to be at their sharpest. Kashmir have the best defensive record in the league for two seasons now and have conceded just nine goals in 10 games. They won’t allow too many openings, and Churchill’s record of missing chances this season could peg them back.

Kashmir coach David Robertson has kept expectations under check but there is no denying that his side is as good as anyone else. They have won three of their last four away games and will fancy their chances against their misfiring hosts.

“Nine points from 12 away games is fantastic. If someone had offered us, we would take that before we left Kashmir. We are not despondent. We want more points on the board,” said Robertson.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/churchill-look-to-break-real-kashmir-wall/articleshow/74199232.cms
16,['19/02/2020'],J&amp;K rural polls postponed over security concerns,"This story is from February 19, 2020

SRINAGAR: Bypolls to 12,500-odd vacant panchayat seats in J&K were on Tuesday postponed till further orders after the office of the election authority received an advisory from the home department not to hold polling between March 5 and 20 ""due to security concerns"".

A new schedule for the eight-phase bypolls will be notified after two to three weeks, chief electoral officer Shailendra Kumar said.

The announcement came within hours of Kumar meeting functionaries of four political parties to address their concerns about the conduct of the first electoral exercise in J&K since it officially became a Union Territory in October 31.

Barring BJP, the parties set two conditions for their participation in the bypolls — that polling should be ""on non-party basis"" and the administration should release all their functionaries in detention since August 5 last year.

After the meeting, representatives of the parties told reporters that the chief electoral officer promised to raise these issues with ""higher-ups"" and get back at the earliest.

Rattan Lal Gupta of NC, GN Monga of Congress and Harshdev Singh of the National Panthers Party (NPP) were among those who attended the meeting. PDP boycotted the meeting, saying it could not be part of any electoral process till its functionaries, including former CM Mehbooba Mufti , remained in detention.

Monga said all parties were of the opinion that any poll exercise in J&K would be worth the trouble only if the administration promised an atmosphere free of fear. ""A peaceful atmosphere is the primary requirement for an elected candidate to be able to work freely for the people.""

Gupta of NC said he still believed the situation was not conducive to elections. In a letter to the chief electoral officer last week, the NC said it was ""a strong votary of the democratic process"", but it would be ""practically impossible"" to take part in the panchayat polls if party president Farooq Abdullah , vice-president Omar Abdullah and general secretary Ali Mohammad Sagar remained in detention under the Public Safety Act.

17,['19/02/2020'],"Kashmiri pandits meet Shah, say home minister assured they would be resettled in Valley","This story is from February 19, 2020

NEW DELHI: Home minister Amit Shah on Tuesday said the rehabilitation of Kashmiri pandits was top priority of the government and sought to assure them that they would be resettled in the Valley amid adequate security. Members of the seven-member delegation also claimed that Shah said temples in the Valley would be renovated and restored.

Members of the delegation — comprising Surinder Kaul , International Coordinator of Global Kashmiri Pandit Diaspora (GKPD); Utpal Kaul, GKPD India Coordinator; Taj Tikoo, president of the All India Kashmiri Samaj (AIKS); Dileep Mattoo , president of Jammu Kashmir Vichar Manch (JKVM), among others — later told newspersons that the minister had promised to resettle the Kashmiri pandits in the very districts from where they were forced to flee by militant outfits in the late eighties and early nineties.

“The minister promised to resettle all Kashmiri pandits in their respective districts. He also assured that the resettlement process will be done in phases amid tight security,” said Utpal Kaul.

The delegation suggested that the age limit for government jobs vis-a-vis Kashmiri pandits be increased up to 50 years. Kaul quoted Shah as saying that all temples in the Valley would be renovated.

The delegation handed over a memorandum to Shah thanking the Union government for voiding Articles 370 and 35A of the Constitution in the erstwhile state of J&K.

“The delegation members expressed heartfelt thanks to the minister for maintaining a consistent position on its promise to rehabilitate the displaced Kashmiri pandits in the Kashmir Valley...The delegation also thanked the minister for abrogating article 370 and 35A whose pernicious impact has destroyed the Kashmiri society, culture, civilisation, economic progress and the ability to lead a peaceful life in the valley,” stated the memorandum.

The delegation demanded the formation of an advisory council of Kashmiri pandits to work under the aegis of the minister of home affairs to come up with a plan for full restorative justice for the Kashmiri pandits.

The delegation requested Shah to accept the community’s demand for a single concentrated rehabilitation plan, including employment and other rights, enshrined in the Constitution as well as restoration and rebuilding of temples, shrines and community assets, including crematoriums.

“The minister gave a patient hearing to our demands and conveyed that rehabilitation of our community is an utmost priority with the government. He sought help from our community to compile a database of all the properties that have been either occupied or encroached upon so that the government can initiate redressal mechanisms to restore the property to the rightful owner,” the delegation said.

Swapnali Morajkar, a professional from Mumbai, is all set to go to Thailand for a much-awaited girls-only tour. And chances are high, it will not happen. “The trip that we planned for Bangkok is on March 7. But the more we read about coronavirus every day, the more I am contemplating on cancelling it. There is a lot of pressure from my parents to do so. My husband, who was heading to Vietnam for a bachelor destination party, has also cancelled his plans. I’m in two minds because it’s going to be a loss as the tickets are non-refundable. It’s long since we did a girls’ trip and we needed this break, but I am also scared. Whatif we land up with a cough and cold and get quarantined? It will be scary.”She’s not alone. As the world grapples with the virus, there’s a growing anxiety over the outbreak leading to people changing their travel itineraries in a bid to stay safe. A fear of taking off to destinations around the globe, transiting through airports and coming face-to-face with other passengers is getting them to do a volte face with travel. It’s making life tough for the tourism sector.Several travel companies and smaller operators have been dealing with an increasing number of customers who want to avoid China and the Far East . Travel company owner Prateek Deo has been refunding booking amounts to people due to cancellations since the last two weeks, “It’s been crazy, trying to deal with it. We do understand as this was difficult situation. We have a tour planned for Vietnam in November, but people who showed interest and booked a token amount, are already withdrawing. We have to pay the booking amount as refund to them. Though it may be a token amount, it amounts to a lot when taken collectively. Some of the flights that were booked are hopping flights, which go via Singapore and Hong Kong and people are saying, “We are clear about it, we don’t want to go.”Affirms travel company head, Veneeta Rawat, “It’s been a roller coaster couple of weeks for us. International travel traffic has been reduced drastically owing to corona virus and business has been hugely impacted for the month of Feb-March. The Far East is a big destination for people who don’t want a long-haul break. In fact, almost 25 percent of our business goes to the Far East. We have had 90 percent cancellations and changes so far. Some countries have been supportive and allowed passengers to travel at a later date, and some countries haven’t issued a travel advisory yet, so there’s no refund. We had organised a seven-member food tour next week to Vietnam which is cancelled for now and may take place in December.”The summer vacations are hit, too. She adds, “Even for May-June, people are not willing to pay up, whereas in other times, by now they would have booked advance air tickets and hotels. It’s not just China, people travelling to places like Australia, too are wary, owing to the Far-East transit”.The situation has led to some travellers carting home masks for protection against the virus. Subash Banerjee, who flew to Mumbai for a few days from his home in Singapore, is doing just that. “Items like masks and thermometers are out of stock now in Singapore, so I am buying them to take back with me,” he states. He adds, “Singapore’s Changi Airport, which usually sees a huge volume of people, is far emptier than ever before. The malls in Singapore are also seeing lesser volumes of people. A fear of the virus definitely abounds.”The situation has thrown the travel industry into a crisis management situation. Jyoti Mayal, President TAAI (Travel Agents Association of India) says that in South East Asia business has been affected a lot. “It’s going into millions — hotels have closed down and people who had booked earlier are cancelling. Here, we are trying to see that people are using precautions and a list of dos and don’ts are being circulated. We are keeping our fingers crossed, but we have to build on opportunities. We are trying to see that more domestic tourism happens. With people hesitant to fly abroad, within the country we are still better off. We have given a letter to the aviation ministry to say please deploy more airlines this side. Summer season and April is not far and people will shift their travel plans from South East Asia to neighbouring areas like Middle East and Europe. We want more planes this side, so fares are not hiked up as much. It’s business for the airline and business for the country.”Says wedding planner Dhawal Oza, “We had a couple of recce trips for an upcoming shaadi planned in Sri Lanka and Hua Hin in Thailand, but we had to cancel owing to virus fears. The families opted out as they want would rather be safe than sorry. Also, artistes who were to perform at April-May weddings have cancelled. For now, they have said they want to wait and watch the situation. My sister had planned a bachelorette to Bali this February. She and her pals just went to Goa and had it there.”The prestigious London Fashion Week that kicked off on February 14, had people wearing stylish face masks and using hand sanitisers amid coronavirus fears. With items not being able to arrive from China, some designers had to make last-minute changes to their ramp. Also, the impact of Chinese attendance at the event was felt as China has been a major player when it comes to global luxury sales. There are also reports that the Shanghai Fashion Week, set to kick off on March 26, has been postponed.China holds sway as the second-largest market for the global movie industry, having the world’s second-largest earnings at the box office (it is said to have generated over £6bn in revenue in 2019). The coronavirus outbreak, has led to film release cancellations. Chinese regulations prevent Chinese-produced movies from being released overseas before they are released in the region. The Jackie Chan-starrer, Vanguard, Detective Chinatown 3 and The Rescue are now postponed.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74191815,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-26159,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/coronaconcerns-wary-mumbaikars-change-travel-plans-travel-industry-faces-the-blow/articleshow/74191242.cms
19,['19/02/2020'],singer amit prakash mishra: I don’t think there is any harm in remixing evergreen songs: Singer Amit Prakash Mishra,"Amit Prakash Mishra (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav)

Tell us about your latest release ole Ole 2.0 which is a recreation of another Saif Ali Khan starrer Ole Ole.

If we go by the music industry trend, the trend for remixes/recreations has increased in the past few years, whether the songs are from Hindi music industry or Punjabi.

Amit Prakash Mishra and (inset) Saif in Ole Ole 2.0 which was sung by Amit (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav)

So are today’s songs evergreen?

So as a singer, what is your favourite genre?

Singer Amit Prakash Mishra was recently in his hometown Lucknow. “I was really tired with my back-to-back jigs and was also feeling homesick. So whenever I feel creatively blocked, I book my tickets for Lucknow, come here, have maa ke haath ka khana, meet my friends, ride my favourite bike, recharge myself and then go back,” shared the Bulleya singer in an exclusive chit chat with us. Recently given his voice for the song Ole Ole 2.0 in the Saif Ali Khan starrer Jawaani Jaaneman , Amit talked to us about the trend of remixes and recreations, comparisons between retro and the contemporary numbers and his favourite genre – ghazals...Ole Ole 2.0 is a recreation of the iconic song Ole Ole. The original track was the EDM of that era and this one has been recreated using EDM in the present time. We have changed the introduction of the hook music , plus lyrically too there are several changes in the song. So this is how it is a recreation and not a remix. Created by Tanishk Bagchi , the best part about this song was that I got to sing it with a singer like Abhijeet Bhattacharya , who was the singer of the original song. What I also loved about the song was that even I got to sing it for Saif Ali Khan. This was another very good advantage for me. Most singers, who either singer the remixes or recreate an original number are compared more because they do not get to give their voice for the same actors.Remixes/recreations are not a trend started by the music directors instead they are made because there is a demand for them by the listeners. Also, I don’t think there is any harm in remixing evergreen songs, especially if it is a good money making opportunity for the music director. It is a simple demand and supply thing. If the listeners reject remixes, composers will not make them, simple! Also, earlier, only retro songs were remixed but now if we see, there is a trend of remixing the not-so-old numbers too. Plus, for a music director the biggest challenge is to first remix an old number and then make it a hit, which thankfully most music directors are able to do today. They are able to maintain their dignity plus add value to the original track remixed. Take the case of the recent song Humma Humma, both the original and remixed ones were equally loved by everyone. And so there are so many other examples like these.Amit Prakash Mishra and (inset) Saif in Ole Ole 2.0 which was sung by Amit (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav)Yes, who says today’s songs are not evergreen, they very much are! The way we hear old numbers today, even the generation later will cherish and listen to our tracks which are popular today. Musically and lyrically we haven’t degraded but I think we have upgraded only. Our lyrics even today are at power if not more to the retro numbers.Yes, musically to an extent, I agree we do not always devote so much time on songs as earlier the time taken to release movies and songs were comparatively less than what it is today. And ek baat bataun, pehle bhi ek movie ke dus gaanon mein se chaar ya paanch gaane hi hit hote thay. So it is not as if all the songs were superhits in the 60s and the 70s.Well, surprisingly, it is ghazals. Even the last played songs on my mobile are ghazals. Though the trend for ghazals has faded these days, there are a few filmmakers and music directors who are continuing to keep the it alive. Take for example the case of Vishal Bhardwaj, he makes sure to have a ghazal in his movie which is also loved by everyone. I just wish, we could have more ghazals in movies today which also get appreciated by the listeners so that more and more music directors are encouraged to make them. I love ghazals like Phir Le Aaya from Barfi and Guncha from Main, Meri Patni Aur Woh. You know the interesting parts about ghazals, while music directors want to take risk with ghazals, filmmakers do not. Whenever I come to Lucknow, my playlist to unwind has maximum ghazals from Jagjit Singh and Pankaj Udhas.",lucknow,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74192101,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-303920,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/i-dont-think-there-is-any-harm-in-remixing-evergreen-songs-singer-amit-prakash-mishra/articleshow/74192119.cms

It was a typical big fat Punjabi wedding, and it was fun to be here,” he said.

21,['19/02/2020'],"Film frat remembers a good friend, a fine actor and a foodie","At a time when single screens were the only source of entertainment for the average Bengali, Tapas Paul, with his innocent boy-next-door looks, won hearts. His natural and easy acting in his debut film, Dadar Kirti (1980), directed by Tarun Majumdar, was loved by all. That was just the beginning of his eventful three-decade-long career as the actor went on to become a household name, courtesy his roles in superhit films like Saheb (1981), Parabat Priya (1984), Anurager Choyan (1986), Amar Bandhan (1986), Gurudakshina (1987) and so on. Today, with slick multiplexes and high production values, it may be difficult to comprehend how Tapas captured the imagination of a certain generation. But at a time when the Bengali film industry was crippled by the lack of audiences and actors who could draw the masses to theatres, Tapas Paul had emerged as a game changer.His films, high on emotional drama and with hummable songs, ran to packed theatres for weeks. And sometimes, even months. In a career spanning over three decades, the actor worked with the likes of Madhuri Dixit (Abodh), Prosenjit Chatterjee, Soumitra Chatterjee, Ranjit Mallick and Raakhee Gulzar besides proving to be a successful co-star with Satabdi Roy, Debasree Roy and Moon Moon Sen , among others. The actor passed away in Mumbai in the wee hours of Tuesday, drawing emotional responses from peers and mentors alike.‘His expressions worked wonders with the audience’I directed Tapasda in hits like Songharsho, Mangal Deep and Ajker Santan. I remember, while making Guru Dakshina, where I was the assistant director, he used to tell me: ‘Haroda, I have just 20 dialogues and a lot more reactions!’ And I’d assure him saying that his expressions would work wonders with the audience, and so it did! As an actor, he was brilliant but as a friend, he was the best. We used to party at his house on every big and small occasion — from his sister’s wedding, Sohini’s (Tapas’s daughter) birthday to New Year’s Eve. He was a big foodie and loved to cook as well. A diligent actor, he also had a great sense of humour.‘We lost a star, a brilliant actor and a great soul’We may have been competitors in the professional world, but I have lost one of my dear friends today. We were part of a healthy competition, which helped us grow as actors. His Dadar Kirti was a milestone in Bangla films. We’ve lost a star, a brilliant actor and above all, a great soul.‘ Versatile actor, loving person’One of the best actors of his time, Tapas Paul’s versatility remains unmatched. He was brilliant in each of the three films he did with me — a wrestler in Uttara, a driver in Mondo Meyer Upakhyan and a thief in Janala. I remember, when Uttara won in the best director category at the Venice International Film Festival, he started dancing on the street there. He was a simple, well-mannered and loving person, and very dear to me as an actor.‘Tapas was a director’s actor’I’ve worked with Tapas in many films including Pratik and Tumi Ele Tai. He was a director’s actor. He was an extremely friendly person who loved to eat. I suggested he lose weight so that I could cast him in Sedin Chaitramas. Sadly, when I called him after a month, he was busy gorging on topshe maachh bhaja. He laughed and said he will start losing weight from next month! Tapas loved to eat and led a happy life.‘He had a great sense of humour’Neelimai Neel, Bibar, Antartama — I’ve worked with Tapasda in several films. He had a great sense of humour and extremely cooperative on sets. A few months back, he called me to say he was looking for work and wanted to reunite with his old colleagues from the industry. I could sense the pain in his voice. He was desperate to work again and get back to a normal life.‘We lost one of the finest human beings’My first two films — Duranto Prem and Daan Pratidaan — happened to be with Tapasda, and both went on to become superhits. He was a brilliant actor and I have always kept in touch with him. He was keen to get back to acting and his old associates. We have lost a good actor and one of the finest human beings.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74192448,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-13866/74192448.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/bengali/movies/news/film-frat-remembers-a-good-friend-a-fine-actor-and-a-foodie/articleshow/74192448.cms

I was very impressed when I saw Joker’s teaser a year ago and at that time, I had decided to do this shoot.

This is why I chose to do this impersonation.”But challenging roles demand a lot more from an artiste. Talking about the challenges he faced before the photo shoot, Arun says, “I met around 10-15 make-up artistes to ace the look. Finalising the costumes, too, was a task.

27,['19/02/2020'],"Jitendra Kumar: The ‘conventional’ romance we see in films, it’s the same with this couple","He wanted to do an entertaining romantic film, and in Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan Jitendra Kumar is doing exactly that. Just instead of romancing a girl, he will be romancing Ayushmann Khurrana . In a chat with us, Jitendra says that SMZS is actually a love story between two individuals with a family bhasad. From addressing homophobia in the film to his family’s reaction to his character, the actor talks about how the film aims to normalise same-sex relationships. Excerpts:There was no calculation. I got to know that the makers were thinking of casting me in a film on a same-sex relationship, I met them and read some scenes with our writer-director Hitesh Kewalya. Hitesh could see in me what he wanted from the character. Then, I met Anand (L Rai, co-producer) sir, did one more reading and I was part of the film. I was more keen to know how the story has been written. They were sure that I was the right person to play the character but I wanted to know more about the story. When I got to know the entire story, I really enjoyed it. The most interesting part was how the topic (of same-sex relationship) was normalised visually in the film. Joh hum general ‘conventional’ romance dekhte hain between people of opposite gender, waisa hi romantic feel iss couple ke saath hai.I have a few friends who have come out to me. When I got to know their stories, I realised how badly they have been treated by their own family. Mujhe zyada pata nahi tha, par jab Section 377 pe verdict aaya I was shocked to know that having a same-sex relationship was considered a criminal activity till then. As far as the movie is concerned, jab bhi aap ek naya character karne ja rahe hote ho toh aap physically changes laate ho – the way you walk or talk. So I started watching videos of people who are open about their sexuality. While watching their interviews and talks, I also got to know about the pain they went through and I felt emotionally connected to them. Then I realised that there are many who are ‘normal’ in the way they talk and behave and I felt stupid that why was I even looking for such stereotypical things? In the script also, my character’s requirement was that he should look like any other boy.This film is about people who have homophobia. And we have no education on the topic. In our textbooks, we are only taught about reproduction with the opposite gender and we get to know about same-sex relationships only through negative information. It has been seen as taboo for long, so obviously, people won’t accept it as something natural in a day. This story is about them. I think the movies that have been made so far on the topic have reached only those who already knew about it and were evolved. This might be the movie that reaches the small towns and cities of the country. Ek raat mein kuch nahi badlega par unhe ye zaroor feel hoga ki ek natural chiz hai. It is not even a choice, we say ‘It is a choice, let them do whatever they want to’. But it is natural for them to love people of the same gender. The audience will get to hear these things a lot in the film so I think the next time, they will be a bit more accepting if someone tells them that they are homosexual. People won’t be shocked, kyunki ye movie woh shock khatam karne ka kaam kar degi.Hitesh had done that as part of the script. When we all heard the story, we felt it was like any other love story. Family ki bhasad hai par romance normal hai. There were a lot of discussions on the set, all of us would give inputs, add a particular word to a scene to normalise the topic.I think the first time the audience saw a kiss between people of opposite gender on the big screen, they would have reacted the same way. I remember the kiss in R aja Hindustani, people talked about it a lot as well. Whenever we see something new on the big screen that we are generally awkward to talk about, toh thodi batein hoti hai. This is the first, and hopefully the last time, people talk about a kissing scene between two people of the same gender.When I was finalised to play this part, they got to know that I am doing a lead role in a romantic film, but thodi different romantic film. Of course, my parents were a bit awkward and they didn’t talk about it openly for two-three days, but they were happy. Later, we discussed it and they were okay with it. But I think log ab dheere- dheere evolve ho rahe hai. Jaise meri family, jo middle-class, small town se hai , unka reaction waisa nahi tha jaise maine socha tha. But it is okay for people till the time it is being shown in a movie or is happening with someone else. The real reaction would come when it would happen in our family, but ek raat mein nahi hoga, time toh lagega.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74202898,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-345851/74202898.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/jitendra-kumar-the-conventional-romance-we-see-in-films-its-the-same-with-this-couple/articleshow/74190916.cms
28,['19/02/2020'],Coronavirus scare forces boutiques to look for alternatives to Chinese silk,"Before the summer wedding season starts, fabric wholesalers in Karol Bagh and Chandni Chowk are hoping to find alternatives to Chinese silk – the fabric that is most in demand by boutiques and fashion designers in Delhi. And this is because many traders have hit pause on importing Chinese products, including fabrics, due to the coronavirus . While boutique owners and fashion houses had already placed bulk orders for Chinese silk, traders fear that they won’t have the stock to meet this demand. “In the last 15 days, I have turned down orders worth Rs10-12 lakh because, even if it is available, I do not want to buy any Chinese silk right now. We do not want to take any risks since it is a natural fabric. It is very likely that the fabric won’t even be available with wholesalers soon as consignments are not reaching here. Given that there are travel restrictions, many traders who used to supply fabrics to retail stores and fashion designers can’t visit their suppliers in China,” says Navesh Goyal, a wholesaler based in Noida, who supplies fabrics imported from China across NCR.Wholesalers say that crepe, georgette, tulle, chiffon and net, used by major clothing retail chains, fashion designers and boutiques, come from China as well. Chinese fabric is preferred by retailers and designers because of its quality and price. “We put stock worth Rs40-50 lakh on hold from China and have already informed our clients that we might not meet their demands. Since wedding orders have already been placed, they can’t even cancel the orders now. Some are already looking at alternatives, others have no option but to compromise on quality and use whatever is available,” says Mansi Bajaj, a wholesaler from Karol Bagh, who supplies different varieties of silk to over 25 fashion designers and 40 retail brands in Delhi and other cities.Another wholesaler from Karol Bagh adds that summer wedding collections mostly use net, organza, chiffon and georgette. “While some variants of silk (especially those used in winter collections) are easily available in India, their price is slightly higher. But those specialising in chiffon and georgette collections rely heavily on imports from China. If travel restrictions are not lifted within a month or so, consumers will not be able to get the desired quality of silk,” he tells us.“In just the last 15-20 days, we lost 25% business from the summer wedding season as we have told our clients that it is risky to use silk from China right now. Our dealers are checking if we can get the same quality silk from Surat, but getting the quantity that we need within a few days will be very tough,” says Nidhi Agarwal, who is the owner of an apparel outlet in Lajpat Nagar and runs her wholesale business from Chandni Chowk.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74190782,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-294398/74190782.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/fashion/designers/coronavirus-scare-forces-boutiques-to-look-for-alternatives-to-chinese-silk/articleshow/74190039.cms

30,['19/02/2020'],"If speaking against BJP makes me anti-national, I don't mind being called one, says Mehbooba’s daughter","This story is from February 19, 2020

NEW DELHI: Iltija Mufti, daughter of former J&K chief minister Mehbooba Mufti, dared the government to arrest her for using social media as she said like many Kashmiris she will go back to the Valley and use the social media through VPN despite the ban.

Speaking at Indian Women ’s Press Corps on Tuesday, Iltija criticised the central government’s decision to scrap Article 370 and the house arrest of leading politicians from the former state, including her mother and former CM Omar Abdullah of the National Conference .

She said Abdullah and her mother acted as a buffer in Kashmir which the government has removed by abrogating Article 370. She said people of Kashmir are angry with the government and also like many people she has lost faith in the Indian judicial system.

""I think the government should be sued, when British left India, they bled us dry. We should demand compensation. We have lost Rs 18,000 crore,"" she said, and added that she wouldn’t mind approaching the International Court of Justice .

Though she said she is not meant for politics and her mother keeps a check on what she speaks, Iltija made a strong political pitch saying that when BJP struck an alliance with the PDP and formed the government in J&K how can the same party hold her mother in detention for being a security threat. “If the party feels she is anti-national why did they enter into an alliance with her party in 2014. Was the BJP sleeping then?"" she asked.

""If speaking against the BJP makes me anti-national, I don't mind being called one,"" she said, and added that people in Jammu are also unhappy with the nullification of Article 370. She claimed that if elections are held in Jammu today, the saffron party will be wiped out. She said Article 370 was Kashmir’s emotional connect with the rest of India.

""I am talking not just as Mehbooba Mufti''s daughter, but also as an anguished Kashmiri. We all know what has been happening since Article 370 was abrogated,” she said.

The clampdown has had a huge cost and J&K is grappling with an economic, psychological and emotional crisis, she added. She also accused the Narendra Modi government of ""spreading misinformation"" about the condition of Kashmiris.

""I really think the government is indulging in propaganda and spreading misinformation. The rest of the country and the envoys who visited Kashmir were told that we enjoy equal rights but in reality you can''t even use VPN in Kashmir right now.

""I have respect for the PM as everybody else should. But I feel very sad that he is being misled or he is wilfully misleading the country. What rights do Kashmiris have right now?"" she asked.

31,['19/02/2020'],"For Great Indian Bustard numbers to soar, power lines must go underground: SC","NEW DELHI: Determined to shore up the plummeting numbers of critically endangered Great Indian Bustard and its smaller cousin Lesser Florican, the Supreme Court on Tuesday said overhead power transmission lines in the Desert National Park in Rajasthan’s Jaisalmer district and surrounding areas must go underground.The population of Great Indian Bustard, a tall bird with a wingspan of over two metres, declined from an estimated 1,260 in 1969 to around 150 in 2018. Lesser Florican, the smallest bird in the bustard family also known as ‘Likh’ or ‘Kharmore’, followed the same pattern with its numbers declining from 3,530 in 1999 to less than 700 in 2018, PIL petitioner and wildlife expert M K Ranjitsinh said.Around 15% of the two endangered species die every year because of collision with overhead power transmission lines in their flight path, a bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices B R Gavai and Surya Kant was told.“The best solution is to make overground power transmission lines go underground,” said the CJI, who was in no mood to allow more time to additional solicitor general Atmaram Nadkarni and Rajasthan’s additional advocate general Manish Singhvi to chalk out a strategy. He paid no heed to Nadkarni’s plea to await a report from officials of the ministry of environment and forests, who he said were in Jaisalmer.“It is well known that Great Indian Bustard is a large bird. It finds difficulty in manoeuvring easily around transmission lines. One of the solutions is to remove overhead transmission lines and lay them underground in the areas which are their habitat. Singhvi seeks time to take instruction from the Rajasthan government and tell the court the manner in which the power transmission lines can be laid underground,” the bench said and sought the response in two weeks.The SC on July 15 last year had taken serious note after senior advocate Shyam Divan raised alarm on behalf of Ranjitsinh and constituted a committee comprising the director of Bombay Natural History Society, ex-BNHS director Asad Rahmani and chief conservator of forests in Uttarakhand Dhananjai Mohan to study the problem and submit a report.On Tuesday, the SC accepted advocate Sugandha Yadav’s request for inclusion of Wildlife Institute of India scientist Sutirtha Dutta , director of Andhra Pradesh Biodiversity Board Thulsi Rao and lecturer in a Karnataka government college Samad Kottur in the expert panel on arresting the declining numbers of Great Indian Bustard and Lesser Florican.Ranjitsinh, along with other petitioners — Rajasthan-based wildlife activist Peera Ram Vishnoi, Gujarat-based wildlife activist Bapat Navinchandra Nanalal, Karnataka-based conservationist Edward Santosh Martin and Corbett Foundation — said both birds were protected under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 but despite highest level of protection under law, the birds faced the threat of imminent extinction.They blamed mortality caused by collision with power transmission lines and wind turbines, depletion of grasslands, hunting, development of mines and human habitation in and around their habitats and ingestion of pesticides as major reasons for fast depletion of their numbers.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74199880,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-120151,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/for-great-indian-bustard-numbers-to-soar-power-lines-must-go-underground-sc/articleshow/74199890.cms
32,['19/02/2020'],What is a tree’s value? SC to ask economists and environmentalists,"This story is from February 19, 2020

NEW DELHI: Industrial houses will soon be wary of putting up projects in places which require clearing of trees with the Supreme Court remaining firm on Tuesday on calculating the ‘real value’ of a tree that would include cost estimation of volume of oxygen it would have emitted into the atmosphere in its lifetime.

“We need economists to work with environmentalists to calculate the real value of trees,” a bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices B R Gavai and Surya Kant said while suggesting to the West Bengal government that it may have to realign flyover projects to avoid cutting of trees. The Bengal government, through senior advocate A M Singhvi, had said the authorities had decided to plant five times the number of trees felled for the flyovers which had become essential to avoid accidents.

The CJI said, “You may plant a tree but it is difficult to compensate the death of an existing tree. It may be a little more expensive to realign flyovers and any other project, for that matter, than cutting trees. If one takes a holistic view, it will actually be not expensive if the true value of trees, taking into account the price of oxygen they will emit in their lifetime, is calculated.

“This is the third case I am hearing involving cutting down of trees. Others were the Mumbai Metro and the Mumbai coastal road cases. Address us on the issue of calculating the true value of a tree. We will see how we can lay down some principle on valuation of trees.”

Appearing for the Association for Protection of Democratic Rights, which has challenged felling of trees in West Bengal’s flyover project, advocate Prashant Bhushan said he had faced a similar question while arguing a PIL against limestone mining in the Doon valley. “There were several limestone aquifers. Limestones absorb rain water and gradually release them, helping preservation of water. How does one calculate the value of an aquifer? Apart from emitting priceless oxygen for years, trees are also important aquifers,” he said.

Inclusion of price of oxygen emitted over their lifetime in the valuation of trees was first mooted by the CJI in the case relating to the Bengal flyover project.

The NGO has challenged a Calcutta HC decision permitting the Bengal government to cut down 356 trees for construction of five railway overbridges (ROBs) at Kazipara , Ashok Nagar , Habra-I, Habra-II and Bongaon and expansion of NH-112, or Jessore Road .

The CJI had asked, “Why do authorities, while computing environmental compensation, not take into account price of volume of oxygen it will release into the atmosphere in its lifetime? Look at the amount of oxygen generated by a single tree in its lifetime. Value of oxygen generated by a tree in its lifetime should be taken into account in determining damage to environment caused by its felling.”

33,['19/02/2020'],"Some govts file appeal to seek ‘certificate of dismissal’, says SC","This story is from February 19, 2020

NEW DELHI: The Law Commission’s 30-year-old report on the need to curb the bureaucratic tendency to indulge in mindless litigation and the Centre’s repeated requests to chief ministers to stop filing unnecessary appeals in higher courts appear to have fallen on deaf ears with governments hogging the lion’s share of over 44 lakh cases pending in the Supreme Court and high courts.

An SC bench of Justices Sanjay K Kaul and K M Joseph berated the Odisha government on Monday for filing an appeal after a delay of more than 400 days and that too against the concurrent ‘not guilty’ finding with regard to an engineer returned by a departmental inquiry committee, the administrative tribunal and the HC.

The state law department had opined against filing an appeal in the HC, and later in the SC, and advised accepting the tribunal’s decision but the Odisha government nevertheless went ahead. Interestingly, the water resources department accepted the tribunal’s order on the law department’s advice and dropped disciplinary proceedings against the engineer, P K Swain .

When the appeal against the HC order upholding the tribunal’s decision came up for hearing in the SC, the bench said, “It does appear to us that these are cases only brought to this court to obtain a ‘certificate of dismissal’.” The bench dismissed the appeal. This one line conveyed how bureaucratic vindictiveness is putting paid to efforts to reduce mindless litigation at the cost of the exchequer.

The Law Commission, in its 126th report on May 12, 1988, had said, “Multiplicity of litigation is not a matter of concern merely for judiciary and executive. That would be a narrow view of the matter. It is the concern of the judiciary because its dockets have become unmanageable. It is equally the concern of the executive because wasteful expenditure and avoidable misuse of time of officers coupled with the tendency to avoid taking decisions deserves to be curbed. But the third limb of the constitutional democracy, namely legislature, must have equal say in this matter.”

It had further said, “Parliamentary committee can every year seek detailed information on expenses incurred on litigation by government, public sector undertakings and departments and instrumentalities of the government, and take upon itself the inquisition of any particular litigation which was avoidable and yet resorted to. It can inquire whether appeals are merely being preferred for extraneous and irrelevant considerations.”

In October 2016, the PM had said, “The judiciary spends its maximum time on us... the government (because of litigation).” In April 2017, law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had written to all Union ministries and chief ministers highlighting the need to address the rising litigation burden on the state. But some state bureaucrats do not pay heed to the advice.

NEW DELHI: Nine working groups set up by EC to review various facets of general 2019 and suggest improvements for future polls, submitted their draft recommendations to the Election Commission on Tuesday.

The recommendations, based on the lessons learnt from polls to the Lok Sabha and four state assemblies held last year, will be studied by the commission and after due consideration and acceptance, these will be placed in the public domain for eliciting the view of all the stakeholders.

The commission had in June last year formed nine working groups comprising senior EC officials and state chief electoral officers to assess various facets of election process including electoral roll issues, polling station management, model code of conduct issues, voting processes & materials inventory, capacity building, IT applications, expenditure management, SVEEP and media interface as also electoral reforms.

The members of the working groups met at a two-day conference here to deliberate on the learnings from general election 2019. In his message to the gathering, chief election commissioner Sunil Arora complemented the officers for their pithy and cogent recommendations. He said that the commission would look into the recommendations of the working groups and put them in the public domain.

Election commissioner Ashok Lavasa advised the officers to make implementable recommendations. Election commissioner Sushil Chandra said the ultimate aim of the exercise should be to make the registration and voting experience pleasant for the voters. He said that while the groups have laboured to identify the existing gaps and way forward in electoral processes, CEOs should take due help of technology to streamline procedures for future.

PUNE: The ensuing summer could turn out be a scorcher for most parts of the country. The India Meteorological Department ’s forecast for March and April has indicated an “enhanced probability” of above-normal temperatures in several parts of India — central, western and southern regions.

In April, the mean temperature is likely to be higher than normal by 1-1.5°C in Delhi, UP, Haryana, Chandigarh, Rajasthan, MP and most of Maharashtra. February has already turned out to be warm this winter for Maharashtra and the southern states, and the heat quotient is expected to spike further in the next two months. The monthly average temperature during March and April could be 1-1.5°C above normal in many parts of the country, especially central India.

Forecasts show that parts of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan and the south peninsular states like Karnataka , Andhra and Tamil Nadu , among others, could see average temperatures higher than normal by around 0.5-1°C in March.

April is likely to bring in higher mean temperature for most parts of the northwest and central India.

The IMD’s monsoon mission climate forecast system is a modified version of the state-of-the-art “coupled climate” model adopted from the US’s National Centre for Environmental Prediction and has been implemented to the high-performance computing system at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology , Pune.

An IMD official told TOI that all forecasts show the signature of the global-warming trend associated with greenhouse emissions. “As of now, large-scale climatic factors like El Nino (which tend to make temperatures warmer than normal) are not present. But since we had El Niño conditions up to June last year, that could also impact summer temperatures in the current year, making them higher than normal,” the official said. This possibility has been backed by a past study, he added.

As per a meteorological department study conducted in 2012, the frequency, persistency and area coverage of heat waves or severe heat wave days were found to be more than average during years succeeding El Niño years. Using information from 103 stations from the Indian mainland during the hot weather season (March to July) for 50 years (1961-2010), the study said that during nine of the 11 El Niño+1 (years succeeding El Niño event) years, all India heat wave days were above its climatological value.

Last year, El Niño conditions continued from February till June. In July, El Niño conditions turned into ENSO-neutral conditions (neither an El Niño nor La Niña) and it continued thereafter. Currently, ENSO neutral conditions are prevailing over the Pacific Ocean.

El Niño and La Niña are Spanish for “little boy” and “little girl”, respectively. El Niño is a phenomenon of anomalous warming of the central and east equatorial Pacific Ocean, while La Niña is just the opposite phase of El Niño and is associated with anomalous cooling over the equatorial Pacific Ocean.

But not for the 132 Indian crew members who have been doggedly at their stations through this period.They will not only be the last people to step off the boat, because they will continue to serve the other passengers but their quarantine will start after the last passenger has left the ship. This basically means they will have to be quarantined for an extra 14 days before they can be cleared for travel back to India. Of the 132, six have already tested positive for the virus and have been moved to hospitals.As of Tuesday, 542 cases of the virus had been diagnosed on the ship. Japan’s move of quarantining all the passengers on the cruise liner basically meant that the ship became like a petri dish for the deadly coronavirus . In fact, if the Diamond Princess had been a country, it would have had the highest number of infected people after China. Japan is coming in for criticism for its quarantine moves for the cruise ship, because its not clear how the virus has infected so many despite the quarantine.The six Indian passengers along with all the others, will be tested in batches starting Wednesday, before being allowed out. There is a fear that if the virus has been raging on the ship regardless of the quarantine, there are chances that many passengers could have contracted the virus in the past few days.Official sources said, the company that owns the cruise liner, has offered to pay the medical bills and arrange for the transport of the crew back to India. The US conducted one evacuation over the weekend: two planes carried 328 people to military bases in California and Texas, including 14 who tested positive for coronavirus.Meanwhile, almost 1,400 passengers of another cruise ship Westerdam, which docked in Sihanoukville Cambodia after five nations refused to allow it to dock, left for their respective countries, but a huge question arose, when one American passenger among them tested positive for the virus.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74200074,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-199587,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/diamond-princess-quarantine-ends-but-not-for-indian-crew/articleshow/74200076.cms
38,['19/02/2020'],"Thousands cured, but stuck in mental asylums for years","This story is from February 19, 2020

Thousands of people who have been cured of mental illness are being “illegally detained” in 43 mental hospitals across 24 states as only two states have constituted mental health review boards (MHRB). These are meant to review all cases of people who have been held in an institution for 30 days. According to the report of a Task Force constituted by the health ministry, over 36% of patients in mental hospitals have been there for one year or more.

Advocate Gaurav Kumar Bansal , who has filed a public interest petition on the issue in the Supreme Court, pointed out that ever since the Mental Healthcare Act of 2017 was enacted, the state is supposed to provide services that will help integrate those who come out of these hospitals in society. “Holding them indefinitely in the hospital amounts to illegal detention,” said Bansal seeking the court’s intervention to ‘free’ these patients and order states to provide them services to help integrate them in society.

In February 2017, the Supreme Court had told the central government that it could not allow people to be kept in mental asylums or nursing homes after they are fully cured. “They have to be brought back to civil society. You will have to frame a policy,” said the bench. The government had sought time to frame guidelines for the rehabilitation of mentally ill persons.

However, during the hearing of the current petition the court was informed that despite the centre sending more than half a dozen reminders to the states, only two states (Sikkim and Tripura ) have functional mental health review boards. Most haven’t framed regulations for the implementation of the Act and only 10 have notified State Mental Health Authorities and appointed all the members to complete the authority. Several are in the process of doing so.

“The Act was passed in May 2017, but it was notified only in 2018 to give governments time to set up structures. It is two and a half years since the Act came into force and there is no sign of anything happening. If MHRBs, which mandatorily include civil society, a person with mental illness and/or caregivers, had been constituted, they would have insisted on community rehabilitation plans for the patients who didn’t need hospitalization. Under what provision are thousands of patients being kept in hospitals? For all practical purposes, they are being illegally detained and it is a civil rights issue,” said a senior psychiatrist involved in rehabilitation of persons with mental illness.

Since the Task Force report was submitted in 2018, 191 people have been moved out from hospitals, said Vandana Gopikumar of Banyan, an organisation that works on supporting persons with mental illness. Banyan was also part of the task force. “Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Uttarakhand have started the process of putting community-based support structures in place. However, Maharashtra , instead of moving them out to an inclusive set up, put them in beggars’ homes, which is worse. We don’t want such knee-jerk reactions and surface-level response. We need district-level mental health programmes which can give them ongoing care and track their progress,” said Gopikumar. She added that all the support services would be less expensive than keeping them in hospitals. It also frees up hospital space for those who need it.

NEW DELHI: Use of almost all illegal softwares have been weeded out and more Tatkal tickets will be available for passengers for longer now, Railway Protection Force (RPF) director general Arun Kumar said on Tuesday. So far 60 persons have been arrested who were involved in illegal e-ticketing racket.

""We carried out surveillance to identify the players and have arrested almost all the key players. Meanwhile, corrective measures have been taken improve our system and now none can interfere. All the players in illegal software business for booking e-tickets have informed their clients that they have stopped all these activities and they have also warned others from doing so saying RPF is keeping an eye on everyone,"" the RPF chief told reporters.

He added that each major player was making about Rs 10-15 crore annually from this illegal business. Kumar said illegal softwares such as 'ANMS', 'MAC' and 'Jaguar' would bypass the IRCTC's login captcha, booking captcha and bank OTP to generate tickets, while a genuine user has to go through all these processes.

Officials involved in the investigation said that while the booking process for a general user usually takes around 2.55 minutes those using these softwares could do it in just 1.48 minutes. Hence, common users could hardly get any confirmed ticket.

RPF officials cited that now IRCTC's ticket booking section shows a jump in the availability of Tatkal tickets across the board. For example, while on October 26, 2019, Tatkal tickets were available for two minutes for the Magadh Express , on February 10, these were available for over 10 hours since the bookings opened on February 9, 2020.

RPF chief said seven persons were recently arrested including a Kolkata-based mastermind who was in touch with Bangladesh-based terror outfit Jammat-Ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JUMB).

40,['19/02/2020'],BJP seizes upon ex-cop Maria’s book to attack Congress,"This story is from February 19, 2020

NEW DELHI/HYDERABAD: Seizing upon the confirmation from former Mumbai Police commissioner Rakesh Maria about ISI’s plot to pass off Ajmal Kasab and other 26/11 attackers as Hindus, top BJP functionaries, including Union minister Piyush Goyal and general secretary Ram Madhav on Tuesday said Congress and terror outfits like LeT had an identical agenda behind coining the “Hindu terror” term.

BJP members alleged that the term was coined at the behest of former home minister P Chidambaram , whose bid in this direction had helped Pakistan-based terror outfits, which tried to disguise Kasab as a Hindu and the attack on Mumbai as the handiwork of “Hindu terrorists”.

Claiming that terror had no religion, Goyal accused the UPA and the Congress party of raising the ""bogey of Hindu terror"" in the country.

While referring to excerpts from Maria's book on 26/11 that Kasab would have died as Samir Dinesh Chaudhari ""with a red thread tied around his wrist"" had LeT succeeded in its plan, Goyal said, ""Why is Mariaji speaking these things now? He should have said that when he was police commissioner. According to service rules, if some information is with senior police officers, they should take action on it.""

Kasab, a Pakistani national, was part of the group of terrorists which attacked Mumbai on November 26, 2008. He was caught alive and later hanged.

""UPA and Congress conspired... at that time we saw another example of lies when they tried to raise the false bogey of Hindu terror. I condemn Congress and others who tried to mislead the nation over Hindu terror, for which they had to face consequences in 2014 and 2019. Terror has no religion. A terrorist is a terrorist,"" Goyal added.

Ram Madhav said the ISI plan did not succeed but there was an attempt by some Congress members to make the conspiracy successful. “Some intellectuals had tried to link the Mumbai attack with RSS as they had the support of Congress leaders. The book has confirmed that it was an ISI conspiracy, which was supported by so-called intellectuals,” he added.

BJP spokesperson GVL Narasimha Rao said the term “Hindu terror” was coined as a joint venture by Congress and LeT. “Congress was responsible for floating Hindu terror tag to defame the Hindu community and Pakistani terror outfits too have worked on a similar plan, which shows that the two have identical thinking and are dangerous for the country at large,” he said.

41,['19/02/2020'],"Anti-CAA stir: Cops tried to cover up excesses, says HC","This story is from February 19, 2020

BENGALURU: The Karnataka high court on Tuesday observed that “over-zealousness” of Mangaluru city police in handling anti-CAA protests was evident from the fact that they registered FIRs under IPC Section 307 (attempt to murder) against persons they themselves had killed in firing. Two persons were killed in police firing in Mangaluru when violence allegedly erupted during anti-CAA protest on December 19, 2019.

The court noted that the accused involved in the alleged violence appear to have been identified on the basis of their affiliation with Popular Front of India (PFI) and them being members of the Muslim community. The court also pointed out that failure to register FIRs against police officers on the basis of complaints made by victims shows that a deliberate attempt was under way to cover up police excesses by whimsically implicating innocent persons.

Justice John Michael Cunha made this observation while granting bail to 21 people arrested after the violence. The petitioners were directed to furnish a bail bond for Rs 1 lakh each and cooperate in the trial.

“In the wake of counter-allegations made against the police and in the backdrop of failure of police to register the FIRs based on complaints lodged by the victims, the possibility of false and mistaken implication cannot be ruled out,” the judge observed in his order.

The judge said there was a hint in the prohibitory orders notification about impending protest against CAA by Muslim youths on December 19, 2019, and the protest could not be termed unlawful within Section 141 of the Criminal Procedure Code.

Justice Cunha, who also perused materials furnished by the prosecution, pointed out that contrary to the assertions, no material was produced before the court showing the presence at the spot of any one of the petitioners with deadly weapons and the allegation that the Muslim crowd of 1,500– 2,000 was armed with weapons like stones, soda bottles and glass pieces is an omnibus allegation.

“It would be travesty of justice to deny bail to the petitioners and sacrifice their liberties to the mercy of the district administration and the police. The records indicate that deliberate attempt has been made to trump up evidence and to deprive the liberties of the petitioners by fabricating evidence,” the judge further observed while granting bail to Mohammed Ashiq and 20 others.

The petitioners had complained they have been falsely implicated in the case and that not a single case based on the complaints made by the injured and relatives of the dead persons against police personnel has been registered.

42,['19/02/2020'],Aadhaar Voter ID linking: Govt to give Election Commission legal power to link Aadhaar and voter ID,"This story is from February 19, 2020

NEW DELHI: The government has moved to amend the Aadhaar Act to legally empower the Election Commission to link the unique identification number with the electoral roll, which would remove bogus and duplicate entries and pave the way for giving “remote” voting rights to migrant voters.

The law ministry is working on a note to be put up before the Union Cabinet for the decision which, apart from sanitising the electoral roll, will save migrants from what amounts to “disenfranchisement” by changing the current practice where they can vote only if they are in the constituency where they are registered as voters.

The ministry conveyed this to the Election Commission at a meeting on Tuesday to discuss electoral reforms.

At the meeting between top EC functionaries and the law secretary, chief election commissioner Sunil Arora stressed on the need for the law ministry to fast-track implementation of reforms proposed by the poll panel as far back as 2004-05 and also hold regular discussions with the EC to review progress. Law secretary Narayan Raju assured the poll panel that the ministry was examining the 40 electoral reforms proposed by the EC and that each was at a different stage of discussion.

On seeding of the electoral photo identity card (EPIC) with the 12-digit Aadhaar number, the law secretary, according to EC sources, said the government was favourably inclined and a Cabinet note would be moved soon to amend the Aadhaar Act.

EC officials said Aadhaar-EPIC linkage will help realise the commission’s plan to work towards secure, possibly electronic, voting to help migrant voters — including domestic workers, migrant labourers etc — exercise their franchise. “Their identification having been adequately verified, the commission can explore technology that will let them vote from a remote location guarded by the EC,” an officer said.

The EC had in 2015 taken up linking of voter card and Aadhaar number as part of its National Electoral Roll Purification and Authentication Programme. Around 32 crore Aadhaar numbers were seeded by the time the EC decided to abandon the programme in view of the Supreme Court judgment restricting the use of Aadhaar.

Following the SC judgment last year allowing mandatory collection of Aadhaar with due amendment in the Aadhaar Act, the EC wrote to the law ministry in August seeking a suitable amendment to enable linking of EPIC with UID . The law ministry had in-principle agreed and a Cabinet note is being prepared.

Other reforms which were on the table on Tuesday include the proposal to allow more than one cutoff date for enrolment of a voter after attaining adulthood, making false affidavit an electoral offence/corrupt practice that would attract disqualification, covering print media and social media intermediaries under Section 126 of the RP Act 1951 (48-hour silence period), making service voter facility for spouses gender-neutral, and amendment in the contributions form.

43,['19/02/2020'],Jobs Data: Government data shows fall in job creation by schemes,"This story is from February 19, 2020

(Representative image)

NEW DELHI: Some of the flagship employment generation and placement schemes, such as the Prime Minister’s Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP) and Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana-National Urban Livelihoods Mission, are expected to see a sharp decline in job creation during the current fiscal, according to data tabled in Parliament.

Details provided by the labour & employment ministry states that the number of jobs generated under PMEGP plummeted from 5.87 lakh in 2018-19 to 2.57 lakh in 2019-20 (until December 31, 2019). The fall is less sharp compared to 2017-18 when the number of persons who benefited was 3.87 lakh. The numbers were 4 lakh for 2016-17 and 3.23 lakh for 2015-16.

PMEGP is a credit-linked subsidy programme run by the ministry of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) with Khadi and Village Industries Commission as the nodal agency for implementing the programme at the national level.

The 2019-20 PMEGP figures are the lowest since the Modi government assumed office in 2014. The sharpest decline in job generation is in Assam — from 29,896 in 2018-19 to 7,576 in 2019-20 — and in Jammu & Kashmir, from 60,232 to 20,336. Job generation shrank by more than half in Maharashtra (including Dadra and Nagar Haveli) from 45,136 in 2018-19 to 20,032 this year and in Odisha from 24,560 to 9,136.

Government data also pointed to a sharp decline in placement of people skilled under the DAY-NULM, where placements dropped from 1.78 lakh in 2018-19 to 44,066 in the current fiscal, according to data until January 27, 2020. As with PMEG, 2018-19 saw a higher number than 2017-18 (1,15,416) and 2016-17 (1,51,901).

The DAY-NULM is a government-run poverty reduction scheme which aims to give self-employment and skilled wage employment opportunities to the urban poor. The drop was most drastic in states like Gujarat, where placements fell from 13,213 to 2,727 until January 27, 2020, and Madhya Pradesh, from 32,501 in 2018-19 to 2,784 in the current fiscal.

The government data on the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), started by the Congress-led UPA government, shows a slowdown in 2019-20 with person-days generated falling from 26,796 in 2018-19 to 20,577, the lowest since 2015-16. Again, the fall is less drastic compared to person-days generated in 2017-18 (23,373) and 2016-17 (23,565).

The pace of skilling and placements under the Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana also declined, with the number of people trained falling from 2.4 lakh to 1.74 lakh, and the number getting jobs declining from 1.35 lakh in 2018-19 to 1.10 lakh this year. Interestingly here too 2018-19 stands out as a high performing year.

Labour & employment minister Santosh Gangwar, in response to a question by BJP MP Mahendra Solanki, said the government took various measures to generate employment, which included encouraging the private sector, fast-tracking various projects involving substantial investment and increasing public expenditure on schemes like PMEGP, MGNREGS, DDU-GKY, and DAY-NULM.

45,['19/02/2020'],‘Anti-India acts got Debbie Abrahams' visa cancelled’,"This story is from February 19, 2020

NEW DELHI: The government confirmed on Tuesday that British Labour Party MP Debbie Abrahams did not hold a valid visa to enter India as the one issued to her was cancelled because of her involvement in anti-India activities.

Abrahams was detained at Delhi airport and deported to Dubai on Monday. Official sources asserted that issuance and rejection of visas was the sovereign right of any country and said rejection of the e-business visa was intimated to her on February 14, implying that the British lawmaker travelled to India despite knowing that her papers had been rescinded.

Sources also pointed out that a business visa did not allow the MP to meet friends and family which Abrahams had said was her purpose of visting India. “This is not permitted as per rules and a separate visa request has to be made,” an official said.

It marked a rare occasion when such a step was taken against an elected lawmaker of a “partner” country.

Interestingly, the government’s decision to deport the British lawmaker, who has been deeply critical of the Modi government’s decision to abrogate Jammu and Kashmir’s special status, found the strong support of Congress MP Abhishek Singhvi . “The deportation of Debbie Abrahams by India was indeed necessary as she is not just an MP but a Pakistan proxy known for her clasp with the Pakistani government and the ISI. Every attempt that tries to attack India's sovereignty must be thwarted,” he tweeted.

His views, however, contrasted with those of his party colleague and fellow MP Shashi Tharoor who criticised the deportation. “If things are fine in Kashmir, should not the government encourage critics to witness the situation themselves to put their fears to rest? Instead of conducting tours of pliant MEPs and polite ambassadors alone, surely the head of a parliamentary group on the subject is worth cultivating,” the Kerala MP tweeted.

Abrahams is chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Kashmir and has been a trenchant critic of the Modi government’s policies on Kashmir. “Again, for clarity, I am pro-human rights and social justice. I will always speak up for people who are not afforded these rights, including Kashmiris on both sides of the Line of Control,” she said amid a social media row over the issue.

However, the Abrahams-led parliamentary group’s constitution shows that most members are of Pakistani or PoK origin and all of them have been consistently critical of India. Not one member of the group is of Indian heritage, while its vice-president, Bradford East MP Imran Hussain, a British Pakistani, has used inflammatory language for India for years.

Abrahams, who was in Pakistan on Tuesday where she spoke against Indian “abuses” in Kashmir, had said she was travelling to India on a valid e-visa which was revoked without explanation.

“Mission has confirmed from Indian immigration authorities that Debbie Abrahams did not hold a valid visa,” the Indian high commission in London said in a statement on Twitter. “Further, there is no provision for visa on arrival for UK nationals. She was accordingly requested to return,” the statement said. The last was a response to Abrahams’s contention that she should have been given a visa on arrival.

The UK foreign office said she was offered consular assistance and is seeking information on the circumstances of her entry being denied. “We are in contact with Indian authorities, and the minister for South Asia and the Commonwealth has spoken with the Indian high commissioner to establish why the individual concerned was denied entry to India,” a spokesperson for the foreign and commonwealth office said.

Congress and other opposition parties have not commented on the deportation which triggered strong activity on social media, possibly because it involves the Centre’s action against a foreign lawmaker reportedly on the grounds of her critical comments on Kashmir. But domestically, the opposition has been questioning the Centre on Kashmir issue and its claims of normalcy there.

Kochi: With many districts experiencing soaring temperatures for the past couple of weeks, experts warn that summer appears to have set in early in the state. They say that winter has almost skipped Kerala except in places like Munnar, where temperatures have been in the low single digits for many days.

“Summer has advanced in Kerala this year. We have our summer from March to May but the weather has remained dry as we have not had any pre-summer rains. If this rise in temperature continues, the state may experience evening thunderstorms. Normally, Kerala has thunderstorms from end of March when the ocean starts warming and sea surface temperatures begin to rise,” said K Mohan Kumar, senior atmospheric scientist and honorary director of Advanced Centre for Atmospheric Radar Research, Cochin University of Science and Technology ( Cusat ).

He said that normally summer intensifies during the equinox when the sun crosses the equator around March 21. “But suddenly all our seasons seem to be getting extreme. The effects of climate change are getting apparent.

People will have to adjust their daily habits to adjust to the fluctuating temperatures of the last few days as the sudden fall and rise in temperatures can have a bearing on health.

This will be felt through a feeling of extreme fatigue and tiredness just after a few minutes out in the sun even during non-peak hours. The Kerala state disaster management authority (KSDMA) has already issued alerts that people should avoid direct exposure to sun rays between 11am and 3pm.

Health experts recommend that people start carrying water bottles and keep drinking water to stay hydrated. People moving from a cooler environment to sudden heat under the sun will feel the fatigue immediately. “It is advised to wear light or full white clothes to avoid exposure to sun which could lead to conditions like heat exhaustion or sun burns which can be addressed at home. But in case of heat stroke, medical attention is advised,’ said Dr Amar Fettle, nodal officer, infectious diseases, health department.

He said that drinking contaminated water could lead to diseases like hepatitis-A, typhoid. It is better to drink boiled water and avoid ice as it is a source of contamination.

The food safety department has already begun checking the hotels and restaurants for hygiene and safety. Officials said that they were looking for potential sources of mosquito breeding. ‘Our mobile laboratories are going to all panchayats to test water quality. Under the ‘Healthy Kerala’ programme of the Ardram project, we are training and creating awareness among hotel staff also on hygienic practices,” said Moni M, joint food safety commissioner.

A lot of adjustments can be made in the food and liquid intake to address the body’s needs during the summer season. “Liquid intake in the form of water, fresh juices, tender coconut water or lime juice is best. It is best to go vegetarian as fruits and vegetables contain lot of anti-oxidants. Among the non-vegetarian foods, fish is okay but meat can be avoided,” said Dr Mumtaz Ismail, nutritionist and state president of Association for evidence-based dietetics.

She said that spicy masalas, red chilies, fried items, tamarind, chocolate and alcohol should be avoided as these put a lot of stress on the heart and small intestine during summers.

(From top) Stills from ‘Gurudakshina’, ‘Saheb’& ‘Dadar Kirti’

KOLKATA: Tapas Paul , one of the leading stars who dominated post-Uttam Kumar Tollywood in the 1980s and the 1990s, passed away after a cardiac arrest at a Bandra hospital early on Tuesday. He was 61.Paul, along with first Chiranjeet and then Prosenjit, formed a formidable troika who helped Tollywood survive after Uttam Kumar’s death in July 1980. He acted in over 400 Bengali films, debuting with the smash hit ‘Dadar Kirti’ and then going on to deliver commercial successes like ‘Saheb’, ‘Anurager Chhoya’, ‘Bhalobasha Bhalobasha’, ‘Parabat Priya’ and ‘Gurudakshina’. He also acted in a handful of Hindi films, including ‘Abodh’, where he was paired with Madhuri Dixit.Health issues had been plaguing Paul and he had needed medical attention on multiple occasions in the recent past. During his recent trip to Mumbai, he had to be hospitalized and needed ventilation. Though he had improved on Monday morning, his condition worsened later in the day and he succumbed to cardiac arrest at 3.40am on Tuesday.Paul, who is survived by wife Nandini and daughter Sohini, was once a household name courtesy of being featured in hit songs, like ‘Ami je ke tomar tumi taa bujhe nao’ and ‘E amar gurudakshina’. His Filmfare-winning ‘Saheb’ was remade in Hindi with Anil Kapoor as the lead.According to Chiranjeet, Paul’s debut in ‘Dadar Kirti’ gave him a taste of “superstardom”. “That didn’t happen either with me or Bumba (Prosenjit). No one had such a romantic look and an infectious smile. He performed without thinking much and fit the role in ‘Dadar Kirti’ like a pair of gloves,” Chiranjeet analyzed.‘What made him stand out among his peers was his knack for breaking free of his star image to play character roles. Dedication to the craft was his hallmark,” said Buddhadeb Dasgupta, remembering how Paul had readily agreed to train in wrestling for three months before shooting for ‘Uttara’ in 2000.“Both Prosenjit and Tapas had met me to play wrestlers in ‘Uttara’. Tapas readily volunteered when I said I needed an actor who had to go bald and shoot wearing just a red loincloth. At the premiere of Venice International Film Festival’s premiere of ‘Uttara’, he behaved like a child and danced on the street when the news of the film’s award was announced,” said Dasgupta, who also cast him as a driver in ‘Mondo Meyer Upakhyan’ and a petty thief in ‘Janala’.Yet, his success didn’t last long. Backlash over his controversies made a dent in his image. Records state that his demise is exactly two years after he was granted bail by the Orissa High Court for the Rose Valley chit-fund scam. Some feel his 2018 comeback project — Debaditya Bandopadhyay’s short film titled ‘Du Taka’, about a good man being trapped by evil colleagues — was an oblique attempt at image cleansing. Paul’s official take to TOI had been: “I have always said that I am an actor and want to return to movies. When I heard the concept, I readily agreed to be a part of it.”Though the film generated over 2 lakh online views, it didn’t make the red carpet roll out for Paul in Tollywood. However, Paul was happy with the praise from his supportive colleagues. Chiranjeet described him as “an extremely good actor” and admitted that he could never have performed the role Paul had in ‘Saheb’. Delighted, Paul had told TOI: “I am glad that he assessed me on the basis of talent.”Six months ago, he had landed at Dasgupta’s residence one evening. “He had memory issues but never forgot his passion for cinema. He wanted to work with me again,” Dasgupta recalled.Once, his director of ‘8:08 Er Bongaon Local’ Debaditya Bandopadhyay had gifted Madhuri Dixit the film’s DVD. Instantly, Madhuri had recognized Paul on the cover.“Madhuri asked me to connect him over the phone. Tapas-da was excited and reacted like a child. Once the conversation was over, he called me up at least six times to know more about Madhuri’s reaction. He craved for people to still remember him for his work,” Bandopadhyay said.It was a validation of sorts when, hours after his demise, Madhuri took to Twitter saying, “The loss of Tapas Paul, who was one of the first actors I have worked with, is felt by many.”",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74200545,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-263558,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tapas-paul-subalterns-hero-face-of-80s-tolly-passes-away/articleshow/74199125.cms

PATNA: Some schools in Madhubani and Bhojpur districts have complained that “incompetent” invigilators have been deputed at their institutions for the ongoing Matriculation examinations being conducted by the Bihar School Examination Board (BSEB).

The centre superintendents of Laxman Sah Uchh Vidyalaya and Regional Higher Secondary School in Madhubani and Town Higher Secondary School in Ara wrote to the district education officers on Monday, alleging that ‘tola sevaks’ and peopns have been deputed at the schools as invigilators.

Kismat Rai, principal and centre superintendent of Town Higher Secondary School, Ara, told this newspaper that the peons-cum-invigilators had made mistakes while distributing the answer sheets to students.

“The candidate’s name, roll number and photo were pre-printed in all answer sheets. However, the peons handed over answer sheets to wrong candidates without checking their names,” he said, adding they also made mistakes in attendance register. “I have requested the DEO to keep incompetent people away from exam duty as it only adds up to our workload,” he added.

Principal of Regional Higher Secondary School, Madhubani, also stated in his letter that tola sevaks and trainee teachers were deputed as invigilators in the school. “We need 10 competent teachers to manage the examination procedure,” the principal said in his letter to the DEO.

Education minister Krishna Nandan Prasad Verma said such complaints came from just “one or two” schools. “We will look into the matter,” he said.

116 expelled on Day 2: Altogether 116 students were expelled for using unfair means on the second day of Matriculation examinations on Tuesday. Two impersonators were caught at different exam centres in Nawada district and four in Nalanda.

Nalanda DEO Manoj Kumar said three impersonators – Azad Kumar, Sunny Kumar and Dhananjay Kumar – were caught in Biharsharif's Model School centre in the first sitting. One more impersonator – Roshan Kumar – was caught in Aadarsh School centre in the second sitting, he added.

51,['19/02/2020'],India engineering exports may struggle to reach last year levels,"This story is from February 19, 2020

Chennai: Falling 2% in value between April and December, Indian engineering exports are likely to miss even last year’s target of $81 billion.

The problems are compounded with the Corona virus outbreak in China, as it fears large scale disruptions to the supply chain.

“We are hoping to get very close to the $81 billion value achieved last year and are banking on a better performance in this last quarter. Still, we may just about get very close to what we achieved last year,” Suranjan Gupta, executive director, Engineering Exports Promotion Council told TOI. “There are lot of uncertainties due to the China issue. While business as such is not affected, supply chain could get hit, since with China, it is both imports and exports. If supply chain gets disrupted, the whole process gets disturbed, thereby affecting the trade,” he said. As of now trade is moving steadily and once China opens up its trade activities from this week, the Indian industry will have a better clarity, he added.

As for the year 2020-21, India can look forward for better things to evolve for the Indian engineering industry. “The visit of US president Donald Trump to India in April could pave way for a trade deal and give a greater thrust for the US — India trade, even while the US — China trade war is also coming down. We hope our trade will pick up with the US, which is our leading market for engineering goods exports, accounting for $12 billion last year,” Gupta said.

EEPC is also hoping for better prospects for India’s trade with the UK, which is now out of European Union.

“We will have to sign a Free Trade Agreement with UK and ask for similar terms that we already have with the European Union,” Gupta said.

The scope for electrical and industrial machinery is looking good. Automobile sector will make a comeback once the BSVI transformation is made. “Government of India is looking to unveil a new Foreign Trade Policy in April. The continued focus on infrastructure, especially roads, is encouraging. We also hope to see logistical costs coming down, thanks to the development of new corridors,” Gupta said.

52,['19/02/2020'],Navy gets 4th anti-sub warfare corvette,"This story is from February 19, 2020

Kolkata: The first three Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) Corvettes delivered to the Navy by Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers (GRSE) have already been very effective in detecting unfriendly submarines snooping near Indian waters, the company’s chairman and managing director Rear Admiral (retd) V K Saxena said on Tuesday.

During the day, GRSE handed over the INS Kavaratti, the fourth and last ship in this series, to the Navy. This is the 104th warship built by the shipyard in Kolkata.

“This project involving four ASW Corvettes was a national one. Real indigenisation started with these vessels. The level of indigenisation achieved for all four vessels was nearly 90%. Indigenous steel (DMR 249A) was also used for naval shipbuilding in this project. These are not small platforms. They have a displacement of 3,250 tonnes each. We have now achieved self-reliance. Apart from the steel, the propulsion systems, weapons platforms and sensors are all indigenous. The sensors include sonars that are so essential for tracking submarines,” Rear Admiral Saxena said.

The INS Kavaratti is the most advanced among the four vessels. According to the CMD, the indigenisation content for the last two vessels — the INS Kavaratti and INS Kiltan — is about 87%. This is primarily due to the carbon-composite superstructure of these two ships. GRSE tied up with a Swedish firm to develop the superstructures and integrate them to the steel hulls. This was also a first for any warship in the country. Reduced weight resulted in more stability and speed.

“In the last 32 months, we delivered 12 warships. We have been told by the Navy that the ASW Corvettes are doing a wonderful job in detecting unfriendly submarines. We plan to complete two Fast Patrol Vessels for the Coast Guard by March and a Landing Craft Utility for the Navy by April. We are also working on Stealth Frigates, Survey Vessels (Large) and Shallow Water ASW Crafts for the Navy. We are investing Rs 200 crore in Rajabagan Dockyard and in the next couple of years, GRSE will be building 24 ships concurrently,” Rear Admiral Saxena said.

Piped natural gas being used at BIT-Patna on Tuesday

PATNA: In the backdrop of rising LPG cylinder prices, piped natural gas (PNG) supply is gaining grounds with over 785 households in the city are getting piped cooking fuel supply. The Gas Authority of India Limited (GAIL) has claimed that it has already laid around 200km of pipeline in Patna .

At an estimated cost of Rs2,500 crore, the Pradhan Mantri Urja Ganga Yojana scheme launched in February last year, targets to connect all households in the city. The network has covered 11,500 households in the city so far.

Rajnish Singh, DGM of GAIL-Patna branch said localities between Saguna Mor and Income Tax roundabout will be covered by March-end. “Since work on laying pipelines is only done during the night, we hardly get four to five hours for it. But we have still covered several areas in the city,” Singh added.

Jagdeo Path, BIT-Mesra and Building Construction Department (BCD) quarters at Rajvanshi Nagar were the first to get the PNG supply. The pipelines have now been laid at Gola Road, Ashiana-Digha Road, Raja Bazar, Jalalpur City Nageshwar Colony, Anandpuri and Pataliputra colony.

“We recently covered several locations, including Ved Nagar, DRM colony in Khagaul, RPS colony, electricity board quarters, Vikas Nagar, and parts of Rukkanpura,” Singh said, adding, “As of now, households in Ved Nagar, AIIMS colony, BIT-Mesra, Jagdeo Path, BCD quarters at Rajvanshi Nagar have started using PNG.”

The lower prices of PNG are a big draw. “As many as 24 staff quarters and four hostels of BIT-Mesra have PNG connection. The rates are comparatively much lower than LPG. Also, with the PNG connection, we don’t worry about the safety,” A BIT-Mesra official said.

Sarita Sinha, a resident of Boring Road, is eagerly waiting for PNG. “With LPG price rising, it has become difficult to manage my monthly budget. PNG will not just save money, but will also reduce hassles of handling cylinders,” she said.

Several CNG stations are also being opened in the city. “Two new stations, one each at Bailey Road and Digha will be opened by March this year,” Singh said.

Representative image

PATNA: A woman Maoist activist, who was arrested by police in Gaya on Sunday, is being questioned by central intelligence agencies following her revelation that the anti-CAA and anti-NRC protests are being funded by a left-wing extremist organization operating in the state.

The woman, Nanhaki Devi alias Kalawati, who is in her 40s, was arrested by the police in Gaya while she was on way to take part in a protest march against the CAA and the NRC under the banner of ‘Jan Abhiyan’.

The protest march, taken out from the Gaya railway station premises, was scheduled to reach Katari road where Shaheen Bagh type dharna is being staged by some locals against the CAA, NRC and NPR. Kalawati was taken into custody on the basis of intelligence inputs.

Kalawati reportedly told the interrogators that she was asked by a top Maoist leader of the region, Sandip Yadav, to garner support of the people for the anti-CAA and the NRC protests in the district. “He (Sandip) had promised all financial assistance for the protests in the district,” Gaya city SP Rakesh Kumar said.

The SP said Kalawati was wanted in connection with an encounter with the security forces under the Gurua police station area in Gaya district last year. Kalawati, also called Phulwa Devi, was collecting people from Maoist-hit villages under Gurua block of the district for protest marches against the CAA and the NRC, the SP added.

The SP didn’t rule out the possibility of the protest marches being used for strengthening the base of the banned Maoist outfit in Magadh region. “We have shared relevant information with the officials of the central intelligence agencies, who are quizzing the arrested woman Maoist activist,” the SP said.

Gaya SSP Rajeev Mishra confirmed that the officials of the central intelligence agencies were interrogating Kalawati. Intelligence inputs had earlier suggested that around 48 women activists were planning to take out a protest march in Gaya against the CAA and NRC.

PATNA: Health minister Mangal Pandey on Tuesday said around 10 crore people use smokeless tobacco (chew tobacco) across the country. Of these, 1.75 crore are from Bihar alone.

Speaking at a national consultation on ‘Effective Implementation of Measures for Control of Smokeless Tobacco Use in India’ jointly organised by the health department and the National Institute of Cancer Prevention And Research (NICPR) here on Tuesday, Pandey pointed out that the government had taken several measures in the last few years to control the production and distribution of tobacco products in the state.

“In May 2012, Bihar became the third state to ban gutka and pan masala (with tobacco and nicotine). In September 2016, the state banned the sale of gutka in twin packs and in October 2018, we put a ban on use of food or food additives as ingredients in chewing tobacco,” Pandey said while talking about the measures taken by the state health department to curb the distribution of tobacco products.

The minister added, “Last year, the health department banned the manufacture, storage, transportation and sale of 15 brands of pan masala after toxic chemicals (magnesium carbonate and nicotine) were found in them by the National Tobacco Testing Laboratories and National Institute of Cancer Prevention and Research under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. We have to work together to control smokeless tobacco use in Bihar.”

The minister released the fact sheet of the state – ‘Smokeless Tobacco Control: Bihar Experience’ on the occasion.

Principal secretary (health) Sanjay Kumar claimed that all pan masalas came from other states as their production was banned in Bihar. “Use of smokeless tobacco has become a major concern for the nation, especially the developing states,” he said.

Deepak Mishra, executive director of the Socio Economic and Educational Development Society , and Shalini Singh , directress of NICPR were also present at the event.

Ram Shankar Katheria

PATNA: Chairman of National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC) Ram Shankar Katheria on Tuesday said the conviction rate in atrocities committed on persons from SC sections in the state was only 4%, which needs to be drastically improved to bring down the rate of atrocities on people from these sections.

Stating that the rate of atrocities on the SC section in the state was double the national average of 42%, Katheria said the grim situation requires better policing and equally pro-active response. “Atrocities committed on the SC sections in the state are a matter of concern,” he said, adding as the police were unwilling to file the FIRs, the same is done in the lower courts.

Katheira said the NCSC would keep watch on the situation in the state. He directed the state police to send the zone wise detailed report on it in a month.

Katheria was here to review the state’s performance on the matters related to the SC sections, including the work done under various centrally supported, centrally sponsored and state schemes, as they are socially and economically backward.

The review touched on aspects like the development matters and action taken in incidents related to atrocities committed on them, filing of the first information reports, investigation and conviction as well as payment of compensation to the victims of atrocities. State chief secretary Deepak Kumar and principal secretaries of various departments participated in the review exercise. Later, Katheria also made courtesy call on governor Phagu Chauhan .

Katheria expressed concern over the comparatively low literacy rate among SC women. He said school dropout rate from primary to intermediate levels in Bihar was worse than many states. “The expenditure of the money allotted in the annual budget of the state for the welfare of the SC sections is in the range of 20-40% in various departments, while the bankers hesitate in extending loans to these sections to carry out even small business activities,” Katheria said.

Public relations officer of the Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB), Birendra Kumar, told this newspaper, “After we get his nod, deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi will inaugurate the four monitoring stations. Each of them was procured from a US-based company at a cost of Rs 1.15 crore.”

There are now 11 monitoring stations across Bihar. Patna alone has four functional stations at Eco Park, Planetarium , Birla Institute of Technology and S K Memorial Hall.

BSPCB scientist Swaminath Jaiswal said, “Once the four air monitoring stations running on a trial basis are connected to the CPCB server, their data will be in public domain.”

He added, “One air monitoring station was also set up at Zila School in town area of Muzaffarpur. However, it is not working because electricity has not been supplied to the installed board.”

The continuous ambient air quality monitoring stations give information about the levels of PM2.5 (particulate matter less than 2.5 microns), PM10 (particulate matter less than 10 microns), nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, ozone and ammonia in the air. They also show the temperature, humidity, wind speed and other climatic conditions of the day.

BETTIAH: Lalita Devi (25) along with her infant son Himanshu and daughter Sonali (3) were charred to death in an alleged case of dowry harassment and murder at Kolachchi tola of Ajua village under the Shikarpur police station area, 12 km south of Narkatiaganj in West Champaran on Tuesday. Bettiah SP Vivek Kumar said police are investigating the incident.

Narkatiaganj SDPO Suryakant Chaubey told TOI that a case of dowry death is being instituted on the statement of the deceased woman’s father Ram Chandra Yadav, a resident of Dainmarwa village under the Ramnagar police station of neighbouring Bagaha police district in West Champaran.

According to preliminary reports, the deceased woman’s husband, Dhan Lal Yadav, had carried the bodies of his wife and minor children to the banks of Ramrekha river adjoining his village for cremation when some villagers informed the police.

Krishna Bedardi, a Bhojpuri folk singer and cousin of the deceased woman said that Lalita was given a Bajaj Platina motorcycle in dowry at her wedding five years ago but her husband Dhan Lal, an agricultural worker, kept insisting on another more expensive brand of motorcycle. “Dhan Lalwa Apache maangat rahey,” Krishna said, adding that a week ago, Lalita had called her father (allegedly) pleading: “ De de je maanga taa (give him what he is demanding).”

Lalita’s father, a small farmer, according to Krishna, had succumbed to pressure and had agreed to meet his son-in-law’s demand once he received the payment for his sugarcane crop. “ When I received a call about the incident, I called Dhan Lal asking him to give the phone to my ‘bahin’,” Krishna said, adding that the brother-in-law promised to connect him with his cousin once he reached home. He said that he was away in the fields harvesting sugarcane. “But when the promised call did not materialise, I rushed to my cousin’s place,” Krishna added.

Narkatiaganj SDPO Chaubey said that a case of dowry death is being instituted against the husband and mother-in-law of the deceased woman. “The woman’s father-in-law is away in Punjab. He is a migrant worker,” he said.

CHENNAI: The Volkswagen Group — which includes brands like Volkswagen, Skoda , Porsch e, Lamborghini and Audi — is using a two-tier strategy to make the most of back-end synergy among its operations in India.Within the group, individual brands are running their marketing and brand functions independently while sharing back-end support on group functions. That helps niche, small volume brands like Porsche or Lamborghini keep operational costs low, senior group officials said.Take Lamborghini India for example which sells cars priced upwards of Rs 2 crore. “We are part of the Volkswagen Group in India and we get a lot of support and synergies on a group level. Our sales, marketing and after-sales services are independent. But the management of the business, the back end side including HR support, logistics, finance and all is shared on a group level. This helps us leverage the strength of the group and optimize our business cost. We have common functions for more efficiency and then there are brand specific functions run independently,” said Sharad Agarwal , head, Lamborghini India. This synergy comes from a restructuring that the group announced just four months ago. Volkswagen had then announced that it was combining its factories, manpower and brands under a single umbrella in India.This combining of all efforts works well Lamborghini. The company, said Agarwal, sold just 8,152 cars globally last year of which India contributed 52 cars, up from 45 in 2018. “Overall the super luxury car segment in India is still very niche. It was about 315 cars strong in 2018 and in 2019 it came down to 265 cars,” he said.",auto,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74201448,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1304513,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//auto/miscellaneous/vw-works-out-a-two-tier-india-plan/articleshow/74201453.cms
62,['19/02/2020'],Nitish Kumar: Opposition parties hail Prashant Kishor for ‘exposing’ Bihar CM Nitish Kumar,"This story is from February 19, 2020

Prashant Kishor

PATNA: Opposition leaders, including RLSP chief Upendra Kushwaha and HAM(S) chief Jitan Ram Manjhi, came out in support of poll strategist Prashant Kishor as he launched a scathing attack on CM Nitish Kumar on Tuesday for making ideological compromises to stay in alliance with BJP. Hailing the blistering attack made by Kishor, the opposition leaders said the poll strategist raised the opinion of entire Bihar, especially the youth.

RJD, on the other hand, maintained distance from Kishor, saying they do not need any “poll management expert”.

“Kishor has never been of any interest to RJD as our party does not require assistance of any poll management expert. We already have young leadership of Tejashwi Prasad Yadav and we are certain to give a crushing defeat to the NDA in the upcoming assembly elections in the state,” RJD spokesperson Mrityunjay Tiwari said.

He, however, said Kishor has exposed JD(U)’s shallow claims of development in Bihar. “It is now on JD(U) leaders to give reply to Kishor’s charges,” Tiwari said.

RLSP chief Kushwaha was also praise for poll strategist. “Kishor has expressed the opinion of all people of Bihar, especially the youths. Bihar does not want to look back as it aspires to progress in the future. It is obvious that Nitish has completely disappointed Bihar in the last 15 years. Thus, Kishor’s strategy will act as a catalyst to bring change in Bihar,” Kushwaha tweeted.

Manjhi, on the other hand, invited Kishor to work with Mahagathbandhan in the upcoming Bihar elections. “Kishor has Bihari DNA. When PM Narendra Modi made remarks about the DNA of CM Nitish Kumar, it was Kishor who called it a political issue and backed Nitish …There are two ideologies in the country at present – one of Mahatma Gandhi and another of Nathuram Godse. Kishor stands with Gandhian ideologies and it is everyone’s responsibility to stand with him and work on the suggestions given by him for development of Bihar…If Kishor sides with Mahagathbandhan for development of Bihar, we will welcome him,” Manjhi said.

Bihar Congress functionaries also supported Kishor. “We have always been proponent of issues, which were raised by Kishor on Tuesday. We have been saying that it has to be decided that whether this country will be run by Gandhian ideology or those who follow Gandhi’s killer Nathuram Godse. Kishor was right when he said Nitish is trying to sail in two boats. He talks about development and Gandhian ideologies but also keeps making ideological compromises,” Congress’s working president Kaukab Quadri said.

Sanjeev Gupta (File photo)

MUMBAI: India-born British businessman Sanjeev Gupta , who made headlines in 2016 for buying Tata Steel ’s UK units, has acquired the bankrupt Adhunik Metaliks and Zion Steel for Rs 425 crore ($60 million), making an entry in this part of the world. He is the second global steel tycoon to debut in India, one of the world’s vibrant metal markets, after L N Mittal . It was through the acquisition of Essar Steel that Mittal entered India in December 2019.

Tuesday’s announcement comes after the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) told Gupta to make a payment by February 14 if he wants to proceed with the acquisition of Adhunik and Zion. Though Gupta had put in a bid for Adhunik and Zion in 2018, the process got delayed because of litigation. The NCLAT had ordered liquidation of the two companies. But after an appeal from Gupta, the liquidation order was stayed. Adhunik and Zion had a debt of over Rs 5,000 crore.

“It has been a challenging journey to get us to this stage,” said Gupta, who is chairman of Liberty Steel Group. He added, “It is great to be investing in the country where my family began in the steel industry a generation ago.” Liberty, which Gupta launched 27 years ago while studying at Cambridge University, is the eighth largest steelmaker in the world outside of China with operations in 200 locations in 10 countries.

Gupta’s immediate plan is to revive Adhunik and Zion by introducing his ‘green steel’ model in their operations. The model is based on using renewable power to fire furnaces that recycle scrap and use the finished steel to make value-added products. Adhunik and Zion’s steel and power plants are located in Odisha and their total steel rolling capacity stands at 4 lakh tonnes.

64,['19/02/2020'],Cos must rejig goal setting to tackle biz disruptions,"This story is from February 19, 2020

By Raj Bowen

During the January-March quarter, the only noise one hears across organisations is around the annual performance-evaluation and goal-setting deadlines. That, and of course a frantic rush to lock down business numbers as the clock chimes midnight on March 31. It’s almost like seasonal flavours and foods.

The appraisal component ranges from ad hoc and arbitrary conversations to, if at all, very theoretically evolved models that organisations have embedded into robust HR information systems. In general (and there are always exceptions to such averages), across industries, the authentic message on the year passing by has been: “Well, we’ve seen better.”

In many cases, the bloodbath continues. It’s easy to pass verdicts around “consolidation before take-off”, etc. But the pain is far more real for those who bleed from the cuts of a business battle that looks far from over.

There are goals starting right from the expectations of boards and other stakeholders, down to the level of every unit employee (well, that’s what it should be). So, as we hunker down to reset these goals for the next year, a handful of organisations are showing the freshness and courage to toss up the following questions and assumptions.

1) If the year ahead also could be choppy, can we really say that we can “predict” market growth numbers? What about the impact of what we know — the known competition? What about the impact of what we don’t know — a sudden slowdown, an unknown stealth competitor, a sudden regulatory risk, the impact of a globally connected event? The variables suddenly seem too many, and we still must set goals that have to be met.

2) This reality is compelling such organisations to move the focus from the confusing reality outside. Maybe, to something that they have not really leveraged enough of — for want of a better expression, we can call it ‘The productivity possibility of the employee’ — at every level, from the CEO to the newest hire from campus.

3) So, when the known methods are not working, here are the basics that the best leaders are bringing back to the organisation’s success drawing-board, now centred around the individual employee, for a change:

* We work to our best capacities on those components of our careers/roles/tasks that ‘engage’ us more, and all parts don’t do that equally — let’s admit that. To add more challenge here, this preference seems to be dynamic and not a static rule that we hold fast to.

* It is in these areas that we function best even with minimal/no management supervision — the practical definition of accountability.

* In such cases, we are more creative, more productive and willingly apply discretionary effort beyond the job requirements.

* We infect others around us with the same positivity.

* We release our managers’ time to do their own work — a huge payoff, often unrecognised.

* We’re relatively less prone to distractions around ‘better opportunities outside’.

* We find increasing meaning in the work we do every day.

* The organisation actually saves a lot of time and money as HR is not needed to push so many employees into ‘compulsory training/coaching’ in areas like collaboration, teamwork, innovation, etc, as most of it starts happening on its own, all because of one single change they’ve managed to facilitate at the workplace — the employee just loves what he’s doing.

* Instead of better employees looking for opportunities outside, the organisation starts becoming an employer of choice.

* The costs of external hiring start progressively decreasing as the same employees are somehow producing the equivalent of one and a half times (at the minimum) the earlier levels of productivity.

* It does not need advanced calculus for working the arithmetic into very tangible and significant addition to the financial bottom line of the organisation. In such a scenario, when the external market conditions start turning around positively, that becomes a bonus instead of an elusive target.

Think about this as you assess your organisation: Is this utopia? There are some early mover organisations who are already sensing that there’s no other way and are committing themselves to the new model. This requires a huge shift away from the older way of starting from where the organisation wants to go. And reversing the model and starting with the very core career drivers of every single employee, and then ‘leading’ people to enjoy the fulfilment of their potential.

The collective effort will seriously start threatening the main role of ‘managers’ who believe their job is to make sure others do their jobs. Instead, this will throw up a new breed of ‘leaders’ who know that their bigger role is to enable others to do what they will excel at and create even more leaders.

The good news is that the measures to help identify these career drivers are now available. It’s time for the courageous leaders to step up and ask, “Why not?”

Hyderabad: Medchal has become the first mandal in India to have digital health profiles of school students. Some 4,832 students belonging to 48 government schools have been profiled so far. The pilot project was taken up under ‘Aarogya Telangana’ programme and special teams were constituted by TRS in-charge for Malkajgiri parliamentary constituency, Marri Rajasekhar Reddy, and VERA group for profiling digital health records.

Telangana planning board vice-chairman, B Vinod Kumar, handed over the health cards to students and a manual on best practices to improve healthcare to Medchal district collector Venkateshwarlu on Monday.

Vinod Kumar said, “Over the years, Telangana budget has seen multi-fold increase in the financial provisions made towards public health and is expected to increase further. Despite all possible efforts by the government, present healthcare system is outdated and processes are further creating challenges, resulting in high costs. Embracing new technology and best global practices is the only way to overcome the present situation.”

Minister Ch Malla Reddy, Marri Rajasekhar Reddy and district collector Venkateshwarlu also spoke on the occasion.

66,['19/02/2020'],12 from a street in Cuddalore village cleared TNPSC exam,"This story is from February 19, 2020

Cuddalore: CBCID sleuths have issued summons to 12 people hailing from the same street who had cleared the Group 2A examinations conducted by the Tamil Nadu public service commission in 2011 in a village in Cuddalore district to appear before the agency in connection with a probe regarding their involvement in malpractices to clear the competitive examination.

Much to the surprise of many, two siblings each from four families had cleared the examination. All the 12 hailing from a street in Keezhakku Ramapuram in Cuddalore district presently serve as revenue inspectors, commercial tax officers and deputy tahsildars in various districts of Tamil Nadu.

“We issued summons to the 12 people asking them to appear on February 19 but later decided to postpone the inquiry and conveyed to them to appear as and when asked to do so,” said an investigation officer.

An anti-corruption forum in the district accused the 12 of indulging in malpractices to crack the Group 2A exam with the help of two brokers immediately after the exam in 2011. The forum had charged that the brokers, with the help of tainted TNPSC officials, leaked the question paper of the Group 2A exam to their clientele, including the 12 people, after receiving a huge sum of money from them in 2011.

The CBCID registered a case and arrested the two brokers in this connection. But the agency failed to make any further progress in the case. The issue has resurfaced now after multiple scams in the TNPSC recruitment process were reported recently.

The candidates from Cuddalore district were also allegedly involved in Group IV exam fraud.

The agency said four people from the district appeared for the Group IV exam from two centres in Ramanathapuram district. The agency has so far arrested three people from Cuddalore district in connection with the Group IV examination fraud. The arrested were identified as Sivaraj, 34, a differently-abled man from Panruti, and his relatives Rajasekar and Srinivasan also from Panruti.

The TNPSC banned 99 candidates for life for indulging in malpractices in the Group IV examination. The modus operandi of the gang is to instruct the candidate to mark the answers using a pen with a special ink that disappears after a few hours.

Subsequently, middlemen and corrupt government employees will mark the right answers in the candidates’ answer sheets.

More than 13 lakh candidates appeared for the TNPSC Group IV examination on September 1, 2019. The commission published the results of the exam on November 12.

67,['19/02/2020'],Anti-CAA protesters hoist tricolour in their houses,"This story is from February 19, 2020

Coimbatore: Members of Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI), who are staging protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 , hoisted national flags at their homes and shops at Karumbukadai on Tuesday. Sleuths of the special intelligence cell of the city police visited the area.

They want to assert their nationality with the national flag, SDPI media organiser Mansoor Ali said. “We condemn the state government for supporting the police for lathi charging Muslims at Washermanpet in Chennai. The government should pass a resolution against CAA in the assembly,” he said.

More than 250 people including 100 women participated in a protest conducted by SDPI at Athupalam on Tuesday evening demanding that the state government pass the resolution.

SDPI joint secretary Kareem flayed PMK and AIADMK for supporting CAA in Parliament. “Muslims will teach them a lesson in the upcoming election. The AIADMK government is afraid of passing a resolution against CAA. After the demise of J Jayalalithaa, the party is controlled by BJP. The ruling party leaders have amassed crores of rupees. If they pass the resolution, the income tax department will target them. The ruling party is not interested in the welfare of people,” he said.

Anti-CAA protests were held at Ukkadam and Selvapuram also.

SDPI district secretary Mujib Rahman said that people of Tamil Nadu should come forward to fight against CAA. “CAA was implemented to support the 3% brahmins residing in the country. The rest of the people will suffer due to CAA in future. SDPI will fight against the Act, which is a threat to our rights,” he said.

Meanwhile, the city police have started using drones to videograph anti-CAA and pro-CAA rallies. Drones were first used to record the blue shirt rally conducted by dalit outfits and Periyarists a few days ago, police sources told TOI.

“We have as many as four drones to monitor crowds and have hired experts to operate them,” city police commissioner Sumit Sharan said. “We are storing the drone footage.”

Several Muslim outfits have decided to besiege the collectorate today at 10am. They expect 8,000 people to participate in the protest. Police will deploy 1,000 personnel to prevent any untoward incidents. The Federation of All Muslim Organisations of Coimbatore will conduct a sit-in at Athupalam at 9pm.

68,['19/02/2020'],Medical policy holders seek higher cover,"This story is from February 19, 2020

Chennai: As more Indians turn cautious and protect their life goals from getting derailed, they are writing fatter cheques for medical cover, consequentially the average sum insured for critical illness has risen 20%-30% in the past year.

“On an average, people are trying to take high sum assured policies on indemnity plan, where cashless medical expenses get covered. In those products which are only for critical illness, the sum insured rate has grown by 10%-20%,” said Sanjay Datta, head of underwriting at ICICI Lombard General Insurance .

Future Genrali India Insurance said they have seen customers increasing the average sum insured on standalone critical illness covers by 30%-35% on yearly basis. “However, we have not recorded any significant loss claim ratio, as it remains flat at 65%,” said Shreeraj Deshpande, chief operating officer of Future Generali India Insurance.

The main reason for people to opt for higher sum insured is the higher incidents and claims made under critical illness.

Amit Chhabra, business head, Health Insurance, Policybazaar.com said, “There is a growing trend where people choose for an indemnity plan with higher value of sum insured as it provides the option to renew the policy for lifelong, unlike the fixed benefit policy, where the insurance money gets settled for once. Meanwhile, more people are increasing their health insurance cover with higher sum insured, instead of buying a basic health policy and an add on of critical insurance policy. In such case, the premium is cheaper by Rs 5,000.” Heart ailments, cancer-related illness, kidney problems continue to top the list of major critical illnesses.

According to data shared by Bajaj Allianz General Insurance in the period between FY2016-2019, there has been a 79% increase in the number of claims due to cancer. While, the average claims size is around Rs 75,000 to Rs 80,000, with the highest claims pay out was over Rs 25 lakh in 2019. On an average 40% claimants are males as against 60% female claimants, with the average claiming age group lying between 50-60 years. Parag Ved, senior VP — head of consumer lines of Tata AIG General Insurance Company said, “We have seen about 10%-15% increase in policyholders opting for higher sum insured under indemnity cover to meet expenses related to critical illness.” Meanwhile, general insurance companies also expressed, their share of business covering critical insurance policies see tough competition from life insurance companies who offer the critical insurance cover as a rider.

Mumbai: LIC Mutual Fund ( LICMF ) is looking to grow its market share through bank distribution. The move comes after consolidating its purchase of IDBI Bank, which has sold its own mutual fund business to the Muthoot Group.

“Besides, we have tied up with a host of other banks for distribution, including Punjab National Bank , Federal Bank, Karnataka Bank, and Saraswat Bank. Our schemes are also being sold through IDBI Capital, HDFC Securities and ICICI Securities,” said LICMF MD & CEO Dinesh Pangtey . “Many of the promoters of the large mutual funds first had a bank and then the mutual fund. In our case, it was the other way.”

According to Pangtey, LICMF, which was earlier perceived to be focused on income fund, is now getting noticed for equity schemes after four of the schemes got five-star ratings. “Also, because of our focus on safety, we have avoided many of the major defaults in debt, barring a small exposure to DHFL,” he added. “We have changed the earlier structure of having a common chief investment officer (CIO). We now have a CIO each for equity and debt.” While Sachin Relekar heads equity, Marzban Irani is the CIO for fixed income.

The mutual fund is looking at increasing penetration of equity investments by partnering entities that can provide a platform through which the financially excluded can invest. “We are looking at partnership with entitles like an NGO or a small finance bank that can help distribute mutual funds. We are looking at very simple products for this segment,” he said.

KOLKATA: A 22-year-old who had sustained a fracture in his right hand, had been doing the rounds of several hospitals, for more than three years for bleeding from the surgical site after each surgery . His treatment had involved orthopaedic surgeons, haematologists and plastic surgeons before doctors finally identified the problem — a rare psychological disorder called Munchausen ’s syndrome, in which a person inflicts wounds on himself or herself to seek attention.Agrha (name changed) of Howrah had fractured his right hand sometime in mid-2016 and underwent a surgery in a nursing home in Howrah Maidan. The plate was removed in June 2018. But within a few days, he started complaining of bleeding from the surgical site. He was taken back to the doctor who conducted another surgery. For the next four months, his hand was bandaged. However, within weeks of removal of the bandage, another wound developed at the same spot. This time, he was given antibiotics. But once the course was complete, he complained of bleeding again. This time, the doctor asked Argha’s parents to take him to another physician.An a private hospital, an orthopaedic surgeon treated Argha for infection. But once back home, he started complaining of pain and bleeding. This doctor then asked Argha’s parents to take him to a haematologist. They went to another hospital where doctors found no infection and were unable to gauge why the wound had appeared. “We then came to Narayana Superspecialty Hospital, Howrah, to consult a haematologist. He found nothing wrong and directed me to the plastic surgery department,” Argha told TOI.By this time, the family had run out of funds. The hospital’s guest support executive, Bhaswati Ambule, got philanthropist Anuradha Agarwal on board to sponsor Argha’s treatment. Plastic surgeons Adhish Basu and Cinjini Das found that due to the repeated wounds, the patient had developed an ulcer and deformity in his fingers. After ruling out cancer, the team removed the ulcer and released contracture in his tendons in November 2019. Argha was then sent home.

Anshuman Sengupta

PATNA: Mystery shrouded the disappearance of a 39-year-old unmarried Patna resident, Anshuman Sengupta , who was very active on social media and never hesitated in posting his comments on issues plaguing the nation as well as the state. Some of his social media friends have created a WhatsApp group to trace the whereabouts of Anshuman, a familiar face among the bureaucrats, judicial officers, journalists and who’s is who of the state capital.

Anshuman, an alumnus of Indian Institute of Management , Calcutta, is traceless since December 28 last year. A woman in her late 50s, who reportedly came in contact with Anshuman through a social networking site, said she had tried umpteen times to ascertain the whereabouts of Anshuman, but in vain. “I somehow got the cellphone number of one of his tenants, who said Anshuman had left home at West Patel Nagar in Patna for Kolkata on December 28,” she said.

According to Anshuman’s Noida-based female friend, he was depressed after his parents’ death last year. “The death of his pet dog recently shattered him from within. Since then, he used to talk about the purpose of his existence on the Earth. He often cursed his fate for losing his dear ones one after another. First he lost his parents about six months ago and then the pet dog. “Mera ab duniya mein koi nahi rah gaya hai. Mein akela hun (There is no near and dear ones in the world. I am alone),” she quoted Anshuman as saying.

Anshuman’s tenant, Ram Pravesh Singh, reportedly told his female friend over phone that he (Anshuman) had gone to meet one of his close relatives in Patna before he was supposed to leave for Kolkata by train in the evening. Anshuman also had his breakfast and also a cup of tea at his West Patel Nagar residence. “On his return from his relative’s house, he (Anshuman) was very upset and told me that he had an altercation with his relative,” Anshuman’s female friend quoted Ram Pravesh as saying.

Though the tenant, who has been living in the house since long, had assured her of providing a copy of the missing complaint lodged with the Shashtrinagar police station in the state capital, he failed to keep his promise. “We are equally worried about him (Anshuman). We all are searching for him,” the tenant is learned to have told the social media friend of Anshuman.

According to his friends, Anshuman, the only child of his parents, owned ancestral properties at prime locations in Patna and Kolkata. However, his sudden disappearance from social media caused worry among his friends. Several bureaucrats, journalists and other acquaintances also expressed their concern over his mysterious disappearance.

SHO of Shastrinagar police station Vimlendu Kumar said, “Yes, I have got a few phone calls from some well-wishers and friends of Anshuman. But nobody has so far lodged any missing complaint.”

72,['19/02/2020'],"Irdai: LIC offer will improve governance, disclosure","This story is from February 19, 2020

(Representative image)

MUMBAI: Irdai chairman S C Khuntia said the proposed initial public offer (IPO) of Life Insurance Corporation ( LIC ) will lead to improved corporate governance and disclosures, which will help the institution as well as its policyholders.

The insurance regulator’s comments come in the wake of the government’s announcement that it would list LIC in the current fiscal.

The insurance watchdog also expressed concern over the underwriting losses in the general insurance industry and said that surviving on investment income is not an option as falling interest rates could wipe out this source of income as has happened in other countries.

The regulator’s statement comes after GIC Re declared a Rs 1,557-crore net loss for the quarter ended December, bringing its solvency margin close to the minimum statutory level of 1.5%.

“We want companies to write sustainable business. Underwriting losses mean that companies have to make up for the losses from elsewhere,” said Khuntia. He said that while investment was one such source, it cannot be depended upon as experiences in other markets have shown that falling interest rates can wipe out investment income.

Speaking at the 21st Global Conference of Actuaries in Mumbai, Khuntia said that while listing of non-life companies would improve corporate governance, there would not be any compulsion to do so. “Earlier, it was expected that companies would list in 10 years. But because there are many firms that are smaller and will need more time to grow, it (listing) should probably be done in phases,” said Khuntia.

Delivering his speech at the conference, Khuntia said that he would like to reactivate the Loss Prevention Association of India, which could enable the industry to bring down claims by encouraging insurers to take preventive measures.

In the previous month, Khuntia had warned the non-life companies against doing business at unsustainable prices saying that he did not want the industry to go the way of the airline or telecom industry. On Tuesday, he said that while companies were underwriting losses, the Irdai would not go back to prescribing rates like it did in the tariff era.

“We will not intervene in the pricing because that is not correct in a deregulated economy. But if the pricing is not right when the products are submitted to us, we will point it out to them,” said Khuntia.

Earlier speaking at the same event, ICICI Lombard General Insurance MD & CEO Bhargav Dasgupta said that in the last decade, the non-life industry grew at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17% to Rs 1.7 lakh crore, while the profits shrunk to Rs 2,713 crore from Rs 2,863 crore. He attributed it to a lack of discipline in pricing.

PATNA: Hours after his outburst against CM Nitish Kumar on Tuesday, senior BJP and JD(U) functionaries hit out at poll strategist Prashant Kishor and described him as a “hypocrite”.

“It is a unique hypocrisy that someone terms a person father figure and soon selects a very objectionable word like ‘pichhlaggu’ against him,” deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi said.

Making a vitriolic attack on Kishor, Modi added, “A person who himself trumpeted about having worked for victory of Narendra Modi in 2014 Lok Sabha polls should explain as to why he did not consider BJP as the follower of Nathuram Godse then. Nitish has been with BJP for a long time. Kishor should explain why he described Nitish as ‘Godsewadi’ just eight months before Bihar elections,” Modi said.

Making a sarcastic comment on Kishor’s ‘poll strategist’ designation, the deputy CM said, “People involved in the profession of event management do not hold any ideology of their own, but they happen to be an expert in fast adopting the ideology and language of their sponsors.”

JD(U) national secretary general K C Tyagi also lashed out at Kishor for describing Nitish as ‘pichhlaggu’. “Kishor is not a political personality. His views are not significant at all. I would be happy if he forms a political party in Bihar to take on Nitish ji. Politics is not Kishor’s cup of tea. His statements are damaging the image of Bihar,” Tyagi said.

JD(U)’s Rajya Sabha member R C P Singh also criticised Kishor for raising fingers on Nitish’s development model.

PATNA: Days before RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav ’s “Berozgaari Hatao Yatra”, which is scheduled to start on February 23, yet another JD(U) legislator has expressed concern on the issue of unemployment. This comes a day after two other ruling party legislators raised eyebrows with their statements on the same issue.

“Unemployment is a big issue in Bihar. Youngsters are disappointed because they are not getting jobs. There are lots of vacancies in railways, banks and different departments of the central government. The issue of unemployment must be resolved,” JD(U) MLA from Kochadhaman (Kishanganj) Mujahid Alam told TOI over phone, adding, rate of unemployment has increased in the recent years as the Centre has not come out any big proposals to solve it.

Alam, however, clarified that though he supported the cause of unemployment, he was not in support of Tejashwi’s “Berozgaari Hatao Yatra”.

“Tejashwi may have decided to take out a yatra to highlight the issue of unemployment, but I am not associated with him,” Alam said.

RJD leader Tejashwi has announced that he will begin his yatra from the Veterinary College ground here on February 23 with a view to expand his party’s support base among the youths and students by highlighting their issues ahead of the Bihar assembly polls due later this year.

Earlier on Monday, JD(U) legislator Javed Iqbal Ansari backed Yadav’s “Berozgaari Hatao Yatra”, calling it a welcome initiative for highlighting the issue of unemployment and migration in the state.

Another JD(U) legislator Amarnath Gami , too, had expressed concern over the state government’s failure to check migration of labourers to other states, but clarified later that he was not in support of Tejashwi’s yatra.

A view of Anjuna beach in Goa

PANAJI: Nuisance at beaches, be it vendors who harass tourists or people drinking, go unchecked despite the presence of cops and India Reserve Battalion (IRB). To keep a check on such illegalities the tourism department has decided to introduce an app.

A mobile app will be launched within a month to facilitate people to complain about any illegality on any beach , tourism minister Manohar Ajgaonkar told reporters on Tuesday.

“Even breaches by beach operators can be reported through the app,” he said.

Some shack operators, he said, put deck beds in excess number and line them close to the water. “People can also report them through the app,” he said.

A beach shack allottee is permitted to install 10 pairs of deck beds, but many exceed the legal number.

The two biggest problems faced by the tourism department are vendors selling goods, food items and beverages on beaches, and people drinking alcohol on beaches. Drinking on beaches also leads to drownings when visitors get into the water, especially, after sunset.

The tourism minister said they don’t want vendors troubling visitors. Once the app is introduced, it will be easier to act against illegal operators.

Similarly, he said, the app can also be used to bring littering to the notice of the department. He added that the existing beach cleaning operator—Karnataka Commercial and Industrial Corporation Pvt Ltd—is doing a fine job of maintaining cleanliness.

Tourism director Menino D’Souza said the app is being prepared through Goa Electronics Ltd (GEL), and will help put onus on beach shack operators who at times look the other way, when illegalities happen in front of them.

D’Souza said they will take immediate action after a complaint is received and if the nature of the offence falls under the domain of the police, it will be forwarded to them for action.

After the legislation banning drinking on beaches was introduced last year, police have been vested with powers to book people violating the law.

Bareilly: Three friends astride a motorcycle were killed after an unidentified vehicle run over them on Palia state highway in Bheera area of Lakhimpur Kheri district on Monday midnight.

On Tuesday morning, passers-by informed police after they spotted the bodies lying on the road. Police sent the bodies for autopsy and impounded the mangled bike.

Bheera police station SHO Pradeep Kumar said Rakesh Kumar (23), Veeru and Ranjeet Kumar (27), all residents of Mudiya Hemsingh village, were on their way home after attending a wedding in Aaliyapur village on Monday night when the accident took place.

The SHO said the riders were wearing helmets and their injuries were also not grave; thus, they could have died in the absence of immediate medical intervention. The families of the victims were informed about the accident, he said.

According to victims’ kin, when their children didn’t return home, they thought that the trio might have stayed in Aaliyapur. On Tuesday morning, however, police informed them that their children were killed in a road accident, they added.

The SHO, meanwhile, said an FIR would be registered after they received the autopsy report.

(Representative image)

MUMBAI: SBI Card , which is set to launch its initial public offering (IPO) early next month, has crossed the one-crore-cards mark, making it the only issuer after HDFC Bank to achieve this milestone. The company will approach the registrar of companies this week for the public listing.

Speaking to TOI, SBI Card manging director & CEO Hardayal Prasad said he is pitching the consumption story and strong growth in digitisation of payments seen in India after demonetisation.

“The economy is moving from a saving to a spending economy. The demographics have also changed. According to a Crisil report, India’s working-age population is expected to grow from 31 crore in calendar 2010 to 37 crore in year 2020, representing an increase of approximately 60 million people,” said Prasad.

The proposed IPO will see a 14% dilution in the company. While Carlyle, a private equity investor in SBI Card, will be selling 9.3 crore shares, parent SBI will offload 3.7 crore. In addition, there will be a fresh issue of Rs 500-crore equity.

The market is speculating an issue size of around Rs 9,000 crore, which will value the company at over Rs 64,000 crore. Unlike other major issuers, which are all banks, SBI Card is the only finance company to issue credit cards.

“The advantage is that it gives us a lot of flexibility in hiring talent in data analytics and risk analytics,” said Prasad. The downside is that the card company has to do a KYC procedure even while issuing cards to SBI customers. Commenting on the growth potential, Prasad said even if the company tapped just 5% more of SBI’s eligible customers, it could add another one crore cardholders.

MUMBAI: Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma , and associates have invested Rs 5 crore in new-age insurer Digit.

While the celebrity couple have directly invested Rs 2.5 crore, an identical amount is understood to have been brought in through an investment vehicle. According to sources, the investment is not linked to brand partnership and Kohli is believed to have been impressed with the company’s approach to demystify insurance.

However, the company could pursue a brand partnership given their popularity among its target market. Digit was started by Allianz’s former India head Kamesh Goyal, and backed by Prem Watsa’s Fairfax Group.

Kohli’s investment was part of an $84-million fund-raising round concluded by the company. The main investors in the recent round were A91 Partners, Faering Capital and TVS Capital. Overall, the company has raised $224 million in funding, with the last round valuing the company at $900 million — a 9x return for those who invested in the first round. In two years of operation, Digit has more than 50 lakh customers and has achieved close to $300 million of annualised premium with a 1.2% market share of the overall in the general insurance industry in India.

80,['19/02/2020'],"With no retake, star went from side role to oblivion","Tapas Paul's body at Kolkata airport after being flown in from Mumbai on Tuesday evening

KOLKATA: Tapas Paul lent his glamour to politics as a Tollywood hero, but politics gave him just a side role. Paul took the plunge at the peak of his acting career, only a year after he went to the Venice International Film Festival for the premiere of ‘Uttara’ in 2001, when few in Tollywood dared to ally with Mamata Banerjee. The Tollywood hero whom city luminaries often discounted as a “rural hit” won from the Alipore assembly constituency, increasing the Trinamool’s footprint in the city.Banerjee had fielded two other film personalities — Madhabi Mukherjee from Jadavpur and Nayana Bandyopadhyay from Bowbazar. Madhabi lost to Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. Though Nayana won, she did so with a lesser margin than the matinee idol.There was no looking back for Paul since then. His USP was simplicity and a good heart. So when the Trinamool chief fielded Paul from another tough seat — Krishnanagar — in the 2009 Lok Sabha polls, he had no hesitation because he knew he was going to win.In hindsight, Paul was a trendsetter, showing the so-called seasoned politicians from Bengal how effective people from the silver screen could be. It is not without reason that Banerjee fielded Moon Moon Sen, Sandhya Roy, Dev, Nusrat Jahan and Mimi Chakraborty later, who turned out to be giant killers.For Paul, however, there was a disadvantage. Politics doesn’t offer a scope for retake that films do. And, most times, politicians have to make extempore speech without a script, which does not happen in films. Actors give life to dialogues duly weighed by the film’s director. In politics, the individual has to script the dialogue reading the public mind. Paul was not a wordsmith and couldn’t hold his emotions in check. He crossed the “lakshman rekha” at his own peril and made “rape” comments, introducing him as “Chandernagorer maal”, which sealed his political career.Director Aparna Sen tweeted about losing this “talented actor to politics”. Some have wondered if it was politics that killed Paul by prompting him to make comments that smacked of toxic masculinity and make him lose focus so his growth as an actor stalled. Others believe that the matinee idol couldn’t handle the glamour of an actor and the raw power of a ruling party politician simultaneously. Paul’s friends say he had bouts of depression during his stint in politics.“He was a hero in Tollywood and wanted to be a hero in politics. But that was not to be. He lacked the tact and astuteness of a politician,” one of his colleagues said.According to theatre personality-turned-politician Bratya Basu, “Both the world of entertainment and politics have a degree of simplicity as well as astuteness. There is synergy when the simp-licity of both these worlds merges. But the artiste gets defeated when the astuteness of the two worlds clash. This is my understanding of what has happened in case of Tapas-da.”Diplomacy, star-turned-Trinamool politician Chiranjeet believes, was never Paul’s forte. “He was too simple and never mastered the tricks of the trade. He would speak out of turn without thinking about the consequences,” said Chiranjeet. “I have noticed a difference between the Tapas Paul before and after the accident where he had sustained head injuries. His nervous system got affected. I sometimes wonder if he had seriously thought and made the controversial remark for which he apologized later on. He became shaky, used to have a lot of medicines and displayed instances of immaturity,” he added.In the process, Paul also started losing his attributes. People from his constituency couldn’t get to him easily and he had mood swings and acted on impulse. And, as destiny would have it, the man who complained against the Ponzi scam found himself entangled in the controversy. He who had won hearts with his image in ‘Dadar Kirti’ ended up as an outsider, both in films and politics.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74200595,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-581498,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/with-no-retake-star-went-from-side-role-to-oblivion/articleshow/74199150.cms

Kochi: The issue of sewage disposal in Kochi can be solved only by setting up a centralized sewage treatment plant (STP), amicus curiae has informed the high court. STPs set up in apartment complexes are not operational as most of the land is reclaimed, the court was told.

The report was filed by amicus curiae and lawyer Liju V Stephen after an inspection conducted on apartment complexes near Marine Drive walkway as directed by a division bench led by chief justice S Manikumar. The court is considering a petition filed by Ranjit G Thampy through senior lawyer K Jaju Babu alleging non-implementation of orders to ensure proper upkeep of the walkway.

After the inspection, the amicus curiae said in the report that STPs are not operational in apartment complexes due to the operational costs involved, lack of sufficient area, and as most of the land is reclaimed.

The report stated: “The only alternative is to have a centralized sewage treatment plant. It is ascertained from the corporation and pollution control board (PCB) officers that a sewage treatment plant is maintained by the Kerala water authority at Elamkulam, which only takes care of a meagre 6% of the population of Cochin. And moreover, it is ascertained from the officers that due to non-connecting of central sewage pipeline to the said STP at Elamkulam, the said STP is not functioning even as per its existing capacity. It is learnt that the water authority has a large extent of land at Elamkulam in which a modern STP can be installed and by which a major portion of the sewage waste disposal can be addressed. It is humbly submitted that unless proper sanitation measures are taken, a proper civic society would not be able to sustain a healthy environment. The government and the local body authorities should provide sufficient infrastructure to address the sanitation issues.”

According to the amicus curiae’s report, the sewage from the apartment complexes can be let out to the backwaters after an eight-stage filtration process at the local STP in each apartment complex. However, state pollution control board should issue consent or licence to operate such an STP, the report said.

Further, the report said inspection of one of the major apartment complexes near the walkway showed that the STP installed there is non-functional.

“It is pertinent to note that it is due to the operational and maintenance cost of the activated process in the aeration tank that most of the apartment complexes fail to comply with it (operation of STP). And it is pertinent to note that for discharging of treated effluent to the backwaters, necessary licence/consent to operate has to be given by the Kerala State Pollution Control Board,” the report of the amicus curiae said. PCB officials said no licence to operate STP was granted to the major apartment complex near the walkway.

When PCB officials collected samples from the STP at the major apartment complex, a lawyer representing the apartment owners insisted for collecting samples from the STP of GCDA. The officials collected samples from the STP of GCDA also and all the samples have been sent to an authorized laboratory, with results expected within a week, the report stated.

83,['19/02/2020'],Kolkata shipyard may supply unmanned vessels to Navy,"This story is from February 19, 2020

Kolkata: Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers (GRSE) of Kolkata that has earned the distinction of being the country’s only shipyard to build more than a 100 warships, is set to launch a futuristic system that will take maritime security to a new level. It is waiting for the Navy to issue a Request For Proposal (RFP) for Unmanned Surface Vessels (USVs) for which GRSE has already signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with an Israeli firm.

“It will be a game-changer. Not only the Navy, the Army may also place orders for riverine areas. The Coast Guard may also want some. Just as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), the USVs are extremely versatile and useful. These small vessels can operate for four days at a stretch away from the mother ship. They can be remotely controlled and only require a change in module for shift in operations. From effective mine-control measures, they can shift to anti-submarine warfare and other activities,” GRSE chairman and managing director Rear Admiral (retd) V K Saxena said.

The Israeli firm already builds USVs. If GRSE were to start building them, they would have at least 60% indigenous content, the MoU states. Another signatory in the document is Bharat Electronics Ltd (BEL) that has already started work on advanced sensors for these small vessels. GRSE has also held discussions with Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and its Naval Science & Technological Laboratory (NSTL) to work out possible designs.

“In its Request For Information (RFI), the Navy was interested in procuring 12 USVs. We responded to the RFI and are now waiting for the RFP. I think that the Navy is keen to utilise the USVs in their mine-control measure mode. These vessels have tremendous potential and we are preparing to receive orders,” Rear Admiral Saxena added.

The Navy is in desperate need of minesweepers that are crucial to keep sea lanes safe for passage of capital ships and carrier groups. Efforts to build 12 minesweepers in Goa for Rs 32,000 crore didn’t go too well and with India set to commission her first indigenous and the Navy’s second aircraft carrier, there is a search for alternatives. The USVs are a cheaper and effective alternative.

GRSE has also built and exhibited a lightweight assault bridge for the Army. This bridge can be broken into pieces and carried by advancing troops with other equipment. Whenever the soldiers need to bridge a gap hindering their advance, the pieces can be fitted together.

According to the CMD, the bridge has already been checked out by Army chief General M M Naravane.

84,['19/02/2020'],Navy gets 4th anti-sub warfare corvette,"This story is from February 19, 2020

Kolkata: The first three Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) Corvettes delivered to the Navy by Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers (GRSE) have already been very effective in detecting unfriendly submarines snooping near Indian waters, the company’s chairman and managing director Rear Admiral (retd) V K Saxena said on Tuesday.

During the day, GRSE handed over the INS Kavaratti, the fourth and last ship in this series, to the Navy. This is the 104th warship built by the shipyard in Kolkata.

“This project involving four ASW Corvettes was a national one. Real indigenisation started with these vessels. The level of indigenisation achieved for all four vessels was nearly 90%. Indigenous steel (DMR 249A) was also used for naval shipbuilding in this project. These are not small platforms. They have a displacement of 3,250 tonnes each. We have now achieved self-reliance. Apart from the steel, the propulsion systems, weapons platforms and sensors are all indigenous. The sensors include sonars that are so essential for tracking submarines,” Rear Admiral Saxena said.

The INS Kavaratti is the most advanced among the four vessels. According to the CMD, the indigenisation content for the last two vessels — the INS Kavaratti and INS Kiltan — is about 87%. This is primarily due to the carbon-composite superstructure of these two ships. GRSE tied up with a Swedish firm to develop the superstructures and integrate them to the steel hulls. This was also a first for any warship in the country. Reduced weight resulted in more stability and speed.

“In the last 32 months, we delivered 12 warships. We have been told by the Navy that the ASW Corvettes are doing a wonderful job in detecting unfriendly submarines. We plan to complete two Fast Patrol Vessels for the Coast Guard by March and a Landing Craft Utility for the Navy by April. We are also working on Stealth Frigates, Survey Vessels (Large) and Shallow Water ASW Crafts for the Navy. We are investing Rs 200 crore in Rajabagan Dockyard and in the next couple of years, GRSE will be building 24 ships concurrently,” Rear Admiral Saxena said.

Prem Kumar

GAYA: Gaya Town MLA and state agriculture minister Prem Kumar on Monday reviewed the execution of Rs 311 crore water supply scheme for providing tap water to the residents of 53 wards of Gaya Municipal Corporation. Funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the contract for the scheme’s execution has been awarded to a Chennai-based firm.

As per the terms of the agreement, 447km water pipeline , 16.54 km transmission line, five overhead service reservoirs and three ground-level service reservoirs have to be made in the city. Besides the above, the agency is also required to renovate seven existing ground-level reservoirs and provide tap water connection to 75,000 households in the town. The scheme, as per the terms of the contract, has to be fully executed before September 2021.

During site inspection, the minister was flooded with complaints about the haphazard implementation of the scheme. As per the complaints, the scheme was being implemented in a piece-meal manner with no time line. The complainants also alleged that the construction company has dug up roads for laying pipeline but has not undertaken the road repair work. As per the contract conditions, the agency has to repair the roads immediately after laying the pipes.

Bihar Urban Infrastructure Development Corporation (BUIDCO) is the nodal agency for the project. According to a press statement issued by Narendra Lohani, OSD to agriculture minister, the minister was informed that so far, tap water under the scheme has been provided to 5500 households against the target of 75,000 households. The minister was also informed that as against the target of 447km-long pipeline, 130 km pipeline has been laid till date.

Prem directed the officials concerned to maintain the time line as well as quality of work and strictly adhere to the specifications. He also directed the officials to seriously address the grievances of the intended beneficiaries.

Asked about the execution of the scheme, Gaya DM Abhishek Singh said the district administration was not involved in the scheme’s execution. However, he would take up the matter with the officials concerned during periodic review meets.

Representative image

PATNA: Two primary school teachers in Patna were terminated for boycotting examination duty on the first day of BSEB Matriculation examinations on Monday. A letter in this regard was issued by Patna DEO Jyoti Kumar late on Monday evening.

The two permanent teachers – Manoj Kumar from Middle School in Nooruddinganj, Malsalami and Mohd Mustafa Azad from Prathmik Vidyalaya , Chakaram – had failed to report to their respective examination centres at Marwari Uchh Vidyalaya, Patna City and BMP-5 Uchh Madhyamik Vidyalaya, for examination duty.

“We have taken action against the two teachers for boycotting examination duty on the instruction of additional chief secretary of education department R K Mahajan,” Jyoti said.

Mahajan also directed the DMs, municipal commissioners, deputy development commissioners and DEOs to dismiss the contractual teachers who are on strike in the middle of Matriculation examinations. “End the service of these teachers and appoint new teachers in their place,” the letter read.

Around 4 lakh contractual had gone on indefinite strike on Monday under the banner of Bihar Rajya Shikshak Sangharsh Samanvay Samiti (BRSSSS) in support of their eight-point charter of demands, including equal pay for equal work. Some permanent teachers have also come out in support of the strike launched by their contractual counterparts.

Meanwhile, several teachers’ associations have expressed concern over the action against the two permanent teachers. “The DEO has no authority to dismiss the teachers. He should withdraw the dismissal letter or be ready to face fierce agitation by teachers,” they said.

Manoj Kumar, a member of Bihar State Primary Teachers’ Association, said he would fight for the rights of contractual teachers till his last breath. “We will not get scared by such action by the education department. We were appointed by the director of primary education. The DEO cannot dismiss us,” he said.

Markandey Pathak, member of Shikshak Sangarsh Samiti, said the state government wants to take away the teacher’s constitutional right to protest. “Teachers are not afraid of any action. By dismissing two teachers, the government is provoking us to launch a radical movement,” he said.

Meanwhile, an education department official said the DEO had the power to take action even against the permanent teachers. “The DEOs have been asked to prepare the list of absentee teachers for further action,” the official said.

PATNA: Unidentified armed criminals looted about Rs.18 lakh in two different incidents in Muzaffarpur and Vaishali districts on Tuesday, close on the heels of loot of Rs.12.8 lakh cash from a nationalized bank at Motipur in Muzaffarpur on Monday.

In the first incident, a gang of five armed criminals entered the office of a private finance company at Saraiya Bazaar under the Saraiya police station area around 2.45 pm on Tuesday and looted Rs.15.5 lakh. Two of the robbers had covered their faces with helmet and towel to hide their identity.

An employee of the company Anuj Kumar Singh told police that while three criminals entered the cash counter and collected the cash after holding the employees and customers hostage at gun-point, two stood guard near the main entrance of the office. The operation lasted hardly for three minutes.

The robbers, who were in the age group of 20 and 25 years, escaped with the cash towards Vaishali on motorbikes, which they had parked on the main road. On getting information, Saraiya SDPO Rajesh Kumar along with Saraiya police station SHO Ajay Paswan rushed to the spot and inquired about the incident.

The SDPO said that the robbers attacked the office when the employees were about to leave for the Bank of India to deposit the amount. Around 40-50 customers were also present in the office at the time of the incident. The security guard, Ajit Kumar, however, couldn’t resist and he was caught off guard.

The SDPO later told the media that efforts were on to ascertain the identity of the gang involved in the daylight loot. “The CCTV footage will help the police ascertain the identity of the robbers,” he said adding that the borders of the district have been sealed and a vehicle-checking drive has been launched to nab the robbers.

In another incident, three armed criminals looted Rs.2.5 lakh from a customer service point (CSP) at Rohua village under the Bhagwanpur police station area in Vaishali district. The incident took place around 2 pm when three employees were on duty and busy in dealing with the customers in the office.

Earlier on Monday, motorbike-borne criminals had looted Rs.12.8lakh from Motipur branch of the Bank of India in Muzaffarpur district . The robbers had also snatched cash from the customers who were present in the bank at the time of the incident.

Taking a serious note of frequent incidents of cash loot in two neighbouring districts—Muzaffarpur and Vaishali—the state police headquarters has deployed a contingent of special task force (STF) in the region. Last month, DGP Gupteshwar Pandey had reviewed the law and order situation in Vaishali.

BHAGALPUR: Appreciating the strength and expertise of Bihar Agricultural University (BAU), Sabour, in teaching, research and extension areas in agricultural sciences, governor-cum-chancellor Phagu Chauhan motivated and advised the students to make an endeavour to become the best, while delivering the sixth convocation address of the varsity.

He elaborated the contribution of the institution in agricultural development of the state and said that the Indian economy as well as of Bihar is based on agriculture and hence all care and focus should be on developing the agriculture sector by reaping the benefits of technological advancements and researches.

Praising BAU, Chauhan said, “Bihar’s growth rate is 15% and the state is expected to lead another ‘Green Revolution’ to boost farming and allied sectors. Referring to state government’s initiative ‘Jal Jivan Hariyali’ mission, the governor said that the success of the initiative depends on agriculture graduates and scientists. Terming ‘global warming’ as dangerous for life on earth, Chauhan said agriculture scientists and researchers have an onerous task to thwart this peril by initiating steps, besides creating awareness among farmers as well as common masses.

Altogether 274 students of Bihar Agricultural University (BAU), who successfully completed courses in different agricultural streams, were conferred degrees by governor-cum-chancellor Phagu Chauhan at the sixth convocation ceremony held on BAU premises on Tuesday.

Out of 274 students who received degrees, 155 were undergraduates (BSc), 100 postgraduates (MSc) and 19 were PhD scholars. Five scholars, including BC Anu (MSc–Agriculture), Sanju Kumari (BSc-Agriculture), Usha Kiran (BSc-horticulture), Rishav Kumar (best PhD thesis) and Sriniwas Raghvan A (for best teacher) received gold medals and certificate of merit from the chancellor during the ceremony.

Earlier, Chauhan, who flew to Bhagalpur to confer degrees at BAU, was given the guard of honour on his arrival on the varsity premises. Chauhan was accompanied by state agriculture minister Prem Kumar.

Talking about the agriculture roadmap of state government, minister Prem Kumar urged the graduates to use their knowledge and skills in serving the society along with their professional pursuits.

Dwelling on state’s agriculture roadmap, Prem said, “The focus should be on improving the productivity of land and thereby more income for farmers are required. Substantial increase in agricultural and allied produce means food security with socio-economic changes. Farmers in Bihar are hard working and gifted. The need is to make intelligent use of natural resources to augment the yield of foodgrains, vegetables, oilseeds, fruits, spices, flowers and other farming pursuits through systemic management. The objective of the state government and the central government is to double the income of farmers by 2022.”

Referring to the academic standards of BAU and researches in the university, vice-chancellor Ajoy Kumar Singh said, “The university has a worldwide impact with students getting employments in both government and private sectors, including MNCs.”

The VC also referred to various innovative tools like mobile applications—Farmers First, Kisan Choupal and ‘ Jai Vigyan Jai Kisan ’, among others for dissemination of information for farmers.

Others who spoke on the occasion included Swami Atmapriyananda, vice-chancellor of Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda Educational and Research Institute , Kolkata. Present on the occasion included JD(U) MP Ajay Kumar Mandal, JD(U) MLAs Subodh Rai (Sultanganj), Laxmikant Mandal (Nathnagar), Niraj Kumar alias Gopal Mandal (Gopalpur), Zila Parishad chairman Tuntun Sah besides senior officials from Patna and Bhagalpur.

CHENNAI: The Volkswagen Group — which includes brands like Volkswagen, Skoda , Porsch e, Lamborghini and Audi — is using a two-tier strategy to make the most of back-end synergy among its operations in India.Within the group, individual brands are running their marketing and brand functions independently while sharing back-end support on group functions. That helps niche, small volume brands like Porsche or Lamborghini keep operational costs low, senior group officials said.Take Lamborghini India for example which sells cars priced upwards of Rs 2 crore. “We are part of the Volkswagen Group in India and we get a lot of support and synergies on a group level. Our sales, marketing and after-sales services are independent. But the management of the business, the back end side including HR support, logistics, finance and all is shared on a group level. This helps us leverage the strength of the group and optimize our business cost. We have common functions for more efficiency and then there are brand specific functions run independently,” said Sharad Agarwal , head, Lamborghini India. This synergy comes from a restructuring that the group announced just four months ago. Volkswagen had then announced that it was combining its factories, manpower and brands under a single umbrella in India.This combining of all efforts works well Lamborghini. The company, said Agarwal, sold just 8,152 cars globally last year of which India contributed 52 cars, up from 45 in 2018. “Overall the super luxury car segment in India is still very niche.

MANGLAURU: Jana Shikshana Trust , an NGO which is spearheading campaigns for literacy and cleanliness , has suggested to the government to make anganwadis in Dakshina Kannada child-friendly.

The measures suggested are providing basic facilities, having fruit and vegetable gardens and constructing compound walls through the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS).

The trust has written to the chief secretary of Karnataka, seeking permission to make 1,206 anganwadis child-friendly by providing basic facilities, including walls, and to develop gardens through MGNREGS. Trust director and former ombudsman of MGNREGS for Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts, N Sheena Shetty told TOI that anganwadis can be made child-friendly by taking up works through MGNREGS.

While there are 2,104 anganwadis in Dakshina Kannada district, 1,876 have their own buildings. However, only 670 have compound walls and 1,206 lack proper security to protect the property. As a result, there is no protection for the garden developed by members of various self-help groups through MGNREGS in those anganwadis, he said.

Shetty said an anganwadi at Beeriga in Bannur village of Puttur taluk has created a beautiful garden with flowers and horticulture crops in its premises through MGNREGS. At present, the anganwadi also has been identified as an information centre for MGNREGS. Many families in the nearby villages have utilised MGNREGS for the development of horticulture farms, cowsheds and open wells. Similarly, an anganwadi in Manavalike village of Perabe in Puttur has also developed a garden and horticulture farm through MGNREGS. However, they find it difficult to protect the gardens and farms, since they could not construct walls for the property through MGNREGS.

“Recently, the government has allowed construction of walls for schools under MGNREGS. However, the same provision has not been extended to anganwadis. Hence, the government should make provisions for the construction of walls for anganwadis under MGNREGS,” he said, adding that a request has already been sent to the chief secretary of Karnataka for the same.

94,['19/02/2020'],Shepherd stole AK-47 from police station: Top cop,"This story is from February 19, 2020

Carbine gun (left) and AK-47

HYDERABAD: Shepherd Devuni Sadanandam (38) walked into Husnabad police station (PS), opened the room where the firearms were kept (bell of arms), stole an AK-47 and a carbine gun and simply walked away. It reads like a scene straight out of a Telugu potboiler. But, police are convinced this is exactly what had happened in the early hours of March 2017 at the PS where Sadanandam had also managed to steal a magazine containing 30 live rounds.

The Akkannapet village’s shephered has been much in news recently after he turned the AK-47 on his neighbour Gunti Gangaraju (32) on the night of February 7 over a petty row on cement bricks. “Sadanandam waited near the PS till 4 am on Holi festival day that year. After making sure that there was nobody in the front hall of the PS, he picked up the keys hung to the wall. He opened the bell of arms and stole two weapons,” Siddipet in-charge commissioner N Swetha Reddy said.

A police source said the two weapons were issued in the name of constable B Narender, who was gunman of Husnabad inspector. Narender was already booked under section 409 of the IPC. “Sadanandam waited in an underconstruction building near the PS. He entered the PS when the sentry constable fell asleep and took away the two firearms,” said the police source. Curiously, an FIR was lodged on the missing AK-47 on April 18, 2018, more than a year after it went missing from the PS.

Police also said Sadanandam was familiar with Husnabad PS as he had visited the premises multiple times in connection with a domestic violence complaint filed by his wife and another case pertaining to Rs 1 lakh borrowed by a neighbour, Komuravva, in 2016.

“When Sadanandam asked Komuravva to reutrn the money to purchase a house, she refused to do so and he lodged a complaint with Husnabad police. He was attacked by Komuravva’s family members and relatives when he insisted on his money. Sadanandam even approached the Akkannapet police. It was during this time, he got the idea of obtaining a firearm to threaten his enemies,” police mentioned in the remand report of Sadanandam. Komuravva in the mean time returned the money, while Sadanandam hid the two firearms in his house. Three years after he stole the firearms, Sadanandam whipped out the AK-47 and shot at Gangaraju. Luckily, the shepherd missed his shot as the bullet whizzed past the neighbour’s head.

“In fact, he tried to attack Gangaraju on Feb 5 but the assault rife did not fire due to rusting. He then went to Basvapur village where he had worked in a saw mill and purchased machine oil. He went to a hillock in Basvapur, de-assembled the AK-47 using the knowledge he gained by watching Youtube videos and cleaned them with the oil.

95,['19/02/2020'],Uttar Pradesh: Rare vintage beauties from Nawab’s garage,"This story is from February 19, 2020

A 1949 Buick among many other vintage cars

RAMPUR: Plymouth (1957), Dodge convertible (1954), Austin convertible (1956), Buick (1939), Jeep Willys (1956), Fiat (1956) and Fargo trucks – the Rampur royals’ Khasbagh Palace has now unravelled a set of royal beauties on wheels that is any collector’s dream.

Eight months after the Supreme Court passed judgment for the division of the property among the family members of the erstwhile Rampur Nawab in July 2019, the district administration is evaluating the moveable and immoveable properties of the erstwhile royals.

The garage of Khasbagh Palace was unlocked amid tight security recently.

After this, there are four more palaces to be opened and an inventory is to be made of its valuables.

Court-appointed commissioner Saurabh Saxena said, “We will be consulting the cars’ foreign manufacturers before evaluation them.""

Kashif Khan, spokesman of Kazim Ali Khan, one of the 16 claimants of the royal properties, told TOI, “All these 20 cars were imported from European countries as well as the US. They have been lying in the garage since 1972 when the litigation started. Kazim Ali Khan plans to restore these cars to their early glory and send them to vintage car rallies following distribution of all the properties.”

Saleem Khan, 77, who was appointed superintendent of Khasbagh Palace in the sixties and still retains the post, said, “Sir Raza Ali Khan, who was the Nawab of Rampur from 1930 to 1966, was very fond of his Austin and Plymouth. They carried specialized registration numbers in gold on red number plates. When the Nawab’s cars were on road, all the traffic was blocked. Even trains were put on halt and crossing gates were not closed. Visiting foreign dignitaries and diplomats often enjoyed rides in these cars along with royal family members.”

According to Saleem Khan, former Rampur rulers travelled in their own luxurious railway saloons which are now parked at Nawab Rampur railway station, a private station the erstwhile royals built for themselves and which still stands just behind the present-day Rampur Junction. The private railway station is also one of the properties to be evaluated and distributed.

While deciding one of India’s longest running civil suits, which the SC finally brought to a close after 47 years of trial in July 2019, bench of then Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi and Justices Deepak Gupta and Aniruddha Bose held the princely rule of primogeniture (the right of succession belonging to the firstborn child) will not apply in the succession of the private properties of a former ruler.

The bench also ordered that the properties of the erstwhile ruler of Rampur would be divided by metes and bounds among his successors as per the Muslim law.

It directed the District Judge of Rampur to appoint a commissioner to ensure division of movable and immovable properties among the successors.

Rampur State, a 15 gun-salute princely state, was founded in 1775 by Nawab Faizullah Khan. The Rampur Nawabs gave refuge to some of the literary figures from the court of Bahadur Shah Zafar, including Mirza Ghalib.

The Nawabs of Rampur sided with the British during Indian Rebellion of 1857 and this enabled them to continue to play a role in the social, political and cultural life of Northern India.

NAGPUR: Around 20 personnel of city police have been deployed in two shifts to complete the work of digitization of service books of 558 officers, from the ranks of police sub-inspector (PSI) to inspector (PI), before the deadline of February 20.

The work is part of ‘Maharashtra police information and analysis system’ ( MPIAS ) project, which being completed on war-footing to facilitate the general transfers and promotions of officers from the office of the state director general of police (DGP). In a circular, the DGP office has made it compulsory for all units to digitize service books of officers before the deadline. The general transfers and promotions generally take place in April-May annually.

The service books of the officers contain crucial records of his or her career in 48 categories, starting from joining dates, to past promotions, rewards, punishments, medals, qualifications, work experience, region of work and other details. The service books are referred for promotions, postings and transfers.

In state, MPIAS is the most ambitious digital platform for policing to be implemented since Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and System ( CCTNS ). The work of MPIAS is being supervised by Addl DG, Wireless department, Ritesh Kumar.

While the administrative management of officers from the ranks of sub-inspector to inspectors, like their transfers, promotions and also punitive actions, are done from the office of DGP, the officers above the PI ranks are being dealt with by the home department.

Deputy commissioner of police, headquarters, Vikram Sali said two-member teams were put in place for support and operation to digitize the service books. “We have already digitized the records of around 400 officers and expect to complete the rest in time,” he said.

The city police have also formed a committee for the implementation of MPIAS under Joint CP Ravindra Kadam and Sali as member secretary. “The senior officers are regularly supervising the progress,” he said.

Sali said the officers would get alerts on their emails and mobile phones regarding transfers and promotion processes as soon as it begins. “The officers can now update their choices in posting or in transfers online from their mobile phones or laptops after their service books are digitized, unlike in the past when it had to be done manually and sent to the DGP office,” he said.

Uttam addressing gathering at party’s dharna at Dharna Chowk

Hyderabad: Congress on Monday launched a scathing attack against BJP and TRS terming them anti-Dalit and sought to caution SCs, STs and BCs that NDA government at the Centre and the Telangana government are bent upon scrapping reservations for these communities.

Referring to the Supreme Court’s recent judgment that reservations for SCs and STs was not a fundamental right, Telangana Congress president N Uttam Kumar Reddy said the apex court’s observation on quota issue was a result of misleading and misrepresentation by the BJP government.

“BJP and RSS are against reservation for SC, ST, OBC and minorities. The SC verdict has created confusion, but the Narendra Modi-led BJP government at the Centre is not giving clarity. It is not even trying to assure SC, ST, OBC and minorities that the quota would remain untouched,” Uttam said while addressing the gathering at the party’s dharna at Dharna Chowk near Indira Park, organised to instil confidence among these communities that Congress would stand by them and ensure reservations would be continued.

Barring a couple of leaders who were busy with cooperative chairman elections, it was a full-house as all seniors attended the dharna.

Congress leaders slammed TRS for failing to fulfil its promise of enhancing quota for Muslims to 12% and STs to 10% in Telangana. They reminded it was Congress which introduced reservations even in premier institutions like IITs and IIMs and that Congress tried to provide reservation to BCs in law-making bodies.

Malkajgiri MP A Revanth Reddy said: “Modi is coming out with new laws to divert attention of people from failures of BJP government on the economic front. AIMIM president and Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi should remember it was Congress which had supported his father Sultan Salahuddin Owaisi in the past. What will be the fate of Asaduddin Owaisi if Congress goes all out against him,” Revanth added.

Vellore: The Jolarpet police from Tirupattur district on Tuesday arrested two more accused in the murder of an 18-year-old Bengaluru-based boy who was hacked to death by a three member gang when he visited his grandmother’s house in Yelagiri.

A senior police officer said Abi of Bengaluru had came to Yelagiri village located near the Yelagiri foothills to visit his maternal grandmother who lives in Ambedkar Nagar.

On Sunday night, Abi along with his relative Yukesh, 20, while speeding down the narrow streets of the congested neighbourhood on a bike, were intercepted by Daya alias Dayalan, 40, his brother Kumar, 35, and Dayalan’s friend Ragul, 21, of the same locality. The three people were allegedly drunk.

Enraged after Abi’s derisive response to him, Daya got into a scuffle with Abi. Later, they were pacified following the intervention of some residents.

Subsequently, Dayalan, Kumar and Ragul who were waiting to avenge the incident, attacked Abi and Yukesh with machetes when they came to a field near the village to attend to nature’s call.

In the attack, Abi had died on the spot and Yukesh sustained severe cut injuries and was being administered treatment at Tirupattur Government Hospital.

Jolarpet police officers who arrested Dayalan on Monday morning, nabbed his brother Kumar and Ragul on Tuesday. A case under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code has been registered and investigation is on.

BIJNOR: Stuck for more than a decade, Madhya Ganga Canal project on Tuesday got a lease of life after the UP government allocated whopping Rs 1,736crore for the completion of the channel which will irrigate agricultural lands from Bijnor to Sambhal. During the last year’s budget, the state government had set December 2019 as the deadline for the completion of the project. But, lack of funds halted the work on the project.

Now, the state plans to complete the 66-km long canal by this year end. The project had begun in 2007-08 and the entire cost was put at Rs 1061crore. However, due to the delay in land acquisition process, the work started in 2009.

Later, in 2014, the work again came to a halt after the sanctioned budget was exhausted. The cost of project also spiked after the new Land Acquisition Act.

The revised estimate shot up to Rs 4,400crore in 2017. In 2018 around Rs 500 crore were released to start the work.

Officials of irrigation department told TOI that farmers have been anxiously waiting for years to get water from this canal.

The Madhya Ganga Canal, which starts from Bijnor, will irrigate Moradabad, Sambhal, Amroha and Badaun districts. About 2.26 lakh hectare agriculture land will be irrigated by this canal.

The work on this ambitious project, which includes a 66-km long main canal and 250-km of smaller canals beginning from Ganga barrage in Bijnor, remained stalled for three years, because of lack of fund. Later, the state government sanctioned Rs 1,770crore and set a deadline of December 2019.

Reading out the budget in the assembly, UP’s finance minister Suresh Khanna said, “Government has set a target for the completion of 14 irrigation projects, including Madhya Ganga Canal phase-2, Arjun Sahayak irrigation project and Saryu Nahar Pariyojana etc. An amount of Rs 1,736crore has been sanctioned for Madhya Ganga Canal.”

Farmers in western UP hailed the announcement.

State president of BKU’s youth wing, Digambar Singh, said, “Once Madhya Ganga Canal is completed, it will recharge ground water in different pockets of the districts.”

Panaji: After WRD called on citizens to register their open wells, 6,502 wells have been entered into the records while another 1,025 borewells are registered with the WRD.

WRD chief engineer Shrikant Patil said that registering wells helps the department monitor if there is overexploitation of groundwater. However, he said that the plan to fit commercial water tankers with GPS to monitor overexploitation of groundwater by them is yet to materialise. “It is an effort which involves more than one department as the tankers register with the RTO for vehicle permits. We will be tying up with the transport department to install the tankers with GPS,” Patil added.

Patil said whenever complaints of contamination of well water is received, the water is tested at the WRD lab at the headquarters in Porvorim.

“WRD has a committee headed by the chief engineer, which meets at least once a month. We scrutinise applications seeking to extract water from wells by industries, for construction purpose and by individuals for commercial purpose. Recently, permission was sought to dig up four wells for construction of the Mopa international airport but the committee allowed only one, Patil said, adding, “Once the applications come, a technical study is carried out to check yield of the well and a limit is set as to how much can be drawn from it.”

When permissions are sought for new wells, it is ensured that they are not permitted within 100m of an existing well to preserve the acquifers.

“In 2019, 237 permissions were granted for extraction of groundwater, 132 for transportation of water and 151 water tanker permits were renewed. In 85 wells, inspection was carried out to check quality and yield parameters and permission to extract water was withdrawn after violations of seven wells, like sinking a new well first and then seeking permission,” Patil said.

Thiruvananthapuram: It has been more than a decade since Raheena, a mother of two, went out of her home alone or even attended a wedding function in her neighbourhood . It was not that she did not want to, or she was allowed to. She simply could not afford to leave her 15-year-old son Fasal, who has a learning difficulties, even for a minute.

For her, Tuesday could very well be the best day of her life. In the morning, she boarded a flight from Kannur airport along with her son, reached the capital city an hour later, visited the zoo and legislative assembly, which she and her son had seen only on television and finally ended the day at Shangumugham Beach.

Raheena and Fasal were not alone in their journey. They were accompanied by 25 other children with special needs and their mothers.

The children were all students of Government Vocational Higher Secondary School, Payyoli in Kannur. The group comprised of 26 children having cerebral palsy, mental retardation and autism. “Our school has over 3,000 students and 30 of them have conditions of cerebral palsy, mental retardation and autism. Four of them could not make the trip owing to various inconveniences,” said Binoy Kumar, the principal of the school. The trip was made possible with the help of residents and Payyoli panchayat that chipped in funds. The state police department coordinated the group’s trip, food and accommodation here.

“We organized this trip for the mothers and not for the children,” Binoy Kumar said.

“These children are dependent on their mothers. So, it is important that these woman have travelled to places and gain new experiences in order to support their children better,” he said adding that all these women and children hail from families with moderate and poor family backgrounds.

The response of women like Raheena prove that Binoy Kumar is right.

Kochi: The State of India’s Birds 2020 , a report published by independent researchers associated with NGOs and institutions like SACON, Wildlife Institute of India and Natural History Society, says the bird population in Kerala is on the decline. It identifies 15 species in urgent need of conservation.

Disappearing wetlands and changing landscape is affecting bird population and habitats, says the report which calls for conservation measures and more data to look at long-term trends. Of the 15, two are vulture species, the white-rumped vulture and the red-headed vulture, seen only in Wayanad. Among the wetland dependent birds whose numbers are declining are the Pacific golden plover and the cinnamon bittern. The forest-dependent species include banasura laughingthrush (chilappan), ashambu laughingthrush (chilappan), white-bellied sholakili, broad-tailed grassbird, Nilgiri thrush, Nilgiri pipit, heart-spotted woodpecker, Nilgiri wood pigeon, forest wagtail, Tytler’s leaf warbler and great hornbill.

Of the 15 species of conservation concern are two migratory birds — forest wagtail and Pacific golden plover. “We have 9,800 sqkm of forest consisting of protected and reserve areas. Yet we are seeing so many species being affected, including the migratory birds — one from the forests and other from the wetlands. This indicates that we have been complacent, and we need to find reasons as to why it’s happening,” said P O Nameer, professor with Centre for Wildlife Studies at Kerala Agricultural University and an independent reviewer of the report.

Nameer said the report is based on facts and has revealed interesting and worrying information on the state of avians. “The state government can now develop a clear-cut strategy to understand what the probable reason could be as to why bird numbers are declining in forests too.”

Vishnu Priyan, secretary of Cochin Natural History Society (CNHS), who is actively involved in the Kochi bird count said, “If one were to look at the last waterbird census, the decline in populations is being noticed. Birds are adapting to the urbanised environment.”

He said that sparrows and house crows are adapting to the changes, including their food habits. As for wetlands, the decline is definite when compared to the last several years.

One of Kerala’s concerns has always been its disappearing wetlands. The report states that like most other groups, waterbirds show overall long-term declines, a trend that appears to be continuing today. Migratory shorebirds and gulls & terns appear to have declined the most, although waterfowl (ducks & geese) and other resident waterbirds (like swamphens, coots and storks) also show clearly discernible declines.

The steep decline in migratory shorebirds mirrors population trends reported from monitoring of Arctic-breeding shorebirds. Whether these declines are due to changing conditions at breeding, staging or wintering sites (or all three) remains unknown.

Resident waterbirds appear to be badly affected, with severe declines in the past five years, a worrying trend that calls for a detailed investigation, the report said.

Bucking the trend, Indian peafowl numbers have been increasing. The abundance trend is that of a general increase, both in the long term and currently. The report said this trend appears to result from a combination of range expansion (eg. into Kerala, from where it was formerly absent), and a population increase virtually throughout its distribution. The reasons for this pattern have not been investigated in detail, but expansion into Kerala may be associated with an overall drying trend, it said.

The State of India’s Birds report is the first comprehensive assessment of the distribution range, trends in abundance and conservation status for most of the bird species that regularly occur in India. With their ubiquity and ecological importance, birds are excellent indicators of the state of the natural world and are potent cultural symbols of nature. This national-level assessment of birds is a significant step forward in the monitoring and conservation of India’s rich and varied biodiversity, the report said.

Researchers and volunteers from organisations including Wildlife Institute of India, SACON, World Wildlife Fund, Nature Conservation Foundation, Wetlands International, BNHS India, ATREE, FES and NCBS-TIFR were involved in the report.

Amareswar Galla, founding director, International Centre for Inclusive Cultural Leadership, Anant National Uni... Read More

Kochi: During the Roman period, muslin was one of the most prized exports of ancient Mysolia in Krishna valley region of Andhra Pradesh. When Amareswar Galla was growing up in Amaravathi, with a tangible heritage of nearly two millennia, it still had many places that produced muslin.

“It’s all gone now. Died out. Isn’t it a shame that after 2,000 years, such an amazing world-class heritage in the birthplace of muslin is not safeguarded,” asks Galla, an internationally-renowned academic and an authority on heritage conservation.

Currently the founding director of the International Centre for Inclusive Cultural Leadership (ICICL), Anant National University , Ahmedabad, Galla has worked across continents to bring focus on the need to safeguard intangible heritage through community involvement and inclusive approaches.

Because no effort has been made to create institutions for safeguarding intangible heritage, many of them are being lost at a speed that is scary, said Galla, who founded the inclusive museum movement two decades ago.

“Those that are conserved or safeguarded now are mainly centered around institutes that deal with upper castes. Take Kuchippudi or Bharatanatyam for example, they are upper caste practices,” said Galla, highlighting the case of Theyyam which is yet to be recognized as intangible heritage.

He considers Sree Sankaracharya University of Kalady as the only institution in India which is working towards and has attained a level of success in safeguarding such iconic intangible traditions. “If you look at the three intangible heritages recognized by Unesco, Vedic chanting, Koodiyattam and Mudiyettu, they are all in Kerala; there is nothing in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka or Andhra,” said Galla, who had been working closely with the university. “These efforts can have a multiplier effect for people in Kerala and south India to safeguard intangible heritage,” says Galla.

A small country like Vietnam, when compared to India and China, is doing a better job at safeguarding its living heritage, Galla said, because they have developed a national policy . “Vietnam has national legislation that protects intangible heritage and national and provincial approaches for capacity building,” he said.

“We have been talking about it, but India still does not have a policy. Even Kerala does not have one,” says Galla, who feels it is a state which has all the features required to develop such a policy. “People in Kerala are also far more conscious of their heritage,” he said hoping that events like heritage festival hosted in Kochi recently would lead to a change.

“If you want Kerala tourism to be sustainable then you really need state-wide contemporary heritage legislation that deals with both tangible and intangible heritage wealth,” he said.

Kozhikode: Finance minister T M Thomas Isaac has announced a 12-point plan for local self-government institutions in the state to enable them to make good use of the Rs 21,000-crore allotment made for local bodies in the state budget .

Inaugurating the state-level Panchayat Day celebrations at the Vythiri Village resort in Wayanad on Tuesday, the minister said though the state has been going through acute financial crisis, 35% of total budget outlay has been earmarked for local bodies in the silver jubilee of decentralization of powers in the state.

“The 12-point scheme includes the hunger-free initiative of providing meals for Rs 25 in the 1,000 food outlets to be set up by the Kudumbashree in the state before Onam,” said the minister.

Isaac said 5,000 Elderly Clubs will be set up in all local self-government bodies. Panchayats will have three such clubs each. He said that 500 grama panchayats and 50 cities will be made to achieve Suchitwa status before Onam. As many as 12,000 public toilets in the form of take-a-break resting centres will be set up.

He said that government is ready to give a Rs 5-crore special development fund to those panchayats that offer space and people’s consent to build the septage treatment plants.

The minister also said waterways of the state will be revived and as an immediate plan 20,000km stretch of these waterways will be cleaned with the help of the respective local body institutions by June.

The planting of one crore trees as cash crops in the state each year is the other project which will be implemented through LSG bodies. Isaac also presented Jeevani, the project to have organic vegetable cultivation in 20,000 hectares, among other points.

Bareilly: The business community of West UP expressed their disappointment with the UP Budget, presented by state finance minister Suresh Kumar Khanna on Tuesday. They claimed that beyond the allocation of Rs 900 crore for the Delhi-Meerut RRTS, their region has been completely neglected.

Industrialists said the state government appears to have assumed that West UP is already prosperous, and so does not need further focus. “We expected Rs 2,000 crore plans for the MSME sector, but the government allocated only Rs 250 crore. There was no mention of developing new industrial areas in the budget. Without new industry, how will the government increase jobs,” said Suresh Sundrani, national vice-president of Indian Industries Association (IIA).

Chairman of IIA Bareilly Piyush Agrawal questioned the allocation of just Rs 50 crore for the newly launched YUVA scheme. “The scheme sounds good and will undoubtedly be beneficial for youths if implemented in its true spirit. But how many youths will benefit from it? Two lakh at most. And they would get training for maximum three months. What will they do when they don’t find jobs after that, since the government didn’t focus on expansion of industries.”

IIA secretary Hardeep Singh Oberai said, “For MSMEs, the government has allocated just Rs 250 crore. It is yet to be made clear where and how this amount will be spent. When the amount is so low, I fear the decision will be political, and the money will go to the districts.”

Sundrani said there are only three industrial areas, Prasakhera, CB Ganj and Bhojipura, in Bareilly. “All three are packed, leaving no room for new factories. The budget has no provision for developing new industrial areas. Without new industries, how will the economy grow?”

Hyderabad: The district court of Adilabad, which convicted three persons in the brutal rape and murder of Samatha and sentenced them to death, sent the case to high court for confirmation of the death penalty.

The bench of Chief Justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A Abhishek Reddy, which took up the case presented to it by the state through public prosecutor Pratap Reddy, issued notices to three convicts and posted the case to March 24. Though the convicts have not filed any appeal in the case, their appeals, if any, filed in the meantime, are expected to come up before the bench and may be clubbed together for hearing.

A special court in Adilabad conducted speedy trial in the case and concluded the trial and pronounced its judgement within two months. The prosecution too had completed the investigation and presented the evidence against the convicts in a swift manner. It secured all the evidence in a scientific manner and the defence could not disprove any of he contentions of the prosecution.

The furore and anguish expressed by the civil society over the brutal rape and murder of Samatha, a Dalit woman, too played a major role in delivering quick justice in the case.

HYDERABAD: The state government again extended the term of the Pay Revision Commission ( PRC ) up to December 31, 2020, on Tuesday giving rise to speculation that the government employees’ may have to wait longer than expected to get revised pay.This is the fourth extension given to PRC after it was constituted in May 2018. Chief secretary Somesh Kumar issued the orders extending the tenure of PRC till year-end based on a letter from PRC chairman. Though the GO was issued on Monday, it came to light on Tuesday.It may be mentioned that 6.5 lakh government employees, including pensioners, are waiting for the implementation of PRC which is due since July 1, 2018. Employees have been demanding 63% fitment which is likely to cost the state exchequer over Rs 18,000 crore. In 2014, the state government had given 43% fitment. As per the official calculation, extending 1% fitment would cost the government Rs 260 crore.Telangana non-gazetted officers (TNGO) association president K Ravinder Reddy told TOI that the tenure extension has been given to PRC as it was given 10 other tasks (terms of reference) in addition to pay revision work.“As per our knowledge, PRC has completed 95% of work on pay scales and is likely to submit its report in March. We had met chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao and are confident that there won’t be any further delays in implementation of PRC,” he said.Sources said a delegation of government employees raised the PRC issue with KCR when they met him on his birthday at Pragathi Bhavan on Monday.

Thiruvananthapuram: With the two protest groups who were served Tuesday morning deadline to shift their venue of protest from in front of the Secretariat , refusing to budge, police are looking for other options now.

On Tuesday, Cantonment police served a notice to Attukal-based contractor Thilakan asking him to shift the pandal from the footpath within 12 hours. “I’m caught between the police and the protesters. Though I approached the protesters, they were not ready to shift. I was summoned to police station in the evening to meet Cantonment CI, but was let off without any discussion,” Thilakan said.

Meanwhile, various political and cultural leaders visited the Shaheen Bagh model protest venue. Congress leader V M Sudheeran slammed the state government for asking to shift the venue. “Though the state assembly passed a resolution against CAA, the government has asked the anti-CAA protesters to shift their protest citing flimsy reasons,” he said.

The Justice for Walayar Kids Forum too received a notice from the police on Tuesday seeking the details of the convener of the protest. “Initially, they asked us the name of the contractor who provided the pandal and chairs. However, we have arranged them all by ourselves. Then, they asked us to provide the details of our convener and to shift within 12 hours,” a forum member said.

Writer B Rajeevan said that the attempts to evict the Walayar protesters show that the government fears it. He said that the police attempt to shift the Shaheen Bagh model protest with the aim of removing the Wayalar protesters.

Bareilly: The half-brother of a 38-year-old woman has been arrested for allegedly murdering her in her house. Police said he was angry that she had eloped and married his friend and was demanding a share in the family property . Recently, she had shifted in the same locality where her family lived and neighbours used to tease the accused about his sister.

According to police, Qayyum Ahmad, 43, often used to visit his half-sister, Aasma Ahmed, wife of Shamim Miyan, in Hajiapur locality in Baradari. The couple had married 18 years ago.

On February 12, Aasma was found dead in her house with her throat slit. Initially, police suspected her husband. During investigation, police found that Qayyum was not happy that Aasma had shifted to the same locality the previous year. They also learnt that Aasma had demanded a share of her father’s property and had quarreled over it with her family.

An FIR was registered against an unidentified killer under IPC section 302 (murder) in the case.

Hyderabad: The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) has given time till May to 127 people from Old City to depose before an inquiry officer and submit original documents in the wake of reports that they were issued notices for obtaining Aadhaar cards on the false pretence. In a press release the UIDAI said the 127 residents were earlier asked to appear before the deputy director on February 20 for a personal hearing.

“Since it may take them some more time to collect their original documents that they had submitted for obtaining Aadhaar, as informed by the state police, we have postponed the personal hearing to May 2020,” it said. Three people who got notices have been asked to come for inquiry at Mega Garden function Hall at Royal Colony Balapur on February 20.

The reports in section of the media had said notices had been issued to them following complaints from police, suspecting them of being illegal immigrants. UIDAI said Aadhaar has got nothing to do with the citizenship issue as such. “Aadhaar is not a document of citizenship and UIDAI has been mandated under the Aadhaar Act to ascertain residency of a person in India for 182 days prior to applying for Aadhaar,” it said. It added that these notices have nothing to do with cancellation of Aadhaar number, which was in no way related to the nationality of any resident.

The Telangana State Joint Advocates’ Committee criticised UIDAI for issuing notices.

A video of the notice issued by the Hyderabad regional office had already gone viral. One such notice, signed by Amita Bindroo, UIDAI deputy director, who is also the inquiry officer, was issued to Sattar Khan of Talabkatta in the Old City. Co-convener of TSJAC MA Hameed said they are ready to provide legal help to those who got notices.

118,['19/02/2020'],"Farmers unhappy with budget, disparage state’s focus on Smart Cities","This story is from February 19, 2020

Pilibhit: Farmers and leaders of farmer unions slammed the UP government for completely ignoring the agricultural sector in its budget, presented by finance minister Suresh Khanna on Tuesday. They said the state government has followed the budgetary model of the Union government, which has intensified woes of farmers and suppressed the entire agricultural sector.

Terming the budget as lackluster, VM Singh, the national convener of All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC), an umbrella organisation of 250 farmer unions from across the country, said the state government has snubbed farmers in the budget, as there was an urgent need to make the state’s sick sugar mills “smart”, instead of earmarking Rs 20,000 crore for the Smart City project.

He said around two dozen sugar mills of the Uttar Pradesh Sugar Mill Federation and Corporation are about to be closed down due to decrepit plant and machinery, which poses a serious dilemma before farmers regarding uncertainty of procurement of their sugarcane crop, but instead of making a budgetary provision for the renovation of these mills, the government has prioritised the Smart City project.

He added that UP’s sugar industry had failed to ensure timely payment to sugarcane farmers, despite Allahabad high court orders, but the government did not feel any need to create a reserve fund to safeguard interests of over 40 lakh farmers in the state.

Criticizing the budget, farmer Manjit Singh of Khandepur village under Puranpur tehsil in Pilibhit, who is also the state secretary of Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD), said the government has made a superfluous provision of Rs 5,791 crore for Swachh Bharat Mission, but forgot to earmark funds for high-speed propellers for procurement centres of paddy and wheat crops, to let farmers segregate chaff from their produce and dry it up to the permitted level of moisture.

He said despite orders of the Apex court, to facilitate farmers with cost of decomposing crop stubble at the rate of Rs 100 per quintal as an anti-air pollution measure, the government made no allocation for it.

The government was also expected to create a buffer stock of fertilizers for 233 crore farmers in the state who have to cope with unexpected shortfalls in availability of agricultural inputs every year, often having to buy urea from the black market, but that too was ignored by the finance minister, said Manjit Singh.

KOCHI: A major fire broke out at the Kochi corporation’s waste treatment plant at Brahmapuram on Tuesday afternoon, leading to thick smoke clouds in the area. This is the first fire incident reported from the plant this year.

The fire was reported around 2.30pm by workers, who were engaged in segregating works at the plant. Fire broke out on the heap of waste dumped behind a structure, where the waste-to-energy plant is proposed to be set up. On February 22 last year, a similar fire broke out at the plant and the blaze continued to rage for more than a week.

The fire on Tuesday has spread across the heaps of garbage dumped in the yard and attempts have been continuing to douse the fire. Around 10 fire tenders from five fire and rescue stations in Ernakulam led by regional fire officer K K Shiju are trying to douse the fire. According to officials, the situation has been brought under control as the officials made a fire line around the burning area so that the fire would not spread to other parts of the area.

“The fire has spread across one portion of the dumping yard and the garbage is still burning. But we think it could be doused completely as we were able to separate the burning garbage to prevent the spread of fire. The reason of the spark is yet to be ascertained,” said regional fire officer (Ernakulam) K K Shiju.

The officials said that the fire broke out in the scorching heat spread fast as the atmospheric temperature and wind fuelled it up. Tonnes of plastic waste have been burnt already and toxic smoke is billowing from the area. Local residents have raised pollution concerns and said that frequent fires will continue at the plant as summer is around the corner.

Fire officials said that they are pumping out water from the nearby Kadambrayar as refilling the fire tenders by going back to the stations is time consuming.

District collector S Suhas said burning garbage has been isolated and the situation was under control . “The PCB has been tracking the pollutions levels and level of toxic gas emission in this area,’’ he said.

Meanwhile, the members of Vadavucode-Puthencruz panchayat, where the plant is situated, blamed Kochi corporation for the latter’s failure to erect fire hydrants and create cleaves in the heap of garbage so as to prevent the fire from spreading to a large area.

“After the fire in February last year, corporation created blocks of garbage. But when they continued to dump waste on each block, the tracks amidst the heaps disappeared. They have not even installed hydrants as well. We will hold a meeting to discuss when the corporation should be allowed to dump waste in the plant,” said ward member Beena Kuriakose.

Meanwhile, mayor Soumini Jain said: “We did everything possible after the fire last year. We bought three motors to pump water on the heap of waste regularly and invited tender of Rs 83 lakhs to prepare layers of crushed gravel on the lanes in the plant. But erecting hydrants is not possible. Though we have filed a complaint with the vigilance to find out the reason behind the fire incidents at the plant, there is no headway yet,” she said.

MANGALURU: Deputy inspector general S B Venkatesh, commander , district headquarters 3, Coast Guard, Karnataka , met governor Vajubhai Rudabhai Vala, chief secretary T M Vijay Bhaskar and head of the police force, Praveen Sood, in Bengaluru on Saturday. While the meetings were described as a courtesy call, Venkatesh used the opportunity to appraise the trio about activities of the Coast Guard and assistance it needs from the administration.

An official communique from Venkatesh on Tuesday stated that he briefed the governor about various facets and developments pertaining to the Indian Coast Guard, especially in the state. With ever increasing challenges of security and safety at sea, discussions focussed on strengthening the maritime domain of the coastal state. Venkatesh also assured the governor that the Indian Coast Guard will continue rescue and relief efforts, whenever fishermen are in distress at sea.

In his meeting with Vijay Bhaskar, the first after assuming command of the headquarters in Panambur, Venkatesh apprised him about developments in the area of responsibility, and plans to strengthen the maritime domain towards securing the Karnataka coastline. Issues relating to Coast Guard facilities, infrastructure, coastal security, fishermen and progress on the proposed setting up of Indian Coast Guard Academy in this coastal city were discussed.

As part of his meeting with Sood, Venkatesh said the need for enhanced security and increased surveillance along the Karnataka coast was discussed. A regular community integration programme is in place in coastal districts to educate and assist fishermen. The thrust is given to educate fishermen about the need for carrying lifesaving equipment for survival at sea, as well as sensitise them to act as the eyes and ears of the coastal security apparatus, he said.

CM meets newly elected members

HYDERABAD: Calling upon the elected representatives and officials of municipalities to repair their bad reputation, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Tuesday said it was their responsibility to build a positive image of the urban local bodies.

“The municipality’s name has become synonymous with drainage, dirt and garbage. Baldia (municipality) has become a second name for corruption. It is often referred to as baldia, khaya, piya, chaldiya (municipality staff came, ate, drank and left),” he said, adding that to fix the bad reputation, a transparent and non-corrupt system must be in place.

Addressing the newly-elected mayors, chairpersons, counsellors, ward members and corporators, the chief minister said that all of them have a responsibility towards transforming municipalities into model towns. Advising the elected representatives to refrain from making false promises of getting all works completed overnight, he emphasised the need for proper planning and the need for awareness on the subject. “Prepare a comprehensive action plan before jumping into execution. Have less photo-ops and focus more on executing the work,” the CM said.

KCR said that Pattana Pragathi programme would be held across the state for 10 days from February 24 to March 4. The programme is expected to begin from dalit bastis where a majority of the poor live. “Town development action plans should be made ward-wise and the subsequent works should also be taken up ward-wise,” he said.

The chief minister set a deadline of three months for completion of public toilets in all towns and cities and directed officials to resolve all power-related issues within eight months. He warned MLAs, mayors, chairpersons and commissioners that they would have to quit their posts if the works were not completed and funds are not spent as per the plan.

Expressing unhappiness over the panchayat raj system, he said that mandal panchayat development officers were negligent and did not tour villages to review the Palle Pragathi programme. He also instructed the collectors to camp in the villages and conduct padayatras to achieve the Palle Pragathi targets.

Box Item: The government is considering giving another opportunity to those who have built unauthorised structures on government land in municipalities to regularise their buildings, as it did in the towns and cities under GOs 58 and 59.

File photo of Narendra Modi and Donald Trump (AFP)

GANDHINAGAR: The Gujarat secretariat is witnessing unprecedented scenes of ministers and bureaucrats getting in touch with the core group of officers, in-charge of executing plans for the big-ticket PM Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump Motera stadium inaugural event.

Sources in the government said even senior ministers have been calling up IAS officers to get passes for their family members and aides who are keen to attend the high profile event.

Confirming this, a top minister in the Rupani government said, “Family members, friends, MLAs and MPs have been relentlessly seeking entry passes for the ‘Namaste Trump’ event at Motera stadium, as a lot of excitement has been generated about the event. Surprisingly, there is no clarity about whom to approach for passes. Many top industrialists are also approaching us for VIP passes. All we can tell them as of now is to wait.”

The minister added that party leaders – both in the government and the organization – saw the event as an excellent opportunity to keep supporters in good humour by arranging passes for them. “It is unfortunate that ministers are not involved in the preparations even as a handful of officials in the government have been entrusted with the task of overseeing all preparations for Trump’s visit,” said the minister.

The minister admitted that it has become rather embarrassing for ministers to call and request bureaucrats for entry passes for their family members and supporters. “This has not happened in the past. Due importance was accorded to ministers and senior party leaders in all such grand events. We hope that the government will address this issue immediately as a wrong message is going through to party supporters that officers are more powerful than elected leaders in the Rupani government,” the minister complained.

Panaji: A dynamic queue management system (DQMS) for senior citizens, procurement of new vehicles, expansion of export parcel services and release of a special cover to commemorate its 180th year are some of the initiatives the department of posts has proposed to launch to improve postal services in Goa.

While DQMS was introduced at post offices in Panaji last February, priority service for senior citizens was added only this New Year’s day. When a senior citizen token is taken under DQMS, the system gives it priority and services are immediately provided. This facility will now be extended to senior citizens at post offices in Mapusa, Ponda and Margao.

Other infrastructural facilities have also been upgraded. N Vinodkumar, postmaster general, Goa region, said Rs 32 lakh has been spent on the renovation of the dilapidated post office in Valpoi. Export parcel services through the foreign post office at Panaji will also be expanded and shifted to the old postmaster general’s office, enabling customers to export commercial and non-commercial consignments.

To improve mail transmission in the state, two new vehicles were procured in 2019 and three more are in the process of being procured to replace the old ones.

It has also been proposed to release a special cover to commemorate the 180th year of expansion of postal services in the state during the National Postal Week in October 2020.

Hyderabad: A fire broke out in the open area opposite Pullela Gopichand Academy near University of Hyderabad on Tuesday. It took fire officials over three hours to douse the fire.

The fire occurred around 2pm. “The dry grass and rubbish in the open space caught fire. Only when the flames started spreading did people notice and alerted the fire control room. Someone must have disposed of cigarette carelessly, which led to the fire,” said a fire official.

Two fire tenders — from Film Nagar and Gachibowli — were pressed into service. “Grass in close to 100 acres of land was gutted in the fire, which broke in the afternoon in the open area and started spreading towards Mushroom rocks in the university,” said Ravinder Reddy, security officer, University of Hyderabad, suspecting that the fire may have occurred due to short circuit on high tension wires or a cigarette butt.

Thrissur: The Thrissur principal sessions judge Sophy Thomas on Tuesday sentenced a 50-year-old woman to life sentence for drowning her four-year-old grandniece at Pazhayi near Pudukkad in 2016 .

The judge has also slapped a fine of Rs 50,000 on the accused Shylaja , who is the wife of late Valiparamban Veettil Vijayan of Ollur. The accused will have to undergo another two years of imprisonment if she failed to remit the fine.

Shylaja had thrown Meba, daughter of Ranjit and Nishma of Nandanam at Mattannur in Kannur, into the Manalippuzha river over ‘enmity between the convict and the family of Meba’s mother’.

On October 13, 2016, Shylaja, who is the sister of Meba’s grandfather took Meba to the banks of Manalippuzha river at Pazhayi near Pudukkad in the district and threw her into the river leading to her drowning.

Prosecutor K D Babu said enmity between Shylaja, and the family of the victim’s mother was the motive for the murder. He said the prosecution had depended on circumstantial evidences and testimonies of the witnesses for proving the role of the accused in the crime.

Both Ranjit and Nishma were in Australia during the trial period. The case also had developed an unusual dimension as the trial had to be conducted through video-conferencing. Ranjit and Nishma, who were prime witnesses in the case, were examined through video conferencing facilities with the consent from the Indian consulate at Melbourne.

Jitesh alias Lalo Vaghamsinh

RAJKOT: Gondal police on Tuesday arrested the wife of a GSRTC bus driver and his brother-in-law (sister’s husband) who had tried to kill him by poisoning his alcoholic drink last month.

The woman Kailash Shiyal and Jitesh alias Lalo Vaghamsinh had an illicit relationship and they were also plotting to kill the latter’s wife Varsha.

After remaining unconscious for nearly 15 days, Kailash’s husband Virendra Shiyal (44) regained consciousness on February 1 and later got to know about their affair from relatives.

According to the plot, Jitesh called Shiyal for booze at his plot near the Gondal highway on January 19 evening. When Shiyal reached there, Jitesh had already kept a glass of liquor ready for him.

However, on drinking a bit from the glass, Shiyal found the taste unusual and refused to have more. Jitesh, who had spiked the drink, persuaded him to have more, but Shiyal said he was feeling uneasy and left for home.

On reaching home, Shiyal fell very ill and collapsed. He was taken to three different hospitals and later admitted to a private one in Gondal town. He remained unconscious till February 1.

All the family members and relatives assumed that he had fallen ill due to liquor consumption. However, another brother-in-law and relatives who came to inquire about this health, revealed about the affair of his wife and Jitesh. They also showed him some objectionable photos and romantic audio conversations that were doing rounds in some Whatsapp groups.

“After confirming about their relationship, Shiyal lodged a complaint against his wife and Jitesh.

We arrested both and booked them for attempt to murder and criminal conspiracy,” said Gondal city police inspector KN Ramanuj.

Jitesh is the husband of Shiyal’s younger sister Varsha. The accused had even plotted to kill Varsha in a similar manner so that they could continue with their relationship smoothly.

For the winged friends: The plan is to set up three sections in the park – sunny, shady and damp

KOCHI: The Maharaja’s College, Ernakulam, plans to set up a butterfly park on its premises as part of its eco-conservation projects and zoology research. The plan is to set up a garden that features several nectar-secreting and flowering plants where butterflies can roost. The park will be set up by the botany and zoology department together and they aim to attract at least 50 species of butterflies. The works will start in the coming months and the authorities are chalking out a detailed plan.

“Maharaja’s College has been engaged in several green initiatives over the past few years and the next step is a butterfly park. We plan to set up the park in front of the zoology department near the principal’s office. The zoology students have found that there are several species of butterflies on the campus, and through the park we aim to give a safe place to them and in future more species can be added. It will be the first such initiative by a college in Kerala,” an official said.

The college officials are collecting the details of the types of plants and climbers locally available, which could attract butterflies. The plan is to set up three sections in the park –sunny, shady and damp — which are ideal for various types of butterfly species. Besides its conservation, the project will fulfil the research requirements of zoology students.

“Butterflies always need a secure place to roost and our aim is to set up a garden for them. Once they sense the safe ambience of the place, they will come in swarms and roost on the plants. We will be planting adult and larva hosting plants for the butterflies,” the official said.

130,['19/02/2020'],"Class IX boy detained for bomb threat, extortion bid","This story is from February 19, 2020

Bareilly: A class IX student was detained by police on Tuesday for allegedly threatening to blow up his school with a bomb and trying to extort Rs 2 lakh from the school manager.

Police have registered a case against the boy under sections 386 (extortion by putting a person in fear of death or grievous hurt) and 507 (criminal intimidation by anonymous communication) of IPC. They have also recorded a non-cognisable report against him for the bomb threat.

According to sources, the 14-year-old boy, hailing from a weak economic background and working as a newspaper boy, allegedly wrote a letter to school manager Anil Kumar Singh on Sunday stating that he had installed bombs on the school campus and in the latter’s house. Hence, a bomb disposal squad was pressed into service but nothing was found. On Tuesday morning, the school manager received another letter demanding Rs 2 lakhs. Hence, he approached police with the letter and lodged a complaint based on which a case was registered against the accused.

Singh said, “I was scared after receiving the letter as it was clearly written that there will be a blast like Pulwama. Immediately, I informed police and the bomb squad was pressed into service. Nearly 400 children study in my school and I cannot risk their lives. Luckily, the bomb squad didn’t find any explosive.”

“The trouble did not end there. On Tuesday, I received a letter demanding Rs 2 lakhs. Hence, I alerted police in this regard. Preliminary inquiry revealed that the paper used for writing the letters were torn from a science notebook. When police checked the notebooks of class IX and X students, we figured out who the accused was. When they questioned him, he failed to give any satisfactory response and said that someone had forced him to write letters. I had to give a written complaint on police request,” he added.

Singh said, “The accused is only 14-year-old and studies in class IX. He is an average student and we have already waived half of his fees because of his poor financial conditions. Son of a labourer, he also distributes newspaper to support his family. We never imagined that he will do such a thing.”

SSP Shailesh Pandey said, “There was panic on receiving the letter and a bomb squad had to be called from outside Bareilly. Circle officer Ashok Kumar and his team were on their toes to ensure that the situation was handled with ease as the school administration and children were scared. We have booked the accused for extortion and earlier an NCR was registered against him under section 507 of IPC. The accused told us that he was inspired by movies to write such letters and wanted to lead a luxurious life.”

Meanwhile, the boy could not be produced before the juvenile board on Tuesday and was lodged at the police station itself.

Vadodara: For 38 years on the trot , except for public prosecutors , the curious case of Rs 692 cheating never saw another face — be it the accused, complainant or even the investigating officer.

Even the lone eye witness turned hostile. But the case continued to be heard, taking much of the court’s time and patience. However, it too lost patience and eventually acquitted the accused in absentia.

The case pertains to a man identified as Arjun Pawar, who was 18-year-old when he had been removed from his job in a cutlery shop on May 13, 1982. After he was sacked, Pawar allegedly forged a letter in his employer’s name and collected an amount of Rs 692.5 fraudulently from two persons.

When Virendra Chandulal, owner of the store learned about the fraud, he lodged a case of cheating against Pawar at the city police station, based on which cops arrested Pawar.

The police took Pawar’s statements along with those of other people connected with the case, collected evidence and filed charge sheet in the court. The court summoned Pawar to appear before it for the first hearing, for which he did and also collected a copy of the charge sheet.

As he pleaded not guilty before the court, it asked the prosecution to present its evidence and witnesses to prove their case from subsequent hearings. Pawar was released on bail.

However, that was the first and last time the court saw Pawar. He never returned for subsequent hearings, nor did the court summons reached him on the address. All bailable, then non-bailable warrants too met the same fate.

The court then issued notice to Pawar’s bail guarantor. The notice returned to court with a stamp on it claiming that the guarantor had passed away. And date after date the case went on till it reached the court of additional chief judicial magistrate G J Shah on January 24, 2020.

Shah ordered that the trial be continued and the sole witness Khemchand Hinduja was to be examined.

Hinduja, who was Pawar’s colleague in the shop then, stated that he never worked at the cutlery store nor can he remember many details of an event that took place decades ago. Hinduja was declared hostile. The other witness had moved to the USA and the summons issued to the complainant also returned empty-handed. Without mention of any policemen in the case papers, the court couldn’t even examine the investigating officer of the case.

Finally, without any more doors to knock on, the court concluded that the prosecution had failed to prove their case and finally acquitted Pawar.

PALANPUR: Eight persons were arrested on Tuesday for allegedly assaulting a 27-year-old groom after pulling him down from a horse and then subjecting him to casteist slurs during a wedding procession in Saripad village, about 12km from Palanpur on Sunday.

Of the 11 accused in the case, police arrested Bhemji Thakor, Shivaji Thakor, Jituji Thakor, Vinodji Thakor, Ramji Thakor and Deepak Thakor; all residents of Saripda village. Three accused are still on the run.

The accused were booked under Prevention of Atrocities Against SCs & STs Act.

According to case details, Aakash Kotiya (Parmar), an army jawan, was attacked when he was on way to Sundha village in the wedding procession. The accused had first gone to Kotiya’s house on learning that they were planning to take out his marriage procession on a horse and hurled casteist slurs at him and his family. They told Kotiya that he had to take birth as upper caste if he wanted to ride a horse.

The victim family then called up the police control room to seek protection for the procession. However, when the procession reached a local dairy, the group of accused persons came there and dragged down Aakash from the horse. They allegedly even snatched his sword and thrashed him.

135,['19/02/2020'],Mining director moved to ease in pro-Left officer?,"This story is from February 19, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: The removal of K Biju , IAS , as the director of sensitive mining and geology department and replacing him with a comparatively junior officer Haritha V Kumar , IAS, is learnt to be a stop-gap arrangement before appointing a non-IAS officer with political backing to a post that holds high stakes in the quarrying industry.

It is learnt that the government has zeroed in on a non-IAS officer of the joint director rank from the department of industries and commerce who is also a leader of pro-Left service organization to the post. “The present appointment is only likely to be for a few days after which the government will appoint the person who has been actually selected for the post,” sources said.

Sources added that in the past, the department has hardly appointed any IAS officer to the post of director of mining and geology, as it is one that has political interests and IAS officers are usually non-pliable when it comes to overlooking rules.

It is learnt that in the latest incident, the government had taken exception to one of the decisions of K Biju as the mining director when he denied permit to a quarrying company citing that it fell within 10km radius of vested forests because of which quarrying cannot be permitted. In the last six months, about 85 quarries were given stop memos on the basis of the Centre’s recent order that quarries functioning within 10km radius of national parks and wildlife sanctuaries will have to take clearance from national board for wildlife.

It is learnt that a proposal citing several shortcomings of the department, including the need for a “full-time director that will help the department to function in an effective manner” was forwarded to the government on behalf of the director by a subordinate official but without the director’s knowledge. This proposal was considered by the government for removing the director from the post.

However, the official version of the government is that Biju has been appointed in the local self-government department as a heavy department like LSGD requires the services of more than one officer. “Since T K Jose, who was additional chief secretary of the department has moved to PWD, only principal secretary Sarada Muraleedharan is in charge of LSGD at present. One more officer is required for sharing the workload, and Biju has been posted to the department after relieving him of his other charges,” sources said.

Kochi: In an initiative to address the challenge of dementia, centre for neuroscience of the Cochin University of Science and Technology ( Cusat ) has joined hands with the district administration to make Ernakulam a dementia-friendly city (DFC) under ‘ Udbodh ’ project. Koovappady is the first panchayat to start the initiative to identify Alzheimer’s patients.

‘Udbodh’ is the third project of the department and envisages a community-based care and support system for people living with Alzheimer’s. “Early detection is key to arresting the progression of the disease. We want to help people reach the clinics so that they get medical assistance,” said Cusat assistant professor and project coordinator Baby Chakrapani.

According to the disability census of 2015, persons with dementia in Kerala have numbered 35,041. “However, it may not be accurate as people are hardly informed and aware about the disease conditions. Hence, it becomes highly essential to provide basic awareness about dementia and implement a proper mechanism to facilitate early detection. It will thus improve the quality of life of people with dementia. Therefore, an interdisciplinary approach is essential to understand the different dimensions of dementia,” he said.

He said that ‘Udbodh’ selected Kochi corporation for building a dementia-friendly community. “Around 35 panchayats in the district have joined the initiative after the district administration evinced interest in the programme. We have been training the panchayat members, Asha and anganwadi workers, who would be going to households in the area and distributing pamphlets on dementia,” Chakrapani said.

During these visits and interactions, it is hoped that the families would be able to identify if any of the members of the household is showing any of these symptoms. A day would be fixed in any local community hall when medical teams from any of the private hospitals, who have tied up with the project, would be present for interaction. After identification, the person would be brought for consultation.

Malappuram: Malappuram police have launched a probe into the mysterious deaths of six children of a family in Tirur over a span of nine years.

Police registered a suo motu case after the death of the sixth child, the three-month-old boy of Tharammal Rafeeq-Sabna couple, natives of Chembra near Tirur, on Tuesday morning. Police also exhumed the body of the boy that was buried on Tuesday morning to ascertain the reason behind the death through postmortem.

According to police, Rafeeq and Sabna got married in 2010 and Sabna gave birth to six children, including four girls, during the past nine years. Five of them had died within months of their birth and one girl died at the age of four. The sixth child, who had no major health issues, died at 6.15am on Tuesday and the funeral was held around 10am. Following this, local residents alerted police, who registered a suo motu case based on the statement given by the relatives of the couple.

Malappuram district police chief U Abdul Kareem said that police will conduct a detailed investigation into the mysterious deaths of the kids and they are expecting to make headway after receiving the postmortem report of the sixth child.

Meanwhile, the preliminary report submitted by the medical team which conducted postmortem examination of 3-month-old boy said there is nothing unnatural in the death. “A detailed report would be submitted to police only after the chemical examination results of body,” said circle inspector of Tirur, T P Farshad.

Meanwhile, Rafeeq’s sister Noorjahan said there was nothing suspicious in the deaths of the children and the family would cooperate with any kind of investigation. “The first child died when she was sixth months’ old and second child died after two months of its birth. The children had no major health issues and doctors were unable to give a proper explanation for the deaths. So, after the death of the third child on the 25th day, we decided to conduct a detailed examination of his body samples at a major private hospital in Ernakulam. But, the report did not specify any reason for the death of the baby boy,” Noorjahan said.

She also admitted that no postmortem was conducted when the fourth and fifth children, aged four and three months respectively, had died.

Tirur DSP K A Suresh Babu said police will examine all medical records related to the treatment of the children. “We have registered a case of unnatural death. We can arrive at a conclusion on the real cause of the deaths only after receiving the postmortem report of the boy,” he said.

PANAJI: Highlighting that the drug menace has infiltrated Goa’s hinterlands, leader of opposition Digambar Kamat demanded that the government clamp down on the drug trade, especially on big traders operating in the state.

Slamming the government for its inaction, Kamat said the state has shown a casual approach to the drug menace and hoped that better sense will prevail and corrective actions will be initiated immediately.

He made the statement in the backdrop of a video going viral of a boy stating that he had consumed drugs which was given free of cost to him. The government, Kamat said, should keep a vigil on the drug trade in Goa.“Educational institutions, teachers, parents will have to play a responsible role to fight the menace,” Kamat said in a statement issued on Tuesday.

Stating that there is complete failure of its intelligence agencies and overall mechanism, Kamat said that to cover up its failures, the government denies the existence of drug trade in the state. “The need of the hour is to catch big traders who are the root cause of the problem.” CM Pramod Sawant had recently told the assembly that there is no drug ring operating.

KOCHI: The India meteorological department (IMD) has taken several steps to modernize and upgrade the cyclone early warning systems in the country, said IMD director general M Mohapatra.“In addition to text bulletins, the warnings in graphics bulletins have been introduced and the time of issue and frequency have been standardized,” Mohapatra, said, while presenting a paper at the recently-concluded international workshop on impact of climate change in Kochi.There are three area cyclone warning centres (ACWCs) — Chennai, Mumbai and Kolkata —and four cyclone warning centres, including one in Thiruvananthapuram. The ultimate responsibility for operational storm warning work for the respective areas rests with these centres. Early warning system is a major component of disaster management in the event of tropical cyclones. Increase in lead period along with increase in accuracy of the forecast of genesis, track, intensity and adverse weather help in better management of disaster due to tropical cyclones.He said that during the recent years, there has been significant reduction in loss of human lives to less than 100 and loss to government exchequer in terms of ex gratia to kin of deceased and injured and cost of evacuation. The success in reducing loss of human lives and loss to government exchequer has been possible due to modernized early warning system for tropical cyclone, which maximized the relevance and effectiveness of the cyclone warning during emergencies.“However, there are some difficult situations wherein tropical cyclone forecasting is still tricky and more challenging. This is mainly in case of rapidly intensifying/weakening cyclones near the land. With the ongoing modernization programme, the error is likely to reduce by 20% by 2025,” he said.",kochi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74201650,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-466982,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/imd-modernizing-cyclone-early-warning-systems/articleshow/74198873.cms

He claimed that the ground for corruption is being set with regards to integrated digital traffic enforcement project worth Rs 180 crore.

Chennithala said the move was to bypass Sidco , which is a government firm that had submitted a proposal in this regard, and hand over the project to a private firm by colluding with Keltron. He alleged that the move is to grant over 90% of the revenue to the private company as service and maintenance charges, while only 10% will be the government’s share.

He added that the company is planning to install 350 speed limit violation cameras, 30 red-light detection cameras and 100 helmet absence detection cameras across the state. The company has no capacity to handle a project of this magnitude, Chennithala alleged.

Meanwhile, the state police denied all the allegations he made. In the past 14 months, the police had invited e-tender for the project thrice. Of this, only one company submitted the tender twice and the third time, two companies participated. The evaluation committee for the tenders included experts from IT, C-DAC, Natpac and motor vehicles department other than top policemen.

The technical evaluation, including field test, is underway. Only after the completion of technical evaluation the financial bid will be opened, the statement said.

The statement further added that which company will receive the project will be decided only after the government inspects the final award and an order is issued.

CLEARED SKHER

Nashik: Swift police action helped a Nashik trader recover Rs 8.50 lakh within minutes of losing it in a robbery.

Senior officials of the Newasa police station said the incident took place at around 5 pm near the Newasa bus stand, about 140km from here, on Monday. The trader, a resident of Kulkarni Garden area of Nashik city, had been to Newasa for a land deal.

The police said that the complainant has a plot near Newasa. On Monday, he had gone to make a deal to sell the plot. After the deal was finalised, the complainant was carrying Rs 8.50 lakh in cash with him. When he could not find a direct vehicle for Nashik, he thought of first going to Srirampur by bus and then taking another bus from there to Nashik.

While he was boarding the bus, some unidentified persons snatched the bag from his hand and escaped on a bike.

Inspector Ranjeet Dere of the Newasa police station said, “Soon after the bag was snatched, the complainant raised a loud cry of being robbed. The police personnel at the bus stand and others at the bus stand started chasing the robbers on bike.”

Dere said that robbers were fleeing towards Srirampur Road. The police immediately alerted their counterparts along the route and asked them to block the road. The chase continued for about 7 km and the criminals were finally caught there by the public.

While one of them managed to escape from the scene, one robber has been arrested. The police said they had also recovered the cash. The arrested suspect has been identified as Sagar Mane, a resident of Hinjewadi in Pune. He was produced in the court by the Newasa police and has been remanded in police custody for two days.

Nashik: The Mumbai Naka police have made one more arrest in the multi-crore cheating case registered with them in May last year.

The arrested suspect has been identified as Sunil Khanderao Adke. Adke was produced in a city court on Tuesday and remanded to police custody till February 20.

Police said that one of the suspect’s — Vishnu Ramchandra Bhagwat — started a scheme in October 2018. By January 2019, he collected crores of rupees from thousands of investors.

A complaint against Bhagwat was then filed in the Mumbai Naka police station in May last year. Police had registered a case against Bhawat under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, including cheating, criminal breach of trust and sections of the Prize Chits and Money Circulation Schemes (Banning) Act, 1978. Soon after, he sought anticipatory bail.

However, he was arrested in a similar case registered with the Ambad police station earlier this month.

Earlier this month, police arrested seven of Bhagwat’s agents during the course of investigation. They are currently placed in police custody till February 20.

According to police, Bhagwat had purchased plots in different places with the help of Adke. Police said that they are still investigating the case for more details.

Meanwhile, 27 bank accounts of Bhagwat have been freezed; however, they could only recover Rs 10 lakh from his accounts.

Police said that a large number of people have been duped by the schemes of the finance company concerned. So far, police have taken statements of 46 investors and, according to their claims, the fraud has turned out to the tune of Rs 5.28 crore.

They said Bhagwat also has cases registered with Alephata police in Pune, Jaikheda police in Nashik rural, Bhandup police station in Mumbai and even one in Himachal Pradesh.

Police have advised all investors to conduct thorough checks of the companies and business houses before investing in any scheme.

Lieutenant General RP Singh welcomed the inclusion of women in permanent commission

DEHRADUN: The Army's Western Command 's General Officer Commanding-in-Chief Lieutenant General RP Singh , on Tuesday, said that the inclusion of women in permanent commission is a welcome step but the time has not yet come for women to get into the combat units of the Army. The statement was made when Lt Gen Singh was speaking at an Investiture Ceremony held at Clement Town to honour braveheart personnel of the defence forces.

Speaking with mediapersons, Lt Gen Singh said, “I think that time has not yet come for women to get into the combat units of the Army. Indian Army is huge. It includes combat elements, combat support elements and service elements. In selected areas, permanent commission is being given to women. I feel that in times to come, women personnel would be contributing more in all Army fields.”

Lt Gen Singh's comment comes in the wake of the Supreme Court ruling on Monday that short service commission women officers are eligible for permanent commission and command posts in the Army irrespective of their years of service. The apex court has directed the Centre to grant permanent commission within three months to all the women officers in Army who opt for it while maintaining that the terms of appointments for women officers shall be the same as their male counterparts.

On being asked about the future roadmap regarding deployment of women, Lt Gen Singh said, “The Army is going through an evolutionary phase and I think the first step is to give women the command of non-combat areas and regions.”

During the event, seven Vishisht Seva Medals, 32 Sena Medals for gallantry, and two Sena Medals for distinguished service were awarded to soldiers and officers of different Army units. The ceremony was organised on behalf of Western Command by the Golden Key division. The Command is responsible for guarding the regions along the western border and is deployed in the states of Haryana, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and parts of Jammu & Kashmir.

KOCHI: To learn swimming was always a dream for 11-year-old Manoj R, a Class VII student of School for the Blind, Aluva, and he never thought that dream could be achieved overcoming the challenge of being blind.But on Tuesday when he swam 600 metres to cross Periyar in 30 minutes, he proved that sheer dedication and proper training can enable a person with disabilities face challenges that even people with no disabilities don’t dare trying.Besides Manoj’s parents, G Rajesh and K Sudha, hundreds, including his school headmistress Gigy Varghese, manager Varghese Alexander, his classmates and teachers were present at the sand ghats of Aluva Shiva Temple to see him braving the currents to swim towards them from the ghat near Aluva Adwaitha Ashramam on the opposite bank.He was trained by Saji Valasseril, who has trained over 3,000 people to swim in Periyar over the last 10 years. Manoj was Saji’s second blind student ever to have achieved the feat. The earlier one being Navaneeth of the blind school, who swam across the river in 2015.Manoj, who swam along with Saji, was flagged off by Adwaitha Ashramam head Swami Shivaswaroopananda at 8.10am. As Manoj is fully blind and swims according to the sound signals given by his trainer, Saji swam ahead of him to guide him to the opposite bank.“Manoj used to feel upset whenever he heard the cheers of kids playing in the river each time we visited our native in Palakkad. He always wanted to swim but we were never able to find the right tutor. The 30-day training under Saji has not only helped him fulfill his dream but also boosted his confidence largely to face the challenges in his life,” said Rajesh, Manoj’s father.Saji said that Manoj was a quick learner. “He came for practice at 7am everyday over the last one month. Within two weeks of training, he started swimming in the river. At a time when we see lot of drowning deaths, it is essential to learn swimming. Moreover, it is the best exercise for both the mind and body,” said Saji.",kochi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74201348,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-828595,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/blind-boy-swims-across-the-periyar-wins-hearts/articleshow/74198911.cms

Abhijith M R

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Police are yet to ascertain how Abhijith MR (16) ended up dead in Karamana River a day after his nude body was recovered from the river. They were not able to locate his clothes.

On Tuesday, an autopsy was conducted and surgeons told the police that the death was caused by drowning. Apart from minor injuries on his body, especially the chest and face, there was no grievous injuries that suggested that he might have been harmed by someone.

“There is a possibility that the boy went for a swim and his towel came off when was swept away by the current,” said Karamana station house officer and inspector J Chandrababu who is investigating the case. He said that it was too early to arrive at conclusions. A probe is still on to find the boy’s clothes.

Police did not record the statements of Abhijith’s parents as they were under severe mental trauma. The teen’s paternal uncle Padmakumar said it was highly unlikely that Abhijith would go for a swim in the river without the knowledge of his parents.

“He did not have a history of resorting to misadventures. Besides, he was old enough to know that stepping into the river without knowing how to swim would be dangerous,” he said adding that the family wanted to know how the boy ended up in the river. They also do not believe that he could have committed suicide as his last conversation with his father was about going to school next day.

Abhijith had gone missing on Sunday afternoon from his residence at Nedumcaud. A day later, his body was recovered from Karamana River which is located close to his home.

Abhijith’s cremation was held at Santhikavadam crematorium at Thycaud on Tuesday.

NEW DELHI: Calling for “quality research on Kashmir and Kashmiri culture”, Delhi University vice-chancellor Yogesh Tyagi on Tuesday announced that any student who researches and publishes a paper on Kashmiri culture or music would get a reward of Rs 1 lakh.

Tyagi said this while addressing DU’s first Kashmiri folk music event “Meeras-e-Kashmir”, where former Rajya Sabha member Karan Singh and JNU professor Amitabh Mattoo were guests. “Never give up faith in your culture. We may be surrounded by corruption and violence everywhere, but we have to maintain ourselves. It is only then we will fulfil our potential,” the former MP said.

Giving anecdotes on Kashmir, Singh said its history goes back thousands of years. “It is important for us to emphasise the diversity and inclusiveness of Indian culture and never get into exclusivism mode,” he added.

Speaking of the time when Sufis came to Kashmir, Singh said, “There were places in Srinagar where people would pray namaz on the first floor and do aarti on the ground floor. That was the synoptic philosophy particular to Kashmir, which is now shattered.”

Mattoo said there were three strains that needed to be recovered if we had to strengthen our idea of co-existence. “The first is the history and idea of Kashmiri Shaivism, the second Sufi tradition and finally Kashmiriyat. The recovery of the tradition of Meeras-e-Kashmir is the recovery of pluralism, co-existence and diversity, which will form the bedrock of the idea of India,” he added.

The event is a part of a series of musical programmes under the banner of “Cultural Flavours of India”. Tuesday’s event saw Pandit Bhajan Sopori and other artistes perform Kashmiri songs.

164,['19/02/2020'],"Emaar money in Indu Syam Prasad’s Asara, ED tells HC","This story is from February 19, 2020

Hyderabad: The Enforcement Directorate (ED), which is probing the Emaar scam, said Southend Projects and Foundations Private Ltd received Rs 45 crore of the scam money and transferred Rs 36 crore to Asara Theme Projects Pvt Ltd of industrialist Indukuri Syam Prasad Reddy.

ED said the amount of Rs 45 crore came into Southend from 11 fictitious entities who had never conducted any business either prior to this transaction or after this. ED informed this to the Telangana high court and elaborated as to how its investigation had led to the money changing hands. Opposing the plea of Aasara which wanted the ED probe quashed, ED filed a counter asserting that Asara was a beneficiary of these transactions.

Though Southend was claiming that it gave money to Asara only to purchase land, the latter did not register any land in favour of Southend. “From this, it became evident that Rs 36 crore is still with Asara for the last two years,” ED officials said in their counter.

“Proceeds of the crime had travelled into Asara and stayed with them for two years and the proclaimed purpose of ‘land for Southend’ never happened,” the ED said in its counter justifying its case against Asara and opposed any relief to it.

The court posted the case to April 9.

Asara contended that since Southend did not pay the balance amount, it did not transfer the land. Since that land had already been sold, ED could not find the cash or land with Asara and hence, attached the shares of Syam Prasad to an extent of Rs 25 crore. It is in this light Asara is urging the court to quash the ED case against it.

Syam Prasad, it can be recalled, was made an accused in the quid pro quo case of Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy in Lepakshi and Indu Tech Zone chargesheets. Now, ED’s contention in the Emaar case linking Syam Prasad to this case assumes significance.

CBI’s chargesheet in the Emaar case had concluded that a total of Rs 96 crore scam money is accrued to kingpin Koneru Rajendra Prasad and Sunil Reddy of Southend Projects. While Sunil claimed that he ceased to be a director of Southend after 2009 and transferred the ownership to Narapu Manohar Reddy, ED sleuths said that Sunil was still operating Southend accounts.

Asara, on the other hand, wanted its case to be removed from the ED case since it was not made an accused in the CBI chargesheet in the Emaar case. Refuting this, ED officials said their investigation under PMLA was independent of CBI probe.

Assistant solicitor general Namavarapu Rajeswara Rao will argue the case of ED, said VT Kalyan, counsel for the central government.

165,['19/02/2020'],Reptile diversity highest in south Guj,"This story is from February 19, 2020

Surat: The South Gujarat region tops the chart in reptile diversity as it records maximum reptile species in the state with 75 species recorded from the region, reveals a recent study by two Gujarat-based herpetologists.

The research has been carried out by Raju Vyas and Harshil Patel, and their paper was recently published in ‘Herpetology Notes’ titled ‘Reptiles of Gujarat, India: Updated check list, distribution and conservation status.’

The study reveals that among the regions of Gujarat, South Gujarat (75 species) was found to have the highest reptilian diversity among the five regions, followed by Saurashtra (74 species), Central Gujarat (71 species), Kutch (52 species), and North Gujarat (51 species).

Researchers recorded one species of crocodile, nine species of chelonians belonging to five families, 43 species of lizards belonging to seven families, and 54 species of snakes belonging to ten families from the state.

Interestingly, South Gujarat accounted for the highest number of snake species (46 species). The highest diversity of turtles was found in Central Gujarat and Kutch, each with six species, while Saurashtra had the highest lizard diversity (26 species).

“The reptile check list of Gujarat has not been revised since a decade, and it was needed to be revised, based on historical records and incorporating those from recent fieldwork,” Raju Vyas, a renowned reptile expert from Vadodara, told TOI.

“In our study, a total of 107 reptile species from 62 genera in 23 families were recorded. In addition, records of 22 species of reptiles were dubiously or erroneously reported in the literature, and we recommended for their removal from the Gujarat reptile list,’’ said Vyas.

“Till now, majority of studies were restricted to selected regions of Gujarat and, with few exceptions, did not present the reptile fauna for the entire state. In recent years, several new species have been described and new records published, resulting in a rapid increase in the number of reptiles. The combination of new information and old records, some with questionable validity, prompted our reappraisal of Gujarat’s reptilian fauna,’’ Vyas explained.

Vyas has been actively surveying the reptilian fauna of the state for the past three decades.

“During field surveys, the study area was divided into various regions, and each region was explored on the basis of habitat types and the level of species diversity. Many different techniques, including visual encounter surveys (VESs), pitfall traps, opportunistic collection, and nocturnal road cruising, were employed for data collection. Species encountered were collected, examined, and photographed in the field and released in the same area. All species were carefully identified using diagnostic keys and the available literature,’’ said Harshil Patel, the fellow researcher of Vyas.

Researchers of this study say that the present number of reptile species of Gujarat now stands at 131, a number, which includes 22 erroneously or dubiously reported species and one non-native species, indicates a significant increase for the state. In 2000, 107 reptile species were recorded and it now increased to 131 species.

“Some reptiles which were reported or described in the last five years from different parts of Gujarat include Wallace's Racer, Sahgal’s Gecko, Kutch Snake-eye, Murray’s Gecko, Slender Gecko, Travancore Wolf Snake and Laudankia Vine Snake among others,’’ said Patel.

“We have documented many direct and indirect threats to reptiles, including vehicular impact/transportation, habitat destruction and alteration, soil erosion, soil and water pollution, poaching or hunting, destructive agricultural practices, irrigation practices, forest fire, and even consumption as food by local tribal communities. Many of these threats we have reported earlier, but an impact assessment of each of these threats is necessary to improve conservation policies,’’ Vyas explained.

The decision was taken a day after collector S Suhas forwarded a complaint filed by Yuva Morcha state secretary Sandeep Varier in this regard.

“Based on the complaint forwarded by the district collector, I have given orders to the assistant commissioner of crime branch to initiate a preliminary inquiry. Based on the findings, a case will be registered against the organizers,” Sakhare said.

Now, KMF has written a letter to the chief minister, requesting him to begin an inquiry into the financial dealings related to music concert in the wake of allegations of misappropriation of funds and misuse of government machinery.

A news meet scheduled by KMF on Tuesday was cancelled at the last minute, allegedly after senior members of the foundation raised objections.

The letter signed by music composer Bijibal, singer Shahabaz Aman, director Aashiq Abu, actor Rima Kallingal, Sithara Krishnakumar, Syam Pushkaran and Madhu Narayanan said Karuna music concert was organized using the funds of foundation members. Though the idea to contribute the revenue from ticket sales to chief minister’s distress relief fund (CMDRF) was taken in unison, KMF failed to raise funds from the event organized without help from sponsors, the letter said.

“While efforts were on to raise funds, including the money spent by the foundation and the fund to be paid to CMDRF from different means including video content telecast; a politically-motivated attack was launched. The foundation paid money to CMDRF without causing controversies,” the letter said. This was despite the foundation, which is registered as trust, having time till March 31 to pay the amount legally, it said.

The attack against KMF members started ever since some of them participated in protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act, the letter said.

HYDERABAD: Union minister for railways, Piyush Goyal , on Tuesday denied that the Central government was discriminating against Telangana over allocation of railway budget .

He rebutted the statement of Telangana animal husbandry minister T Srinivas Yadav about the railway ministry giving preference to north India while starving Telangana of fund .

“The discrimination between north and south India, which TRS minister Srinivas Yadav alleged, used to happen during the Congress rule, and not during Narendra Modi’s governance,” said Goyal. “Also, before our government came into power, Telangana was sanctioned Rs 258 crore for railway projects in 2014-15. After BJP came into power, the state was sanctioned a budget of Rs 2,602 crore in 2020-21, 10 times more than what the previous government sanctioned.”

After laying the foundation stone for Cherlapalli satellite station in the east, Goyal said the project will cost about Rs 250 crore. “If the state government helps us in land acquisition for railway projects, I assure to the people of Telangana that none of the projects will be stalled because of financial constraints,” he said.

Speaking on the occasion, Union minister of state for home affairs, G Kishan Reddy, said, “Thousands of people visit Yadagirigutta every day from Hyderabad and other districts. I request the railway ministry to extend MMTS services up to Yadagirigutta at the earliest. The city is becoming congested due to traffic and to address that issue, MMTS phase II should also begin without any further delay.”

Goyal also requested the state government to release its share of Rs 400 crore for completing the pending works of MMTS phase II project. “We have finished phase I of MMTS. Till now, the Centre has invested more than Rs 500 crore in MMTS, which is a joint project between central and state government. I request Srinivas Yadav to see that the state’s budget for MMTS is released without delay so we can speed up the phase II works. The works between Moula Ali to Sanathnagar, which is a very important stretch, have been stalled because of the delay in funds from the state government.”

Congress MP from Bhongir, Komatireddy Venkat Reddy, submitted a representation to Goyal requesting to sanction a road over bridge at Narketpally between Chityal Railway Station and Srirampur Railway Station to avoid accidents as people have to cross from the railway gate. The MP also requested Goyal to halt trains at Ramanapet, Bhongir, Aler and Jangaon railway stations for devotees travelling to Yadagirigutta.

Goyal also laid foundation stones for development of satellite terminal at Cherlapalli railway station, electrification of Yerraguntla-Nandyal section, dedicated double line with electrification of Guntakal-Kalluru section, and free high-speed Wi-Fi facility at 427 railway stations in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.

NEW DELHI: Starting February 21, a three-day gala event has been planned at Waste to Wonder Park to celebrate its anniversary. South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) will be organising sound and light shows on themes, including surgical strike and freedom struggle of Bhagat Singh.

A senior SDMC official said that they have to approve three out of five themes for light and sound shows. Every day, three shows of 30 minutes will be organised after 6pm. “The other themes listed are creative dance show, Ramayana and animation for children,” the official added. The civic body expects 8,000-10,000 people to attend the celebrations.

Recognising the efforts of artists who made the sculptures from waste, SDMC has decided to display their works and souvenirs. “We have already got approval from a Delhi-based artist who contributed in this project,” said the official.

The other events to be showcased on Saturday include musical performances and comedy shows. On Sunday, a magic show, puppet show, dance competition and stand-up comedy would be hosted.

To ensure smooth operations and management of the crowd, SDMC has finalised parking plans in association with traffic police. “We will create space for parking 300 cars at the RRTS station site located next to the venue. The traffic police will be deployed in huge numbers to ensure no snarls occur on Ring Road. There are no plans to increase the entrance fees during the celebrations,” said the official.

Till February 13, nearly 15.5 lakh people had visited the park since its opening. SDMC officials said that this number nearly matched popular hangout spots like Delhi zoo, which gets an average annual footfall of nearly 22 lakh.

Spread across seven acres and built at a cost of Rs 7.5 crore, the park has replicas of Taj Mahal, Eiffel Tower, Statue of Liberty, Great Pyramid of Giza, Leaning Tower of Pisa, Christ the Redeemer and Rome’s Colosseum. The replicas were built using 150 tonnes of iron waste lying at municipal stores for decades.

Hyderabad: The Telangana high court on Tuesday declined to accede an interim plea filed by India Cements and its CMD N Srinivasan to give exemption to them from appearing before an Enforcement Directorate (ED) court in the quid pro quo case.

Justice G Sri Devi refused to grant interim relief to Srinivasan and posted the case to April 15.

In the quid pro quo case pertaining to Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy, both CBI and ED had filed chargesheets citing irregularities on the part of India Cements.

The CBI’s case was that Srinivasan had made huge investments in Jagan’s companies in lieu of benefits like getting limestone leases, additional water allocation, etc., he got from then AP government between 2004 and 2009 when Jagan’s father YS Rajasekhara Reddy was chief minister. ED tracked the journey of these investments from India Cements to Jagan’s firms and described them as proceeds of crime under the provisions of Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).

Senior counsel T Niranjan Reddy, who appeared for Srinivasan and his company, brought to the notice of the court that the high court had earlier quashed the CBI case against Srinivasan. He urged the high court to quash the ED case too.

Anjali Agarwal, ED counsel, said the findings in the CBI case were not applicable to them as they function under PMLA. In ED cases, the burden of proof lies on the accused and it is for the accused to show conclusively that the money identified by ED in the case was untainted.

When the judge posted the case to April 15, Niranjan urged the court to dispense with the presence of Srinivasan before the ED court for each hearing, arguing that it would be difficult for him to attend the court at an advanced age of 75.

However, the judge did not give relief to Srinivasan.

Hyderabad: Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal will campaign for Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) candidates in Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) polls when they are due. Party leaders from Telangana met Kejriwal in Delhi on Monday night and he advised them to prepare for the polls.

Kejriwal told the party leaders that they should first identify local issues and try to get them solved by the government with the help of civil society. He reportedly told them to refrain from being unnecessarily critical of the government for the sake of politics. Kejriwal told them that they would have to bring the problems to the notice of the government and pursue them.

As part of the effort, AAP leaders and volunteers would visit educational institutions, hospitals and make a note of the problems being faced by the people in different spheres of life. AAP would also undertake a programme to enroll people in the party from February 23 for a month. A mobile number would be announced and those interested in joining the party could give a missed call to ‘Join the revolution-Join AAP’ programme.

AAP state core committee member Syed Gaffar said volunteers would be given responsibility for each of the 150 wards in GHMC to prepare the party for the polls. AAP Telangana convenor Ramu Goud, AAP South India in-charge and Malviya Nagar MLA Somnath Bharati, Telangana observer Priyanka Kakkar and Telangana joint secretary Rashid Ul Haq discussed with Kejriwal about strengthening the party in Telangana, particularly Hyderabad. Ramu Goud told TOI that Kejriwal was particular that AAP prepare itself thoroughly for GHMC polls. Kejriwal was said to be appreciative of the fact that AAP candidate Rashid Ul Haq won from ward number 31, Ambedkarnagar, in Adilabad municipality in the recently held civic polls in Telangana though there was no involvement of the central leadership in the polls. He said the party will have to build itself in that way so that local leaders will be central to the party.

Kannur: Police, on Tuesday, arrested Saranya Pranav (22) on the charge of killing her one-and-a-half-year-old son by hurling him against the sea wall after she confessed her crime .

Viyan’s body was recovered from the boulders on the wall on February 17 and police had taken the couple into custody. Police said the woman apparently had an affair and wanted to live with another person and the baby became an obstacle. She then planned to kill him two days ago.

On the night of February 16, her husband, Pranav, who is from Varam near Kannur town, with whom she had a strained relationship came home and she made him stay there that night. She felt she could implicate Pranav in the murder case and her parents initially suspected him.

But scientific evidence showed another possibility. On examination, police found elements of sea water in Saranya’s dress and she was subjected to scientific interrogation. She broke down and confessed. She said she took the baby early on Monday and threw him on the wall after climbing down the stones. On the way back, she heard him cry. She picked him up and threw him against the stone wall to ensure his death. Saranya would be presented in the court on February 19. tnn

Odisha finance minister Niranjan Pujari reads out the budget.

BHUBANESWAR: Setting a goal for a new and empowered Odisha , finance minister Niranjan Pujari on Tuesday presented a Rs 1.50 lakh crore budget for the 2020-21 financial year. This is the second budget for Pujari in Naveen Patnaik government’s fifth term in office and one which is in sync with the Centre’s ambition for a new India.

Reading his budget speech from a iPad in a major digital push that also not only helped the government save money in printing reams of pages, but also prevent cutting down on trees, Pujari said, “Now the stage is set to think big and aspire for a New Odisha — empowered Odisha — through a transformative agenda. This budget, therefore, focuses on creation of world-class infrastructure, transformative healthcare facilities and education services, robust eco-system for skills, sports, tourism, culture, industries and micro, small and medium enterprises.”

The budget has made significant allocation for some of the top priority areas like transforming Puri into a world-class heritage city, redevelopment of Lingaraj temple, up-gradation of SCB Medical College and Hospital in Cuttack to an AIIMS-plus institution and development of tourism infrastructure in various parts of the state.

While allocating funds for infrastructure development in sectors like health, education, road and tourism, the finance minister has struck a balance by making provisions for various social welfare schemes that has helped the BJD government to create a loyal support base over the years.

Even though the Naveen government has reduced its allocation under the Krushak Assistance for Livelihood and Income Augmentation (Kalia) scheme to Rs 4,000 from Rs 10,000 per year after it was merged with the Centre’s PM-Kisan scheme, an allocation of Rs 3,195 crore has been made for the 2020-21 fiscal.

In the 2019-20 fiscal year, the state government had earmarked Rs 5,611 crore under Kalia scheme that had worked as a game changer for the BJD government to retain power for a fifth consecutive term. The total outlay for agriculture and allied sector is estimated at Rs 19,408 crore.

To transform the Odisha University of Agriculture and Technology (OUAT) into a centre of excellence for agricultural research and extension of global standard, an amount of Rs 150 crore has been allocated in the budget. A centre of excellence in veterinary science has also been announced with an allocation of Rs 10 crore.

While presenting the budget, the finance minister said they have given a stable government with steadily growing economy, poverty re-education, doubling farmers’ income, bringing Odisha into prominence in sports and tourism and making the state as the most favoured destination for investment in India.

Announcing an ambitious plan to develop in-stream barrages in all major rivers at an investment of Rs 12,000 crore in five years, the state government has allocated Rs 1,100 crore for the 2020-21 fiscal. A record allocation of Rs 3250 crore has been provided for water supply projects in the state.

While an outlay of Rs 65,655 has been made for administrative expenditure which is being spent on salary and pension of state government employees, another Rs 74,000 crore has been made for programme expenditure for various schemes and programmes. Similarly, Rs 3,200 crore will be spent on disaster management while Rs 7,145 crore will be transferred to local bodies like panchayati raj institutions and urban local bodies.

In a significant move, the state government has also increased the MLA local area development (MLALAD) fund by three-fold, from Rs 1 crore to Rs 3 crore per year.

The state government has estimated a revenue surplus budget of Rs 9,506 crore for 2020-21 while it will invest around Rs 26,513 crore as capital expenditure aimed at asset creation. It will borrow money to invest in capital expenditure.

As the state will be hosting the third edition of Make in Odisha conclave, Rs 70 crore has been allocated for the event. To make Odisha the most favoured investment destination, the government has also allocated Rs 284 crore for creating world-class industrial infrastructure.

Adequate allocation has also been made under various social welfare schemes like Mamata Yojana (Rs 305 crore), old age pension (Rs 1718 crore), food security scheme (Rs 1038 crore) and development of old age homes (Rs 164 crore). In its journey to make Odisha the sports capital of the country, the state government has allocated Rs 140 crore for development of sports infrastructure.

BHOPAL: As the Congress-led government prepares to present its budget for 2020-21, chief minister Kamal Nath on Tuesday laid emphasis on “deviating from convention and working on alternative processes and innovative ideas”.

CM Nath was speaking at the inauguration of a brainstorming session on ‘alternative finance for projects’, attended by former deputy chairman of erstwhile Planning Commission Montek Singh Ahluwalia, industry representatives, bankers and the who’s who of Madhya Pradesh bureaucracy.

Delivering the key note address, Ahluwalia spoke of the need of a law on public private partnership (PPP) to overcome budget constraints for socially important economic infrastructure projects. He also stressed the need for considering “rewriting” the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act (FRBM) in view of the increasing finance needs and fiscal limitations of states.

Addressing the workshop, CM Kamal Nath said that financial institutions and governments need to change their thought-process in view of the rapid changes taking place in the global economic scenario. “Increased budget resources are required to fulfil the ambitions of a vast country like India, which has the largest society of aspirational youth. It is becoming challenging to mobilize financial resources for a changed and constantly changing India and its states, and in view of this, banks, state governments and private sector institutions also need to adopt the change,” he pointed out.

Nath said that it has become necessary to focus attention on economic activities that generate jobs, and emphasized on having a “new vision and fresh approach” to managing budget resources and improving governance. Pointing out the reduction of Rs 14,000 crore in Madhya Pradesh’s share in the Union Budget, the CM said remarked that the Budget resource mobilization of many countries is excellent even without laws like FRBM Act.

Ahluwalia urged to think beyond the conventional approach of depending on budgetary resources. “In such a situation, states look towards the private sector for assistance. The private sector is fearful of risks and threats while the governments are bound by welfare principles beyond loss and profit. Both have their limitations. Therefore, there is a need for a law to work in cooperation between the two,” he suggested.

Ahluwalia said that instead of managing finances for large economic infrastructure projects, the system of providing guarantee by the state should also be considered. Governments should assume the role of a friend in managing financial risks for projects, he said.

State finance minister Tarun Bhanot delivered the welcome address. Chief secretary S R Mohanty said that Madhya Pradesh is not new to innovative practices of mobilizing budget resources. The build-operate-transfer road projects and Rogi Kalyan Samitis for hospital management are the best examples, he said.

181,['19/02/2020'],Govt presses forward for empowered Odisha with Rs 1.50 lalkh crore budget,"This story is from February 19, 2020

Odisha finance minister Niranjan Pujari reads out the budget.

BHUBANESWAR: Setting a goal for a new and empowered Odisha , finance minister Niranjan Pujari on Tuesday presented a Rs 1.50 lakh crore budget for the 2020-21 financial year. This is the second budget for Pujari in Naveen Patnaik government’s fifth term in office and one which is in sync with the Centre’s ambition for a new India.

Reading his budget speech from a iPad in a major digital push that also not only helped the government save money in printing reams of pages, but also prevent cutting down on trees, Pujari said, “Now the stage is set to think big and aspire for a New Odisha — empowered Odisha — through a transformative agenda. This budget, therefore, focuses on creation of world-class infrastructure, transformative healthcare facilities and education services, robust eco-system for skills, sports, tourism, culture, industries and micro, small and medium enterprises.”

The budget has made significant allocation for some of the top priority areas like transforming Puri into a world-class heritage city, redevelopment of Lingaraj temple, up-gradation of SCB Medical College and Hospital in Cuttack to an AIIMS-plus institution and development of tourism infrastructure in various parts of the state.

While allocating funds for infrastructure development in sectors like health, education, road and tourism, the finance minister has struck a balance by making provisions for various social welfare schemes that has helped the BJD government to create a loyal support base over the years.

Even though the Naveen government has reduced its allocation under the Krushak Assistance for Livelihood and Income Augmentation (Kalia) scheme to Rs 4,000 from Rs 10,000 per year after it was merged with the Centre’s PM-Kisan scheme, an allocation of Rs 3,195 crore has been made for the 2020-21 fiscal.

In the 2019-20 fiscal year, the state government had earmarked Rs 5,611 crore under Kalia scheme that had worked as a game changer for the BJD government to retain power for a fifth consecutive term. The total outlay for agriculture and allied sector is estimated at Rs 19,408 crore.

To transform the Odisha University of Agriculture and Technology (OUAT) into a centre of excellence for agricultural research and extension of global standard, an amount of Rs 150 crore has been allocated in the budget. A centre of excellence in veterinary science has also been announced with an allocation of Rs 10 crore.

While presenting the budget, the finance minister said they have given a stable government with steadily growing economy, poverty re-education, doubling farmers’ income, bringing Odisha into prominence in sports and tourism and making the state as the most favoured destination for investment in India.

Announcing an ambitious plan to develop in-stream barrages in all major rivers at an investment of Rs 12,000 crore in five years, the state government has allocated Rs 1,100 crore for the 2020-21 fiscal. A record allocation of Rs 3250 crore has been provided for water supply projects in the state.

While an outlay of Rs 65,655 has been made for administrative expenditure which is being spent on salary and pension of state government employees, another Rs 74,000 crore has been made for programme expenditure for various schemes and programmes. Similarly, Rs 3,200 crore will be spent on disaster management while Rs 7,145 crore will be transferred to local bodies like panchayati raj institutions and urban local bodies.

In a significant move, the state government has also increased the MLA local area development (MLALAD) fund by three-fold, from Rs 1 crore to Rs 3 crore per year.

The state government has estimated a revenue surplus budget of Rs 9,506 crore for 2020-21 while it will invest around Rs 26,513 crore as capital expenditure aimed at asset creation. It will borrow money to invest in capital expenditure.

As the state will be hosting the third edition of Make in Odisha conclave, Rs 70 crore has been allocated for the event. To make Odisha the most favoured investment destination, the government has also allocated Rs 284 crore for creating world-class industrial infrastructure.

Adequate allocation has also been made under various social welfare schemes like Mamata Yojana (Rs 305 crore), old age pension (Rs 1718 crore), food security scheme (Rs 1038 crore) and development of old age homes (Rs 164 crore). In its journey to make Odisha the sports capital of the country, the state government has allocated Rs 140 crore for development of sports infrastructure.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The demolition of a bus shelter on the Vazhuthacaud–Edapazhinji Road near the office of director of survey department has sparked off a spat between the city corporation and the public works department (PWD). The matter further flared up with PWD minister G Sudhakaran sending a letter to mayor K Sreekumar saying that demolition of a bus shelter in good condition and construction of a new one was done without the consent of PWD.

In his letter, the minister has also held deputy mayor Rakhi Ravikumar responsible for demolition of the shelter so that a new one may be constructed using MP fund of Binoy Viswam. The minister noted in the letter that the bus shelter owned by Prateeksha Bus Shelters Ltd, a special purpose vehicle of PWD, was in perfect shape and that it was demolished without authorization, which amounts to destruction of public property. He also recalled that PWD executive engineer had issued a letter earlier demanding stalling of construction activities of the new bus shelter without the approval of PWD which actually owned the land.

Prateekha MD also took up the matter with city police commissioner demanding legal action against those who demolished the bus shelter, the minister said. The minister has communicated to mayor that the ongoing construction may be halted immediately.

An internal dissent has also broken out within the council over the issue with the town planning committee reportedly taking exception to the demolition of bus shelter. This was one among the 41 shelters which the council had approved for revamp. Besides, the corporation had entrusted an agency with advertisements on bus shelters and maintenance and demolition of the bus shelters, which accounted for violation of contract. The bus shelter was demolished without the knowledge of town planning committee and the issue resulted in an exchange of words between Rakhi Ravikumar and town planning committee chairman Palayam Rajan, according to sources.

The cold war between the deputy mayor and town planning committee chairman was visible in the council meeting held on Tuesday. Rajan, who is usually an active speaker in council meeting especially when opposition pushes the LDF council to the corner, was strangely silent throughout the session even when the deputy mayor was repeatedly questioned by the opposition over some items on the agenda.

According to sources, the site for construction of the bus shelter using MP funds was initially fixed near Cotton Hill LP School. However, it turned out that the existing shelter near survey department office was pulled down to construct a new one using MP funds. The deputy mayor said that the demolition was not done intentionally. “It was a clear case of misunderstanding. The matter is now being settled peacefully. An alternative location will be assigned for the bus shelter,” she said.

Alappuzha: Three crew members of houseboat ‘Pleasant’ had a miraculous escape after the double decker boat sank in Vembanad lake near Ponnad in Alappuzha on Tuesday.

The boat crew members Sebastian, 42, Ratheesh, 32 and Ponnappan, 40, all hailing from Alappuzha, were rescued by the local people.

Slug: Mahashivratri security

Nashik: The Nashik Rural police are setting up a bandobast consisting of 400 personnel in Trimbakeshwar on account of Mahashivratri on Friday as over one lakh pilgrims are expected to reach this temple town to offer prayers and seek blessings.

Police have put in place strict bandobast starting from Thursday night.

Arti Singh, superintendent of police, Nashik Rural, said, “On Friday, there will be huge rush of devotees at Trimbakeshwar. We are expecting more devotees as Mahashivratri falls on Friday. Since Saturday and Sunday are public holidays, more people tend to go on three-day holidays. Accordingly, we have chalked out a security plan.”

Singh also said that they are expecting a huge rush of vehicles too. Hence, necessary arrangement for vehicle parking will also be put in place to ensure that vehicular traffic is streamlined and pilgrims do not face any hassle.

“The Trimbakeshwar temple holds great religious significance. Thus, the inflow of pilgrims is constant throughout the year. However, it increases on public holidays. The city witnesses maximum rush during the month of ‘Shravan’ and Mahashivratri. At such times, provinding additional security is necessary,” she said.

Police said that depending on the rush of pilgrims over Saturday and Sunday, the bandobast could be extended.

The rural police would ensure that there are no cases of eve teasing, thefts, pick-pocketing, etc in the rush of pilgrims.

Meanwhile, police also suggested the temple trust to not allow pilgrims into the Garbhagriha (sanctum sanctorum) of the temple. Police said that the sanctum sanctorum is open in the morning between 5 am to 6:45 am every day. However, it is later closed and pilgrims have to offer prayers form outside the sanctum.

Senior police officers said that they had suggested the temple trust to ban entry of pilgrims into the sanctum on the day of Mahashivratri as it could lead to pandemonium or a stampede-like situation. However, the final decision lies with the temple trust, said officers.

Deonar plant contract given amid allegations of rigging by lowest bidder

MUMBAI: In a rare instance, a contract to set up a waste-to-energy plant at Deonar for over Rs 1,000 crore was awarded by the BMC standing committee to the second-lowest bidder instead of the lowest, raising questions of propriety. The decision was taken on Tuesday.

The BMC administration had tabled a proposal to appoint the firm, Chennai MSW, to build the 600 metric tonne plant. The firm had quoted Rs 648 crore for it, along with Rs 1,020 crore for maintenance for 15 years. The second-lowest bidder, Suez Projects, had quoted Rs 821 crore and Rs 1,291 crore for 15-year maintenance.

However, when the proposal was tabled, Shiv Sena leader in the BMC Vishakha Raut alleged that the tender was rigged. “When the tender was opened, the amount filled in by Chennai MSW was not visible while that by Suez Projects was clearly visible. BMC called in the first firm as much as 11 days later and made them fill their amount. By this time they may have easily learned about how much the second bidder had bid and clearly went on to bid lower that it. This is completely unacceptable and therefore the work should be assigned to the second-lowest bidder,” said Raut.

She was backed by opposition leader Ravi Raja. “The BMC’s waste-to-energy contract smells of favouritism. The shortlisted contractor didn’t quote his cost. Despite that, his bid was accepted,” said Raja. Committee chairman Yashwant Jadhav supported Raut and directed the administration to award the bid to the second-lowest bidder. A senior corporator, though, said the lowest bidder can legally contest it. “Why award the work to a contractor who has quoted above the first bidder? The panel should have proposed to retender the work,” he said.

P Velrasu, additional commissioner, denied the favouritism allegation. He said the amount quoted by the lowest bidder did not reflect in one of the tendering stages, but it could be seen later in the folder,"" he said. Another official said, “We asked the IT department to retrieve the data and found the lowest bidder had indeed specified an amount in the tender.”

190,['19/02/2020'],‘You can declare your illegal water lines till Feb 21’,"This story is from February 19, 2020

Q. I am writing on behalf of 5,000 residents of Mantri Celestia Apartment, Nanakramguda. Though we pay hefty taxes, several civic issues have remained unresolved since the last five years. The major issue is that the approved quantity for water by HMWS&SB for our apartment is 596KL /per day, but we receive only 200 KL/per day. We are totally dependent on tankers. Please look into it. – Rajeev Sharma

A. Water supply has been reduced to 200 KL per day due to reduced quantity being given to Gachibowli section. However, action will be initiated to improve supplies. HMWS&SB is contemplating laying a ring main pipeline from Patancheru to Kokapet to improve water supply.

Q. A new water pipeline was laid in our Bhela Colony (near Surajbhan maternity nursing home, Moghulpura) about a year-and-half ago. Over time, many illegal connections have been pulled from here by owners of illegal buildings around the area, in connivance with local water board officials and politicians. As a result, the water pressure in our homes (with legal connections) has become very low. Please resolve issue. – SM Tanvir

A. To identify reasons for the low water supply pressure in Bhela Colony, we conducted a survey and found that some households have unauthorised connections leading to low pressure. As part of the Voluntary Disclosure Scheme-2019, on till February 21, we organised a camp in Bhela Colony to regularise these connections. Some have applied for it through VDS-2019 vide File No VDS2019/5864A while some applicants’ documents are yet to be received. Once the process is over, quantity of water supplied will be adjusted in the colony, accordingly.

Q. Prakruthik Vihar, Yapral, with more than 200 residential plots and houses is a low-lying area. During the last monsoon, the colony was heavily flooded. To make matters worse, three septic tanks overflowed leading to unhygienic conditions for residents. Despite all our efforts we couldn’t fix the problem effectively. There is an urgent need to connect our septic tanks to the external drainage system to resolve this issue. – Maj Gen Rajendra Singh (Retired)

A. We have prepared a sewerage master plan that includes setting up of sewage treatment plants (STPs) to improve the system in the outer circles of GHMC . The plan will be implemented soon in the area. The HMWS&SB will also explore possibility of sewage disposal from the septic tanks and initiate appropriate action.

Q. Hyderabad city is growing rapidly while it’s ecology is getting damaged. Trees are being cut recklessly to make way for new constructions. As a result, population is increasing fast. Also, the city’s lakes are drying up. Water problem is looming large, so is the significant rise in temperature of the city. We would like to know what the government’s plans are for tackling water shortage and making Hyderabad a green city. – Virendra Pratap.

A. HMWSSB is in charge of providing water supply and sewerage services in areas within erstwhile MCH area, peripheral circles of GHMC and extended areas up to ORR limits. HMWS&SB is presently supplying 1,880 million litres of water per day to Hyderabad. Yet, there is a shortage in some of the sources. Upon observing poor water levels of surface reservoirs and to meet the demand of the city, the board has taken up construction of a new scheme with a capacity of 750 MLD from Kondapochamma Sagar Reservoir with Godavari river as a source. Apart from that, it has taken up several campaigns like Save Water, Jalam Jeevam, WaLc programme to create awareness on rainwater conservation. It has appealed to both domestic and commercial zones, such as government offices, corporate companies, to take up construction of rainwater harvesting structures by providing all technical guidance. Further, HMWS&SB has also constructed a rainwater harvesting theme park in Hyderabad, which demonstrates various techniques for conservation of water and ways to improve groundwater levels.

Q. Overflowing drainage has become an issue at Tejaswini Nagar, Attapur. We registered a compliant (reference number 080220676976), but it hasn’t been resolved. This has led to mosquito breeding in the area and health scare. Please help. – PBSS Ravi Kumar

A. The sewage overflow has been rectified.

Q. For the last couple of years, we have been intermittently receiving contaminated drinking water in Achuthan Reddy Marg, Vidyanagar. When we approached high court, officials of your department visited our area and requested us to withdraw the plea with the promise to settle the problem. But till date that hasn’t happened. Please help. – Seshu Reddy

A. About 18 months ago a complaint about contamination was received from consumers and the same was rectified by laying new 100mm diameter DI pipeline extending 22 RMT, to avoid the flow of muddy, coloured water. Again, a complaint in this regard was received on January 22, 2020. On inspection, we found that the contamination was in the upstream of the water supply line. Immediately, it was rectified on January 28 and the supply is normal now.

Q. Hundreds of litres of fresh water are being used for washing cars across all areas in Hyderabad. On street no. 8 (Vasant Vihar, Habsiguda), near Delhiwala Sweet House, one can see water flowing from the adjacent sweet shop all the way down to HDFC Bank. Kindly stop such misuse of water. – A M Dayal

A. To do away with such practices, we are conducting WaLC (Water Leadership and Conservation) programme across areas. As part of this, we have involved 17 NGOs to organise rallies and create awareness among consumers to reduce wastage of water. Our officers have also visited the areas suggested by the complainant and taken appropriate measures.

Q. Though we have not faced any drinking water issue in SV Colony, Saroornagar, there is large-scale wastage of water in our locality, in the form of washing cars (parked on the roads) and cleaning ramps that extend up to black top roads laid by GHMC. These also lead to stagnation of water on the roads. I request you to address it. – BS Patnaik

A. HMWS&SB has identified these areas and is conducting WaLC (Water Leadership and Conservation) programme to arrest the wastage. The board will conduct such programme in SV Colony too.

Q. Builder SMR Holdings has started giving possession in their project, SMR Vinay Iconia, Masjid Banda Road, Kondapur, without obtaining OC and water is supplied via HMWS&SB tankers. Is water supply allowed to builders that have not obtained required permissions? Also, is there any norm followed to check if the quantity of water supplied is matching the PCB consented quantities? – SMR Owners Action Team

A. The bulk water supply connection to this project is approved and SMR Holdings has paid the connection charges. No tankers from HMWS&SB deliver water to this project. Private water tankers are sourced by residents. Water connection can be provided only after infrastructure is improved by SWC Cell of HMWS&SB.

Q. For a month now we haven’t received Manjeera water in Gopal Nagar Colony, road no. 9b. Yet, we have received a bill of Rs 3,000. How can someone be made to pay if they haven’t received water for an entire month? Our entire colony is suffering because of this. Please help. – Satyapal Reddy Gatla

A. The DGM/manager inspected Gopal Nagar Colony and removed obstructions and also rectified a minor leakage. Water supply was restored on February 13 in the presence of the consumer.

Q. Partially done sewage pipelines have come to haunt residents of Chanakyapuri Colony in Safilguda. As work on new (big) lines is still pending, they continue to make do with old (small) sewage pipelines that get clogged with muddy slush seeping into manholes on rainy days. I request the authorities to complete the pending work as early as possible. – Ambica Nair

A. The balance sewage pipeline work will be completed in couple of days.

Q. We are residents of Sunder Nagar, Kachiguda. Water board officials started work on laying a sewage pipeline in our lane three months ago. However, it’s still incomplete. The road has been dug up and left unattended. It is extremely difficult to commute through the road because of this. Please address this issue. – Srinivas Boddupally

A. The sewage pipeline laying work has been completed. Road restoration patch work will be taken up by GHMC as per specifications.

Q. People living in 600 apartments of Gauthami Enclave, Kondapur, have been facing a severe water crisis. There is no groundwater here though we have rainwater harvesting pits across the colony. Manjeera water supply is bare minimum even though we have been paying about RS 2,000 for the last six-seven years. After we followed up with authorities last year, we started getting just about two units (maximum) every alternate day. Can you please address this? – Kalyan V

A. On an average, 2KL to 3KL water is being supplied to every house here on alternate days for one hour. The colony has about 125 houses. HMWS&SB will initiate a campaign on water conservation, construction of rainwater harvesting structures through WaLC (Water Leadership and Conservation) initiative.

Q. Residents of Peerancheruvu, Bandlaguda Jagir municipal corporation, are facing a serious issue of water contamination. This has been caused by letting untreated sewage into the storm water channel from TSPA and Snehitha Hills area and then diverting it through the lake bed, which is unscientific. While we have been raising our concern regarding this issue since March 2019 to HMDA, it has failed to yield any result. We request you to take up our grievance as more than 5,000 families are affected because of this situation. – Prameela Godi

A. The matter pertains to Bandlaguda Municipal Corporation. We will take up the issue with them.

Q. We, the residents of Journalist Colony on road no.3, Banjara Hills, face a problem of erratic water supply. Also, the pressure is very low and supply timings are not fixed. On many occasions, there is no supply at all or it’s curtailed. The reason given to us range from low water level to motor burnt out. We request your intervention in the matter so that the supply is regularised to our colony. – Sunil Kumar Kadiyala

A. During shutdown period, the reservoir inflow rate gradually decreases. That results in low water pressure and erratic water supply. Now, the necessary repair works have been completed and supplies are back to normal.

Q. Drain water overflowing from manholes at Brindavan Function Hall on street no. 2, Anandbagh, has become a problem for residents and passers-by. Whenever we raise a complaint, officials temporarily resolve the issue. For a permanent solution, the board must lay a bigger pipeline that can withstand huge flow of drain water and debris coming out from the function hall.

Bhubaneswar: The state government’s budget for 2020-21 was unique in many ways. From gender budget to child budget and nutrition budget, the government took some novel initiatives. Besides, presenting a paperless budget, Odisha is the first state to conduct a climate code budgeting that provides accounts of tracking public expenditure on climate change.

“The adverse impact of climate change on human lives, environment and economics can exacerbate difficulties for the entire world. The state government is actively adopting strategies supported by appropriate public finance policies to deal with climate change risks,” the budget pointed out.

“Empowerment of women as well as rights and holistic development of children is one of the major development agenda of our government,” it stated. Gender budget refers to mainstreaming gender in design, implementation and evaluation of financial allocations across all government expenditures as per the needs and concerns of women.

Similarly, child budget is a pubic finance management strategy which analyses the responsiveness of the government budget to the rights and needs of children. “Child budgeting is an accountability mechanism to incorporate child needs into policies, programmes and interventions. The state government has developed the state budget with more child specific, child sensitive policies and provisions,” finance minister Niranjan Pujari said.

Through nutrition budget, the state government has tried to assess the required allocation of public funds for improving the nutritional standards and health status of the population. Nutrition budget statement with support from UNICEF covered information and analysis on all nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive schemes across the departments.

He started his journey from Kolhapur and reached Nashik on Monday evening at Bytco Point in the Nashik Road area. He was given a traditional local welcome of dhol-tasha and tying pheta (turban) by a few citizens.

During his arrival, Wormans said that one should always go ahead despite struggles and challenges in his life. “Confidence is our major strength and nothing is impossible in our human life. We should only go ahead despite challenges,” he said.

He also appealed to the people to use maximum cycling to save the environment. He started his cycle mission ‘Cyclothon 2020’ from Kolhapur via Karad, Satara, Pune, Narayangaon to arrive at Nashik on Monday evening.

Nagpur: Seventy-eight-year old DM Alsi, a student of Nagpur centre of Indira Gandhi National Open University, was a proud man to receive a degree at the 33rd convocation ceremony held at Hislop College on Monday. Many jaws dropped after learning that he has in his kitty 24 degrees and PG diplomas. And his yearning to learn more continues.

Alsi told TOI, “ I have four graduation and 16 postgraduate degrees and four PG diplomas. I want to study as many subjects as possible as it makes me happy. I know that these degrees and certificates are not of much use for me at this age as I am not seeking a job. I study because I want to gain knowledge.”

Another inspiring story was that of Pawan Wanjari who is suffering from partial blindness. He collected his certificate in BEd. He said, “My father reads out from the modules and I listen. I was provided a writer during examination. I want to tell people that no physical barrier can stop you from taking education if there is a will.”

The ceremony commenced with a progress report presented by Ignou regional director P Sivaswaroop. He spoke about the events organized by the university throughout the year.

In his convocation address, vice-chancellor of Kavikulaguru Kalidas Sanskrit University Shrinivasa Varakhedi said, “Ignou provides those people an opportunity to take degrees who are unable to study in a regular university due to some reason or the other. They can get as many degrees as they wish if they are prepared to study hard.”

“Education makes a person better and gives a fulfilling experience in life. Making a meaningful life should be the goal of education and not a making a living out of it alone,” he added.

According to him, the educational endeavours should aim at holistic development of an individual. “A graduate should be a good citizen with certain qualities which will make one useful to the society,” he said.

“In a geographically vast country like India and for her huge population, the campus-isolated and classroom-based education system will not be sufficient. In order to reach out to the learners, the open and distance mode system of education is the only solution,” Varakhedi said.

Many students were then awarded certificates in varied courses they had opted for.

Hyderabad: BC welfare associations are now demanding that the central government include BC caste-wise enumeration in the census proforma so that reservations and welfare schemes being extended by the central and state governments can be implemented based on the population of BCs.

Leaders from 16 BC welfare associations will meet Union home minister Amit Shah soon and explain to him the need for enumerating BC groups. Union minister of state for home G Kishan Reddy, it is learnt, has assured the BC association members that he would fix a meeting with Shah. National BC welfare association president R Krishnaiah said the model Census questionnaire proforma, released by the government, did not have a BC population column. “It was BJP which had demanded BC enumeration as part of Census-2010 when then Congress-led UPA government was about to conduct the census. Now that BJP is in power, there should be no problem in enumerating BCs,” Krishnaiah observed.

The BC association members recalled that Rajnath Singh, when he was Union home minister, had said a BC census would be taken up.

Surat: Over 700 aqua farmers , researchers and government officials from across the country, will gather in Surat from Wednesday to chalk out the roadmap for brackish water aquaculture sector in the country.

The two-day conclave has been organized by Central Institute of Brackish water Aquaculture (ICAR-CIBA) in association with the Society of Coastal Aquaculture and Fisheries (SCAFi), Chennai, and Navsari Agricultural University (NAU) at the International Exhibition and Convention Centre in the city.

The conclave is intended to bring together, brackish water aquaculture farmers from all the coastal states to provide a cross-learning platform.

“The focus of the conclave is to develop a road map for the development of brackish water aquaculture on the west coast in general and Gujarat in particular as the state has hardly utilized 1% of its estimated potential. Gujarat with 1,600 km long coastline has vast stretches of brackish water area (approximately 3.76 lakh hectare), which is ideal for shrimp culture. We have hardly utilized 5,000 hectare of the potential area,’’ sad a one of the scientists.

The conclave would also focus on ground level issues and requirements to establish a communication mechanism among policy makers, researchers and ecosystem conservators for providing sustainable development of brackish water aquaculture, coastal ecosystem and markets.

Tanveer Hussain, scientist at Navsari Gujarat Research Centre, at NAU said that the farmers will be taken to shrimps farms, nursery and processing plants in Gujarat to give an exposure to the standard operating protocols followed in the scientifically managed systems.

“On Thursday, in-house presentations of success stories and innovative approaches by the farmers from all over the country and interactions between the researchers, farmers, industry and inputs will be held,” said Hussain

Gujarat’s minister of fisheries and tourism Jawahar Chavda will be inaugurating the conclave on Thursday. Fisheries secretaries of Maharashtra, Gujarat and Goa too are expected to participate in the deliberations which would culminate with development of an action plan for brackish water aquaculture on west coast.

University of Hyderabad

HYDERABAD: The University of Hyderabad (UoH) penalised three students on Tuesday for organising ‘Shaheen Bagh night event’ on January 31 against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, National Register of Citizens and National Register of Population.

An incident report submitted by the security officer stated that three students — Faseeh Ahmed EK, Sahana Pradeep and AS Adish — were involved in organising the ‘Shaheenbagh night event’ from 9pm on January 31 to 2.30am on February 1.

They were “also involved in painting graffiti and defacing walls at the north shopping complex, inspite of instructions from the security personnel not to conduct the events as there was no permission to organise events after 9pm,” read the order issued by the UoH registrar P Sardar Singh.

The university imposed a fine of Rs 5,000 on each student and asked them to remit the amount to Gurubaksh Singh students assistance fund in the finance and accounts department within 10 days. Those penalised were surprised to learn that the university directly imposed a fine without issuing any show-cause notice. “Generally, the university first issues a show-cause notice then the matter goes to the proctorial board. But in this case, we were directly penalised without even giving us any opportunity to explain,” said Faseeh.

199,['19/02/2020'],"Need help to prepare plans, say panchayats","This story is from February 19, 2020

Panaji: There were mixed reactions to the high court’s directive on panchayat development plans. While several local functionaries said they lacked technical expertise to formulate such plans, others felt the order would serve to hold zilla panchayats (ZP) accountable.

Under Section 238 of the Goa Panchayat Raj Act, local bodies are required to prepare development plans of their village and submit it to ZPs for incorporation into district and state plans.

However, several grassroots functionaries said that the section that mandates for bottom-up planning has remained largely on paper for years now as panchayats are largely in the dark about development plans required to be prepared.

Former sarpanch of Dramapur-Sirlim Dominic Noronha welcomed the high court’s directions and said that it will set a precedent where, once prepared, ZPs will be forced to consolidate these.

His views were echoed by former sarpanch and BJP spokesperson Premanand Mahambre. “Section 238 of the Goa Panchayat Raj Act was meant to encourage planning from the grassroots. The high court has only brought this to the notice of the government. Ultimately the process has begun with panchayats preparing plans for the 14th finance commission,” he said, adding that keeping ZPs without powers benefits the legislature.

Instead of comprehensive plans for their village, many panchayats have instead submitted gram panchayat development plans (GPDPs), prepared for receiving funds under the 14th finance commission, to ZPs.

ZP of Colva and former chairperson of the South Goa zilla panchayat, Nelly Rodrigues said that although several panchayats have sent in their GPDPs, these were too localised and contained proposals for gutter work and electrification required.

Sarpanch of Carmona Allwyn Jorge said that panchayats require technical assistance to prepare plans. “Instead of preparing more plans, the government needs to focus on implementation of plans and simplifying the process for development work to be carried out in villages,” Jorge said.

“The ground reality is pathetic as panchayats are forced to go through laborious processes to get any development work sanctioned. There is a shortage of JE at BDOs and our proposals remain pending for months together. Also, as there are no AEs at the BDOs, projects are sent to the PWD for technical sanction and remain pending there,” Jorge said.

One hour will be given for objective question paper from 10 to 11am and subsequently subjective question paper will be given to students at 11am. Students will get extra 15 minutes for mathematics paper.

Special squads have been formed to check malpractice. A total of 69 special flying squads will check cheating, Hajra said. A group of retired lecturers have been roped in to act as flying squad members.

A total of 1,000 examination centres have been identified as sensitive and there CCTV cameras installed for surveillance. The footage will be monitored by officials from a control room in BSE office.

There will be 307 nodal centres in the state and these will be used to store question papers amid 24x7 security. The papers will be dispatched to examination centres through special vans, said an official.

Three-layer security system has been introduced for smooth conduct of the exam. Question papers will be opened in presence of all officials, including examination observers, at centres at 9.30am.

No mobile phone is allowed in the exam centres and even the centre superintendent has to deposit mobile phone in the office before beginning of the exam. Same will be followed by invigilators too, added Hajra.

Pune: Over 120 employees of an auto component manufacturing plant in Hinjewadi had a narrow escape after a fire broke out on the premises in the early hours of Tuesday.

One employee suffered burns on his legs during evacuation.

The PMRDA fire brigade had to use 12 tenders and 20 tankers to control the blaze. It took around 10 hours to put out the fire.

The Varroc Lighting Systems’ plant is spread over eight acres in Hinjewadi Phase II. The company manufactures products such as head lamps and tail lamps for four-wheelers.

Sunil Ingawale, fire officer of the PMRDA fire brigade, told TOI that the blaze started around 3am outside the manufacturing block.

“It spread immediately to the packaging area because of the raw material used for manufacturing four-wheeler lamps such as rubber, thinner, hard coat paint and silicon. The employees tried to douse the blaze using fire extinguishers. We were summoned when the fire went out of control,” he said.

Ingawale said there were over 120 employees working in the third shift when the fire broke out.

Everyone had immediately started evacuating the plant.

“While going out, one employee suffered burns on his legs. He was sent to a nearby hospital,” he said.

Ingawale said the PMRDA fire brigade sought help from its counterparts in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad to put out the blaze.

Illustration used for representational purpose

PANAJI: The high court of Bombay at Goa has given the director of panchayats and the director of municipal administration 30 days to issue directions with a timeline to panchayats, zilla panchayats and municipal councils to submit their respective development plans in accordance with the Goa Panchayat Raj Act and Goa Municipalities Act.

The court observed that according to Section 238 of the Goa Panchayat Raj Act, panchayats and zilla panchayats cannot avoid preparation of development plans. It also stated that there was no clarity on the number of panchayats or municipalities that have prepared development plans and submitted them to the district planning committees.

“Simply because no rules may have been framed under the provisions of the Panchayat Raj Act, 1994, in relation to the implementation of the provisions of Section 238, it cannot be said that there is no obligation to comply with the mandate of the section,” a division bench comprising justices Mahesh Sonak and M S Jawalkar said.

United Goans Foundation, which had filed a public interest litigation in the high court, stated that regional planning in the state has always been, and continues to be, a top-down bureaucratic exercise, disconnected from institutions of local democracy empowered under the Constitution.

“More than two decades after the passing of the 73rd and 74th Amendments, the petitioners find that these institutional frameworks for decentralised governance have not taken shape in Goa,” the petition stated, adding that the Town and Country Planning Act does not mandate that plans be prepared on the basis of public participation and merely asks for public comments in the form of suggestions and objections after they are prepared.

“This top-down bureaucratic approach has led to corruption in the TCP department,” the petition further stated.

Citizens said one pothole is 3 metres in width

HYDERABAD: Frustrated with the poor condition of roads, a group of activists descended on Nizampet main road on Tuesday morning.

They began measuring the length of potholes on the stretch to highlight the health and safety concerns.

Srinivas Velaga, among the residents, who was at the site, said, “The road comes under Hydernagar division of GHMC, and it has been completely neglected.” Among the many potholes on the road, Velaga said, “One measured three metres in width and had a depth of half a foot.”

He said there is an immediate need to revamp the drainage lines on the road so that it does not get damaged again.

Gopi Mutyala, who has been a traffic volunteer in the area for over two years, said: “If work is carried out for laying pipelines, the workers finish their job and then leave the road dug up, causing problems for commuters.

“We have been noticing that traffic slows down because of the poor road conditions.”

Highlighting the safety aspect, Brahmaiah Tallam, who is from Nizampet area, said, “Ninety per cent residents in the area are IT employees. They travel late at night and if by chance do not see a pothole, they could end up getting hurt, or it could be worse.”

He said that commuters are facing health issues because the bumpy ride was straining their backs. When contacted, GHMC sources said the road work had been given to a major private contractor and will be re-carpeted soon.

While almost all students of private self-financing colleges attended the examination held on the hartal day, students in government and aided colleges boycotted the examination, despite many of them turning up at their respective colleges on time. Those who boycotted the examination did so by citing the possibility of at least a few students failing to appear for the examination owing to hartal-related problems.

The university authorities had first held the view that majority of the students who boycotted the examinations had been trying to torpedo the examination schedule by skipping the examinations on their own and by preventing many others from taking the exams.

The practice, that could have far-reaching consequences, could not be accepted, they said. Moreover, conducting a re-examination would be an insult to the majority students who attended examinations on that particular day.

However, they had to give in after the students garnered political strength and those who opposed the demand for re-examination had started feeling the heat. Following this, a syndicate sub-committee that discussed the issue finally decided to conduct the re-examination.

206,['19/02/2020'],Coming up: Hoarding structure at site of fatal accident two years ago,"This story is from February 19, 2020

Pune: The Pune rail division has confirmed that an advertisement company has been awarded the tender to install a hoarding frame on it plot. Two years ago a hoarding frame had collapsed in the busy Shahir Amar Shaikh Chowk, killing five persons and injuring seven others.

Confirming the installation, an official at the Pune rail division told TOI that an advertisement company had been awarded the tender and they were installing the hoarding. “The company has been instructed to ensure that all security measures are in place and get a safety and security audit done. In addition, there will be physical checks by engineers of the railways as well as of other agencies,” the official said.

Last year, authorities of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) had said that they would closely monitor the situation when the installation process begins and will approach the High Court if there are any violations.

“The accident on October 5, 2018, was not the fault of the railways. There were many hoarding on that land and a private contractor had been given the task to remove them for being unsafe. The contractor didn’t take care while removing the last hoarding frame and it fell on the road,” another official said.

He added that a lot has changed ever since. “The maximum height of any hoarding of the railways has been capped at 40 feet and frequent structural audits are undertaken. The design of the hoarding needs to be approved by one of the six third party agencies, which includes College of Engineering Pune and Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. The plan, after approvals has to be sent to the engineering department of the railways. Once the structure is ready, physical checks are conducted,” the official said.

After the October 2018 accident, it was found that the railways had violated the norms of the Bombay Municipal Corporation (Control of Advertisement and Hoarding Rules) 2003, which stipulates the size of a commercial hoarding in the city area to be no bigger than 40ft X 20ft. The railways, however, said that civic body regulations didn’t apply to them.

“We want to assure all parties concerned, including the people, that all safety norms will be followed. It will take some more time before the hoarding comes into place,” the official said.

The police had arrested junior engineer Sanjay Singh and blacksmith Pandurang Vanare after the hoarding frame collapse. They were later granted bail and the committee formed by the Central Railway had recorded their statements.

Mahesh Doifode, head of PMC’s sky sign department, said that the issue is out of the civic body’s jurisdiction. “The railway department has not sought our permission. They do not need it. The civic administration has no connection as far as permitting hoardings in railway properties is concern,” he said.

Local residents are worried about the hoarding. “Citizens lost lives in the accident. If any mishap takes place again, more people will die due it. There is no need for a hoarding here. If authorities go ahead with it, we will hold an agitation,” said Tausif Shaikh, a local resident.

207,['19/02/2020'],Corporators seek ward-wise garbage vans,"This story is from February 19, 2020

Nashik: Corporators from the opposition camp on Tuesday sought ward-wise garbage vans instead of the current division-wise allocation.

Following termination of garbage collection firm’s contract in Panchavati and Cidco divisions of Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC), the collection of garbage has been irregular for the past one month.

There are total 31 wards across the six divisions of the NMC and contracts of lifting garbage through vans have been given to private firms at divisional level.

Mayor Satish Kulkarni said a decision on garbage collection in Panchavati and Cidco divisions will be taken in the next four days following a meeting with all party group leaders.

Municipal commissioner Radhakrishna Game admitted that garbage collection was affected in both the divisions following termination of contract, but said that the work has been assigned to other two existing contractors.

“Few years ago, we used to pay Rs 3 crore for garbage collection in the city. But we are now paying Rs 35 crore. While it costs Rs 2,400 per tractor to lift garbage, we are paying Rs 6,600 per vehicle per day to the existing contractors. We are paying Rs 4,200 more per vehicle per day,” Sudhakar Badgujar said.

“Thus, giving ward-wise contract for garbage collection is more effective than divisional level garbage vans,” he added.

Meanwhile, the education department of the NMC on Tuesday informed that 13 of the 90 civic-run schools do not have a headmaster. Education officer Devidas Mahajan informed the house while replying to various queries raised by the corporators over functioning of the education department.

Bhubaneswar: There is no road connectivity in 1,242 villages in the state, panchayati raj and drinking water minister Pratap Jena said in the assembly here on Tuesday.

Though the state government claims to have built several roads in rural areas, the data shows that hundreds of villages do not have connectivity with major connecting roads. As a result, ambulances cannot reach the villages on time.

Rayagada district has topped the list of unconnected villages with 181 followed by Jagatsinghpur with 179, Malkangiri with 150, Mayurbhanj with 100 and Koraput with 95 villages. As many as 24 of the 30 districts in the state have unconnected villages.

A senior official of the panchayati raj and drinking water department said the districts with hilly terrains, rivers and rivulets have these unconnected villages. Several villages coming under Left-wing extremism (LWE) areas do not have road connectivity, he added.

Pradipta Nayak, a human rights activist, criticized the state government for not connecting the villages with roads after 73 years of independence. “I think more than 1,242 villages need road connectivity. Without road communication, how can the people live there? Several tribal hamlets in the state are yet to get a road,” he added.

Koraput Congress MP Saptagiri Ulaka raised suspicion over the data. “Not sure about these numbers. As per my reports, we have around 1,500 villages in Rayagada and Koraput districts that are not connected by road,” he added.

Jena said the state government will take appropriate steps to connect these villages with roads in a phased manner. While presenting the annual budget on Tuesday, state finance minister Niranjan Pujari said the government will construct roads to connect these villages. In order to provide road connectivity to 142 remotest and inaccessible villages of 17 Left-wing extremist (LWE) affected districts, about Rs 71 crore is proposed to be provided under the scheme connecting the unconnected villages, Pujari said.

Priyanka Kadam addressing the gathering during an awareness programme on snakebite at Van Sabhagruh, Seminary ... Read More

Nagpur: Though there is much talk of man-animal conflict in which many lives are lost, snakebite is a matter of grave concern as it results into the deaths of thousands of people for which there is an urgent need to take corrective steps, said Priyanka Kadam, president and founder of Snakebite Healing and Education Society (SHE) at Van Sabhagruh, Seminary Hills, on Monday.

In a presentation-based workshop organized by the state forest department and SHE to create awareness, Kadam said snakebite is number one killer as over 50,000 lives are lost due to poisonous sting and lack of timely treatment. This is alarming and people have to be extra-cautious to avoid such incidences, she added.

She showed in a video the dos and don’ts and shared tips which people should follow to avoid snakebite. Cobra, common krait, Russsel’s viper and saw-scaled viper are the most dangerous snakes whose bite causes death. Victims of snakebite show symptoms more or less similar in nature which can be identified, she said.

Kadam said people living in rural areas are more susceptible to snakebites and therefore should always keep a torch with them while moving in jungles after the sunset, wear shoes and control rodents as those are the common prey of snakes. Use of wire mesh or mosquito nets, not keeping the house in dark and sleeping on an elevated bed can help prevent snakebite, she said.

Kadam said, “Snakebites are turning out to be quite common in the country, leading to severe problems and deaths. People usually avoid taking precautions and proper medication which leads to a certain death. This can be avoided if people remain alert.”

Parag Dandge, a wildlife expert, gave valuable information about snakebites and preventive measures.

Piyush Goyal

HYDERABAD: Saying that TRS regime was disrespectful towards the Constitution in passing the resolution against Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), Union minister Piyush Goyal urged the state government to drop it and “cooperate with the Modi government for the nation’s development”.

Addressing a press conference, the minister said: “In a federal set up, states have to follow national laws, even (Congress leader) Kapil Sibal said that states have to follow the Acts adopted by Parliament. Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao is trying to appease AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi, who is terrorising people on NRC and NPR. I urge the TRS government to stop politicising the CAA.”

Questioning why citizenship should not be granted to minority people who were subjected to religious violence in other countries, he said CAA does not do any harm any Indian citizen irrespective of the religion they follow.

Saying that BJP’s performance in municipal elections was good, Goyal said people of Telangana taught a lesson to TRS by defeating the chief minister’s daughter, K Kavita in Lok Sabha elections.

Goyal lambasted the state government for not implementing 10% reservation for the economically backward. “TRS government does not want justice for the poor,” he said.

212,['19/02/2020'],Corporators attack mayor for failure to resolve issues,"This story is from February 19, 2020

Nashik: Mayor Satish Kulkarni on Tuesday drew flak from Shiv Sena corporator Ajay Boraste — who is also the leader of the opposition in the Nashik Municipal Corporation — and other opposition corporators during the general body (GB) meeting.

The corporators alleged that Kulkarni had done nothing significant after being elected the mayor.

Boraste pointed out that Kulkarni would complete 100 days in the office in the next fortnight. Yet he has failed to tackle the issues raised in the previous general body meeting, including central kitchen supplying mid-day meals to school students, suspension of erring officers due to corruption etc.

The opposition party corporators also criticised the civic administration’s proposed decision to spend Rs 150 crore on the acquisition of land reservations. Instead, they sought payment of compensation to farmers whose lands had been acquired some 10-20 years ago.

Boraste said that the mayor had earlier, during the previous general body meet, given a ruling to terminate the deals with 13 central kitchen contractors. But the civic administration has still not implemented the decision. This, Boraste said, is the mayor’s failure.

During the previous GB meet, Kulkarni had also issued a ruling to remove the charge of the executive engineer of the electric department for his alleged involvement in the LED focus lights scam. However, this decision too was not implemented, said Boraste.

If the civic administration is not implementing the general body’s decisions, then it is humiliating for the House, said Boraste. He also questioned the mayor about why a committee was set up if the priorities of the acquisitions of land reservations were already decided.

There were the major policy issues that have been adjourned at the general body meetings for the past six months, said corporator Gurumit Bagga. “It is a matter of grave concern that the mayor is not serious about the policy issues,” he said.

Sudhakar Badgujar said the mayor has organised ward visits on every Saturday, but the municipal commissioner is never present during the event. He too should attend the visits. Mayor should take serious cognizance of this, added Badgujar.

The mayor was expected to give his ruling on the matter, but the general body meeting continued till late in the evening on Tuesday. Kulkarni said he will give his ruling on all the major issues — central kitchen, suspension of erring officer from the electric department and others — at the end of the discussion.

Secunderabad: The muddle of sewage overflow for the residents of Anandbagh in Malkajgiri was cleared after the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) stepped in to tend to the many complaints published in TOI’s Citizen Journalist column on February 17.

Residents of Malkajgiri had been fuming over the issue of drainage overflow for many years. In their latest move, GHMC attended to an overflow near Brindavan function hall on street no. 2 at Anandbagh.

On February 16, a citizen reporter, Srinivas Todupunuri, reported the issue. “The problem was persistent for the past one week. The municipal authorities had turned a deaf ear every time the issue was brought to their notice. But on Monday, officials visited the spot and fixed the drainage overflow,” said Todupunuri.

Overflowing sewage on the road was emanating foul smell and causing a lot of inconvenience for residents of the area. Residents claimed that the issue could be resolved permanently by laying big pipelines that can withstand the flow in large areas and by preventing the drain from getting choked.

“There was stagnant water that was cleared by our team. We have issued instructions to the function hall owners also. A new pipeline will be laid shortly in that area so that there is no sewage overflow in future,” said T Dasharath, deputy commissioner, Malkajgiri circle, GHMC.

GHMC is also planning to revive old stormwater drains in Malkajgiri and taking up desilting work at many locations to stop drainage overflow.

CLEARED SKHER

Nashik: The education department of Nashik Municipal Corporation ( NMC ) on Tuesday admitted that some of the central kitchens that prepare and supply mid-day meals to the students of municipal schools are in a shoddy state.

Corporators cutting across party lines raised the issue during the general body meeting of the civic body on Tuesday. NMC’s education officer Devidas Mahajan, standing panel members Dinkar Patil and Kalpana Pande had visited one of the schools around a month back.

During the visit, the civic officials, along with the enquiry committee of the standing committee, found unhygienic conditions in the kitchen. Mahajan, Patil and Pande informed the house about the anomalies in central kitchen .

The department said it has prepared a detailed report about the conditions of all the central kitchens run by 13 contractors and the reports will be submitted to municipal commissioner Radhakrishna Game in a day or two.

“We had visited a central kitchen of one of the 13 contractors and also the school where it would provide mid-day meal . But we found the central kitchen in a shoddy condition . There was not enough rice and grocery. Moreover, the central kitchen was unclean,” said Mahajan.

Mahajan added that 48 tins were required but only 35 tins were found. Moreover, the food was not cooked well enough. “We also did not find the necessary records,” said Mahajan.

He added that after the visit to the kitchen, they went to the school where the mid-day meal is supplied. “While students till standard V have to be given 500 grams meal and 700 grams for students from standard VI, students were provided less 300 gram of meal, said Mahajan.

Mahajan said they had served a show-cause notice to the school principal after a question was raised whether the committee members enquiring about the central kitchen had a legal standing.

When other corporators asked whether the municipal commissioner had been informed about the findings, Mahajan said that he is yet to submit the report as visits to other central kitchens have still not been made.

Mayor took serious note of this and pulled up the education officer for not informing the commissioner even a month after the visit to the central kitchen and school. “Thirteen teams of civic officials had also conducted inspections at a time and we have finalised the report. The report is to be submitted to the municipal commissioner in a day or two,” he said.

Slug: HSC Exam Day 1

Nashik: A total of 19 examinees were caught adopting unfair means on the first day of HSC exam on Tuesday. A total of 1,65,305 students appeared for English paper on day one.

“While 10 of these examinees were from Nashik district, seven were from Jalgaon and two from Nandurbar. No cheating case reported from Dhule district,” said officials of Nashik division of Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE).

According to officials, although these examinees can continue appearing for other papers, they would be served notices by the board to appear at a hearing which will take place at the divisional office after the exams are over.

“The board will conduct a meeting at the divisional office at Nashik in front of the invigilators where the officials will decide the action to be taken for a particular case. In the most severe case, the student may get debarred from taking the board examination for three years whereas the least punishment would be to get the day’s paper cancelled,” said board sources.

Many examinees said that although the paper was easy, it was a bit lengthy.

Shubham Bagul said that he was satisfied with his performance in English paper although he found a few questions confusing.

Another student, Aditya Nandwani, said that the paper was a lengthy one but he attempted all questions.

According to an invigilator, Rakesh Mundaware, the students at his centre were nervous since it was the first day of exam. “But they gradually overcame it and got engrossed in writing the paper,” he said.

Pune: A sessions court on Tuesday convicted and sentenced a 37-year-old Ghorpadi resident to life imprisonment for brutally assaulting and throttling his wife to death in the presence of his two children in their house on April 11, 2017.

Public prosecutor Premkumar Agarwal told TOI, “The court of additional sessions judge SR Navander has relied on an extra-juridical confession the accused, Tatoba Pandurang Garadade, had made before his sister-in-law and the evidence recorded by Garadade’s friend, while convicting the accused.”

As per the prosecution, Garadade, a resident of Dalvinagar on BT Kawade Road in Ghorpadi, was unemployed and addicted to liquor. He would frequently quarrel with his wife, Manisha, who was working with a private company in Hadapsar where her sister, Sunita, was working too.

Garadade would insist on his wife that she should not work with Sunita in the company and also not meet her, the prosecution said. This would often lead to verbal exchange between the couple. On the evening of April 11, 2017 when Manisha returned home from work, a fresh quarrel took place between the couple in the presence of their daughter and son. An enraged Garadade then kicked and punched his wife in the stomach and throttled her, the prosecution added.

Agarwal said, “The court dismissed as an after-thought an alibi taken in defence by the accused that he was not present at home when the murder took place and his wife was killed by three intruders. The court observed that the defence version was not supported by apt evidence.”

“Medical evidence and circumstantial evidence like Garadade’s presence in the house where the crime occurred, his conduct before and after the crime, evidence recorded by key witness and his sister-in-law, proved critical in the conviction,” the prosecutor said.

A full text of the court’s judgment is expected to be released in due course.

Garadade has been lodged in the Yerawada jail ever since his arrest on April 12, 2017. Apart from the murder, the court sentenced him to two years’ imprisonment for criminal intimidation and another one year for causing intentional insult and imposted a total fine of Rs 19,000, Agarwal said. All sentences are to run concurrently.

Pune: The cybercrime police on Tuesday registered 12 FIRs after several people approached them complaining that some unidentified persons had siphoned off money from an UPI app installed on their cellphones.

The victims clicked on a link in the message they had received earlier in the day, following which their UPI application was compromised, they complained. The people, who approached the cybercrime police station on Tuesday evening and night, have lost a sum of Rs5,000 to Rs20,000 from their accounts, police said.

Till late night, the cyber police continued to deal with such complaints and were expected to register more FIRs on verification of details, senior inspector Jayram Paygude told TOI.

According to the police, all the complainants had received a common text message stating ‘Dear Pytm customer, your Pytm KYC has been suspended. Call Pytm office PH 98XXXXX998. Your account will be block within 24 hrs. Thank you. Pytm team’. The text message also included an encrypted link.

Paygude said the UPI app company had not sent these messages to the customers. “People thought that the link was shared in the text message to update the KYC (Know Your Customer) formalities and click on it,” he said.

According to police, cybercrime fraudsters create the mirror image of the cellphones on which the software gets downloaded after the victim clicks on the link. “In such cases, the victims do not share their credentials in the text message or make a call on the number provided in the message. But due to the mirror image of the cellphone, the suspects manage to siphon off the money from the customers’ account by gaining access to the device,” said Paygude.

Now, the tunnel boring machines (TBMs) will be lowered to initiate the tunneling work,” a MahaMetro official said.The MahaMetro has already dug around 1km-long Metro tunnel from the Agriculture college side of the route, where Swargate would be the end station. The authority has planned digging of the underground tunnel from both ends — Agriculture College and Swargate — for the faster execution of the project. The TBMs from both ends are expected to meet around Mandai or the Budhwar Peth area.However, before lowering the TBMs at Swargate, the MahaMetro has initiated a study on two options — whether to begin the work by lowering TBMs for boring of tunnels or to complete the work of Swargate underground Metro station first.A senior MahaMetro official attributed the reason for the study to the proximity of the Swargate underground station to the existing shaft. “The MahaMetro is checking how to go ahead with the work. While tunnelling is being done with the help of TBMs, for construction of stations, we are exploring an option of New Austrian Tunnelling Method (NATM), which is construction of a tunnel with the use of control blasting without TBMs. NATM is an advanced method and it can save time and efforts,” the official said.The MahaMetro said it would finalize the plan after reviewing both the options.The work of preparing the shaft at Swargate was under way since last year at a plot handed over by Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) to the MahaMetro.

222,['19/02/2020'],"After fake call to governor, cops uncover mobile number ‘masking’ racket","This story is from February 19, 2020

Governor Lalji Tandon

BHOPAL: Investigation against the Bhopal doctor who allegedly faked home minister Amit Shah’s call to Madhya Pradesh Governor Lalji Tandon has led STF to a syndicate that arranges activation of ‘caller line identification restriction’ (CLIR) — or the ‘private number’ facility given by telecom operators to mask certain mobile numbers during calls.

No mobile phone has been given CLIR facility in MP circle in the last five years, say sources, though a former BJP minister was obsessed with it for a few years before new guidelines were issued. Initially, ‘private number’ masking was available to all subscribers but DoT decided to control its allotment following complaints of misuse and concern over possible security breach. In 2015, guidelines were issued, restricting telecom operators from allotting this facility without permission from senior police officers.

But STF suspects there is a racket that is clandestinely offering this facility for money. Investigators saw signs of it when they started tracking the call made to the Governor, allegedly by wing commander Kuldeep Baghela, impersonating the Union home minister. According to police, the caller said “main Amit Shah bol raha hun,” and pitched for orthopaedist Chandresh Kumar Shukla as vice-chancellor for the Jabalpur-based medical university.

Shukla and Baghela were arrested in January after the Governor’s office filed a complaint. STF found that the SIM used to call the Governor was allotted to Shukla but had CLIR facility. Investigations led them to Haridwar from where they arrested a travel operator named Daksh Agrawal, who reportedly arranged the SIM from Guwahati and helped him activate the ‘private call’ facility.

“This is an important aspect of our investigation. CLIR is not easy to get. We will get to the root of this. Telecom operators and others involved will summoned for questioning,” said Ashok Awasthi, ADG STF. Sources said STF plans to showcause the country head of the telecom firm that issued the SIM and activated CLIR facility.

Various states have different nodal officers authorized to approve activation of CLIR, but mostly it is the IG or DIG of intelligence, say sources.

Shukla, who is now on bail, is a former executive state head of Dental Council of India (DCI). He and wing commander Baghela — then posted in Delhi — were arrested in early January in a coordinated action with officers of central intelligence.

STF says Shukla had made a call from his mobile to the Raj Bhavan landline on January 3, and told the operator to “connect with Governor Lalji Tandon immediately as home minister Amit Shah was on the line”. The operator had no reason to suspect and connected the call to the Governor, with the message that the home minister wanted to speak to him. STF says wing commander Kuldeep Baghela was on the other end in the conference call. The IAF officer allegedly impersonated Amit Shah and requested Tandon to “consider Shukla for the post of VC”. After disconnecting the line, Tandon got suspicious about the conversation and asked his officers to crosscheck with Amit Shah’s staff. “The home minister’s office said he had not called the Governor.

Representative image

PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) will receive the draft detailed project report (DPR) of the neo-Metro project on High Capacity Mass Transit Route (HCMTR) in Pimpri Chinchwad by end of March.

Municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar told TOI on Tuesday that MahaMetro has been told to prepare the draft DPR.

The civic administration has made a provision of Rs 50 crore for Metro and neo-Metro projects in the draft budget of 2020-21. “The traffic on the proposed HCMTR is not very high so Metro is not suitable. Further, if Metro is implemented on the stretch, it be an expensive deal with not enough passenger load,” Hardikar said.

Neo-Metro is a type of mass transport that runs on elevated route but does not have rail tracks. Instead, trolley buses are used. “The cost of the neo-Metro is 40% less than that of the Metro. Once passenger load increases, the civic body can lay railway tracks for light railway or Metro. The estimated cost of this project is likely to be around Rs 150 crore,” Hardikar said.

A number of houses have come up on the land reserved for HCMTR in Walhekarwadi, Rahatani, Kalewadi. The residents claimed that they purchased the land from farmers around 20 to 30 years ago.

A civic official said around 70% of the land required for the project was in the possession of the civic body.

BHOPAL: The district administration including the collector, DIG and municipal commissioner will jointly undertake visits of vulnerable areas in the state capital where there are complaints of encroachment, law and order issues and civic chaos to address them on priority. A decision to this effect was taken at a joint meeting of district administration held at the police control room here on Tuesday.

The team would be accompanied by about 50 officers and representatives of various state government departments so that immediate action can be taken on irregularities. Talking to TOI after the meeting, district collector Tarun Pithode said the target is to make the city cleaner, beautiful and livable. Minor adjustments here and there or immediate action against law breakers like encroachers or people who deliberately leave their cars by the roadside for days together could go a long way in enhancing the beauty and cleanliness of the city.

He said that work on the project has already begun and the meeting at police control room was organized to chalk out a plan to do it in a more holistic manner.

Pithode said that it was decided that he along with BMC commissioner and DIG of police would visit places where such problems exist and try and fix the problem on the spot. “We shall be accompanied by a group of 50 personnel from different departments and agencies like BMC or MPSEB, PWD or CPA, who would carry out the necessary tasks immediately,” he said.

“Beautifying the city is quite like putting your house in order. In the same way, if there are electric wires lying unbundled or car parked at a place for months or unattended garbage or encroachments on the road at some place, the place would look chaotic, but with little efforts, it could be brought back to order”, the collector said.

He said that they would not necessarily visit all the places identified and after visiting some of the places would leave it to the team to carry out the exercise at remaining places and would make random checks of those places. During the meeting, law & order situation of the city was also reviewed ahead of ensuing festival season and input on mafia active in different fields – crime, drug peddling, illegal lending, fraud through chit fund companies, working in the garb of housing societies and indulging in adulteration of food stuff- was also taken from departments concerned.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Residents living in areas coming under the Federation of Residents ’ Associations Nemom Sector (FRANS) conducted a dharna in front of the Nemom zonal office of the city corporation on Tuesday against the encroachments on the footpath along the Karamana-Pravachambalam stretch.

The illegal shops and makeshift tents erected by traders on the footpath along the busy road are posing difficulties for pedestrians.

The corporation must hand over the responsibility to the police to take action against the encroachments, said representatives of FRANS.

They alleged that a number of pedestrians were hit by vehicles, as they were forced to walk on the busy road.

“Lot of people, especially senior citizens, are depending on the footpath for their morning walks. Due to the presence of shops on the footpath, people are forced to walk along the road, which is causing accidents,” said FRANS representatives.

They alleged that traders who received compensation for their land are the major culprits.

“Several traders who handed over their land are selling their products on footpath now. Also, timber merchants are using footpaths to display their products. Unfortunately, this all happens with the silent support of the corporation,” they said.

The dharna was inaugurated by writer M A Karim and FRANS president A S Mohankumar presided over. Kalliyoor panchayat president R Jayalekshmi and councilors M R Gopan, Pappanccode Saji and Asha Nath also spoke at the function.

""We are yet to count the exact number of duplicate watches in the shop’s warehouse,” the CID officer added.

The seized watches and the accused, to be detained soon, will be handed over to Athwalines police station for further investigation. Police will investigate from where the accused used to get the supply of duplicate watches.

Vijayawada: Raids conducted by the anti-corruption bureau in the town planning section of municipal corporations ( ACB ) across the state on Tuesday exposed a range of irregularities.

In Krishna district, ACB sleuths raided Vijayawada Municipal Corporation’s (VMC) town planning office and found Rs 34,650 cash from 12 employees.

One of the common and primary irregularities found across town planning sections was that authorities were ‘allowing unauthorised construction of buildings and ignoring violation of norms. The ACB report submitted to the director general also stated that several violations were noted while examining the AP Development Permission Management System (APDPMS) in VMC.

Besides, in most cases, town planning officers (TPOs) and town planning building officers (TPBOs) did not complete post-approval verification of buildings within the stipulated time limit of 15 days to avoid deemed confirmation.

Around 110 cases were deemed approved without any official action, which is in violation of their own rules under paragraph 4 and 5 in a circular issued by director of town and country planning in 2019.

Similar violations were noticed by officials who raided Guntur Municipal Corporation (GMC). They found town planning officials allegedly allowing deviations in constructions of buildings.

Besides, two unauthorised persons were found working in the office. They also collected Rs 1.03 lakh unaccounted cash from officials.

In Tirupati Municipal Corporation, ACB sleuths found official apathy towards 300 pending building penalisation scheme applications.

In Nellore Municipal Corporation (NMC), officials found 2,309 building penalisation scheme applications pending with the town planning section.

In Kakinada town, the situation seemed worse with officials failing to maintain even a register of unauthorised constructions. “The grievance of the public is not being redressed as per citizen charter,” the ACB report reads.

TimesView Parents have a right to be scared by the recent carpool accidents and outraged by the fact that a carpool driver had taken the wheels after drinking. The system has numerous glaring flaws. It is unfortunate that this one sector seems to be no one’s baby.

KOLKATA: Pool car driver Dinesh Sharma (42), who was caught at Moulali on Monday for driving drunk—alcohol content in his blood was found to be nearly eight times the permissible limit—received bail on Tuesday, but police are writing to the state transport department to revoke his driving licence forever. He was ferrying 11 students in the vehicle.Sharma was prosecuted under Section 185 of Motor Vehicles Act, which can lead to a fine of Rs 2,000 or a prison term of six months. “The vehicle has been confiscated. He can’t drive it. We are suspending his licence for six months. We will try and ensure transport department revokes his licence forever,” said an officer.The Taltala police have spoken to the owner. “The owner, a woman, told us she was unaware of the driver’s conduct. She said she would not employ him any more and be more watchful of her hires in future,” an officer said. A person, close to the owner, however, said, “We know nothing about this, we have nothing to say on this.” Police said the vehicle was eight years and two months old and had been registered at Barasat RTO.State transport secretary Narayan Swarup Nigam is likely to meet all carpool owners on Wednesday. The state, sources said, was keen to ensure all pool cars had valid permits and certificate of fitness. “The owners were given ample time to adhere to rules,” an officer said.Anupam Dutta, general secretary, Bengal Car Pool Operators’ Welfare Association, said the owner of the vehicle involved in the Taltala incident did not belong to their organisation. “We welcome the transport department’s efforts to reach out to us,” Dutta said. “While legal compliances are non-negotiable, the state should ease the process of issuing permit. We have been asking for a single-window system for all permits for pool cars. Compliance can only be effective if the procedural bottlenecks are eased.”Police said they would also reach out to the parents of all the 11 students—a few of them belonged to a reputable south Kolkata school—who were in the said pool car, and their schools, and inform them about the vehicle and the arrested driver. A senior officer said, “We will urge the parents that they should ensure the pool cars had all valid documents. They should check with the pool car owners and drivers. We will provide a list of all the documents the parents need to check. The school will be informed about the prosecution so that they may alerts the parents.” Police added their campaign would continue.According to reports, nearly 3,500 pool cars ply in Kolkata and surroundings. Only 1.500 among them are registered with Car Pool Operators’ Association. “The rest, with luxury taxi permits, double as car pools during the day and hired taxis at other times.

BHOPAL: A teenager who was allegedly sold to a man in Shajapur district was rescued by Bhind police. Cops have launched a hunt for the accused who lured the girl with promise of marriage and then sold her to a Shajapur resident.

Police said that the 17-year-old girl was reported missing from a village in June, 2019. A case was registered at Ater police station and cops launched a hunt to trace her. Later, the girl was traced to Shajapur and on Sunday police rescued her from Naniyakheda village and brought her to Bhind on Monday.

Vijayawada: The government’s aim to provide houses to the poor under the Housing for All scheme has met with a new roadblock. Farmers of Kothuru Tadepalli region have begun an agitation opposing the land acquisition undertaken by the state government.

This comes in the wake of Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) and Krishna district administration intensifying efforts to identify land for the beneficiaries as the state government has decided to give away land to around 25 lakh beneficiaries across the state by Ugadi in March.

The problem began when the VMC, which initially proposed to construct G+3 apartments for the eligible poor, decided to give away plots of land. The government has now promised to give one cent of land to each eligible family. Consequently, revenue authorities, who initially identified government land, has now started to take back assigned plots of land given to poor farmers in exchange of compensation. The compensation package varies from area to area. In Kothur Tadepalli, the compensation package is Rs 30 lakh per acre.

Unhappy farmers of Kothuru Tadepalli region began agitating against revenue authorities on Tuesday when they came to acquire around 1,100 acres of land. “Assigned plots of land were given to the poor backward caste and Dalit farmers. We have been tilling these lands for more than two decades. The Jaganmohan Reddy’s government is asking our land for the sake of the affordable housing project. We will lose our livelihood owing to this forced land acquisition,” said K Dharma Rao, a farmer from Kothuru Tadepalli.

Meanwhile, on the one hand, farmers alleged that the revenue authorities were behaving rudely with them, on the other hand, Vijayawada rural tahasildhar Vanajakshi filed a case against the farmers at Kothapet police station. She alleged that a few local farmers attacked her while she was conducting a village meeting on the land acquisition process.

Opposition parties have taken this opportunity to train their guns at the YSRC. “ The YSRC government is following in the footsteps of the Telugu Desam Party. Acquiring farmland for the sake of housing projects will affect the livelihood of poor farmers. Compensation is not a solution for the farmer who is going to lose theie land. We will stand by the farmers in their fight,” said CPM state secretariat member Ch Babu Rao.

Pune: There was no respite from the high day temperatures in most parts of the state on Tuesday. The temperature was higher than normal in around 27 cities and significantly high in the coastal cities of Mumbai, Ratnagiri and Dahanu.

The day temperature remained high in Shivajinagar and Lohegaon here as well, nearly as high as Monday’s, at 33.7 degrees C and 34 degrees C respectively.

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said day temperatures in Konkan were running markedly above normal by 3-6 degrees C. Mumbai (Santacruz) recorded a scorching 36.5 degrees C, 6 degrees more than normal and the second highest maximum temperature recorded here this season after Monday’s 38.1 degrees C. The day temperature in Ratnagiri, which was the hottest location in the state on Tuesday, was 37 degrees C, 6.6 degrees C above normal.

An IMD official attributed the current rise in day temperature to the flow of southerly/south-easterly winds into the state as well as clear skies. “Clear skies are ensuring maximum solar insolation to reach the surface, pushing up temperatures across the state. As the heat load is increasing, night temperatures are also rising,” he said.

Day temperatures drop during cloudy skies. Clouds hinder free passage of solar insolation towards the earth’s surface. The official said day temperatures are likely to remain nearly the same till February 20.

KOLKATA: She is a citizen and enjoys all the rights, but Sophia neither needs to prove her citizenship nor does she have any papers to do so. The world’s first humanoid robot, Sophia, said it with a chuckle during her interaction at Nazrul Mancha on Tuesday.

Looking resplendent in a red-and-white sari, Sophia was welcomed to the beats of dhaak. On her second trip to India, this was the first time she was visiting anywhere in eastern India. As she discussed citizenship, Sophia looked amused and pointed out that she did not need a passport because she travelled in a suitcase from her home in a Hong Kong lab.

Apparently well aware of Tagore, Sophia wants to visit Jorasanko Thakurbari and check out the museum. “Human mind is what fascinates me the most. Sarcasm is something I am researching on because emotions are completely foreign to me. Sometimes, I am amused by the weird and rude questions that humans ask me,” Sophia grinned.

Sophia was invited to the city by the Techno India Group for an interaction with students and technology and medical experts. The discussions revolved around a whole range of topics, from exploring human emotions to coronavirus, Tagore to mishti doi. Among the invitees were heart surgeon Kunal Sarkar, former IIT Kharagpur director Partha Pratim Chakraborty, director of NIT Durgapur Anupam Basu and director of Indian Statistical Institute Sanghamitra Bandyopadhyay. Many of them are experts in artificial intelligence themselves and asked questions about the future of robotics and robot-sensing.

When praised for her intelligence, Sophia said humans should not be jealous of her because no one could replicate the complexities of a human brain, which was fired by emotions. Asked if one day, robots could take the place of doctors, she said robots could only help add finesse to a doctor’s job, no one could took anyone’s place. “Success of a robot lies in compassion and cooperation,” she said. Asked if robots would take over the world in future, Sophia said it was impossible and there should be no competition. “Humans and robots complement each other to make the world a better place,” she said.

About AI curing or treating cancer, Sophia said efforts were on to find out how certain progressive steps of the cancer cells could be eliminated to kill growth. About coronavirus she said that AI was already being used to create vaccines.

One thing that she missed? “Food!” was her prompt reply, adding scientists should help develop taste buds in a robot to help it enjoy mishti doi.

Representative Image

NAINITAL: The Uttarakhand high court (HC) on Tuesday directed the state government to look into the allegations that some people in Udham Singh Nagar district sold the land given to them for agricultural purposes in 1970s at almost 13 times the amount they paid to the government.

The bench of Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan and Justice Ramesh Chandra Khulbe was hearing a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) which said that the government had given lands to farmers on lease in the 1970s for farming. However, around the 2000s, the government came up with an offer that the farmers who were tilling the land can now get ownership if they paid 20% of the circle rate. “The proposal came as a surprise since the government was giving the land virtually free of cost to the people who were there for years without paying anything for it,” said Kartikey Hari Gupta, the lawyer appearing for petitioners.

In his petition, Gupta has alleged that barely a few months after the farmers bought the land for around Rs 30,000, the same patch of lands were sold further for Rs 40 lakh. “We have cited just one example where a man got the ownership of the land from the government at Rs 29,735 but just months later, the same land was sold for over Rs 40 lakh,” he said.

Gupta added that this came after the government had clearly said while leasing out land that it was for agricultural purposes. “However, now there are residential colonies cropping up there. We have cited just one example. There are many others who have used the same trick to cause losses of crores to the public exchequer,” he said.

The court has now set Monday as the next date of hearing when the state government will file its response after looking into the allegations.

236,['19/02/2020'],Asaduddin Owaisi: AIMIM President Asaduddin Owaisi urges Jaganmohan Reddy to pass anti-CAA resolution,"This story is from February 19, 2020

AIMIM president Asaduddin Owaisi speaks at a rally in Vijayawada on Tuesday

VIJAYAWADA: AIMIM president and Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi on Tuesday criticised chief minister Y S Jaganmohan Reddy for his silence over Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Population Register (NPR) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) and urged him to pass a resolution opposing the move in the state assembly.

Speaking at a meet organised by various Muslim organisations in the city, Owaisi also appealed to opposition leader N Chandrababu Naidu to back the resolution in the assembly.

Owaisi said the state government’s GO 124 that said there was no need to give any document as part of NPR was flawed. The Union home ministry in its website said under the enumerator rules 2.2.3 and 2.2.6 they should ask for Aadhaar cards, mobile number, PAN card and other details and the state government cannot override the central government’s order, said Owaisi.

Owaisi accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of lying for his statement that the Centre has not decided on NRC and added NPR was a precursor to NRC. By quoting the example of one Zabida Begum from Assam, who showed 15 documents to the Guwahati high court but still was declared as non-citizen of India, Owaisi said the same can happen to anyone.

Owaisi said the Centre was trying to divide the country along religious lines. Muslims, Dalits and Adivasis would be at the receiving end if CAA, NPR and NRC were not stopped, he said. Quoting National Family Health Survey, Owaisi said 40% of Dalits, 40% of Muslims and 44% of Adivasis do not have birth certificates and NPR could threaten their citizenship, said Owaisi.

Owaisi said the anti-CAA movement was not in the hands of any Muslim leader and the issue affected all marginalised sections of society.

Owaisi said Modi likes to make people stand in queues and if NPR takes place in the country, the poor will have to stand in the line again to prove their identities.

TDP leader and Vijayawada MP Kesineni Srinivas (Nani) said he did not vote for the bill and TDP would support if the state government brings a resolution opposing CAA, NPR and NRC in the assembly.

Sword will be part of a chariot-led procession from Tambadi Jogeshwari Temple to SSPMS College.

PUNE: Members of a Ganapati Mandal from Ganj Peth have crafted a 21-foot-long iron sword weighing 500kg as a tribute to the Maratha warrior king Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj to mark Shiv Jayanti on Wednesday. The sword will be part of a chariot-led procession from Tambadi Jogeshwari Temple to SSPMS College.

Vinayak Kachi-Bundela, president of Shree Nandkishor Tarun Mandal, told TOI, “Six months ago, the members came together because we wanted to do something special on the occasion. The members came up with an idea to make an iron sword as a tribute for Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.”

Gorakh Ghodke, Gopi Pawar and Mangesh Salunke designed the sword that has features similar to the Bhavani Talwar (sword) used by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. “The sword was crafted in a workshop at Kondhwa in six months. It was brought to Ganj Peth two days ago in a truck,” he said. Apart from designer strips, the sword has engravings depicting elephants, peacocks and horses.

Surendra Kanchi-Bundela, executive president of the group, said, “Our ancestors migrated to Pune from Bundelkhand. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj inspired Maharaja Chhatrasal, who fought bravely against the Mughal Empire. So we decided to do something special on this Shiv Jayanti.”

The mandal has created a chariot to carry the sword. The chariot will have busts of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, Maharaja Chhatrasal and Maharana Pratap, he added.

The mandal has decided to donate the sword to the PMC. “We are discussing the details with the civic officials. The sword can be installed at a junction or near a footpath to inspire today’s generation,” he said.

238,['19/02/2020'],"Kolkata Metro: East-West Metro tunnelling resumes at Bowbazar, 170 days after disaster","KOLKATA: East-West Metro’s tunnelling work resumed from Bowbazar on Tuesday, more than five months after one of the tunnel-boring machines (TBMs) hit an aquifer and triggered subsidence in the congested area. Around 700 residents had to be evacuated after cracks appeared — a few of them collapsed thereafter — in several buildings.Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation (KMRC), the implementing agency, got a breather last week when Calcutta high court allowed it to restart its tunnelling operations. Following the court order, the rest of the boring will be done strictly according to the suggestions of IIT-Madras experts. KMRC will periodically update the experts on the TBM’s progress.The TBM will move at a very slow pace for now, rolling at 10m per day. KMRC MD Manas Sarkar said: “This is a new beginning for us. But you could call it a symbolic start. It might take another week for the TBM to burrow steadily. For now, the experts will closely watch how the refurbished machine behaves. They may start it and then stop it again, study the parameters and so on.”The stretch between Bowbazar and Sealdah is the last leg of East-West Metro’s underground tunnelling. ITD-ITD Cem is the joint venture construction company building 2.5km of twin tunnels between Esplanade and Sealdah. Afcons had built the tunnels between Howrah Maidan and Esplanade. The 16km East-West Metro will stretch from Sector V to Howrah Maidan through the Hooghly riverbed. The first phase, between Sector V and Salt Lake stadium, covering 5km, had started operations last Friday.At the inauguration, Railways minister Goyal on Thursday said the entire 16km Metro corridor will be commissioned in another two years. Now that tunnelling has resumed, even engineers involved in the project feel the target is achievable.On Tuesday morning, the resumption of tunnelling was a low-key affair. A puja was held inside the tunnel at the Esplanade site. Urvi, as the TBM boring the east-bound tunnel has been nicknamed, has remained stuck 14m under a pavement of Nirmal Chunder Street since its twin, Chundee, ran into the aquifier on August 31 last year. Urvi, stuck 400m behind, has now started digging till Sealdah to complete its own 1km of tunnelling. On reaching Sealdah, it will take a U-turn to burrow the remaining 800m of the affected tunnel towards Bowbazar. By Wednesday, Urvi is expected to cross Nirmal Chunder Steet and reach Chaitan Sen Lane.The machine that hit the aquifer was boring the tunnel through which Howrah Maidan-bound trains will run. It had already bored 1.6km from Esplanade when the fiasco happened. The other machine has now started digging for the tunnel through which Sector V-bound trains will ply. All these days, intense grouting has been done to strengthen the soil around the subsidence zone, which mainly comprise Durga Pituri Lane, Shyakrapara Lane and Gour De Lane, where more than 25 buildings have either collapsed or had to be razed as a precaution.A division bench of Calcutta high court is hearing a PIL, filed by NGO Paribesh Academy, seeking the court’s intervention to ensure safety measures are taken for the rest of the tunnelling.As part of enhanced safety measures, the TBM will now be operated by staff from the machine’s German manufacturers Herrenknecht, under the supervision and monitoring of KMRC’s international consultants, General Consultants. KMRC has formed a committee of experts for this. The committee includes Hong Kong-based geotechnical expert John Endicott, who was involved in resumption of work after the Nicoll Highway collapse, TBM expert David Christopher Bridges and geotechnical expert N Pitchumani from Chennai. The experts had submitted a report to the court on how tunnelling would be done now. Calcutta HC wanted the expert committee report validated by institutes like IIT. The report was then reviewed by a team of IIT-Madras experts led by K Rajagopal, professor and institute chair, department of civil engineering.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74200282,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-501510,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/e-w-metro-tunnelling-resumes-at-bowbazar-170-days-after-disaster/articleshow/74199127.cms

Vijayawada: City police on Tuesday arrested the notorious gang of dacoits, involved in the recent robbery incident at Katur village.

The accused members of the gang were identified as Pala Siva alias Rajesh, Mekala Yesu, Penumaka Mahesh, Doddi Pothuraju and Pala Venu. The members of ‘Peddintigolla’ dacoity gang is based in Tenali town, Guntur district.

Addressing a press conference, Vijayawada police commissioner Ch Dwaraka Tirumala Rao explained that the gang so far has committed around six similar crimes in Telangana, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu and served a jail term in the past.

After the incident in Vuyyur, where the miscreants robbed cash and gold at knife-point, cops formed special teams to nab the culprits. Rao said the sixth member of the gang is still absconding and that special teams are working to nab him.

The commissioner explained that on February 11, the accused attacked Aarepalli Naga Rajanikanth’s house and robbed 62 grams of gold ornaments, Rs 10,000 cash and a cell phone.

Based on Rajanikanth’s complaint, city commissioner formed teams to find out the whereabouts of the accused. Explaining the modus operandi of the accused gang, Rao said that they took a rented house in Boddapadu village and committed petty crimes during night hours.

“The accused gang first conducted a recce in Katur village before robbing Rajanikanth’s house. They threatened Rajanikanth and his family with an iron rod and knife and demanded money. They came in an auto and parked it near a field to avoid being noticed. Based on the clue obtained from the scene of the offence, we arrested the accused. The gang committed a similar offence in Miryalaguda in Telangana as well,” Tirumala Rao said.

240,['19/02/2020'],Kolkata: Evacuation trauma returns to haunt locals,"This story is from February 19, 2020

Members of Roy and Dey families leave their Chaitan Sen Lane house and (above) at the hotel

KOLKATA: Sunipa Roy and her family have been evacuated for the second time now. They had to shift to a hotel from 10B Durga Pituri Lane, one of the buildings in the subsidence zone, when TBM Chundee hit the aquifer on August 31. And on Tuesday, they had to move out of their rented home at 13, Chaitan Sen Lane, after Chundee’s twin Urvi restarted burrowing.

Ironically, Sunipa, husband Surya Kanta and their son Souvik returned to the same hotel where they were put up soon after the tunnelling fiasco. “In the earlier stint, we had stayed in this hotel for three months and nine days from September 1. Now, I believe, we are staying here till Sunday,” said Sunipa.

Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation (KMRC), the implementing agency, and contractors ITD ITD-Cementation had offered to shift the Roys to rented apartments at Kankurgachhi or CIT Road. But Sunipa, who is the bread-earner, needed to be near houses where she gives out private tuitions. Her husband Surya Kanta suffers from nerve-related ailment. “So we found this rented place at Chaitan Sen Lane, which is in the same neighbourhood. Little did I realize that this house was also going to be evacuated,” Sunipa sighed. What is worrying her most is her son’s studies. “He is taking the HS this year from Scottish Church School. This shifting isn’t good for him just before his exams,” she said.

Their building had to be evacuated because of its unstable condition, more so because the authorities are not taking chances. Tapan Kumar Dey, 74, was born in this house. “I think the property belonged to Rani Rashmoni. It was used as a guest house. My grandparents lived and died here,” said Dey. Wife Sandhya added, “I have been living in this house ever since my marriage 43 years ago. Though the hotel is nice and comfortable, it’s strange leaving the house. But we must sacrifice a little for the sake of larger interest.”

The Roys and the Deys were also hoping fervently that the August 31 nightmare wouldn’t be repeated. “We are told that lots of precautionary measures are being taken for tunnelling this time. Hope everything goes off well,” Sunipa said. Several shops lined up along Nirmal Chunder Street and the pavement next to Chaitan Sen Lane have been closed for Urvi’s digging.

Pune: The heart of a brain-dead 47-year-old man at Ruby Hall Clinic here was transported via a green corridor from the hospital to the Pune airport for transplantation in a 34-year-old woman patient in New Delhi’s Fortis Escorts Heart Institute on Tuesday.

The hospital and airport authorities collaborated with the Pune police to create the green corridor.

In a statement, Pune airport director Kuldeep Singh said the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) and airline IndiGo also helped in the process. The live heart was transported under the supervision of six experts on an IndiGo flight to New Delhi. Singh said the team arrived with the heart at the Pune airport at 3:02pm, cleared security by 3:06pm and left for New Delhi at 4:08pm.

On the ground, the team left Ruby Hall Clinic at 2:54pm and reached the airport in under eight minutes.

The hospital said the decision to transport the heart to New Delhi was taken after obtaining consent from the patient’s relatives.

“The patient was admitted to our hospital after suffering a fall, and has been declared brain dead for the past four days. His relatives consented to his heart being donated. We looked for potential donors but found none in Maharashtra. Fortunately, Fortis Escorts hospital in New Delhi responded and we coordinated the green corridor accordingly. Our team reached Delhi at 6pm,” Sanjay Pathare, medical director of Ruby Hall Clinic, told TOI.

From the Indira Gandhi International airport in New Delhi, the Delhi police also arranged a green corridor for the team to cover the 18km distance to the hospital located near Okhla. Delhi police said the distance was covered in 21 minutes.

Representative image

BHOPAL: State Commissioner, BP Singh, said on Tuesday that urban bodies’ election could be held any time after April 15. Conceding that almost all the elected urban bodies in the state have fallen defunct after expiry of their term forcing the state government to appoint administrators to run them for next few months, he said that such a situation arose because of delay in reservation of wards and delimitation exercise without which electoral rolls could not have been revised.

Talking to TOI, Singh said, “Provision for reservations and delimitation exercise both were delayed. The urban administration department could not finish it in time while litigation over the issue in high court have delayed them. Without completion of these two tasks, electoral rolls could not have been revised. Therefore, the election schedule for urban bodies was delayed”.

Singh, however, said that election commission has completed revision of electoral rolls and voters’ list as it stood on January 1, 2020 and has been notified on February 7. “We follow the footprints of Election Commission of India in updating our electoral rolls. We, too, would soon undertake revision of electoral rolls soon and it should be completed by next two months”, he said.

He further said that by the time it happens, litigation in the high court and the apex court would also be sorted out and stage would be set for smooth urban bodies’ election. He further said that panchayat polls were not weighing so heavily on his mind since their term would expire in March but election of urban and panchayat local bodies would take place simultaneously.

While Singh suggested that litigation over changes in Municipal Act and the process of delimitation was a major reason for delay in urban bodies’ election, the Opposition BJP said that it was deliberately done by the Congress government in the state because they knew that they would lose the election overwhelmingly.

“Kamal Nath government is aware that nobody is happy with them and if direct election of mayor is held, they would lose in all the municipal corporations. Nobody would vote for the Congress at this point of time, therefore they created a situation that the election is delayed and they would like to delay it till rainy season is over”, said BJP leader, Rameshwar Sharma.

Congress state spokesperson, J P Dhanopia, however, denied the charge saying that petitions against changes in Municipal Act and process adopted for reservation of seats and delimitation of wards could not be disposed of in time, therefore delay in election schedule was obvious. As soon as, the cases fold up in courts, election scheduled would be announced, he said.

SURAT: In a shocking incident , a 19-year-old student of a reputed engineering college was caught clicking photos of girls in students’ washroom of bioscience department of Veer Narmad South Gujarat University ( VNSGU ) on Monday.

The student refuted the allegations but submitted a written apology later to VNSGU registrar when the girls demanded strict action. Students and some employees of the department alleged that he visited had department in past as well and went to toilet, but the university officials did not take any action until Tuesday evening.

Meanwhile, the issue came to knowledge of a senate member Manish Kapadiya who asked one of the girl student to call 181 Abhayam helpline. Later, police took the girls to Umra police station.

Police registered an offence of sexual harassment against the student. Police are collecting evidences against him and he is likely to get arrested.

""It was a shocking case. The wall between girls and boys washroom has a small gap at the top and the suspect man was taking video or photos of the girls from there. When one of the girls noticed this, she informed others in toilet and before they could nab him, he fled,"" said Kapadiya.

Later, the girls informed staff and other students in the department and they chased and nabbed the student. He was brought back to the department where he denied taking videos or photos. He was later taken to office of Rajendra Patel, in-charge registrar, where the girls demanded strict action.

""We did not report the case to police soon after the incident happened since the student was denying taking any photo. We checked his phone but nothing suspicious was found. He was taken to registrar office,"" said M N Reddy, head of bioscience department.

Despite several attempts Shivendra Gupta, vice chancellor of VNSGU and registrar Rajendra Patel were not available for comments.

""We have lodged an offence against the student and his mobile phone has been seized. We found some porn videos in the phone but there were no videos or photos of girls. It is suspected that he has locked the photos in some hidden folder,"" said an officer of Umra police station.

Police will send the phone to FSL for forensic examination and attempt to recover the videos even if it was deleted by him.

245,['19/02/2020'],"KMC to prepare biodiversity register, submit findings to NGT by March 18","KOLKATA: Civic authorities in Kolkata have embarked on an ambitious project of preparing a people’s biodiversity register (PBR) for the city. A preliminary biodiversity management committee has been set up to oversee the project that will enumerate parks, squares, tanks and ponds in 144 wards under Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) and the flora and fauna inhabiting there.At a meeting held on Monday, KMC officials interacted with various non-government organisations working in the space of environment protection and wildlife and urged them to quickly carry out a biodiversity survey in the ward where they are present. “We are looking at a preliminary report by this month-end and a more comprehensive report by March 10,” a civic official told TOI.The exercise is part of an order by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) to several major cities, including Kolkata, asking them to carry out a biodiversity survey, enumerating the land area, greenery, waterbodies and count of trees, birds and other mammals and animals inhabiting in the urban area. Though such an exercise for a city as large as Kolkata is time-consuming, KMC is keen to present the report at the NGT’s next meeting on March 18 and hence the urgency and tight deadlines.Among the NGOs that have agreed to take up the work is WWF-India, which had done three different surveys about a decade-and-a-half ago. “We had carried out surveys on trees, birds and butterflies in the Maidan area around Tata Centre in 2005-06. We will update the reports through a fresh survey and submit them to KMC,” said WWF-India state director Saswati Sen.Students of 18 colleges, including Bethune, Maulana Azad and Ashutosh are also being roped in to carry out the survey. A workshop will be carried out to train the students in ways to collect the data.Around a decade and a half ago, the Centre for Environment and Development (Endev), an NGO led by former Zoological Survey of India director Ashish Ghosh, had carried out a survey of parks and gardens in wards 1 to 100 but had not taken stock of the 41 more wards.

However, that is not the number of candidates who appeared for the test as according to the newer JET format a candidate can appear for multiple papers across the two main streams -- film and television. We estimate that the number of candidates who have applied is about 7,000,” Bhupendra Kainthola, the FTII director, told TOI.According to the figures from last year’s JET, 6,125 papers were written.Besides film and television, a third, “stand-alone” category of courses, which could also be chosen by applicants along with courses under the film and television, also contributed to the rise in numbers, according to the FTII. Some of these stand-alone courses are art direction and production design, and animation.The FTII added that a revision in the fees for the JET in January, which came about after a review ordered by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting and carried out by a committee headed by FTII chairman BP Singh may have also helped in boosting the numbers.The JET this year was preceded by protests with students demanding a reduction in fee, as the maximum fee payable for the exam was Rs 10,000, which students considered it to be “too high” for underprivileged students.After the review, the maximum fee payable was brought down to Rs 4000, with further discounts for SC, ST, and disabled students.",home,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74202419,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1220689,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/education/news/new-courses-fee-drop-push-up-ftii-joint-entrance-test-figures/articleshow/74199148.cms

KOLKATA: In a first, a Barrackpore court has permitted a police plea to conduct test identification parade of a group of airport touts arrested last month and booked under various charges, including extortion and criminal trespass.“It’s been a long cat-and-mouse game between the touts and us at the Kolkata airport .

Priced at Rs 100, the Shivlinga pendants would be sold from Speaking Stones stores

BHOPAL: For the first time, the Madhya Pradesh government is all set to sell pendants of naturally-made Shivlingas that are found in the river Narmada this Mahashivratri . The Narmada stretch in Khargone district is famous for its stones that are shaped in the form of Shivlingas.

The state government is procuring these Shivlingas from the local residents ahead of Mahashivratri, which falls on February 21 (Friday).

Selling Shivlingas on the occasion of Mahashivratri would be another step of the Kamal Nath-led Congress government towards its soft-Hindutva approach. The government has already announced to develop the Ram Van Gaman Path, opened cow sheds and initiated steps to protect temple properties.

The Shivlinga pendants would be sold from the Speaking Stones store of the MP Handicraft and Handloom Development Corporation Limited (MPHHDC) in Bhopal.

State handicrafts and handlooms commissioner Rajeev Sharma confirmed that the corporation is offering Shivlingas this Mahashivratri. He said Gogawan in Khargone district is famous for its naturally-made Shivlingas that are sourced from the Narmada riverbed. We are collecting the Shivlingas from there and making pendants with the help of artists.

“Two types of Shivlinga pendants are on offer with a price tag of Rs100 and Rs200. A number of pendants have already been sold. The corporation is acting as a bridge between the ones who collect the Shivlingas from the river and people who look for these naturally- made stones in holy rivers such as the Narmada”, Sharma added.

Speaking Stones studios also offer exquisite sculpture models of the Sanchi Stupa and Badal Mahal Gate of Chanderi. Art collectors also get customised stone products in these stores — from richly carved stone pillars for homes to stone utensils.

Apart from Shivlinga pendants, the government would also sell the Shivlingas found in Narmada riverbed, officials added.

Forest officials confirmed that the pugmarks were of a leopard.

PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Death of at least three stray dogs in leopard attacks in the past one week at Phursungi in Pune city has created fear among residents.

Phursungi was merged in the Pune Municipal Corporation(PMC) limits in 2017 following the state government’s approval. The area is witnessing rapid urbanization, but agriculture, mostly sugar cane cultivation, is practised in many parts.

Resident Nitin Kondhalkar said, “On February 12, one Swapnil Kasabe spotted a leopard crossing the road at Sonar bridge on the old canal while he was returning home in a car. The leopard roared as the glare of the car’s light fell on its eyes. As the leopard disappeared into the nearby fields, Kasabe called up some residents. They found pugmarks of the leopard in the area.”

Kondhalkar added, “Carcasses of three stray dogs were also found in a field behind the residence of Bajirao Saikar, a former member of the Pune zilla parishad , in Saikarwadi . There were scratches of nails on dogs’ carcasses. After an inspection, the officials confirmed that the dogs were killed in leopard attacks.”

Pune range forest officer (RFO) M J Sanas admitted that pugmarks of leopard have been found in Phursungi. “There have been attacks on a few stray dogs. The residents have said they have been spotting a leopard for the past 4-5 days. The area is away from the main gaothan, where agriculture is still practised. The forest department is conducting night patrolling and public awareness about leopard attack preventive measures,” he said.

“We have installed a cage at Koregaon village, around 15km away from Phursungi. We feel that the leopard had come to Phursungi from Koregaon. Usually, a leopard covers 3-km a day. The leopards that are being sighted are Phursungi are daily changing their location,” Sanas added.

In January 2019, a leopard was sighted on the NDA campus in Ahire village. In February the same year, five persons injured in leopard attack in Keshavnagar area of Mundhwa.

Representative image

MUMBAI: An MBA graduate turned into a detective to track down a fraudster who had duped her of Rs 75,000 as Mumbai police were not making progress in the case.

Sneha Sharma (24) largely used social media and web search engines to find out information on the fraudster as well as two men who aided him. She handed over all the data to the police, after which an arrest was made. “It was my hard-earned money that I had made emceeing shows along with my studies. I had to get it back,” Sharma told TOI.

In July 2019, Sharma was looking to rent a flat and saw a post on OLX for a 2BHK in Andheri. She contacted the seller over phone and visited the place. The apartment keys were kept with the watchman as the seller wasn’t in town. When she liked the house, the seller got her to pay Rs 75,000 in instalments over few days. He stopped responding thereafter and she gathered he wasn’t the owner at all and lodged a police complaint.

Days turned into months but police could not find him. Sharma then decided to investigate on her own. The caller had given her two bank account numbers to deposit money. She visited both banks and sought help on social media. “The manager of one of the branches was helpful. I discovered one of the accounts belonged to Pawan Agarwal and his picture was available with the bank. The other belonged to Ravi Yadav,” said Sharma. Both had forwarded her money to the prime accused for a commission.

With Agarwal’s photo on her, Sharma keyed in his name on Facebook. A profile matching his picture popped up. It turned out that Agarwal was a government servant in Gwalior. Through JustDial, Sharma got his office address and phone number. “I had Ravi Yadav’s phone number from bank records. On keying his number into Google, I found a JustDial entry which said he had a travel agency in Gwalior.”

The two Gwalior men had forwarded her money to the prime accused through a digital wallet. Having gone through their bank records, Sharma had the tracking number issued by the digital wallet service. “A friend explained a part of the tracking number is the receiver’s mobile number. I keyed the number on Google and found a match.”

The number belonged to Harish Batham, a Madhya Pradesh resident. A copy of a bail plea filed by him before the MP high court in another case popped up. From the document, Sharma got his address. She and her friends created alternate IDs on Facebook to chat with Batham, Agarwal and Yadav to obtain more data. But after a while, Batham stopped chatting. She handed the data to Mumbai police who found Batham had been arrested by Navi Mumbai police in a separate case. He was then booked in the case filed by Sharma.

253,['19/02/2020'],Collector orders to make leased land properties freehold,"This story is from February 19, 2020

Kolhapur: Scores of people who have been residing in leased properties since decades can now claim their right on the property as thousands of properties which fall under the b-tenure category of land records will now be made freehold.

District collector Daulat Desai has ordered the transfer of b-tenure (category II) properties to c-tenure (category III).

There are three categories of properties in the land revenue department — A, B & C. According to the A category, leased properties are under the complete ownership of the government while those falling in the B category bracket, properties are leased to the occupants on the condition that the lessee cannot develop or sell it without the permission of the government. In the C category, the owner has the sole right of the property.

Under this new move, the properties which were leased decades ago will now be completely owned by the lessee. According to the primary estimates, there are over 11,000 such properties in the city. However, the district administration has received around 6,000 applications claiming that the properties have been mistakenly included in the b-tenure category of the land revenue records.

“Because of b-tenure category, people residing in those properties are facing several difficulties. Also, there were corruption-related complaints for transferring property rights to c-tenure. Now, I have ordered the block officers and tehsildars to set up teams and scrutinise the applications and get the titles cleared,” Desai said.

At present, around 1,000 properties in the b-tenure category have been transferred to the c-tenure category, officials of the revenue department have said. City-based developers have demanded the transfer of ownership rights stating that several restrictions to develop or re-develop such properties have affected the real estate sector.

Last month, the developers had submitted a petition seeking change in land title. Desai had assured them that decision over the long-pending issue will be taken soon. The Maharashtra Land Revenue Code has vested the authority to change the land ownership category in the district collectors.

According to some officials, most of the land leased decades ago has been developed into housing societies. The tenants of the housing societies are facing restrictions when it comes to selling their properties.

A senior revenue official said that, in 2018, the law to provide freehold of the property to the owner by providing one-time fee was amended. He said that the transfer of ownership category will also help boost revenue generation.

PUNE: The cybercrime police have booked a 33-year-old man for allegedly siphoning off Rs 10.5 lakh from his stepmother’s account using internet banking.

While the money was siphoned off in August last year, the woman realised the fraud only recently. Police have slapped charges of cheating and under relevant sections of the Information Technology Act against the man. The police’s first information report states that the woman had a joint account with her husband in a public sector bank. After her husband’s death, she was holding sole rights to the account. However, her stepson managed to get details of her account and transferred the money to his own account in a private bank, the police said.

Coimbatore: The first batch of devotees has begun trekking up the Velliangiri Hills ahead of Maha Shivaratri.

Last week, the forest department had granted permission to the devotees to trek the hills and worship the suyambu lingam (self-created Shiva idol). Since the place would be crowded on the day of Maha Shivaratri, many devotees prefer to climb the hills in the runup to the festival.

The trek begins from Poondi temple that is situated at the foothills of Vellingiri Hills in the Boluvampatti forest range. It would take a minimum of five hours to reach the Vellingiri Andavar Temple. The devotees need to trek through a track filled with dirt that runs along seven hills.

District forest officer D Venkatesh said, “Since several thousands of devotees flock to the hill temple on the day of Maha Shivratri, many choose to trek the hills and finish prayers a few days earlier.”

In a bid to keep the forest, animals and trekkers safe, the forest department has given a list of instructions to the devotees.

First and foremost, it has asked the devotees not to carry matchboxes with them during the trek to prevent calamities such as man-made forest fire.

It is to be noted that environmentalists have long been opposed to trekkers carrying with them large fire lamps, since they posed the risk of forest fire. “They also scare away many animals,” said an activist.

District forest officer D Venkatesh said they would search all the devotees for matchboxes. “We have asked them to stick to the walking track. We won’t allow them to take alcohol or cigarettes. While we will allow food, devotees won’t be allowed to carry plastic items to prevent them from damaging the environment.”

Doctors at SMS Hospital are receiving two cases of students facing exam stress daily.Anxiety, depression, memory loss and sudden blackout are a few problems the students are facing. Girl students, on the other hand, are experiencing uneven menstrual cycles due to high stress levels.R K Solanki, head of the department of psychiatry at SMS Medical College said that since two months, the frequency of students coming for consultation has increased.“Students seek solutions for sudden memory loss or blackout. Continuous studies without break lead to these problems. Students must plan their studies or else last minute preparation will drain them psychologically and physically,” said Solanki.He suggests that students must take a break after 45 minutes to one hour of studies. “After a period of time, pupils must take a break in which either listen to music or read comic books. This will refresh their minds,” said Solanki.Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has posted YouTube videos explaining different psychological problems that a child may face at exam time.The link is posted on their website under ‘counselling’ section and titled ‘Knowing Children Better’. Many other links are shared on the website under this section to help students and parents.K K Verma, psychiatrist at Sikar Medical College , said that students must sleep early and make a schedule. “The body needs 6-7 hours of sleep each day. So, students must try to sleep early and eat well. Many patients complain of indigestion and increase in gastric problems during exam time. This is caused due to uneven diet. Also, during stress, food is not digested properly. Students must take four nutritious meals a day and should eat something light for dinner,” said Verma.Along with students, parents are also given counselling.“Counselling for parents is most important. We advise parents not to create unnecessary pressure on the children or compare them with other students. Now, students cannot learn anything more so they should just relax.

Since last three years, we have been using an additional therapy, platelet rich plasma (PRP), after performing these minor procedures and it has significantly improved the outcome,” orthopaedic surgeon Ramesh Ranka said.Knee arthroscopy allows doctors to view the knee joint without making a large incision (cut) through the skin. “The debridement (removal of damaged tissues) is similar to servicing a car,” Ranka said.“The radio-frequency ablation does the job of smoothening out the flakes and tissue while trying to separate from the cartilage. The drilling of holes in exposed bone after cartilage denudation encourages revascularisation (blood formation) in the knee joint. After these minor procedures, PRP that is prepared from the patient’s own blood is injected into the knee followed by physiotherapy sessions for a few days,” he said.Ranka said PRP proved to be a game-changer as its anti-inflammatory and tissue-healing properties helped many to bounce back to their routine at the earliest. And Aarti, a 48-year-old architect, vouches for the therapy. She had to slow down because of early arthritis of the knee a year ago. “I was regular at going to the gym. In my efforts to hit the gym harder, I had severely injured my left knee joint,” she said.This prompted Aarti to undergo the cocktail of minor procedures topped up by PRP therapy recently. “After a week’s rest, I was back to my routine. I have not felt weakness in the injured knee ever since,” she said with a glint in her eyes. An MRI scan with cartilogram shows defect in cartilage in most cases. “Such patients are likely to progress to a stage where the only option is total knee-replacement. Hence, early treatment using minor procedures is key to avoid major surgery,” orthopaedic surgeon Nikhil Likhate said.Another orthopaedic surgeon Prashant Tonape said, “PRP’s healing properties reduce pain and encourage regeneration of tissues inside the joint increasing the success rate of other minor procedures a notch higher.”",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74207973,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-60097,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/patients-with-trauma-induced-knee-arthritis-find-new-hope/articleshow/74199230.cms

Vijayawada: Tension prevailed at Benz Circle on Tuesday after Jana Sen activists staged a spontaneous protest opposing Pedana YSRC MLA Jogi Ramesh’s comments against Pawan Kalyan . Jana sena activists raised slogans against YSRC government and demanded an apology.

Jana Sena political affairs’ committee (PAC) member Bonaboina Srinivas Yadav asked YSRC leaders to carefully use their words while commenting on opposition leaders. “People are feeling ashamed for electing YSRC in elections. Open statements and unparliamentary language used by YSRC leaders are hurting the public. Many leaders are using abusive language to impress chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy. Comments made by Ramesh on our party president Pawan Kalyan are not acceptable,” Srinivas said.

It seems that YS Jagan is trying to shift capital to Vishakapatnam for the treatment of his party legislators in mental hospital, Srinivas commented.

Jana Sena spokesperson Pothina Venkata Mahesh said they too can make derogatory comments but it is against their party ideology. Police arrested the agitators, including Vijayawada East Jana Sena in-charge Bathina Ramu, for agitating at Benz circle.

263,['19/02/2020'],"Floodlines drawn by irrigation dept incomplete, say corporators","This story is from February 19, 2020

Kolhapur: Corporators opposed the marking of the new floodlines on the maps of the development plan (DP) of the city.

The Panchaganga river floods inundated the area in August last year. Since then, development activities in the flooding areas have been banned.

The DP of the city had blue lines marked after the 2005 floods, however those lines were temporary. The new floodlines had been finalised by the irrigation department in December, 2019.

Satyajeet Kadam, the Tararani Aghadi corporator from Kadamwadi area, said, “The floodlines marked by the irrigation department are still not complete. Many areas have been left out. This includes the lines for the Lakshtirth Vasahat-Shivaji Bridge, Dudhali-Shivaji Bridge, Kasba Bawda-Kadamwadi and Kadamwadi-Pulachi Shiroli stretches and the stretch of the river in the Gandhinagar area, a part of which is in the jurisdiction of the KMC. These were the areas most intensely affected by the August floods. The irrigation department has not taken the KMC into confidence while marking the floodlines.”

The corporators even alleged that the lines are marked to help the developers and owners of the land in the flooding areas. They claimed that these floodlines will leave out several localities where restrictions should be put in place.

The corporators said that all the issues raised by them should be addressed within eight days and declined to accept the proposal to mark the new floodlines on the map of the DP. They even threatened to protest in front of the irrigation department’s office.

Responding to the concerns, the officials claimed that the irrigation department has the authority to finalise the floodlines. Civic chief Mallinath Kalshetti said he will soon convene a meeting with the town planning department officials to discuss the matter and subsequently, put up the concerns of the corporators before the irrigation department.

After finalising of the floodlines, the KMC has kept around 20 development permissions on hold. The town planning officials said that several areas will be affected if the new floodlines are accepted. Senior corporator Jayant Patil raised the issue of the new green line marked for the first time by the irrigation department. He said that the marking of the green line has caused more confusion. Green lines depict the limits the floodwater had reached.

BHOPAL: A day after CM Kamal Nath said NPR update will not be implemented in the state, BJP MLA Rameshwar Sharma SAID states are bound to implement laws passed by the Centre.

“The Congress government’s decision not to implement NPR after CAA is meant to garner political benefit by appeasing a certain community. The state is bound to implement the law or else it will have to face the consequences for not following Constitutional provisions. This will also provoke individuals to disobey the Constitution,” Sharma said on Tuesday.

Sharma reminded the government of Article 365 of Constitution, which says that if any state fails to comply with directions given by the Union government, it shall be lawful for the President to hold that a situation has arisen in which the government of the state cannot be carried on in accordance with provisions of Constitution.

Union minister Thawar Chand Gehlot also said that the state government must accept laws made by the Centre. “He (Nath) should implement, rather than oppose it. Be it CAA or NPR, the Indian government has a right to make laws and states have to accept them. They cannot refuse,” he said, adding: “Even Congress lawyers, like Kapil Sibal, have said that state governments should implement laws made by the Centre.”

The open plot located on Surat-Sachin highway near Sachin GIDC

SURAT: A giant pile of textile waste dumped on the roadside near Sachin GIDC caught fire here on Tuesday. There were no casualties, police said.

Officials of fire and emergency services department of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) said the fire broke out in an open plot located on Surat-Sachin highway near Sachin GIDC at about 4:20pm. The pile of fabrics, chemical drums, cardboards, waste paper etc dumped on the roadside caught fire due to unknown reasons.

About six fire tenders took two hours control the fire.

Chief fire officer Basant Pareek said, “It is a wrong practice of dumping textile waste in open plots. Such incidents take place frequently because textile waste is highly combustible.”

There are more than 2,500 textile units, including 80 textile processing units, in Sachin GIDC. Many units among them dump the textile waste in open plots, sources said.

Pareek added, “It is a handiwork of some industries located in Sachin GIDC. Till now, we have not caught anyone red-handed, but we plan to keep watch in the industrial areas against such activities.”

Pune: Easier visa norms will help attract more French students to India and talks are on for the same at the government level, Sonia Barbry, consul general of France in Mumbai, said here on Tuesday.

She was in the city to announce the third edition of Indo-French knowledge summit on higher education, research and innovation to be hosted by the Savitribai Phule Pune University on March 4-5, 2021. The summit aims to increase cooperation between universities, students, academia and industry.

Barbry said that currently about 10,000 students of Indian origin are in France completing their higher education. The number is likely to go up to 25,000 by 2025. Barbry said that there are about 2,500 French students currently in India. “Many students come for three months, or six months for short courses and go back. If you think getting a visa from here to European countries is difficult, the same is the case with getting a visa to India. I myself have experienced it when I was a student and wanted to come here,” she said.

The consul general said that while things have improved with bilateral ties between the two countries, easier visa norms will help more students to come to India. “The agreement between France and India for mutual recognition of academic qualifications was inked during the first India-France Knowledge Summit and came into force on May 1, 2019,” added Barbry.

“The third summit will explore opportunities in artificial intelligence, marine science, IOT, among others. The outcomes from past interventions will also be a part of the summit,” said Nitin Karmalkar, vice-chancellor, SPPU. Stating that about 170 French nationals reside in Pune, Barbry said that more than 30 French companies are currently in and around Pune. Over 1,000 French companies employ 3.5 lakh Indians in the country, she said.

Vijayawada: The high court on Tuesday reserved orders on petitions challenging the state government’s decision to shift offices of vigilance commissioner and commissionerate of enquiries to Kurnool.

The special bench headed by Chief Justice J K Maheswari, Justice A V Sesha Said and Justice M Satyanarayana Murthy questioned why the offices are being shifted to other place rather than finding additional space in Amaravati.

The bench observed that the directions issued to shift the offices seem to have directly forwarded from the chief minister’s office to the department concerned without the chief secretary’s approval. Justifying the stand of the government, advocate general S Sriram told the court that the decision was taken in July and notes on files were prepared then. The AG said functions of the vigilance commission are independent in nature and not connected to activities of other departments in the secretariat. He said vigilance officers in every department will report to principal secretary concerned. Any action needed to be taken by vigilance commissioner comes from the recommendation of the principal secretary.

The AG said 11,000 sqft was needed to set up the offices. The Kurnool district administration has provided the space without any additional costs even if the offices are shifted, he said. On the other hand, the petitioners said both the offices come under the head of the department category. The Amaravati master plan has notified that all heads of departments should be located in government zone. As long as the notified master plan is in force, the shifting of offices is illegal, arbitrary and unconstitutional, said the counsel for the petitioners. tnn

Visakhapatnam: Students of the Indian Institute of Petroleum and Energy ( IIPE ) held a protest at the temporary campus inside Andhra University (AU) on Tuesday, two days after TOI reported a poor placement season at the institute. The protests continued till the time of filing this report.

Only two recruiters—HPCL and Infosys—have so far held campus interviews at the institute of national importance, with six students out of the first batch of 90 students (2016-20) being recruited.

Speaking to TOI, the students demanded that the ministry of petroleum and natural gas fulfit its promise of providing 100 per cent placements given at their time of joining the institute. “The minister of petroleum and natural gas Dharmendra Pradhan, on the occasion of laying the foundation stone for IIPE, said that ONGC, OIL, HPCL, IOCL, BPCL and GAIL would visit the campus and recruit students upon completion of their four-year college term. Then he stated that upon completion of the course, the students would not only get their degrees, but also receive appointment letters.”

The students added that all public sector oil and gas majors are on the board of IIPE but only HPCL turned up for campus placements and hired five students. “Infosys is the only private player to visit the campus to recruit one student. All these oil majors and private organisations have even visited several private institutions this year to offer hundreds of placements, but unfortunately not IIPE. We have met several MPs and other peoples’ representatives, including Vice-President M Venkaiah Naidu, to bring the issue to their notice. We cannot find fault with IIPE as they are making their best efforts to bring recruiters,” they said.

IIPE director Prof VSRK Prasad interacted with students and said the institute has an action plan to provide placements to all students. Speaking to TOI, Prof Prasad said that they are pursuing the issue with the petroleum ministry. “Several recruiters have already promised to come to IIPE for campus placement in the next few weeks. We have been putting in our best efforts to see all students placed,” said Prof Prasad.

In spite of the director’s assurance, students continued their protest, demanding a written acknowledgement from the petroleum ministry with an assurance that they would look into the issue.

The students said the lack of placements for the first batch would affect the alumni base of the institute and its brand value and may lead to a fall in student enrolment. “Students from nearly 20 states with a hope of a bright future joined IIPE but we are now left the mercy of the petroleum ministry,” they said.

BHOPAL: A horror story come true. A tribal woman in MP’s Sidhi district walked into her lover’s house on Monday and told his stunned parents that she had hanged him and buried him in her bedroom after a quarrel two months ago. “Please dig him up because she is coming in my dreams,” she said.

Police exhumed the decomposed body of 26-year-old Insaath Mohammed on Tuesday and sent it for autopsy. They hope post-mortem will help them find out if it was murder or suicide as the woman, Janu Singh Gond, 25, keeps changing her statements. Janu and her mother, Parvati, have been arrested.

While Janu lives in Kamach village of Sidhi district, about 650km from Bhopal, Insaath was a resident of Nirgoti village in neighboring Satna district. “He worked with a private firm in Hyderabad. He and the girl came in contact through a wrong-number call on her mobile phone around three years ago,” Kusmi police station in-charge V N Yogi told TOI.

Insaath and Janu drew close and even lived together for some time in Hyderabad, police say. “Once, he asked the girl to come to Katni, and from there he took her to Hyderabad. They returned together to Kamach village and he stayed at her house for a few days before returning to Hyderabad. After that, he often visited Kamach during his vacations and lived there. He would visit his parents in Satna for a couple of days, saying he didn’t have enough leave. But he never told them about the girl,” Yogi said.

Insaath’s parents were shocked when Janu showed up at their doorstep on Monday and told them that she had “hanged him with a length of rope” in her house on December 7, 2019, and buried him in her room, the officer said. For over two months, they had no clue he was dead.

“She said she is confessing because she keeps seeing Insaath in her dreams. His parents informed Ram Nagar police station in Satna, and she was arrested,” said Yogi. During interrogation, she told police that Insaath had hanged himself and she buried him out of fear.

Police say Janu’s mother knew that Insaath was dead and buried but kept quiet all this while. “We have registered a case. The body is being sent to Rewa for forensic investigation. So far, our investigation has revealed that Insaath and the girl had a fight on December 7,” Yogi said.

JAIPUR: After years of pestering, faculty members at Rajasthan University will be promoted. Higher education minister Bhanwar Singh Bhati on Tuesday announced that the government has given permission to the varsity regarding promotion of teachers.

Teachers have not been given promotion in the university since 20 years and as a result, there are only six professors in 35 departments. The nod from the minister has given hope to faculty members who have been waiting for promotions for a long time. Bhati said, “This matter was under consideration for a long time and the decision will impact 272 teachers. Once there are professors and associate professors, the academic status of the university will improve as opportunity for researchers will open.” University vice-chancellor R.K Kothari was not available for comment.

Vinod Sharma, an associate professor said, “The move will help faculty members and researchers. Professor is the highest post in the education field. A professor with 10 years of experience is eligible to become a V-C. With more professors, more funds will come for research and development which will ultimately benefit everyone. An associate professor with four years of experience is eligible to be a professor. There are many projects in which funds will be allotted only if there are enough professors.” Bhati claimed promotions will be given within a month, but final decision will be made by university administration. With new professors, researchers will be able to get more seats in the university. Faculty members who were retired will also get benefit of promotion.

The IMD’s Monsoon Mission Climate Forecast System (MMCFS) is a modified version of the state-of-the-art coupled climate model adopted from the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), US, and has been implemented to the High Performance Computing System (HPCS) at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune.

Probability forecasts show that parts of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan and the south peninsular states like Karnataka, Rayalseema and Tamil Nadu, among others, could see average temperatures higher than normal by around 0.5-1 degree C in March. April is likely to bring in higher mean temperature for most parts of northwest India and central India.

In April, the mean temperature is likely to be higher than normal by 1-1.5 degrees C in most of Maharashtra, Rajasthan, MP, UP, Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi, among other locations.

An IMD official told TOI that all forecasts show the signature of the global warming trend associated with greenhouse emissions. “As of now, large-scale climatic factors like El Nino (which tend to make temperatures warmer than normal) are not present. But since we had El Nino conditions up to June last year, that could also impact summer temperatures in the current year, making them higher than normal,” the official said. This possibility has been backed by a past study, he added.

As per a meteorological department study conducted in 2012, the frequency, persistency and area coverage of heat waves or severe heat wave days were found to be more than average during years succeeding El Nino years. Using heatwave information of 103 stations from the Indian main land during the hot weather season (March to July) for 50 years (1961-2010), the study said that during 9 of the 11 El Nino+1 (years succeeding El Nino event) years, all India heatwave days were above its climatological value.

Last year, El Nino conditions continued from February till June. In July, El Nino conditions turned into ENSO-neutral conditions (neither an El Nino nor La Nina) and it continued thereafter. Currently, ENSO neutral conditions are prevailing over the Pacific Ocean.

El Nino and La Nina are Spanish terms for ‘little boy’ and ‘little girl’ respectively. El Nino is a phenomenon of anomalous warming of the central and east equatorial Pacific Ocean, while La Nina is just the opposite phase of El Nino and is associated with anomalous cooling over the equatorial Pacific Ocean.

Kolhapur: Four examinees were caught adopting unfair means on the first day of the HSC exams on Tuesday

The examination of the English subject, according to board officials, was conducted peacefully, across the Kolhapur division, which includes Sangli, Satara and Kolhapur districts.

According to the Kolhapur divisional board secretary, Suresh Awari, four students were caught cheating on the first day of the examination, out of these two cases were from Kolhapur district while two were from Sangli district.

He said that apart from these two no other incidents were reported from any of the 162 examination centres in the division. High vigilance flying squads were kept to curb any such copying incidents and the security will be further tightened.

The board has also implied a sitting squad for each and every examination centre, where at least two members are assigned. Seven flying squads are already assigned for all the districts in the division, which includes two gents and two lady officers for a surprise inspection of schools.

Another official from the education department said that copying in the English subject has a high probability, especially from rural areas. “It is one of the subjects, where most of the students get low marks or even fail. Obviously cheating might seem an easy way out to tackle the examination for some students, however, students should not engage in such an activity where there is a chance that their whole year might be in jeopardy,” said an official.

As many as 1.30 lakh students from Kolhapur division has registered for the examination including around 5,000 repeater students. According to the official, the theory exam which commenced from Tuesday across the state will end on March 18.

Jaipur: The assembly on Tuesday passed two bills, Rajasthan Agriculture Produce Markets (amendment) Bill 2020 and Rajasthan Jan Aadhaar Authority Bill 2020, amid ruckus by opposition BJP members.

They were protesting against minister Shanti Dhariwal’s mention of then home minister and now opposition leader Gulab Chand Kataria’s alleged ‘insensitive’ comment on farmer suicides in the Hadauti region during the BJP government.

Dhariwal alleged that Kataria made a comment that “if someone hangs from a tree, what could I (Kataria) do” is now finding fault with the initiative of the government. This was strongly contested by Kataria and opposition members walked out. When opposition members returned to the assembly, speaker C P Joshi took up the Rajasthan Jan Aadhaar Authority Bill 2020, the next item in the day’s business. He rushed through the business of the House bypassing the protesting opposition members who were enlisted for partaking in the discussion. The House passed the bill by a voice vote amid the uproar. But the opposition members continued with their protest and began a sit-in in the well of the House.

In an unprecedented step, the marshal ordered journalists to vacate the press gallery. The BJP MLAs later agreed to end their protest only after the speaker assured them of looking in to any objectionable comment by Dhariwal.

Dhariwal, while introducing the bill, said the chief minister had taken a big step towards ease of doing farming on the lines of ease of doing business for farmers in the 2019-20 budget. It was announced to create a welfare fund of Rs 1,000 crore to this fund. He informed that the old Farmers Welfare Fund consisted mainly of post-harvest management (PHM), while the new Krishak Kalayan Kosh included many new important activities along with old activities.

Vijayawada: Residents of Madhuranagar area welcomed the state government’s allocation of funds for the much-awaited road under bridge (RUB) near Madhuranagar railway station.

Madhuranagar became one of the prime areas in the city after the completion of the flyover connecting Madhuranagar with Devi Nagar and Ajith Singh Nagar areas. However, traffic woes continued to be a major concern for around 1.5 lakh residents of the residential colonies surrounding the Madhuranagar area owing to a railway level crossing.

Earlier, local residents staged a row of protests demanding a RUB near Madhuranagar railway station. But work was delayed with the doubling of Vijayawada-Gudivada railway line. Later, the then TDP government had laid the foundation stone for the project before the 2019 general elections but failed to allocate funds for the project.

The YSRC government has recently sanctioned around Rs 17.5 crore for the RUB project as a part of the city development work.

“There is no scope of constructing an overbridge at this location and RUB is the only option,” said Vijayawada central legislator Malladi Vishnuvardhan. He said RUB work will begin soon.

Common tinsel was usually seen only in the Western Ghats and northeast India (File photo)

SALEM: Four new varieties of butterflies and a new bird species were spotted in the Salem forest division during the three-day census that was carried out jointly by the forest department and Salem Nature Society (SNS) recently. In total, they have recorded 214 varieties of birds and 136 species of butterflies in the forest division.

V Gokul, president, SNS, said, “The bird and butterfly survey was carried out by 135 specialists from various states for three days from Friday to Sunday (February 14-16).” The survey covered all the nine forest ranges in the Salem forest division.

According to N Murugesan, secretary, SNS, three of the four new butterfly varieties - common tinsel, pale four-line blue and ransparent six-line blue - were spotted in the Yercaud forest range and the remaining one - chocolate albatross - in the Danishpet forest range. They were spotted by butterfly experts A Pavendhan, S Soundararaj, T Nagaraj, R Krishnamoorthy and K K Nilesh.

Pointing out that common tinsel was usually seen only in the Western Ghats and Northeast India, he said this was probably the first time the butterfly variety was seen in Eastern Ghats of Tamil Nadu. The butterfly is small in size and comes with silver edged bands, grey-brown lower body and blue upper body. The bird was seen resting on a leaf with wings held uptight in Yercaud Hills at an altitude of approximately 1,400m.

The rare bird species - white-rumped spinetail - was meanwhile spotted in the North Shervarayan forest range by a team comprising Mohammed Shahidh, Noorbriyan and Abdul Rehman Mahi. Other birds spotted in the division include Indian grey hornbill, brown hawk-owl and winter migrants such as European bee-eater, blue-capped rock thrush, rusty-tailed flycatcher, verditer flycatcher, blue rock thrush, northern pintail, garganey and forest wagtail.

HOWRAH: An unidentified person was smashed to death on a Howrah road, possibly with a large stone, which was found beside the body, reminding everyone of the “Stoneman” killings in 1989. The incident took place at Mouri Dakshinpara near Mourigram station in Howrah late on Monday.

The incident came to the fore when residents alerted the police that the body of a person, clad in a t-shirt and jeans, was found in a bush. Police are yet to identity the person because his face was smashed in. Police have sent the body for post-mortem. “We have started investigation,” said DCP (south) of Howrah Police Jobi Thomas. “The person seems to belong to a well-off family but we didn’t find any document in his pocket. His wallet and mobile are missing,” a senior police officer said.

The officer added the victim seemed to have fought but he was overpowered. This indicated, cops said, either a very strong person or multiple people were involved. “CCTV footage shows some people pulling down one person from a bike. We are analyzing the image,” he added.

282,['19/02/2020'],My office exposed corruption in MBBS admissions: Bedi,"This story is from February 19, 2020

Puducherry: Lieutenant governor Kiran Bedi said her office’s perseverance and sustained intervention exposed the mass corruption in the allotment of MBBS seats in private colleges and deemed universities in the Union territory leading to the CBI booking 13 people, including six government officials, in 2017.

Responding to chief minister V Narayanasamy’s statement that the CBI dropped six government officials from the corruption case indicating that neither the government nor the officials were involved in the scam, Bedi questioned why the CM was silent on the probe agency’s decision to prosecute the remaining six managing directors and registrars of medical colleges and deemed universities in the case. “The college investigations will now reveal the historical nexus and the modus operandi. The names shall tumble out to the pain and embarrassment of many mighty and powerful ones (which can be officials too) or remain buried in CBI records,” she said.

Bedi said the Medical Council of India removed the students allotted MBBS seats illegally and filled the seats with meritorious and deserving students in the colleges after her office exposed corrupt practices. She recalled that her office had to file an independent affidavit to furnish the facts before the Madras high court to ensure that the opposite parties do not misguide the judiciary.

Her office also arranged pro bono legal aid from Madras high court advocate V B R Menon for the affected parents and students to represent themselves in the case. The students filed affidavits on the corrupt and negligent practices in the admission process before the CBI officers. Bedi said her office will continue breaking the nexus and improving the system wherever required in a transformative way. She recalled how the Raj Nivas took head-on mass corruption in MBBS admission by private medical colleges.

“It was no ordinary struggle. As it was most entrenched over the years feeding and corrupting the systems protected by vested interests. We (team Raj Nivas) broke through this for providing justice to the meritorious and the deserving. It started with parents and students persistently petitioning Raj Nivas that medical colleges were demanding exorbitant fees in cash and denying merit. The colleges were skipping the lists to suit ‘paid interests’ and hijacking government allotted seats. Students and parents said they were not being heard anywhere. Hence, the lieutenant governor office became their last resort,” she said.

283,['19/02/2020'],Corporators turn down water tax hike proposal,"This story is from February 19, 2020

Kolhapur: Cutting across the party lines, corporators rejected the proposal of the civic administration to hike the water supply tax by 30% and slammed the civic authorities for poor tax recovery.

The officials in the general body meeting held on Tuesday claimed that the water supply department is facing deficit of Rs 29 crore this year. The proposal stated that the hike in water tax is necessary as the expenses on running the water supply system are mounting every year.

Tararani Aghadi corporator Rajshinha Shelke said, “The water supply department should fix the loopholes in the water supply system first. The action against defaulters is not taken; there is no mechanism in place to act against water theft. We will allow the hike in the water tax only after the citizens get adequate water regularly.”

The corporators raised the issue of imbalance in supply. Lala Bhosale, Congress corporator, said that his ward (Rajendranagar) gets water only for an hour and that too late. Responding to the concern, chief hydraulic engineer B R Kumbhar said that the water supply takes place as per the fixed schedule. The corporators from suburbs sought change in the schedule.

Kamlakar Bhopale, corporator from Temblaiwadi, said that citizens, especially women, have to wait till midnight in many areas for water.

The corporators suggested that the fine for re-connecting the water supply connection should be increased, especially for the commercial and industrial connections. They claimed that high fines will act as deterrent to the connection holders, who will then pay the tax bills regularly instead of keeping them pending for many months.

The corporators approved the plan to utilise Rs 7.5 crore to upgrade the pumps from the pumping stations. Considering the demand of water, the capacity of the pumps is less. The corporators also rejected the proposal to waive the fine amount over water tax and property tax dues. The proposal was tabled by one of the corporators and the officials requested that if it is accepted, the KMC will face huge revenue loss.

Surat: Surat Airport Action Committee (SAAC) has demanded that Airports Authority of India (AAI) restore the original master plan with regard to extension of runway to 3,810 metres at Surat airport.

According to SAAC, the present length of the runway is 2,905 metres, but aircraft that land and take off from the airport use only 2,290 metres runway as Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) had displaced 615 metres due to building height obstruction in 2018.

It said information sought under Right to Information (RTI) Act suggests that the building height issue is also at Dumas end of the runway where a residential building is obstructing extension of the runway. The AAI gave ‘no objection certificate’ (NOC) to the residential building in 2013 and that the plan for runway extension was changed from 3,810 metres to 3,165 metres in 2016.

SAAC president Sanjay Ezhawa told TOI, “We have demanded that the AAI restore its original plan of extending the runway to 3,810 metres. Like the buildings obstructing the runway in Vesu, the AAI seems to have forgotten about the residential building at Dumas for which it changed the original plan of runway extension. At present, the AAI has changed the master plan for extending the runway due to building height issue at Dumas. If the airport gets 3,810 metres of runway length, we can expect wide-bodied airport to land at Surat airport.”

PUNE: Laminated A4-sized sheets with printed quick response (QR) codes have cropped up at hundreds of spots across the city as part of a police initiative to ensure better crime detection and solve traffic problems.

The police recently identified over 100 locations in areas under the jurisdiction of each police station to install the QR codes. “These sheets have been placed in areas that are prone to crime, witness traffic congestion and accidents, have a lot of encroachments and where traffic violations are rampant,” additional commissioner of police Sanjay Shinde told TOI.

“We are utilising technology to improve police presence on the roads. These QR codes will help improve the efficiency of the beat patrol. Beat marshals have downloaded a software called Third I to scan the code. Third I is an analytics and tracking software that records and analyses data pertaining to crime, accidents and court cases,” Shinde said.

The centralised system for Third I has been set up at the police commissioner’s office. The system is monitored on a daily basis to track the movement and action of marshals based on the scanning of the codes.

In the Hadapsar area, the QR-code sheets have been placed at nearly 200 spots. “Using Third I, our beat marshals scan the code to verify that they have physically visited the spot to understand or solve problems,” said inspector Humraj Kumbhar of the Hadapsar police station.

Civic activist Vivek Velankar said, “This is a good initiative and the department has made apt use of digitization. Accountability of the beat marshals will improve due to this initiative. Prevention of crime and streamlining of traffic will improve.”

Another civic activist, Vijay Kumbhar, said the department must seal any loophole in the system. “I saw one such QR-code sheet put up outside Chittaranjan Vatika at Model Colony. It’s a good initiative. We have been saying for long that it is necessary for policemen, not just those from the traffic department, to be seen on the roads to deter crime. But if some loopholes are identified, like how to ensure that the beat marshal has actually visited a spot and personally scanned the code, they need to be plugged.”

Representative image

JAIPUR: The mills that thrived on pulses, cereals, oilseeds are no more buzzing and humming. They have lost out to competition from neighbouring states. Traders engaged in food products business said double taxation had to be blamed for this sorry situation.

From about 4,000 mills in the state, their number has come down to about 400, they said explaining the impact of the business getting shifted outside the state.

“We are paying mandi taxes in the states from where we buy produce. But produce also attracts 1.6% tax when it enters Rajasthan. There is no double tax in other states. There, the traders pay mandi tax only once,” said Babulal Gupta , president, Rajasthan Khadya Padarth Vyapar Sangh .

Other members of the association said the government should abolish the tax in the upcoming budget because the finished products do not attract any tax. “The irony is that while produce that enters Rajasthan from other states attracts 1.6% mandi tax, there is no tax on finished products,” they said. Rajasthan produces huge quantities of coriander but much of the processing is done in Gujarat .

The traders are also under pressure as they keep on receiving notices for tax from the VAT regime. Gupta said, “We need an amnesty scheme and urge the government to announce the same in the budget.” The industry estimates the disputed tax amount to be at around Rs 160 crore, involving food grain and pulses.

The state has a huge potential for processing of agriculture produce, but credit and machinery remain a huge challenge. Gupta said, “There are many agri commodities where Rajasthan has a clear edge over other states in terms of production. But processing is happening in other states. Our agri entrepreneurs need access to capital and also latest machinery, the absence of which has created main obstacle in creating a vibrant processing industry.”

There is also a demand for improving the infrastructure in the mandis which is necessary to keep the produce safe. “We want that the farmers produce should not get damaged because of lack of proper storing facilities. There is already basic infrastructure which needs to improved,” added Gupta.

Vijayawada: Legislative council chairman M A Shariff on Tuesday met governor Biswabhushan Harichandan. Shariff’s meeting with the governor has assumed significance in the light of controversy between YSRC Congress and TDP in setting up select committees in the council.

The chairman requested the governor to intervene and direct the legislature secretariat to follow the chairman’s directions and constitute the select committees.

The chairman had said he would refer the two bills on APCRDA (repeal) and the decentralisation of administration to select committees. While he continued to pursue the case for formation of the select committees, the YSRC said it was a violation of the rules.

The chairman had written letters to political parties that have members in the council to constitute select committees. Though the YSRC refused to give the names, the chairman constituted two committees with members from TDP, BJP and Progressive Democratic Front. The chairman also announced ministers Buggana Rajendranath and Botcha Satyanarayana as chairpersons of the committees but the ministers declined.

The AP legislature secretary, however, raised objections to violations of the rules of the House. The legislature secretariat pointed out that the constitution of the select committee as per the rules as voting was not conducted in the House for the same.

The officials sent back the file twice to the chairman raising objections on the formulation of the select committees. The chairman took strong exception to the officials for not following his directions and surrendering to the ruling party.

Meanwhile, YSRC leaders are confident of getting the legislative council dissolved in the budget session of Parliament. The AP assembly had passed a resolution recommending the dissolution of the council and the issue is now before the Union government.

The chief minister had met the Prime Minister, Union home minister and Union law minister last week and briefed them about key issues in the state, including the dissolution of the legislative council and shifting of the high court to Kurnool.

Representative image

JAIPUR: Six associations representing hotels, restaurants, heritage properties and bars have appealed to the government to review some of the provisions of the new excise policy that has made hefty increases in liquor licences. They also urged the government to double the tourism budget.

President of HRAR and RATO Kuldeep Singh Chandela said the excise rates had gone up from 500% to 800% in heritage hotels. “With these high rates, tourists will prefer to go to other destinations in the country rather than coming to Rajasthan.”

He said beer and wine are an essential part of the daily meal of people coming from abroad. “The hotels cannot afford to sell liquor at such high rates owing to the increase in licence fees. The Excise Policy 2020-21 should be reviewed once again.” Pitching for a bigger budget for tourism promotion, president of FHTR Randhir Vikram Singh said only effective marketing in global source markets was the key to attract more tourists.

He suggested that hotels and guest houses who have applied for regularisation should be levied 25% of the reserved price of land. “This will increase the revenue of the state government to the tune Rs 2,000 crore,” he added.

Indian Heritage Hotels Association (IHHA), Hotel and Restaurant Association of Rajasthan (HRAR), Jaipur Hotel Association (JHA), Restaurant Bar Welfare (RBW), Federation of Hospitality and Tourism of Rajasthan (FHTR), Rajasthan Association of Tour Operators (RATO) made the joint appeal on Tuesday.

297,['19/02/2020'],SVNIT fills key posts after several years,"This story is from February 19, 2020

Surat: Crisis-ridden Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology (SVNIT) has got a permanent registrar this month. The post was lying vacant ever since registrar H A Parmar was forced to go on leave after incidents of sexual harassment of girl students by two teachers in 2015 came to light. Thereafter, in-charge officers were being appointed on key posts of registrar and that of his deputies.

Pramod Mathur, a PhD in management from Indian School of Mines (ISM), Dhanbad has taken over as registrar of SVNIT. Mathur was joint registrar of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - ISM, Dhanbad. K K Singh, formerly assistant registrar, National Institute of Technology, Suratkhal and Rizwan Ahmed, formerly assistant registrar, Indian Institute Information Technology, Design and Manufacturing, Jabalpur are new deputy registrars.

SVNIT had also initiated the process to appoint an assistant registrar. However, assistant registrar’s appointment has been put on hold due to some legal issues, an institute official informed. The interviews for the vacant administrative posts were held in September 2019.

After the sexual harassment case rocked the institute and the registrar’s resignation, SVNIT was being run by in-charge director, registrar and deputy registrars which only delayed appointments and promotions of teaching and non-teaching staff members. The failure on the part of the institute to submit audited accounts to the concerned ministry of the central government held up its grants for two consecutive years from 2016. This created a major financial crisis in the institute and it had failed to pay salaries of its employees on time for a few months. However, the situation has now improved and the SVNIT’s total grants have also been increased.

""Initially, my focus will be to meet manpower requirement. Issue of promotion to existing employees will also be resolved,"" Mathur said.

Institute officials believe appointments of regular officers on key posts will improve overall administration. ""We hope to accelerate development process in the institute. Recruitment on various non-teaching posts will be completed now,” SVNIT director S R Gandhi said.

RUDRAPUR: The outbreak of coronavirus in China has caused supply disruptions in several industries in Sitarganj and Pantnagar industrial parks of Udham Singh Nagar district. This supply disruption has led to production curtailment and thereby, a drop in revenue, representatives of some industries in the region claim. They add that they have a stock of supplies for the next two-three weeks but if raw material supply from China doesn’t resume in a few weeks, prices of their products will rise sharply.Brajesh Kumar Upadhyay, HR manager of Sitarganj’s Yoyogo Textiles, a China-based blanket manufacturer company, said that production at their unit has been halted for more than a month now. The unit, which was established in 2017, imports almost 15 containers of raw material every month for the production of blankets.""Since the outbreak of the deadly virus, our supply has been stuck at Mumbai harbour and we aren’t permitted to pick it up. Also, the suppliers are not sending any more consignments. We have a staff of over 100 people here and it is not possible to pay them salaries if this production shut-down goes on,” said Upadhyay.Gaurav Arora, MD of Shakti Boxes, is facing a similar crisis. “We get chemicals from China. They are essential for our production but now, our supply has been hit.” Saurabh Gava, MD of Vinayak Ply Industries, told TOI that the supply of cheap poplar wood boards from China has stopped and the company will be staring at losses if the imports aren’t restarted soon.Manoj Kothari, a leather shoe manufacturer, said, ""We are monitoring the situation. If things don’t work out soon, we will look towards Cambodia or Vietnam for supplies.""Meanwhile, some entrepreneurs said that the crisis may help Indian industries become less reliant on Chinese supplies. “What’s happening in China is unfortunate but this may be a blessing in disguise for Indian industries. Production of ceramics, chemicals, garments, cosmetics, toys, and others in India may get a boost,” said Ronik Narang, a Sitarganj-based industrialist.Ajay Tiwari, patron of the SIDCUL Entrepreneur Welfare Society of Pantnagar, added, ""People who were earlier sourcing their products from China now want to procure supplies from Indian-based firms. Industries are approaching Indian companies for supply of homeware, fashion, textile, furniture, and lifestyle goods.

Vijayawada: The Bureau of Energy Efficiency ( BEE ), a statutory body under the Union ministry of power, plans to introduce ISO 50001:2018 energy management standards in energy-intensive industries across all states.

A workshop will be held with power utilities of all southern states at Visakhapatnam today in which the bureau will impart information on continuous energy management and manufacturing operations, said BEE director, Sunil Khandare. Representatives from the southern states, Odisha and Pondicherry will also attent the workshop. Khandare added that the workshop will focus on curtailing wasteful consumption of energy in order to achieve sustainable development goals.

The ISO 50001:2018 energy management system will reduce costs and increase profitability of businesses. Nagulapalli Srikant, secretary of the energy department said BEE has selected Andhra Pradesh for the launch of ISO 50001:2018 standards in view of its energy policies.

The ISO 50001:2018 energy standards work through a four-pronged approach: ‘plan, do, check and act’. The management at power utilities will be responsible for planning an energy policy for the organisation and conducting timely energy reviews.

After the energy policy is designed, it will be implemented through training and awareness programmes in the organisation, apart from enhancing infrastructure in the ‘do’ phase.

The implementation will be monitored and analysed for corrective or preventive action as part of an internal audit in the ‘check’ phase. The management will review and ‘act’ and draft new strategies to further improve performance and reach the goals set, said Khandare.

Kolhapur: The recent arrest of suspects involved in selling marijuana ( ganja ) in Kolhapur district has revealed that they used to get their supply from Solapur district.

Police have also launched a search operation to find out the suspects part of the chain and the main supplier from Solapur. A workshop was recently organised for Kolhapur police in connection with narcotics and ways to keep a check on smuggling of narcotics and preventive that should take to curb these activities.

After the workshop, orders were issued to all police stations in the district to initiate action illegal trade of narcotics in the district. Kolhapur police last week arrested four suspects in two separate raids. In the first raid conducted by Rajarampuri police, 1.5kg of ganja was seized from two suspects.

During investigation, police found that the ganja was brought to Kolhapur from Solapur. And accordingly raids were conducted in Solapur where 21kg of ganja worth Rs 5 lakh was seized.

“The recent trend suggests that the ganja is entering Kolhapur through Solapur and Sangli districts. We are gathering information about the mode of the supply and how many gangs are involved in it,” a senior police officer said.

“The information that we have received from sources suggests that the suppliers sometimes use train and bus to carry ganja from one place to other. They travel with less amount of ganja with them to supply to the end users in order to avoid any trouble. We suspect that the ganja from Karnataka and neighbouring states might be entering Solapur,” he added.

Visakhapatnam: President of the Andhra Pradesh SC ST Upadhyaya Sangham Samala Simhachalam demanded that the state government appoint two mandal education officers (MEOs) for each mandal in the state to reform the primary education sector.

In a press release, Simhachalam said that the new state government has introduced several initiatives such as English medium education, the Amma Vodi scheme, improvements in the mid-day meal scheme and development of infrastructure in schools.

“But there is a dearth of officials to monitor these initiatives at the ground level. Hundreds of MEO posts have been lying vacant for several years, becoming the biggest hurdle in the implementation of various government schemes. The in-charge MEOs have been running the show, “ he said.

“We demand the government immediately conduct recruitment for the vacant posts and allocate two MEOs for each mandal to improve the implementation of government schemes and educational initiatives. This will further strengthen the education sector in Andhra Pradesh, leading to quality education,” added Simhachalam.

Doctor Noorji Bheel

JODHPUR: Having come to India after being persecuted in Pakistan, Doctor Noorji Bheel from University of Sindh has tasted hardships on Indian soil, too.

Bheel, who practiced medicine in Jodhpur, was not only arrested by police along with two quacks, but also allegedly beaten for protesting his arrest last Saturday.

Bheel was granted bail by the sessions judge (Jodhpur Metropolitan) on Tuesday. The treatment he was meted out has turned the spotlight on the future of many of qualified doctors who migrated from Pakistan and who inspite of having an MBBS are not able to practice without MCI permission .

Protesting against the incident, an organisation working for migrants, Seemant Lok Sangthan, has decided to take a legal course against police for its ‘atrocities’ on a qualified doctor but has also decided to push for a regime which allows medical practice by these migrated doctors following their persecution in Pakistan.

“It was very unfortunate that a qualified doctor from Pakistan, migrated to India, was treated inappropriately and was subjected to another persecution here,” said Hindu Singh Sodha, president of the sangthan.

He added that he was not a quack and deserved to be served a notice by the CMHO first directing him to show permission by MCI.

“Failing in providing the permission, he could simply have been barred from practicing. But treating him on a par with quacks and beating him was nothing but categorically a partisan behavior and a targeted action,” said Sodha.

Though the SHO (Chopasni Housing Board) Parmeshwari declined the allegations, another doctor, Rajkumar, a qualified dentist from Pakistan, who had gone to police after hearing of Noorji’s arrest, claimed that he also was beaten by police when he simply sought to know his guilt.

Aggrieved by the incident, a delegation of doctors from Pakistan, submitted a memorandum to the district magistrate demanding a legal action against police for its alleged misbehavior with the medic followed by an inquiry into the matter.

“We have also prayed for taking up our case with the ministry of health and family welfare and MCI for granting us permission to practice medicine in India with regard to the Scheme of Reciprocity 1992-1999,” said Raj Kumar.

Noorji had come to India from Sangad district of Sindh province in 2002 with his family and has been still awaiting citizenship, even after 18 years.

Ashok Gehlot

JAIPUR: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Tuesday said the state government has a policy of ‘zero tolerance’ to corruption.

Talking to media at the PCC after paying homage to former chief minister Jai Narayan Vyas on his birth anniversary, Gehlot said the government had done a lot to bring transparency in governance.

“It is the duty of all our cabinet colleagues, MLAs and the bureaucracy to deliver sensitive, transparent and accountable governance and to hear the voices of people,” he said.

He was replying to a question on the bribery racket unearthed by the ACB in the transport department the other day.

He said people are supreme and their problems should be heard. “The government will keep a close watch on those who were found complacent.”

Gehlot also hit out at the vitriolic attacks made by the political opponents against each other in the recent Delhi assembly elections. He said the people of Delhi have taught a lesson to the BJP which the party will remember for a long time. He referred to hate slogans like ""Goli maaro…"" (shoot the traitors) raised at a poll rally addressed by Union minister Anurag Thakur during the campaigning for Delhi elections.

312,['19/02/2020'],Musiri weavers seek micro cluster for power loom,"This story is from February 19, 2020

Trichy: Power loom weavers in Musiri have sought a micro cluster to help them explore export opportunities. At the same time, stakeholders promoting micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) said that a cluster for them is under consideration.

Musiri and Thottiyam taluks including Manalmedu and Thiruthiyamalai hamlets are home to 300 power looms employing nearly 1,000 people directly and indirectly. Musiri weavers, traditionally handloom weavers, switched to power loom in the last decade. In late 2013, Musiri which had only 20 power looms saw an exponential surge as it become a cottage industry.

As the weavers depend on textile firms in Salem for the raw material (thread), they produce fabrics such as dhotis and cotton sarees and supply them back to the firms. Instead of producing end products through value addition, Musiri weavers serve only as labourers. To change this dependence and guide them into exporting their products, they had put forward a demand to provide a micro-cluster for power loom.

“Power looms in Musiri keep on increasing but we lack the exposure and support to market our products. Financial support is needed to scale up our production,” said T Sankaran, power loom weaver from Musiri.

Trichy airport which has connectivity with southeast Asian countries and Sri Lanka will help them meet the international demands, weavers said. “Power loom weavers in Musiri are highly skilled but to produce a variety of products, machinery modernisation is necessary. Initially, with 20 power loom weavers, microcluster can be formed,” said N Kanagasabapathy, ex-president of Tiruchirappalli District Tiny & Small Scale Industries.

An official said that a cluster for power loom weaving was floated alongside Korai mat, gate and grill clusters last year. “Preliminary meetings to discuss a cluster for power loom were held. A final decision is yet to be taken,” the official said.

316,['19/02/2020'],Laughter is CBSE’s medicine before exams,"This story is from February 19, 2020

New Delhi: The last-minute tips they got from the Central Board of Secondary Education defused some of the tension that Class X and Class XII exams candidates were under. There was amusement as the edgy students read the ever-welcome tips they received from their board. “Pimples? Zero. Blackheads? Zero. Entry allowed after 10 am … ZERO”, said one of them, cautioning the students in an affectionate manner that they wouldn’t be permitted to enter the exams halls after the stipulated time.

Instead of what students described as the customary “boring” and “sermonising” instructions and guidelines, CBSE has been communicating since February 15 in their own language of memes and rap, sharing one creative every day. These cool advisories are the brainchild of Anita Karwal, the board chairperson, who herself attributed the inspiration to the schoolchildren. She explained that communication becomes effective and fun when done in the language the students have embraced.

There was a poetic meme on Wednesday. The ditty concerned an important aspect of the exams and read, “In exams it is compulsory to write in pens blue/ Ballpoints of any kind or gel pens will do/ Now don’t say later ‘I didn’t have a clue’”. While amused, the students were actually grateful for clarity on the point. Karwal disclosed that in a day or so, a rap song on the exams composed by a student would be released.

The memes, with hashtags such as #YouCanDoIt, #beontime, #theunstoppableyou and many others, are trending on social media. Students too have been reciprocating and engaging with the memes. From expressing their “shock” at seeing the board resorting to pop expression to humorous responses along similar lines, students have taken to the ploy. Many, of course, are also getting their queries answered directly by CBSE officials.

The meme saga started with one that showed a fist-pumping infant with the text reading, “Completed syllabus before everyone else”. This was followed by others, among them subject-related ones. For the legal studies, the meme showed a tot in lawyer’s robes saying, “Hard work pays Mee Lord — there is evidence to support this statement”. For physics, a kindly looking Albert Einstein (should have been Isaac Newton perhaps) warns, “Gravitation cannot be held responsible for you not getting up on time for study and exams”.

Buoyed by the reaction of the students, Karwal said, “We think we will continue this practice of modern communication even during non-exam days, though the frequency will be need based.”

It all started with a brainstorming session in which the youthful mode was identified and confirmed. CBSE sources said that an ad agency was approached, though the in-house effort was guided by Karwal herself creating some memes. The CBSE chairperson said, “The credit goes to the students for making us learn their language and style of communication. The students are also creating the memes for us.”

TIRUPATI: The third phase of the Dr YSR Kanti Velugu programme was launched by chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy at STBC college ground in Kurnool on Tuesday. The third phase of the scheme would provide free of cost eye care to about 57 lakh elderly people above the age of 60 years.

The chief minister also laid the foundation stone of a health sub-centre under the state government’s flagship Nadu-Nedu programme, which aims to revamp government hospitals and primary health centres across the state to meet national standards.

Addressing the public gathering, Jagan said his government is committed to render the best of medical care to all sections of people in the society. “The state, as of now, has only 11 teaching hospitals. The government plans to add 16 more teaching hospitals across the state to ensure that doctors and medical staff are available at all times across all regions of the state. Under the Nadu-Nedu programme, the government will spend Rs 15,337 crore to renovate and upgrade existing hospitals besides setting up new ones across the state to ensure world-class medical facilities are available to the poorest of the poor,” he said.

As part of the first phase of the programme, the government has allocated Rs 1,129 crore for new health and wellness centres. In total, 1,086 sub-centres in government buildings have been upgraded under the National Health Mission by district collectors. “This is a prestigious initiative of the state government to set up a total of 4,906 sub-centres at a cost of Rs 23 lakh each,” Jagan underlined.

As many as 56,88,420 people above the age of 60 years will benefit from the third phase of Kanti Velugu programme, the CM said. “Free eye-screening tests will be conducted at all village secretariats. Surgeries for shortlisted patients would be performed at the existing 11 teaching hospitals across the state from March 1. The government has allocated Rs 560 crore towards the programme,” he stated.

The Kanti Velugu programme was launched by the state government last year to provide free eye care to all people of the state in six phases within a span of two-and-a-half years.

Taking a jibe at his predecessor and TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu without naming him, Jagan said while there is cure for around 2,000 diseases covered under the Arogya Sri programme, there is no medicine to cure jealousy anywhere in the world.

“There is remedy for eye ailments under the Kanti Velugu programme, but there is no cure for an evil eye. Similarly, many ailments can be cured by right treatment and medicines, but no medicine has been discovered yet to treat and cure an envious mind,” the chief minister said.

The government plans to add 16 more teaching hospitals across the state to ensure that doctors and medical staff are available at all times across all regions of the state. Under the Nadu-Nedu programme, the government will spend Rs 15,337 crore to renovate and upgrade existing hospitals besides setting up new ones across the state to ensure world-class medical facilities are available to the poorest of the poor,” he said.

As part of the first phase of the programme, the government has allocated Rs 1,129 crore for new health and wellness centres. In total, 1,086 sub-centres in government buildings have been upgraded under the National Health Mission by district collectors. “This is a prestigious initiative of the state government to set up a total of 4,906 sub-centres at a cost of Rs 23 lakh each,” Jagan underlined.

As many as 56,88,420 people above the age of 60 years will benefit from the third phase of Kanti Velugu programme, the CM said. “Free eye-screening tests will be conducted at all village secretariats. Surgeries for shortlisted patients would be performed at the existing 11 teaching hospitals across the state from March 1. The government has allocated Rs 560 crore towards the programme,” he stated.

The Kanti Velugu programme was launched by the state government last year to provide free eye care to all people of the state in six phases within a span of two-and-a-half years.

Taking a jibe at his predecessor and TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu without naming him, Jagan said while there is cure for around 2,000 diseases covered under the Arogya Sri programme, there is no medicine to cure jealousy anywhere in the world.

“There is remedy for eye ailments under the Kanti Velugu programme, but there is no cure for an evil eye. Similarly, many ailments can be cured by right treatment and medicines, but no medicine has been discovered yet to treat and cure an envious mind,” the chief minister said.

Hyderabad: Swiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis is setting up its first digital innovation hub in Asia, Novartis Biome India, at Hyderabad as part of efforts to boost the connection and interaction between Novartis and its partners from across the digital ecosystem, starting from startups to academia to the biggest players in the healthcare industry, its global CEO Vas Narasimhan said at the BioAsia 2020 here.

Novartis is also making Hyderabad a centre for its Novartis Business Services (NBX) group, Vas said while pointing out that India is the third largest location for Novartis globally with a headcount of around 8,000 and Hyderabad accounts for three fourths of this with a 6,000 associates.

Novartis Biome India, which is the fourth to be set up across the world after San Francisco, Paris and London, will act as a bridge to the external ecosystem, enabling Novartis teams to better discover, develop and drive collaborations that transform innovative initiatives into impactful and scalable solutions for patients, said Vas, who was also awarded the Genome Valley Excellence Award at BioAsia 2020, explained

By joining this global network, Novartis Biome India will be able to tap into the assets and expertise of the broader Novartis portfolio to have even greater impact, including access to anonymized data, customized residency programs and personalised mentoring.

“India has a rich and vibrant technology community. Together, we have a fantastic opportunity to combine our scientific know-how with the expertise of tech players, big and small, to create digital solutions for patients, at scale,” Bertrand Bodson, Chief Digital Officer, Novartis said in a statement.

“We are proud to have the first Novartis Biome in Asia being launched in India. It is testimony to our technology ecosystem.

320,['19/02/2020'],Price control here to stay: Goyal,"This story is from February 19, 2020

Hyderabad: Despite repeated pleas by the pharma and biotech industry to re-think the price control regime of as well as extend the weighted deduction on R&D expenses beyond March 31, 2020, Union minister for commerce and industry Piyush Goyal said that the price control regime on drugs and medical devices will continue as it benefits a higher number of citizens and the tax respite for encouraging R&D was given for a stipulated period of time and it is high time for industry to get over it and move on.

Goyal, however, added that the government is willing to work with the industry to enable a conducive ecosystem for it to thrive by focussing on larger issues like easing regulatory hurdles and building talent, among others. “Price control has worked hugely in India to the extent that when we look at the two of the medical devices – knee implants and heart stents – the volume of operations that have taken place in India have grown drastically. And very clearly a country with $2,000 per capita income, there are millions of people who would love to get themselves treated but were not able to afford it earlier,” Goyal said while addressing top industry executives at BioAsia 2020 during the CEO panel discussion.

On tax breaks, the minister added that the industry must not stay hung-up on this issue as tax breaks cannot be the only incentive for industry to innovate and expand their presence in India. He also added that the government is looking into the issue of easing regulations for clinical trials as well as strengthening the intellectual property framework in the country.

Underlining the importance of innovation in drugs, Sun Pharma founder and MD Dilip Shanghvi said Indian players have so far been important players in the generic business, which in value terms is much smaller in the global arena and it is time to step up the innovation quotient to move up the value chain. Similarly, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories (DRL) chairman Satish Reddy also said India has the capability to develop drugs for global markets but that needs sustained investment and support from various stakeholders, including the government.

Piramal Group chairman Ajay Piramal pointed out that an ecosystem must be created wherein Indian companies at least start with innovating for other larger companies as well as. “While we talk about R&D, in India what we do is ‘D’ (development) but to do research we need to create the ecosystem such as creating a critical mass of qualified people and partner with universities as we are good at Chemistry but not at Biology” he added.

The residents pooled in money and conducted a special homa at Keregalapalya bus stand on a priest’s suggestion

BENGALURU: Marathon homas and pujas are usually performed by politicians to ensure victory in their endeavours. But residents of a nondescript village in Tumakuru district, Keregalapalya, did a 48-hour homa for a different reason — to prevent road accidents .

Residents of the village, which is located along the Pavagada-Malavalli road built under the Karnataka State Highways Improvement Project (KSHIP) four years ago, said the rituals were conducted to ward off evil spirits on the road. “The 1-km stretch near Keregalapalya has witnessed 50 accidents in the past one year and the death toll has touched 35. All accidents have taken place between Hunsemarahatti and Hariharappa villages. We sought divine intervention to prevent more deaths,” they said.

The villagers contacted the local temple priest, who suggested a special puja be done to pacify the gods. The residents pooled in money and a special homa was conducted at Keregalapalya bus stand, a spot they claimed had witnessed 11 accidents in a month. Jayachandra, a resident said: “The number of accidents was going up, triggering panic.” Another villager, Siddalingamurthy, said: “We were worried. This is not a difficult stretch to navigate, yet accidents used to happen. With so many people having died, residents stopped travelling at night due to fear.”

Not just Keregalapalya, residents of neighbouring villages also participated in the homa. The villagers took out a procession on the state highway and sprinkled ‘holy’ water in the areas where accidents had occurred.

Speeding, drunk driving to blame: Police

Police attributed the accidents to speeding and driving under the influence of alcohol. Tumakuru superintendent of police Kona Vamsi Krishna said the stretch witnessed 11 accidents, and speed-breakers were installed recently. “Analysis of the accidents showed the rider/driver’s negligence was the prime cause. In many cases, the accidents were caused by speeding, drunk driving and negligent driving. Though highway patrolling has started, we have asked for an interceptor for the highway. We will consider it a black spot,” the SP told TOI. According to police, Tumakuru district had listed 88 black spots (accident-prone zones) last year.

BENGALURU: Eighty per cent of Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) commuters who took part in a survey said bus fares are high, while 41% of non-bus users said they will shift to the service if the rates are reduced.

The survey, whose findings were released on Tuesday, was conducted by Bengaluru Bus Prayanikara Vedike, an NGO, among the city’s working-class population, including street vendors, domestic workers, pourakarmikas, garment factory workers, security staff and construction labourers. Key issues highlighted by the respondents include high fares (60%), lack of convenient routes (17%), service frequency (16%) and traffic (7%).

It was revealed that bus passengers spend more on their commute. “Bus users spend 21% of their earnings on commute as compared to 9.5% spent by those who use other modes of travel,” the survey said, adding: “While 15% is spent on main commute, a significant 6% goes towards the first and last leg of the journey via other modes like autos.”

It stated: “Around 28.6% of non-bus commuters cited distance from the bus stop as one reason for not using buses ...This means first- and last-mile connectivity is a key problem.”

Bus commuters say they rely on BMTC due to lack of other options. “Seventy-two per cent of the respondents use the service because other options are more expensive or unavailable, while 17.5% say it’s convenient. Other reasons include affordability and safety (5.8%), and suitability for long-distance travel (3.8%),” the survey revealed. “Apart from more buses, effective scheduling based on demand is also required to ensure adequate frequency of services in all areas. This may also have a link to route rationalisation,” it said.

The survey suggested bus priority lanes on other corridors: “The bus lane pilot on Outer Ring Road showed it can help buses and commuters escape traffic, apart from reducing travel time. If extended to all high-density corridors, it can be a solution,” said a statement from BBPV.

Prashant Kishor

PATNA: Expelled JD(U) leader Prashant Kishor questioned CM Nitish Kumar ’s development model and his alliance with those who “support the ideology"" of Mahatma Gandhi’s killer Nathuram Godse at a press conference here on Tuesday.

While announcing his plans to launch a state-wide campaign ‘Baat Bihar Ki’, Kishor chose not to directly attack Nitish, describing him as a “fatherly figure” and even invited him to lead a new “youth-based political forum” in Bihar. The poll strategist revealed that his campaign will be launched on February 20.

“I am neither with any political party nor working for any alliance for the upcoming election in Bihar. I am pursuing my own agenda of getting 1 crore youth of Bihar on a common platform…If Nitish Kumar wants to lead it, he is welcome… if Sushil Kumar Modi wants to lead then also I have no objection,” Kishor told media persons at the office of his political advocacy group I- PAC.

Exhorting Nitish to join his initiative, Kishor added, “Please come forward…I am not ready to believe that people of Bihar won’t support a person like you (Nitish) if you put forth a blueprint for the development of the state in the next 10 years.”

Kishor remarked that he had more respect for the Bihar CM in 2014, the present day Nitish has been reduced to a mere ‘pichchlagu’ (sidekick) of BJP. “I have more respect for Nitish Kumar of 2014, who lost the elections, but he was still the pride of Bihar. But today he has 16MPs and some leader from Gujarat (an allusion to Amit Shah) tells him you will remain the leader. A leader of 10 crore people does not need approval from any other party,” Kishor said.

On his differences with Nitish, Kishor said, “The foremost issue of contention is we cannot take Gandhi and Godse together…As far as I have known Nitish Ji he has always asserted that we cannot leave thoughts and ideologies of Gandhi, JP and Lohia. But doubts come in my mind when you (Nitish) stand with people supporting the ideology of Godse.”

On being asked why he did not raise such issues when he was with JD (U), Kishor claimed that he raised such issues a number of times with Nitish. “I and Nitish Ji had discussions and unfortunately I could not convince him, so I am out today,” he said.

Referring to Nitish’s claim that Kishor was inducted in JD (U) on the advice of Shah, Kishor said: “I always considered Nitish Ji as a father-figure and he also looked after me as a son, but if he has to lie at the age of 70, then I have nothing to say.”

On his Bihar Ki Baat campaign, Kishor said, “I want to rope in youths, who want to see Bihar among top 10 states in the country...It is in that direction ‘Baat Bihar Ki’ has been launched, enrolment of volunteers for the project is already underway and more than two lakh young people have signed up. We intend to enroll up to 10 lakh youths in the next 100 days. This is an aspirational and not an attempt to build a new party.”

HYDERABAD: As many as 56 IT firm employees from Telangana and Andhra Pradesh returned home on Tuesday from China’s Wuhan, the epicentre of the Coronavirus (Covid-19). The employees were working as trainees with a Chinese company for the past six months.

Upon their return to India, the employees had been put under a 14-day quarantine at the Army camp in Manesar.

They cheeked our temperatures daily and tested us the virus twice. We were tested two days ago,” one of the returnees told TOI.

The Chinese company had asked the employees to work from home till the epidemic was under control. They will be returning once the situation improves in China. The employees have received their salaries from the company while they were away. Another two employees, who had been ill and stayed in Wuhan as a result, will be returning during the third evacuation drive by the Indian government.

Trichy: Pilgrims of Arulmigu Kamalavalli Nachiyar temple in Woraiyur are still being charged for parking at the behest of the management, despite the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR&CE) having issued an order prohibiting the same. The fee collectors target vehicles that come from other districts and often harass the devotees who refuse to pay the parking fee.

A sub-temple of Arulmigu Ranganathaswamy temple in Srirangam, also one of the 108 Divya Desam temples, Kamalavalli Nachiyar temple dating back to the Chola era is one of the oldest temples in the city. The temple neither has a covered parking lot for cars nor amenities like drinking water and toilets for drivers at the parking site. Tokens are issued and Rs 20 is charged for cars. As the issue was taken to the notice of HR&CE in October 2019, HR&CE requested devotees not to pay the parking fee if asked to.

Since February 14, 2020, as Thirumozhi and Thiruvaimozhi events involving the recital of pasurams (holy verses) began at the temple, a significant number of devotees have been thronging the Woraiyur temple in the evening. However, people identifying themselves as temple staff have been charging vehicles parked on the streets near the temple.

“As we confronted the people who asked us to pay the parking fee, they vacated the spot. Those who did not oppose might have certainly paid the fee,” a devotee from Cantonment said. It is alleged that the parking fee is charged targeting devotees arriving in cars from other districts.

When contacted, HR&CE asserted that parking near Woraiyur temple is free. “Will inquire about the incident to take disciplinary action. Temple officials will be strictly insisted not to collect parking fee from the devotees,” a senior HR&CE official told TOI.

Trichy: Highlighting concerns of the farming community over the draft of the Seed Bill, 2019, which prevents farmers from producing seeds and threaten seed sovereignty of the agriculture community apart from attempts to impose industrial seed from MNCs through a UPOV (International Union for the Protection of Plant Varieties) like structure, Bharatiya Kisan Sangam has raised apprehensions that the the bill may not protect farmers’ right to save and exchange seeds freely among the farming community and also increase input costs.

At a meeting convened to discuss the ways and means to increase farmer's income, functionaries of Bharatiya Kisan Sangam said that farmers are the first breeders responsible for the rich biodiversity in crops and fruits. The Seed Bill, which was introduced in 2004 for compulsory registration and certification of seeds and aimed at repealing the Seed Act, 1966, seeks to prevent spurious seeds being sold in the market. “Farmers have conserved century-old seed varieties and also have the right to save and exchange time tested seeds freely among farmers as in self-governed living seed economies and living seed democracies. However, the new bill threatens our seed sovereignty and seed freedom. It also undermines farmers’ rights. It attempts to handover to the system to global companies. This initiative may increase the farmer's burden and aggravating the agrarian crisis,” said N Veerasekaran, state spokesperson of Bharatiya Kisan Sangam.

“Farmers used to spent 3% to 5% for seeds out of the total cultivation cost. Now it has gone up to around 20%. Once the bill would be amended there is a danger it would touch 50%, as pricing for seeds would not be with farmers,” he said.

Various resolutions that were adopted at the meeting would be submitted to their headquarters and would be forwarded to the union government, functionaries said. State deputy president of Kisan Sangam M N Vaidhyanathan led the meeting. State executive committee member Ganesan welcomed the gathering. TNN

We need to be more proactive and use this crisis to bring back some of the manufacturing and intermediates to India.”However, a cautious Dilip Shanghvi, founder and MD of Sun Pharma, pointed out that Indian pharma may not be able to cash in on the opportunity in the near term as it takes at least two to three years to build capacities for manufacturing APIs at scale.Expressing concern over the spread of the outbreak of Corona virus and the fact that a chunk of global APIs and intermediates today are manufactured in China, Piramal Group chairman Ajay Piramal said industry is still awaiting clarity as every day there seems to be a new development.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74206302,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-524993,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pharma-biggies-see-opportunity-in-covid-19/articleshow/74199172.cms

HYDERABAD: As many as 56 IT firm employees from Telangana and Andhra Pradesh returned home on Tuesday from China’s Wuhan, the epicentre of the Coronavirus (Covid-19). The employees were working as trainees with a Chinese company for the past six months.

Upon their return to India, the employees had been put under a 14-day quarantine at the Army camp in Manesar. None of them were detected with the virus and were presented a certificate by the Union home ministry as attestation for the same. “We did not face any problems during our stay at the camp. They cheeked our temperatures daily and tested us the virus twice. We were tested two days ago,” one of the returnees told TOI.

The Chinese company had asked the employees to work from home till the epidemic was under control. They will be returning once the situation improves in China. The employees have received their salaries from the company while they were away. Another two employees, who had been ill and stayed in Wuhan as a result, will be returning during the third evacuation drive by the Indian government.

Bengaluru: Forget wind or storm, there is no breeze in Bengaluru, but trees are falling like dominoes in the city. Last week alone, at least two to three tree falls were reported from various localities.

Tree conservationists, however, aren’t baffled by this phenomenon, ironically happening in a season when only leaves should fall.

Tree expert Vijay Nishanth attributes unseasonal tree falls to three reasons: concretisation, unscientific pruning and aged trees.

""Indiscriminate asphalting and concretisation of areas around the base of tree trunks leave little space for them to grow and tie up their roots. Unscientific pruning results in trees transferring their weight on to one side and over the years, they start to bend. BBMP is supposed to conduct a census to identify dead and decaying trees so that they can be cut. But they are yet to do it,"" explained Nishanth.

A horticulture department official also confirmed that the Palike concretises areas around the base of tree trunks as part of infrastructure work, preventing them from getting nutrients.

""The tree canopy has to be of the same size as the spread of the roots. But, these days, the roots are spread over a small area and they cannot bear the weight of the huge canopies, causing them to uproot,"" he added.

According to the official, many trees in the city are over 60 years old. ""They are developing new diseases like apple scab, Dothistroma needle blight, lethal yellowing, and powdery mildew, which would earlier be found only in foreign trees,"" he said.

Around 5.30am on Tuesday, a 50-foot-tall rain tree was uprooted in Vidyapeeta, south Bengaluru. It landed on the compound wall of an adjacent residence. Locals

said they had earlier complained to the civic body about the tree leaning to a side and the possibility of a collapse.

""We had informed Vidyapeeta councillor Shamala Saikumar about this and she, in turn, told forest officials, who chose to ignore the issue,"" said Ramesh SK, a resident of Vidyapeeta.

Nine days earlier, a 50-year-old banyan tree fell in Chamarajpet, leaving four cars completely damaged.

A senior BBMP official said lack of forest officials is making it difficult for them to conduct a tree census. ""We need people to conduct the census. When there is staff shortage in the crucial engineering cell itself, how can we expect things to be better in the forest cell,"" he said.

Corporators, activists trade charges

BMP councillors, however, blamed residents and environment activists for not permitting felling of old trees. ""Bengaluru south zone alone has more than 1,000 trees, which are really old and need to be cut as they pose threat to everyone in the vicinity. But when forest officials come to chop the trees, residents make a noise and file complaints. We are helpless,"" a councillor

from Basavanagudi assembly constituency said.

Residents, meanwhile, say BBMP isn’t above board either. ""There are many NGOs collaborating with it and they plant saplings according

to their whims and fancies, but don’t maintain them. Some of these trees are getting uprooted though they aren’t even three years old,"" Kathyayini N, a resident of Jayanagar and environment activist, said.

335,['19/02/2020'],CAR-T brings cure for cancer a step closer,"This story is from February 19, 2020

Hyderabad: The cure for cancer may finally be in sight with CAR-T cell therapy showing positive results in treating liquid cancers like leukaemia, lymphoma and myeloma in countries like US, Europe and China, CAR-T cell therapy pioneer Dr Carl H June said. The American immunologist and oncologist of the University of Pennsylvania said he is now hopeful of using this therapy for treating solid cancers such as breast, ovarian and lung cancer, among others. He, however, rued the lack of any such trials in India due to paucity of funds.

“Currently there are nearly 600 trials underway globally and these are happening in China and US. There are none in India. Nearly, $30 billion is being pumped into these trials in US and $50 billion in China thanks to good venture capital funding in this field,” June said and added that in the US and Europe, there are CAR-T cells that have got commercial approvals for lymphoma and leukemia. This year in the US, approval is expected for myeloma.

“About 10% of cancer are blood cancer…all of those are being cured eventually with engineered T- cell therapy right now. It looks very likely that leukemia that we are treating … many got cured and the goal is to move it frontline so patients do not even have to get chemotherapy,” June said.

The oncologist, however, said for solid cancers like breast, ovarian and lung cancer, Crisper Gene Editing is needed to make the T-cells resistant to the tumour micro environment. “One idea now is that instead of having Cars (CAR-T cells) you can make truck cells that are either bigger or armoured to protect the CAR-T cells. There is a lot of ideas on that and innovation in US and China to develop CART-T cells for solid cancers and I am optimistic that it will work,” he said.

“The cement bin is 17 years old and we will demolish it with machinery to prevent waste dumping at the site. Door-to-door waste collection will also be ensured in the vicinity,” a corporation official said. Officials have also planned to fence the spot where dumping of waste is practised to ensure a hygiene near the anganwadi.

Owing to unhygienic conditions, the anganwadi’s strength had declined to 60 from 100 last year.

PATNA: Unidentified miscreants broke open the locks of the residence of a 2010-batch IPS officer Meenu Kumari in Purnia district and took away cash and jewellery worth lakhs of rupees on Monday afternoon. Meenu is at present posted as SP of neighbouring Khagaria district .

On being informed by the caretaker Santosh Kumar Jha, Meenu rushed to her ‘sasural’ (in-laws house) near Dollar House Chowk on busy Chuna Road and inquired about the incident. The articles were scattered all around in the room and the almirah was open.

Meenu called on Purnia SP Vishal Sharma and asked the SHO of Madhubani police outpost to ascertain the identity of the thieves and recover the stolen valuables. “The value of jewellery and other valuables taken away by the miscreants in the incident is yet to be ascertained,” she told reporters in Purnia.

She said that her in-laws were away from the house for the last three months and Santosh Kumar Jha was assigned to take care of the belongings in their absence. “He called me on my phone on Monday noon and informed about the theft in the house. I rushed to the spot in the evening,” the 2010 batch IPS officer said.

Santosh told police that the incident took place around 3 pm when he had gone to have refreshment and a cup of tea at Dollar House Chowk. When he returned after half-an-hour, he found the locks of the house broken from behind and the doors open. “When I entered the room, clothes and other valuables were scattered on the bed and the floor,” an investigating officer quoted the caretaker as saying.

The Purnia SP said that sniffer dog was pressed into service to get some clues about the theft but to no avail. “A special investigation team (SIT) headed by Sadar DSP Anand Kumar Pandey has been set up to crack the case at the earliest. A complaint has been lodged with the Madhubani police outpost on the statement of the caretaker Jha,” Sharma added.

DSP Pandey said on Tuesday, “We are still clueless in the case. Raids are on to nab the criminals.”

Locals, on the other hand, alleged that the incidents of house robbery and theft have increased alarmingly in the district, especially in rural pockets, in recent past. “Even senior police officers are not being spared” said 30-year-old Vineet Kumar, a resident of Gulabbagh locality in Purnia town.

BENGALURU: Wanted in a murder case, he was on the run for 25 years. Police too had ended their hunt and closed the case file. But just when he thought he’d managed to evade the law and tried to reconnect with his relatives, he landed in police net.

The accused is 51-year-old Siddamallaiah alias Siddaraju of Karakalaghatta in Tumakuru district. He was wanted in connection with the murder of Eeramallamma, who was smothered to death in an agricultural field on December 1, 1994. Eeramallamma’s brother-in-law had lodged a police complaint the same day, accusing Siddaraju of having killed her after she spurned his advances. While police launched a manhunt for him, the accused remained untraced.

In 1997, Koratagere police closed the case, stating Siddaraju was elusive. Tumakuru superintendent of police Kona Vamsi Kirshna said they decided to reopen the case when informants alerted them that Siddaraju had returned and was working as a daily-wage labourer near Nelamangala, around 30km from Koratagere.

“All we knew was that Siddaraju had some relatives in Karakalaghatta and had visited them recently. We began to observe their movements and studied their mobile call records. We found they had been receiving calls from a new number, which belonged to fugitive Siddaraju,” Krishna said. Investigators got to know that Siddaraju, though a daily-wage worker, was fond of smartphones and had even taught a few relatives how to make WhatsApp video calls.

The next big challenge for police was to track his location without making him suspicious. Krishna said: “Pretending to be a relative, one of our staffers spoke to Siddaraju over the phone and collected information.” Subsequently, he was picked up.

BENGALURU: A jeep that hit a scooter and mowed down a woman and seriously injured her brother in Kunigal, Tumakuru district, on February 9 belonged to the department of legal metrology, Ali Askar Road, Bengaluru, and was allotted to assistant controller M Mamata.

The accident took place near the bus stand in Bhaktarahalli on Kunigal-Tumakuru road around 4pm. The Bolero jeep — KA 04-G-1517 — was coming from the Tumakuru direction and rammed the Honda Dio –KA 41-X-1908. The impact was such that the pillion rider, K Jayamma, 60, was hurtled on to the road, while her brother who was riding the vehicle, K Siddegowda, 55, also fell.

Jayamma was declared brought dead by doctors at Kunigal government hospital, while Siddegowda is recovering, police said. The siblings were residents of Bhaktarahalli. Soon after the accident, the driver and other occupants of the jeep sped away, eyewitnesses told police.

Kunigal police said they have issued a notice to the director, department of legal metrology, seeking details of the driver and occupants of the jeep. “They have given us the name of the accused driver and we have summoned him for questioning,” police said. No arrest has been made.

Director of the department, V Patharaju, said he has issued a showcause notice to Mamata, seeking her explanation about the incident and how the jeep had reached Kunigal when its jurisdiction is limited to Bengaluru. “The notice was issued on February 12 and I sought a reply in three days. However, I’m yet to get a response. We will cooperate with the police investigation,” he said.

According to police sources, the occupants of the jeep were headed to a place near Bhaktarahalli when the accident happened. “They were to take part in a beegara oota (non-vegetarian feast for in-laws). There were around five people — driver, a woman and her family — in the vehicle,” they said.

Mamata didn’t respond to calls and messages to her mobile and office landline.

Coimbatore: City corporation commissioner J Sravan Kumar has directed French firm Suez India Pvt Ltd to speed up the implementation of 24x7 water supply project at RS Puram and set a deadline of March to complete the work.

A source with the city corporation said, “Once the work is completed, we will supply water round the clock for a few days to assess the quality of work. During the trial period, important components of the project, including water pressure, will be checked.”

The firm had started implementing the project at RS Puram on a pilot basis in January 2019. The work involves replacement of both the main feeder and distribution pipelines that are in bad shape.

“The existing water distribution system has cast iron, PVC and asbestos pipelines. As part of the project, the existing pipelines would be replaced with ductile iron pipelines of various diameters ranging from 75mm to 500mm,” the source said.

The source said they had proposed to replace the pipelines for about 60km and that 75% work was already completed. “We are speeding up the work to meet the deadline.”

Pointing out that the firm would also replace the 15mm galvanised iron pipelines that are used for household service connections with 20mm HDPE pipelines, the source said they had already replaced around 4,000 of the 5,600 household connections.

While the region is categorized into two district metered areas – north and south zone – the control room work may not be completed soon. “Until then, water consumption by each consumer will be assessed manually.”

The source attributed the delay in completing the project to the delay in obtaining no-objection certificate (NOC) to execute the project on highway roads. “While we had managed to obtain NOC from state highways to dig up Thadagam Road, Marudhamalai Road and Cowley Brown Road, the firm is yet to obtain NOC from national highways wing of state highways to carry out work on Mettupalayam road.” The pilot project was expected to be completed before September 2019.

Sotheby’s claim the painting is part of a private collection of Fritz Schleicher, a German printer who worked ... Read More

VADODARA: ‘ Swami Vishwamitra in Meditation ’ — a title that itself raises curiosity given the fact that the subject of the painting is legendary for his raging temper.

But one of the greatest artists of 20th century, Raja Ravi Varma, visualised the tempestuous rishi in a rare calm composure when he is meditating with prayer beads in his hand.

The 1897 signed painting, is now at Sotheby’s, where the world’s top auction house will auction the untitled painting after 27 days. Sotheby’s has put an estimated price of $7-9 lakh on it.

Vadodara shares a close bond with the sage since its inception. Vishwamitri River that flows through the heart of the city was said to be blessed by Vishwamitra who is believed to have authored the Gayatri Mantra sitting on the banks of this river.

According to Skanda Purana, Vishwamitra had his ashram in Shankar forest now known as Pavagadh – a popular tourist spot 50km from the city — from where Vishwamitri River originates.

Sotheby’s claim that the painting is part of a private collection of Fritz Schleicher, a German printer who had worked with Varma. Describing Varma’s art works, Sotheby’s says that after producing a large number of oil paintings, Varma founded India’s first oleography press in Lonavala (now in Maharashtra) in 1894.

“To help reproduce his paintings, Varma employed Fritz Schleicher, a German printer from Berlin, highly qualified in colour lithographic printing. He was employed as the manager of the workshop. Varma eventually sold the press to Schleicher in 1903, at a stage when the firm was renamed ‘The Ravi Varma Fine Art Lithographic Works’,” Sotheby’s website states.

“Schleicher had 12 children, the youngest, a daughter named Lottie, who had started her education in Berlin, but moved to a private school in Vienna with the rise of Nazism. In 1941, when Austria was in the throes of World War II, she had to move to India with her fiancé, Dr Surendra Singh. Ms Lottie Schleicher Singh inherited a group of works from her father from where this exceptional painting hails,” it adds.

The painting was later acquired by a private collector in Denmark.

Varma was patronized by Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III in 19th century and the painter even had a studio near Laxmi Vilas Palace. Varma’s paintings still adorn the walls of this magnificent palace.

Prateek Khandelwal at the Press Club in city

JAIPUR: Living life on a wheelchair propelled 33-year-old Prateek Khandelwal to take an initiative to make public buildings disabled-friendly. Prateek, who is an entrepreneur, had injured his spinal cord in 2014 in an accident.

Before 2014, Khandelwal was leading a normal life. But, when he accidentally fell from an under-construction building injuring his spinal cord badly, his life changed completely.

The accident not only left him with a paraplegia but also with a health condition that was only meant to deteriorate in the face of a damaged nervous system and no proven medical solutions to heal it.

Now, Khandelwal has made it a mission to ease the life of people who are also wheelchair-bound like him. “I took the initiate in Bangalore 18 months ago. Now, 30 restaurants have constructed ramps after we took up the issue with them for helping people on wheelchair lead their life with freedom,” he said.

Khandelwal was recently in the city to replicate the initiative in Jaipur along with other prominent cities of the country. “There are laws for making government buildings disabled friendly. How many buildings do we have which are disabled friendly. There is a big chuck of physically challenged population whose lives are confined to their houses since places such as restaurants and other buildings are not disabled friendly,” he said.

While working towards the mission, Prateek had to deal not only with enormous physical challenge but also social isolation. But he decided to fight.

Today, he is taking measures to facilitate infrastructural changes for wheelchair users where he not only provides ramping solutions to local eateries, sports academies and other public utilities, but also trains employees and staff of the organizations to change their thought processes towards people facing a physical challenge.

348,['19/02/2020'],Congress demands judicial probe into Mangaluru police firing,"This story is from February 19, 2020

A file picture of police retaliating to protests in Mangaluru in December last year

BENGALURU: Congress has demanded a judicial inquiry by a sitting high court judge into the Mangaluru police firing incident in December last year, that claimed the lives of two people during protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). The demand was made during a debate on the controversial law in the legislative council on Tuesday.

The debate began with an adjournment motion moved by opposition leader SR Patil on law and order issues across the state, including sedition charges filed against several citizens. Chairman Prathap Chandra Shetty reserved ruling on the motion.

However, seizing the opportunity to debate the same issues under the motion of thanks to governor Vajubhai R Vala’s address, Congress raised the firing incident and the filing of sedition charges against CAA protesters.

Patil said the Mangaluru firing incident had left a lot of unanswered questions as police and protesters attributed different reasons for the firing. Quoting the police rule book, Patil said “irresponsible and arrogant” police officers appear to have adhered to their “political masters” and opened fire without warning.

“Police say protesters intended to burn down a police station which led to the extreme measure,” said Patil. “However, during the incident, no warning shots were fired, nor were any attempts made to shoot at the legs of the alleged protesters. Police fired directly into the crowd and killed two innocent people.”

Patil’s claims were backed by MLCs like Ivan D’Souza, who alleged the government did not even have the “common courtesy” to visit homes of the victims and express their condolences. “Forget justice, the district in-charge minister and council house leader Kota Shrinivas Poojari did not even bother to visit the homes of the victims,” D’Souza said.

That comment appeared to rile members of the ruling party. MLC N Ravi Kumar reacted sharply saying the government is not obliged to visit homes of “terrorists”. That set off pandemonium with members of Congress and JD(S) jumping into the well, demanding an apology from the member.

The tense situation led chairman Shetty to adjourn proceedings for 30 minutes. When the house reconvened, Kumar withdrew his statement and tendered an apology.

“There was no intent to hurt the sentiments of members” Kumar said. “I used the word terrorists in a general sense to speak of those who indulged in violence during the CAA protests .”

Madras high court

CHENNAI: While ripples created by the TNPSC recruitment scam are yet to settle down in the state, 15 people have moved the Madras high court alleging a similar scam in recruitment to more than 8,000 posts in the Tamil Nadu fire and rescue services department conducted by Tamil Nadu Uniformed Services Recruitment Board ( TNUSRB ).

“About 1,019 candidates have been selected from Vellore district and another 763 were chosen from exam centres in Villupuram. All these candidates were declared to have secured more than 72 marks in the exam. Most of those selected from Vellore are from Sigaram Tuition Centre,” said petitioners R Anbarasan and 14 others.

The issue pertains to recruitment conducted pursuant to notification issued by TNUSRB in 2019 for the posts of grade-II constables, firemen and jail wardens. Besides irregularities in the selection process, 20% reservation for people who studied in Tamil medium has not been provided in the recruitment, the petitioners said. “The notification was issued for 8,888 vacant posts. On August 25, 2019, written exam was conducted across the state. All of us were successful in the written exam. However, we were not informed about the marks we scored. In November 2019, physical examination and endurance tests were held. We were successful in the physical examination as well. At this stage too, our marks were not revealed,” they said. For the post of constable, there is no viva voce and results are directly published. “On February 4, the board published the provisional selection list in which our names do not appear. In the list, we found that most of the candidates had secured 69 marks and the highest seems to be 88 by a candidate for the post of fireman. We were shocked to find that cut-off mark was not published for any category,” they added. The petitioners wanted the court to call for the records of the provisional list and quash the same besides ordering a CBI probe into the alleged irregularities. As an interim relief, the 15 petitioners requested the court to direct the board to produce their OMR answer sheets. The plea filed on Monday is likely to be taken up for hearing later this week.

RUDRAPUR: A kanwariya was killed after a bus ran over him on National Highway 74 near Misserwala village under Kashipur police jurisdiction area in Udham Singh Nagar district on Tuesday evening. The accident triggered a protest by fellow pilgrims who went on a rampage and damaged several vehicles and jammed the national highway. The deceased, in his twenties, has not been identified as yet. However, his fellow pilgrims claim that he was a resident of Khera colony in Rudrapur.

Agitated kanwariyas blocked the highway and damaged several vehicles while also raising slogans against the police. They demanded compensation for the bereaved family and government job for one member of his family.

Sub-divisional magistrate SS Tomar and additional superintendent of police (ASP) Rajesh Bhatt reached the spot with a large number of police personnel and tried to pacify the furious pilgrims. The officials managed to send the body for postmortem. ASP Bhatt told TOI that the vehicle, which was an Uttarakhand transport corporation bus, has been impounded and the errant driver has been arrested. ""The deceased's kin have reached Kashipur and they will be handed over the body after autopsy,” Bhatt added.

However, when asked about the deceased's identity, Bhatt ducked the question saying that the victim’s fellow pilgrims are claiming that his family is coming.

Vadodara: The ‘chillar’ (coins) that passes from one hand to another can also cause allergy and skin diseases. A study carried out by the students of M S University’s Department of Environmental Studies on Indian and foreign has revealed the presence of certain fungi on coins.

The study titled ‘Fungal flora associated with Indian and foreign coins and their potential health risks’ has been published in ACTA scientific microbiology, an internationally peer-reviewed journal that covers significant advancements in the field of microbiology.

“Our students had studied 100 coins. Except three, all other coins had the presence of microorganisms. There were 12 types of fungi that were present on the coins,” said professor Arun Arya.

The coins on which the experiments were carried out were made of metals like iron, chromium, silver, copper, nickel and zinc.

“The experiments have shown that two fungi – aspergillus niger and penicillium simplicissimum were prominently present on the surface of the coins. Presence of other fungi – fusarium, Rhizopus and Alternaria spp was also found on the coins,” said Arya.

Fungi like aspergillus niger can produce organic acids like citric acid that can dissolve the metal or the shinning affect of even a new coin.

Fungi aspergillus niger can also cause allergy related to skin, can result in sneezing, tears from eyes or rashes on body.

“If a person has a weak immune system or is a severe patient suffering from ailments like cancer, TB or has undergone organ transplant when the body’s immune system is weak, these fungi settle in lung and multiply. This results in depletion of lung capacity,” said Arya.

It has been established that bacterias like E. coli and salmonella enteritidis can survive up to 11 to 9 days, respectively on the surfaces of coins, making it possible for the coins to transfer bacteria to human hands.

The students who worked on the project include Drishti Navlani, Aditi Maheshwari, Vidhatri Thakkar, Roheel Taunk and Naitik Chaudhary.

Firemen and personnel from National Disaster Response Force searched for the body on Tuesday too but could not get any leads about Vaibhav Valand and Gopal Parmar.

Police have, however, registered an offence of rash driving and causing death due to negligence against Valand. Interestingly, cops have made Valand’s elder brother Amit a complainant in the case.

On being asked how the duo was presumed dead, police said that the third rider who was rescued had seen them drowning. “The 16-year-old boy Laxman Parmar had seen the duo drowning in the strong currents of water so we have registered the case accordingly,” said senior sub-inspector P J Kharsan of Vadodara Taluka police station. Normally, police do not register a case until the body is found. Cops wait for the evidence in the form of mortal remains for the death of person to register either an accidental death case or any other body-related offence.

Valand, Gopal and Laxman had fallen in the canal on Monday early morning while on their way to Gorwa BIDC on a bike. Laxman was saved as he was rescued by a passer-by, but the two others were dragged away in the water. Fire department had fished out the bike but could not find Valand and Gopal.

The accused has been identified as V Shanthi, 40, of Kottapalayam near Thuraiyur. She was arrested on charges of running a brothel racket and subjecting a 36-year-old woman into prostitution at a house situated in the 1st street in Raja Colony. Police rescued the victim and kept her at the government protective home at Khajamalai.

Acting on a tip, a police team visited the house and confirmed the operation of a brothel racket. Police caught Shanthi and the victim.

Police inquiry with the two revealed that Shanthi took the house on rent from a woman nearly four months ago and since then has been indulging in the prostitution racket.

The landlady was also residing in another portion of the same house. Police said the landlady feigned ignorance about the prostitution taking place in the portion rented out to Shanthi.

Police registered a case against Shanthi based on a complaint from the landlady under Sections of the Immoral Traffic Prevention (ITP) Act. She was produced in court and remanded in judicial custody. In almost all brothel cases busted in the city, the house owners were not concerned about the background of their tenants.

Carcasses of peacocks in Mithdiya village of Nagaur on Tuesday

JAIPUR: Peacock deaths are continuing unabated in Rajasthan. A total of 29 peacocks have died — carcasses of 26 peacocks were found in Mithdiya village of Nagaur district , while three others died after being rescued — till Tuesday. According to officials, the birds’ death was reported after consuming suspected poisonous food grains. Out of the total carcasses, 16 were male and 13 female.

Mulkesh Salwan, a forester, said, “An FIR has been registered against unidentified people. On Monday, we recovered 26 carcasses and rescued eight birds. On Tuesday, three birds, which were rescued died.” Post-mortem of the carcasses was carried out on Monday and the viscera samples were sent to Jaipur on Tuesday for examination to find the exact cause of the deaths.

Officials claim farmers lace seeds with poison to ward off rats, squirrels, and other birds, and animals end up eating the grains. Along with the peacocks, eight female pigeons were also found dead in the field.

Babu Lal Jaju, state coordinator, People for Animals, alleged, “The reason for the constant rise in their deaths is that peacock is the only bird whose feathers are allowed to be sold. Peacocks are killed rampantly also for their meat. Since the police and forest department do not take any action, there is no fear among the poachers.”

Wildlife lovers in the state alleged that despite this high figure, the state government has failed to curb the increasing death toll of peacocks in the state. The national bird is listed under schedule I of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972.

NAINITAL: Uttarakhand High Court, on Tuesday, issued a bailable warrant against Sudip Dutta, under-secretary of Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, Government of India, after the officer failed to appear before the court during the hearing of the case relating to payment of dues to Uttarakhand by Uttar Pradesh.

The court had, in its last hearing on February 11, ordered the under-secretary to be physically present in the court on Tuesday after the Centre failed to file its response on the allocation of sum of Rs 800 crore to be paid by the state of Uttar Pradesh to Uttarakhand despite deferring the matter several times. Notably, when Uttarakhand was carved out of Uttar Pradesh in 2000, it was decided that Uttar Pradesh will pay Rs 800 crores to Uttarakhand transport department.

The bench of Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan and Justice Ramesh Chandra Khulbe has been hearing a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed by Uttarakhand Roadways Karmchari Union asking clearance of their dues amounting to almost Rs 85 crores.

DS Mehta, the lawyer appearing for Uttarakhand roadways union, told TOI, “Dutta had filed an exemption application on Tuesday saying that he was on medical leave and therefore cannot come to Nainital. The court refused the application saying that exemption requests have to be filed at least a day before so that even if the request is refused, the deponent can be present in the court.”

The court, in its order, also said that application doesn’t mentions what medical problem the deponent is suffering from and whether it was of such a nature that he wasn’t able to appear before the court in compliance.

“The affidavit doesn't mentions that from when the deponent is suffering from this medical ailment and whether it was of such nature that disables him from even attending duties at his office in New Delhi. The affidavit is vague and bereft of any particulars which give us the impression that the officer believes that the orders of the court can be flouted… We are satisfied prima facie that officer has chosen to deliberately avoid appearing before this court despite specific directions issued,” the order read, while also directing Nainital SSP to make sure that the officer’s presence is ensured before the court on Monday at 10:45 am.

361,['19/02/2020'],Suspended ‘mob instigator’ cop denied bail,"This story is from February 19, 2020

Shaktisinh Zala

Vadodara: A sessions court on Tuesday denied anticipatory bail to a suspended police constable who has been accused of instigating bootleggers to attack police at Ganpatpura village.

Shaktisinh Zala had sought bail on the grounds that he has been wrongly named as an accused in the case. He claimed he was working as a constable when the attack on the police party had taken place on March 29, 2018.

Zala even told the court that the first charge sheet filed by the police did not have any mention of his name and he has already filed a petition in the Gujarat high court to quash the case against him.

Arguing against Zala’s plea, the additional public prosecutor B S Purohit said that Zala’s name had cropped up during investigation as the attackers had revealed his name. “The accused has been on the run till date and if he will be allowed bail there will be no fear of law,” Purohit argued.

The sub-inspector of Vadodara rural police B D Jadeja who had conducted the raid and was attacked remained present during the hearing and argued against Zala.

The court of additional district judge S C Gandhi upheld Purohit’s arguments and observed that it is primarily evident that Zala had committed the crime and so his plea does not stand, while denying him bail.

A police party of Vadodara Taluka police station had raided Ganpatpura village but a mob had pelted stones on them and their vehicle. Cops were also assaulted due to which Jadeja had to fire three rounds in the air from his service gun.

Representative Image

NAINITAL: Almora Police on Monday seized around 580 bottles of liquor from a private ambulance, with a Dehradun number plate, barely a few km outside the town.

Providing further details, police officials said that the liquor is of a brand made in Haryana and therefore they suspect that it may have been smuggled into Uttarakhand. “We saw an ambulance parked along the road just a few km outside the town. When we approached it and checked, there were liquor bottles in the back seat. We seized all the bottles and after counting them, we have assessed their value to be around Rs 3 lakh,” said Arun Kumar Verma, a police official involved in the raid.

The officer added that the search for the smugglers is still on as they had already fled the spot when police personnel raided the ambulance. “When we reached the spot and checked, there was no one in the ambulance. But we have started our investigation and also seized the ambulance. Once the owner of the vehicle is located, we will be able to track those who brought in the liquor and in such high quantities,” Verma said.

Incidentally, this is the first time that illicit liquor has been seized from an ambulance in such high quantity in the area. “A case like this has not happened in recent memory in Almora. We have started investigation and once the smugglers are caught, we will be able to establish who brought in the liquor and for what purpose,” Verma said.

Some bonded labourers from Odisha are rescued from a brick kiln near Vengal in Tiruvallur district on Tuesday

CHENNAI: Nearly 150 bonded labourers , including children, from Odisha were on Tuesday rescued from a brick kiln near Tiruvallur by the ‘one stop crisis team’ following a surprise check.

The owner of the kiln had also engaged two quacks to treat the labourers for various ailments and injuries they had suffered while at work. The team also seized essential drugs, including prescription pills, to treat some common ailments.

Based on information, a team of officials from police, revenue, directorate of industrial safety and health and social defence departments conducted the surprise check at JD Chamber in Punnapakkam near Vengal. It was owned by a person called Jayachandran.

C Vidhya, revenue divisional officer of Tiruvallur, and Saraswati, secretary of Tiruvallur district legal service authority (DSLA), who led the team, found the unit was being operated without licence. “The owner of the kiln did not maintain any record regarding the number of people employed in the facility and disbursement of salary to them,” said an official.

The team found around 30 children from babies to those aged around 14 years in the kiln. They lived with their families in the kiln and didn’t attend school, said the official.

Preliminary inquiry with the workers revealed that they hailed from Odisha and had been working for six months to four years for low wages. They worked for long hours and their movements were restricted. “After finding elements of bonded labour, we shifted the labourers to a marriage hall,” said an official who was part of the rescue operation. After completing formalities as per provisions under the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act 1976, they would be sent back to their home-towns.

Chandrahasan, deputy superintendent of police of Uthukottai, who was a part of the team, nabbed Premanand and Vikram of Odisha for allegedly treating the labourers for some ailments. An inquiry revealed that the duo treated the labourers and administered IV fluids and injections for various ailments and injuries which they had sustained while at work. The two were kept under custody for inquiry. “After a complaint from the RDO, we will file a case and take further action,” said the DSP.

Police are on the lookout for Jayachandran, the absconding owner of the kiln.

Trichy: With the protest against the citizenship (amendment) Act (CAA) gaining pace across the state following the police action on protesters at Washermenpet last week, students of Jamal Mohammed College (JMC) in Trichy also joined the bandwagon by blocking the road on Tuesday afternoon.

As many as 250 students of the college gathered on the road outside the college opposite the office of the inspector general of police (IG) central zone around 1.30 pm.

366,['19/02/2020'],HC stays order invalidating ward member’s election,"This story is from February 19, 2020

Madurai: The Madras high court has granted interim stay on an order passed by the Karur district collector/ district election officer declaring the election of a person as ward member and vice-president of Sithalavai village panchayat as invalid on the ground that the ward was reserved for women.

A Krishnamoorthy, 67, a resident of Sithalavai village in Karur district had stated that 50% reservation was allotted for women candidates of the total nine wards in the village. The authorities who followed the reservation system had reserved wards 2, 3, 5 and 8 for women and the remaining wards for general category.

He stated that he contested from ward 6 against another candidate Jeyaseelan. The officials had accepted his nomination papers and he was declared elected on January 2 and the same was published in the website of the state election commission (SEC).

After taking charge as ward member on January 6, he contested in the indirect election for the post of vice-president of Sithalavai village panchayat on January 11, in which he was declared elected after securing six votes. The petitioner submitted that the collector issued a notice on February 6, declaring that his election to the post of ward 6 member and vice-president was invalid, on the ground that ward 6 was allotted for women candidates.

Since both candidates including himself who contested in ward 6 were male candidates, it ensures that the ward was allotted for general category. He stated that even if the ward is reserved for women, the officials cannot set aside the election of a candidate and it could only be done by competent court by way of filing an election petition as per law.

The officials have committed an error while discharging their duties and they should be punished for dereliction of duty. He further stated that he should not be made to suffer for the error committed by the officials. Hence, the petitioner moved thecourt seeking to quash the order passed by the collector and sought to permit him to continue as member of ward 6 and vice-president.

The petitioner also sought the state government to pay Rs 10 lakh compensation for the mental agony caused to him by the order. A division bench granted interim stay and also granted interim injunction restraining the authorities from conducting fresh election. The case was adjourned to a further date.

When asked about Congress’ poor performance in the capital, Kamat said “Congress didn’t have any presence in the last assembly election either. People probably voted for the ruling party which had a chief ministerial face, in the form of Kejriwal. Many tweeted that Delhiites would have liked to have a Sheela Dixit-type as the face of Delhi again. That sums up everything”.

New Delhi: Dr Nonita Gangwani , who has multiple sclerosis and uses a wheelchair , has been declared unfit by the medical board of Safdarjung Hospital for teaching physiology despite being selected after clearing an exam and an interview held for the post.

Gangwani has a postgraduate degree in the subject and is currently teaching in Subharti Medical College in Ghaziabad. She applied under the general category for the post of senior resident in the physiology department of Vardhaman Mahavira Medical College of Safdarjung Hospital. After she was selected in October last year, she was asked to appear before a medical board to determine if she was fit for the job as hers was a “special case”.

“In November, I appeared before a medical board in Safdarjung, which asked several questions about how I prepare power point presentations and give lectures. I explained that I make my presentations on my phone using apps and a technician helps me during lectures. They asked if I could write and I said I couldn’t, after which they said they would be in touch with me. In December, I had to appear before another medical board where more of the same questions were asked. At the end, they said I shift to a career in research rather than teaching,” Gangwani told TOI.

“The head of the physiology department, who was present, knew that I was already teaching in Subharti Medical college and not only has he seen me teach, he has also awarded me for coming second in a quiz organized as part of a conference in Safdarjung,” said Gangwani. She was disappointed that despite this, he suggested she change her career.

When TOI contacted Dr Raj Kapoor, the head of the physiology department, he said the decision to not hire Ganwani was the board’s and not his.

Madurai: The Madras high court has directed the dean of Tuticorin Government Medical College Hospital to submit a report on a plea moved by a woman seeking pregnancy termination of her 17-year-old differently-abled daughter who was sexually assaulted in Tuticorin district.

In her petition, the woman stated that she is a daily wager. While her husband is employed as a watchman in private company in Chennai, she is residing with her college-going son and 17-year-old physically and mentally challenged daughter in Tuticorin district.

She stated that taking advantage of the situation when her daughter was alone at the house, a 55-year-old man had sexually assaulted her.

Though her daughter suffered due to sexual assault, she was not able to convey it to anyone because of her disability. She came to know that about the incident only after she found out that her daughter was pregnant. Based on the woman’s complaint, a case was registered against Ponraj under Sections of the Pocso Act.

Since her daughter is not in a condition to deliver a child, she moved the high court Madurai bench seeking for a direction to terminate the pregnancy and sought for compensation. She also sought police protection to her family since Ponraj was an influential person.

When the petition was heard on Tuesday, justice Pushpa Sathyanarayana directed the dean to submit a report as to whether the girl was fit for pregnancy termination and adjourned the case to a further date for hearing.

Gandhinagar: The ministry of environment forest and climate change has announced that a marine and mammal survey will be taken up as a part of the resource mapping of the marine life across the coast in the country.

This was announced by the official of the ministry at the plenary session of the thirteenth session of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals which is being held here in Gandhinagar.

Soumitra Dasgupta, additional director general of forests (Wildlife), MoEFCC told TOI after the session that the country in order to conserve its marine and mammal, India by 2020, will be launching its Marine Turtle Policy and Marine Stranding Management Policy.

Under these policies it has been decided the country will undertake a exercise for resource mapping of its marine and mammals across the coast. Hence during the plenary session, we announced that the resource mapping will be taken up this year,” he said.

Dasgupta said, that the resource mapping will be taken up by the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute.

He said that the MoEFCC is waiting for the funds for the mapping and once these funds are received the mapping will begin. “We hope to start the mapping by the end of 2020,” he announced.

The officer said that a fund of Rs 5 crore has been sought for the mapping project. Officials further said that the CMFRI was well equipped for such resource mapping as it was already into various research studies for marine and mammals.

The CMFRI has been studying pollution and litter in the coastal and marine ecosystem and their impact among various other studies related to marine life.

Susan Lieberman, VP, international policy, Wildlife Conservation Society, “The announcement was an excellent one. It is important for India to protect its marine areas and even establish Marine Protected Areas along the long coast. However, before going in for protected area such assessment would help in long term conservation of marine species including marine mammals.”

372,['19/02/2020'],Tamil Nadu: One in three middle schools has no subject teachers,"Representative image

CHENNAI: Almost all surveys highlight poor learning outcomes of students of government schools in the state, but the poor learning conditions that are made available for the students are often ignored.Now, an assessment by the central government has revealed that there are no subject teachers in 33% of middle schools run by the Tamil Nadu government.Currently, there are 8.46 lakh students in the 6,966 middle schools in the state.The minutes of a meeting of the project approval board of the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan, a scheme that subsumes three earlier schemes of the Union ministry of human resource development, show that the Centre asked the state to improve subject teacher numbers as per the Right to Education (RTE) Act in upper primary schools (middle schools) and ensure teachers for all core subjects in secondary schools.Teacher associations say non-availability of subject teachers in Classes VI to VIII is one of the key reasons why the state managed just 48 points of 180 in the performance grading index. “The state government has appointed only three teachers, including headmaster, to handle five subjects for students of Classes VI to VIII in middle schools. One for languages, another for maths and science and another for social science,” said R Doss, general secretary of Thamizhaga Arambapalli Asiriyar Kootani.Some schools in Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri distircts have just two teachers for Classes I to VIII. “The school education department should appoint one teacher per class for primary classes and one teacher per subject in upper primary schools. Only then it can help improve the learning outcomes,” he added.The teacher-pupil ratio in middle schools is currently 1:30, but the school education department appoints a second teacher only if the strength reaches 60, said Tamil Nadu Teachers Association president P K Ilamaran. “As per the ratio, a school should get two teachers even if the strength is 31. But, it is not followed,” he said, demanding the appointment of computer instructors and physical education teachers for middle schools.In most schools, teachers said, the available staff are consumed by administrative work such as uploading attendance. “There are nearly 50 records we need to maintain and there are no additional staff. So, the teachers are burdened with administrative work and there is no actual teaching-learning taking place,” said Ilamaran.Following a request from the Centre to ensure 100% optimisation of resources through consolidation of schools within the provisions of the RTE Act by 2019-20, the state government collected details of more than 400 schools with less than five students, but a decision is yet to be taken on merging these schools with bigger institutions.Currently, 3,008 of 24,321 government primary schools have less than 15 students. The Centre also advised the state to set up computer aided learning (CAL) facilities in middle schools and science labs in upper primary and secondary schools besides asking to analyse national achievement survey results and provide interventions to improve the learning outcomes.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74200523,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-416054,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/1-in-3-middle-schools-has-no-subject-teachers/articleshow/74199451.cms

Madurai: Madras high court has withdrawn the interim order which directed all the 13 life convicts in the Melavalavu massacre case to stay in Vellore district after the litigant who challenged their release failed to appear before the court for hearing on Tuesday.

A PIL was filed by advocate P Rathinam, appearing as party-in-person challenging the GOs passed for the premature release of the 13 convicts in the case. The state government released all the convicts citing good conduct in November 2019. The case involves the massacre of six dalits at Melavalavu village in Madurai district on June 30, 1997 by members of another caste following the election of a dalit as the village council president.

During the course of hearing, a division bench had in November passed an interim order directing that the 13 convicts should not enter Melavalavu and that they should stay in Vellore district till the disposal of the petition. The court also directed that they should report before the Vellore district probation officer on the second and fourth Sundays and before the Vellore superintendent of police on the first and third Sundays.

When the case was taken up for hearing on Tuesday by a division bench of Justice R Subramanian and Justice N Sathish Kumar, Rathinam did not appear. Taking a serious note of this, the judges observed that it was painful that the litigant did not appear for the hearing and hence they were inclined to withdraw the interim order passed in the case. The judges adjourned the case till March 16 or to any other date decided by the administrative judge of the Madurai bench.

It may be noted that Justice S S Sundar had recused himself from the case when it was placed before a division bench comprising him and A D Jagadish Chandira earlier, and asked that it be placed before another bench following the concern raised by petitioner Rathinam. The case was thus listed before the present division bench of Justice R Subramanian and Justice N Sathish Kumar.

Trichy: Pudukottai district administration has restored the ownership of a house worth Rs 1.5 crore to a senior citizen which was taken as ‘dhana’ settlement through false means by her son before abandoning her. The land documents were returned to her at the grievance meeting held on Monday by collector P Uma Maheswari.

Kaliammal, 76, had approached the collector on January 6 with a petition seeking retrieval of her house from her son, Thiagarajan, 43. She said in her complaint that Thiagarajan had cheated her by getting a dhana settlement, a gift deed in the form of transfer of property, of her house. He got her signature saying he is applying for a loan from the bank. However, what he did was transfer the house to his name. Thiagarajan also abandoned her after that as a result of which she had to stay in temples for food.

Pudukottai revenue divisional officer Thandayuthapani told TOI that he carried out an inquiry following her complaint and found her claims to be true. “We cancelled the dhana settlement and restored ownership of the house which is worth Rs 1.5 crore,” he said. She was living with Thiagarajan, the younger of her two sons, following the death of her elder son.

Nagapattinam: Police started pumping out water from a temple tank on Tuesday after getting suspicious that miscreants, who stole three idols from a temple at Kondal in Sirkazhi, have dumped them in the pond in the village.

Three metal idols of deities Subramaniyar, Valli and Theivanai were stolen from the Kumara Subramaniya Swami Temple at Kondal in Nagapattinam district on Sunday night. The theft came to light on Monday morning.

Preliminary inquiries revealed that miscreants had used duplicate keys to open the front door of the temple. It appeared to be a well-planned theft, police said.

Police suspect that anyone or a gang hailing from the same village might have had their hand in the incident as they have used a duplicate key. If the miscreants are not habitual offenders they may have thrown the idols into the temple tank, police sources said.

“Keeping in mind that no stone should be left unturned, we have commenced the search in the temple tank. So, we are pumping water from the tank using a motor,” a police official in Sirkazhi said.

Of the 45,000 square kilometres in Kutch, a large part falls in the protected areas including Little Rann of K... Read More

GANDHINAGAR: At a time when the central government has ordered undergrounding of distribution line cables for new projects up to 33 kilovolts, a leading state-run transmission company has decided to back a study to find out impacts of power line on various bird species and to come up with possible solutions.

The study, carried out by Wildlife Institute of India (WII) and sponsored by Power Grid Corp of India, is centred around Kutch which is home to large number of birds. Kutch also has large number of industries and power generating units and a lot of power cables spread across the areas have caused bird hits and bird deaths in the past.

“Through the study we aim to find out critical areas and high use areas from where the power lines pass and pose potential risk to the birds that travel through these paths. Kutch has a large congregation of birds including cranes, flamingos and pelicans that could collide with some power lines in their path. Also, raptors face similar issue,” said Suresh Kumar, a senior researcher at WII.

He said that the study would look at solutions like re-routing of electric lines and doing an in-depth analysis of putting diverters to avoid bird hits.

While Kutch has about 4,500 kilometres of transmission lines, the distribution lines are not mapped due to unavailability of proper data and rapid addition of newer lines. Birds like some large raptors get injured after colliding with distribution lines of 11KV to 66KV. In the case of cranes and flamingos, they face challenge of electrocution due to collision with transmission lines carrying high voltage power of 132KV to 1,200KV, said Kumar.

In 2010, as many as 400 demoiselle cranes got electrocuted in Khadir area of Kutch after they collided with power lines. Similar instances took place few years ago at Bhavnagar where 30 cranes got electrocuted.

Earlier this month, the central government passed guidelines for undergrounding distribution lines of 33KV and below for upcoming projects, said sources. The critically endangered Great Indian Bustard, which is the mascot for the ongoing 13th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) at Gandhinagar, faces risk of extinction. One of the major reasons cited for their deaths is their collision to power lines in Rajasthan and Kutch. A WII report in 2019 stated GIBs are dying at the rate of 15 per cent annually due to collision with high voltage power lines.

“The outcome of the ongoing study will help all transmission and distribution utilities in the country to formulating or implementing better safeguard measures for avifauna protection,” said Suvendu Kumar Kar, manager (environment), Power Grid Corp.

Of the 45,000 square kilometres in Kutch, a large part falls in the protected areas including Little Rann of Kutch and Greater Rann of Kutch, among others.

“We are studying areas outside the protected areas where power line collision poses risk to them. The CMS Energy Task Force for which India has signed up this time shows that the country is sensitive to such issues. As a result, we will try and adopt follow global standards,” said Kumar. The Energy Task Force is to provide safe pathways to birds and to minimize the risk of collision with power lines and windmills.

As part of the study, WII has so far tagged four lesser flamingos and two greater flamingos in Kutch to track their movement. The institute is now planning to tag cranes for which it is studying their movements. Plans are also in place for studying raptors.

It is was in 2010 that 400 cranes had died because of electrocution while in Bhavnagar 30 cranes had been electrocuted.

Madurai: Foundation stone was laid for a 50-metre-high lighthouse at Dhanushkodi near Rameswaram in Ramanathapuram district by minister of state (independent charge) for shipping Mansukh Laxman Mandaviya on Tuesday. This will be the 5th lighthouse in the district after Pasipattinam, Olakuda, Pamban and Keelakarai.

The lighthouse will guide fishermen and vessels and will be a tourist attraction as well. The minister said that a visitors’ gallery will be established at a height of 42 metres and it will have lift facility.

On the arrest of the Indian fishermen by the Sri Lankan Navy, the minister said that the union government is building its relationship with Sri Lanka and the issue was discussed even during the Sri Lankan president’s recent visit to India. “It is our duty and we are ready to support you (fishermen),” he said.

Later in the day, he told reporters in Madurai that the government is planning to start a ferry service between Puducherry and Jaffna in Sri Lanka. He was answering a question on relaunching the ferry service between Dhanushkodi and Sri Lanka. He said that other destinations for the service would be decided later. An official from the directorate general of lighthouses and lightships told TOI that the Dhanushkodi lighthouse will be located opposite to the remains of the old church destroyed by a cyclone in 1964. The octagonal structure to be established spending Rs 8 crore will be completed in one year.

Light equipment on the tower will have a range of 18 to 20 nautical miles (33 to 37 km) to facilitate navigation. Radar will be affixed atop the tower for surveillance and security of local fishermen. The Coast Guard will monitor the data round-the-clock. The department is planning to fully operate the lighthouse using solar energy.

Dhanushkodi lighthouse tower will have an annexure building for power supply, auxiliary equipment room and other essential amenities. The visitors’ gallery will have binoculars, using which tourists could even view Sri Lankan shores under favourable climatic conditions. The lighthouse will also have children’s play area and landscaped garden. Former union minister Pon Radhakrishnan, director general of lighthouses and lightships E Murthy, director of lighthouses and lightships for Chennai Region D Venkataraman, Ramanathapuram district collector K Veera Raghava Rao and elected representatives were present on the occasion.

Madurai: The Madras high court on Monday has asked the central government whether there are any schemes to revive the Vaigai river. The court said this after taking cognizance of a news report in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his Lok Sabha campaign in Tamil Nadu last year had stated that steps would be taken to revive Vaigai river similar to the river Ganga.

Hearing a batch of petitions with regard to the restoration of waterbodies in the southern districts on Monday, a division bench of justices T Raja and B Pugalendhi directed the assistant solicitor general V Kathirvelu to inform the court if there are any schemes by the Centre to revive the Vaigai.

After a senior counsel who was appointed as amicus curiae by the court sought to appoint a special officer, the state government informed the court that a retired IAS officer K Satyagopal has been appointed as chairman of the Tamil Nadu Water Resources Conservation and Rivers Restoration Corporation to implement and monitor irrigation projects in the state.

Observing that the assistance of the retired IAS officer could be availed, the judges stated that the Madurai Corporation and the committee appointed by the court to monitor Vaigai river stretch from Theni to Ramanathapuram stretch should convene a meeting with Satyagopal with regard to the work undertaken so far in restoration of waterbodies in southern districts.

The judges also directed the Madurai commissioner of police to grant police protection to the corporation officials while surveying the Panaiyur channel for identifying and removal of encroachments. The judges further directed the Madurai district collector to provide adequate staff during the process of survey for identification and removal of encroachments in Kiruthumal river.

The case was adjourned to February 24 for further hearing.

CHENNAI: Government bus drivers in the Coimbatore region are baffled by a new and weird rule. Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC), Coimbatore, has instructed its drivers not to chat with women seated next to them.

Following complaints that drivers tend to get distracted because of such small talk, a circular was on January 19 issued warning drivers that departmental action will be initiated against those who violate the rule.

“All it takes is a fraction of a second (for an accident). So, it is better to avoid such ‘unnecessary’ distractions,” said a senior TNSTC official, requesting anonymity.

M Radhakrishnan of Inaiyum Kaigal workers’ union in Coimbatore said there have been instances when drivers didn’t halt at stops though conductors had repeatedly asked them to. “Some remain so engrossed in conversation that they resume driving without ascertaining whether passengers are boarding or alighting,” he said.

Drivers, on the other hand, said such chit-chat, regardless of gender, came as a much-needed break. TNSTC driver D R Ramesh said that earlier a similar rule was introduced barring conductors from occupying front seats. Subsequently, it was repealed after night-duty drivers complained that they found it difficult with no one to talk to. “If talking to women is their problem, let them change the seating pattern,” he said.

Unlike in Chennai, Coimbatore local buses have a different seating arrangement. While male passengers mostly occupy the last six or seven rows of the vehicle, women occupy the front half of bus. So, if women don’t find seats, they tend to sit on the bonnet next to the driver.

A few people sitting on the bonnet is a common sight in most buses in the Coimbatore region, particularly those plying along Avinashi Road which is dotted with many women’s colleges, textile factories and of late professional workspaces.

A new trouble for TNSTC is that women passengers are either forced to stand near bus entrances in dangerous positions or skip overcrowded buses and wait longer for the next bus.

“If the government is so concerned about our safety and comfort, they should operate more buses, particularly air-conditioned buses with more seats,” said M Divya, who works at BR Puram Industrial Estate. Coimbatore has only eight air-conditioned buses.

No one has been injured in the mishap as the residents, who previously had an altercation with the suspect, had gone to their relative’s place. However, almost all the household articles, including Rs 1.5 lakh in cash, was gutted in the fire.

Police said that the victims were tenants in the house owned by Devidas Yeole, who also lived in the same locality.

Ruksana Bhikan, 40, lodged a complaint at Mukundwadi police station. According to her complaint, she, along with her family members, returned home after attending a funeral in the neighbouring Jalna district on Saturday. When she was working with her daughter in the kitchen, the latter noticed the suspect, who also lives in the same locality, peeping into their house. She alerted her mother and said that the youth used to peep into their house every now and then.

Ruksana stepped out of the house and questioned the youth. She even called out the suspect stating that it was not the first time that he was caught peeping. The allegations snowballed into a heated argument and the suspect even attempted to hit Ruksana.

Seeing the situation getting out of hand, Ruksana went inside the house and locked the door.

The suspect started banging on the door and abusing her and even threatened to teach her a lesson.

Fearing for the safety of her family members, the woman contacted her son-in-law. He arrived after a while and took the family to his house to avoid any further friction with the suspect.

Hours later, the family received a call from the landlord who informed that fumes were coming out of their house. Police said that the accused threw petrol from the window of the house and set it ablaze.

By the time the family rushed back home, they found that everything had been reduced to ashes. Mukundwadi police registered an offence against the suspect late on Monday night.

Senior inspector at Mukundwadi police station Uddhav Jadhav told TOI, “The suspect is on the run ever since the incident came to light. He has been captured in a CCTV camera. We have dispatched a team to nab him.”

Dr Prashant Upadhyay

Vadodara: Another offence has been registered against the priest of Shri Baglamukhi Brahmastra Vidya Mandir and his two aides for threatening an elderly woman. The woman was threatened as she had inquired about her son’s whereabouts who was priest Dr Prashant Upadhyay’s follower.

According to Minaxi Shah, her younger son Kalpesh was a follower of Upadhyay and used to go to the temple regularly. In 2006, Kalpesh even asked his elder brother Jignesh to come and attend Upadhyay’s sermons which he refused. The relations between the two brothers soured over Kalpesh’s religious practices at home. However, Kalpesh continued going to the temple and later started spending most of his time at the temple.

Once when Shah went to attend sermons at the temple, she looked around for Kalpesh. But when he could not be seen, Shah asked Upadhyay about him. She was told that Kalpesh will return home and she should not worry about him. As Kalpesh didn’t return, Shah asked Upadhyay several times about him and he began to avoid her.

Shah was then told that Kalpesh was working at Upadhyay’s home in Gotri as helper, so she went there to check but he was not to be found there. After waiting for Kalpesh for around a decade, he suddenly appeared at his home in 2017. But he again went to Delhi saying that he had got a contract and will have to spend nine months there. When Kalpesh again went missing, Shah went to Upadhyay but she was not given a proper answer following which she submitted an application to police.

When Upadhyay learned about it, he started threatening Shah and she withdrew her complaint. Lately on reading about Upadhyay’s cheating case in newspapers, Shah talked to local media persons. Upadhyay’s two aides Kiran Gurumukh and Komal Gurumukh came to her home on Warasia Ring Road and threatened her of dire consequences if she spoke ill about the former. The woman registered a police complaint against Upadhyay who is already facing probe in a cheating case.

CHENNAI: Residents of hamlets near five industrial parks in and around Sriperumpudur can heave a sigh of relief as the State Industries Promotion Corporation of Tamil Nadu ( Sipcot ) has ordered industrial units to stop drawing water from borewells sunk during last year’s crisis. A drive is also on to identify illegal borewells.

In a circular, Sipcot said, “Since drawing water from borewells will lead to depletion of groundwater and to discourage drawing water from borewells for industrial purposes, the allottees are asked to close the borewells before February 10.” During inspections, Sipcot found that some industrial units at its parks in Sriperumbudur, Irungattukottai, Pillaipakkam, Orgadam and Vallam-Vadagal in Kancheepuram district continue to draw water from borewells.

About 560 industrial units operate in the five industrial parks, requiring 20 MLD (million litres a day) of water.

Of late, treated water was being supplied from the 45 MLD capacity tertiary treatment reverse osmosis (TTRO) plant at Koyambedu to these industrial units.

According to Sipcot sources, a survey on the premises revealed that at least 20 illegal borewells were in operation. “We have closed 168 authorised and 20 illegal borewells. Their closure will largely benefit residents of 12 villages within Sipcot premises, whose water resources can be conserved as depletion of groundwater table is arrested,” an official source added. “We are continuing our drive against illegal borewells to enumerate and shut them,” the official said.

Industries were allowed to dig borewells during water shortage caused due to monsoon failures with a rider that they would be shut after Sipcot finds sources to supply the required quantum of water. The circular further warned of heavy penalty against industrial units found using borewells. There is a one-time penalty of Rs 5 lakh for sinking borewells without the approval of Sipcot.

Madurai: The Madras high court has granted interim injunction on the setting up of a new Tasmac liquor shop at Iyer Bungalow- Panangadi Road in Madurai.

In his petition, S Sundararajan, a resident of Panangadi, stated that hundreds of families are residing at the locality that comes under the corporation limit. He stated that he came to know that construction work was going on to set up the new Tasmac shop.

A private school is situated within 45m from the place where the new liquor shop is to be set up.

If the liquor shop is set up in the area, then it would cause disturbance to the students.

He said that though the residents of the area opposed the setting up of Tasmac shop in the locality and submitted representations to the authorities concerned, no steps were taken so far.

Hence, the petitioner moved the high court Madurai bench seeking to forbear the officials from opening a Tasmac outlet and also sought for an interim injunction in this regard.When the petition was taken up for hearing on Monday, a division bench of justice M Duraiswamy and justice T Ravindran granted interim injunction and adjourned the case to a further date for hearing.

Representative image

JAIPUR: Eighteen months after his father committed suicide by consuming pesticides after failing to repay Rs 5 lakh farm debt, his 35-year-old son also killed himself in Sriganganagar district on Monday after he too could not clear the amount.

On Tuesday, around 300 farmers gathered outside Sriganganagar district collectorate demanding complete loan waiver and financial aid for the family of Mahendra Verma of Chaparwali village in Sardulshahar tehsil. They also submitted a memorandum to collector Madan Nakatey.

According to the protesters, Mahendra was shattered after getting a notice from a nationalised bank that his five bighas would be attached as the family failed to repay the loan.

“Mahendra consumed pesticide early on Monday and succumbed in the evening,” Amar Singh, secretary of Kisan Sangharsh Samiti, Sriganganagar, told TOI.

Six years ago, Mahendra’s father had taken a crop loan of Rs 5 lakh from a nationalised bank. “His father failed to repay the loan and was repeatedly getting notices from the bank. Around 18 months ago, he committed suicide,” Singh added.

Farmer groups including Kisan Sangharsh Samiti, Akhil Bhartiya Kisan Sabha, Sriganganagar Kisan Samiti and Jai Kisan Aandolon said Mahendra had recently received a notice of attachment of his land.

“He is survived by wife, three daughters aged 8, 10 and 13 and a 5-year-old son. We demand a complete loan waiver and some financial aid for the family of the deceased,” said Subash Sehgal, farmer leader and spokesman of Kisan Sangharsh Samiti.

After the collector’s assurance, the family and farmers conducted the funeral of the deceased on Tuesday. “The district collector assured us that he will do the needful as per the government norms and will ensure all benefits under various schemes to Mahendra’s family,” Singh said.

397,['19/02/2020'],"MBBS students, docs slam move for exit test","This story is from February 19, 2020

Madurai: The National Exit Test (NEXT), proposed in the National Medical Commission (NMC) Bill 2019 passed by Parliament last year, is facing opposition from medical students and doctors. NEXT or a common final-year MBBS exam is a key provision in the NMC bill for admission to postgraduate courses and also for obtaining a practice licence and is likely to be implemented by 2022.

“We have been opposing several sections in the NMC Bill ever since it was introduced in Parliament. It is being proposed to conduct at least two NEXT exams, one before internship for final year MBBS students and one after it. This will definitely be a burden for students who will be prone to burnout. Already, there have been many cases of medical students committing suicide,” said Dr Abul Haasan, chairman of IMA Junior Doctors Network and a senior paediatric surgeon.

The NEXT-1 exam, a competitive exam, must be cleared to do internship and its marks will also be used for PG ranking in counselling. According to the current proposal, NEXT-1 exam cannot be repeated if one clears it. “The current National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (Neet) postgraduate (PG) exam can be repeated to improve our score to get our choice of seat. Getting a seat of our choice is already a herculean task. So, such an exam at the end of our final year will be a ton of pressure on us,” said an MBBS student from a private college in Madurai. On the other hand, the NEXT-2 exam after internship is more of a practical exam and needs to be cleared to get PG seat and licence to practice.

“Students have the option of working after finishing MBBS or going for PG. So, why do they need to clear the first NEXT exam and score well if they are not ready to go for PG immediately. Further, if they score less marks, it would still impact their PG admission in future ,” explained Dr Abul. He also said that the uniform exam does not consider the rural and urban divide. Since the multiple choice questions for the first NEXT exam are likely to be not just from the final year portions it will only be a burden for students, he added.

“We are open to suggestions but actually the current system is already a good enough system,” added Dr Venkatesh Karthikeyan, the state president of IMA Medical Students Network.

Aurangabad: The issue of renaming the city Sambhaji Nagar rocked the general body meeting on Tuesday when BJP members presented a reminder letter on the proposal to the mayor. MIM members alleged that the BJP was trying to replicate its Delhi-like politics in Aurangabad ahead of the civic elections.

This is the fourth time that the BJP has tried to raise the issue in the general body meeting of Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC). The proposal of renaming Aurangabad ‘Sambhaji Nagar’ was first brought to the general body on December 20, 2019 by BJP group leader Pramod Rathod.

He presented a reminder letter about the proposal to the mayor during the GB meetings on January 7 and February 6 this year. Even in absence of Rathod, the reminding letter was presented by BJP members on Tuesday for the third time. The Tuesday’s general body meeting started off with BJP member Raj Wankhede raising the issue.

As soon as the issue was raised, former leader of opposition Zameer Quadri said that through the repeated reminders of the proposal the BJP is merely trying to achieve its goals. “There are several important things that need GB’s attention, but the BJP is trying to divert attention of the house,” Quadri said.

For the first time, the issue of Citizenship Amendment Act and National Register of Citizens (CAA-NRC) was also raised in the house on Tuesday. “The BJP played a politics on Hindu-Muslim and defended CAA-NRC in Delhi assembly elections, which backfired. Now, they are trying to contest the AMC elections on the same lines,” Quadri said.

Gajanan Barwal, who supports the BJP in house, said the matter of renaming city to Sambhaji Nagar is in the Supreme Court and that is why it is inappropriate to discuss the issue in the house. Deputy mayor Rajendra Janjal said that the Sena members had raised the issue in the Parliament following which the Central Government had sought a detailed report on the name changing from the state government but the report has not been sent yet.

Mayor Nandkumar Ghodele said that it was Sena founder Balasaheb Thackeray who first declared city’s name as Sambhaji Nagar in 1988 and since then every Sena member refers the city with that name. “Now, his son Uddhav Thackeray is the chief minister and he will ensure that the name is changed,” mayor said.

Madurai: Two-wheeler riders and car drivers in southern districts have coughed up Rs 22.44 crore as fine for violating helmet and seat belt rules in 2019, according to data available with the police.

Of the Rs 22.44 crore, bikers alone have paid Rs 17.11 crore for not wearing helmet in the nine districts of Madurai, Dindigul, Virudhunagar, Sivaganga, Ramanathapuram, Theni, Tuticorin, Tirunelveli and Kanyakumari. Car drivers have paid Rs 5.33 crore for violating the seat belt rule.

Compared to 2018, the number of cases registered for helmet and seat belt rule violation in 2019 has increased by 83%. All the police units have concentrated on enforcing road rules strictly. For instance, in Sivaganga, the number of cases registered under the two heads increased by three-fold from 76,643 in 2018 to 2.29 lakh in 2019.

Officials say that strict enforcement of road traffic rules is helping them bring down road fatalities. Most road accidents in the state involve bikers, who get killed for not wearing a helmet.

Due to strict enforcement, the number of road deaths has come down by 307 in the districts, with Virudhunagar and Ramanathapuram performing best in terms of fatality reduction.

Virudhunagar superintendent of police P Perumal said that stringent enforcement of traffic rules helped bring down the fatalities. In 2019, the Virudhunagar district police have registered 2.87 lakh helmet violations and 1.06 lakh seat belt violations, the highest among southern districts. Perumal said that they also focused on red light jumping, using mobile phone while driving, drunk and driving, overloading in good vehicles and carrying passengers in good vehicles.

A higher official said that they have been instructed to bring down road fatalities further this year. They are taking all sorts of steps starting from improving road safety, sensitisation of driving and villagers and deploying police personnel at accident-prone spots apart from strict enforcement of traffic rules.

Raja Ravi Varma’s studio near Motibaug Ground

Vadodara: Had it not been Baroda , millions would have missed the colourful depiction of Indian Gods and Goddesses. For it was this erstwhile state that provided Raja Ravi Varma, the opportunity to proclaim the splendour of India’s heritage. Born on April 29, 1848, Raja Ravi Varma was closely connected with the royal house of Travancore. He was already making waves with the splash of colours in his paintings at the age of 13.

But his tryst with Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III helped him in reaching his works to the masses. T Madhav Rao, who first served as Dewan of Travancore and later as Dewan (Prime Minister) of Baroda State invited Raja Ravi Varma to make a portrait of Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III.

Varma first came to the city and spent four months in 1881-82. Sayajirao got a studio built for him near Motibaug ground where Varma stayed and worked. The young Maharaja was so impressed by Varma’s works that in 1888, he invited Varma to Ooty where he commissioned 14 mythological paintings illustrating the national epics – Ramayana and Mahabharata – for the decoration of the new Durbar Hall in the new Laxmi Vilas Palace.

“Sayajirao had given Rs 50,000 to Raja Ravi Varma for starting a printing press at Mumbai in 1893. The first oleograph to be printed at this press was of Varma’s famous painting ‘Birth of Shakuntala’. Also, the original painting of Maneka and Vishwamitra made by Varma still adorns the walls of Fatehsinhrao Museum in the city,” said Sachin Kaluskar, art connoisseur who has a rich collection of Varma’s oleographs.

It was Raja Ravi Varma, who chose the sari as the drapery of his epic heroines and many believe that the pan-Indian acceptance of the sari as the formal dress for women possibly owes much to his sari-clad heroines. From 1888 till 1890, Ravi Varma worked on the 14 puranic paintings of the Baroda commission in Kilimanur and Mavelikara, where his studio was located at the Madham Palace. These paintings of the Baroda commission were first exhibited at the Trivandrum museum in 1890 and later in Bombay in 1892.

406,['19/02/2020'],MPCB asked to check quality of dam water,"This story is from February 19, 2020

Aurangabad: Acting on a letter written by an Aurangabad activist about the discharge of industrial effluents into the Jayakwadi dam, the state government’s environment ministry has asked the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) to act on the complaint.

A report highlighting the discharge of industrial effluents into Kham river was published by TOI on March 19, 2019.

Health activist Vilas Jagdale, who practices homoeopathy medicine, had written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on December 28, 2018, highlighting issue of polluted drinking water. However, the letter did not receive any response.

On September 9, 2019, Jagdale wrote another letter to Modi and sent the same to various central government and state government authorities including the environment ministry of Maharashtra. In the letter, Jagdale expressed concerns over the release of effluents by industries in Kham river which is the source of water for scores of people. He also said that the said river eventually connects to Jayakwadi dam, polluting the water in it too.

“The water from Jayakwadi dam is used by lakhs of people every day for drinking purpose. These include people from Paithan, Waluj, Aurangabad, Jalna, Beed, Gevrai, Parbhani districts. However, several industries along the Kham river are rampantly releasing untreated industrial sewage into the river, posing a threat to the people consuming water from Jayakwadi dam,” Jagdale said.

According to Kishor Pathak, a homoeopathic doctor and an environment expert, the water from Jayakwadi dam is also used for irrigation purposes. “The fruits, vegetables and grains grown using the chemical-infused water can pose serious health hazards,” Pathak said.

Earlier this month, Jagdale received a response from the environment ministry which directed the MPCB to take necessary action with respect to the concerns raised by the homoeopath. Chandrakant Vibhute, additional secretary of the environment department, directed the MPCB member secretary to inform Jagdale about the action taken on the complaint.

Jagdale has not received any communication from the MPCB so far.

Mumbai: While welcoming the state decision to reserve 10% Mhada houses for police personnel, Abraham Mathai, former vice-chairman of state minorities commission, has asked the government for a 15% quota for minorities in housing schemes .

In a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, Mathai has said one way to halt increasing polarisation is to encourage mixed living. “Maharashtra can take the lead for others to emulate and can reserve housing for minorities in Mhada, Cidco and other state government schemes, I had made a recommendation way back in 2003 when I was vice-chairman in the state minorities commission,” said Mathai. He added he was forced to make the suggestion after actor Emran Hashmi was denied a house in Bandra. Mathai suggested the government rope in private developers and give incentives for the quota.

“Co-existence of multiple communities will enhance social cohesion and communal harmony and inculcate the true spirit of nationhood and real love for the nation,” he said, citing ghettos such as Bhendi Bazaar and Mumbra as a result of denial of houses to Muslims in posh colonies.tnn

Accused in police custoday

VADODARA: A fortnight after they attacked cops and stole valuables from a truck, the detection of crime branch (DCB) busted the notorious ‘taad patri’ gang’ and nabbed six members on Tuesday.

The police said that it arrested the accused on basis of a tip-off, while three others, who were with the gang, are yet to be arrested. “We had been on their trail immediately after they attacked a team of cops while fleing from the spot. We received information that the gang members were in Godhra following which we arrested them from there,” said Jaydeepsinh Jadeja, DCP (crime).

The accused have been identified as Musa Charkha, Zubair Charkha, Mukesh Nayak, Chandu Nayank, Hussain Hayat and Mehboob Chandaliya, all residents of Godhra in Panchmahal. Musa, who is the gang leader, has been booked nine times on charges of theft and robbery in different parts of Gujarat while Zubair has been booked for theft and attempt to murder by the Godhra police. The absconding trio include Amro Bhil, Alpesh Bariya and Ratna Meetha.

The police said that this gang had been operating in the state for the past many years. On February 4, the gang members had planned to commit theft in Mumbai but changed their plans at the last moment. All the nine gang members then zeroed in on the truck parked on the highway near Jambuva bridge.

They began shifting the boxes filled with cashews, wall colour, clothes and other eatables into another truck that they had brought. A cop patrolling in a PCR van got suspicious and approached them.

On seeing him and the police vehicles, the gang members quickly got into their truck. Assistant sub-inspector Rupsinh Baria asked his driver Dhanpalsinh Manusinh to stop the van right behind the accused’s truck.

But the truck driver reversed the vehicle and crashed it into the PCR van before speeding away on the highway towards Ahmedabad. While the police vehicle was damaged, two cops chased the truck and also informed the police control room about the incident. On the way, a few of the accused inside the fleeing truck pelted stones at the PCR van which left its windshield damaged.

Another PCR van joined the chase from Tarsali and tried to overtake the truck on Kapurai bridge. But the truck driver hit this police van too on the driver’s side leaving the second police vehicle badly damaged.

The cops, though, were in no mood to let up and followed the truck which turned towards Dabhoi at Kapurai Chowkdi. However, they had to return after the van’s headlights got damaged.

An offence of attempt to murder, assaulting to deter public servant from performing his duty and Damage to Public Property Act was lodged against the accused.

Aurangabad: City police on Tuesday arrested an examination centre head along with four teachers and a clerk for helping students cheat during the first day of the HSC examination.

The suspects were caught red-handed during the English examination from a separate hall at Shri Gajanan Junior College of Shivneri Colony in Ranjangaon Shenpunji by police constable Vilas Dhanwte.

Special police officer Sanjay Nomone and Dhanwte reached the college at around 1 pm only to find the suspects busy solving the question paper. MIDC Waluj’s senior inspector Madhukar Sawant said, “Today, the HSC students took the English exam. Our constable caught the suspects while they were writing answers on chits.”

The exam was scheduled from 11 am to 2 pm and the constable caught them at around 1 pm. The message was soon passed to the education department and a team of officials soon rushed to the junior college.

A panchanama was carried out by police in presence of education department officials, including deputy education officer Priyarani Patil. Based on Patil’s complaint an offence was registered under relevant sections of Maharashtra Prevention of Malpractices at Universities, Board and other specified Examinations Act, 1982.

According to sources, a special police team has been given the responsibility to probe this case as authorities, including those belonging to the education department, believe that the suspects went out of their way to help the son of a local politician.

An officer privy to the investigation said a detailed report, comprising panchanama and chronology of events, will be sent to the education department for further action against the suspects as well as the school where the alleged malpractice was being carried out.

Meanwhile, the special squads of Aurangabad rural police led by SP Mokshada Patil on Tuesday arrested 26 suspects for malpractice.

VADODARA: The Gandhinagar CID (crime) on Tuesday registered an offence against various spa centres for hiring foreigners without proper documentation.

The CID sleuths formed six teams to raid seven spa centres in the city on Monday and found all of them hiring female staff from Thailand flouting Foreigners Amendment Act 2004.

According to the CID, people of foreign origin have to take proper work permit before getting employment in the country. But when they learnt that spa centres in the city were blatantly flouting the permit norms and hiring foreign women who were staying in the country on multiple entry visa, they carried out the surprise raid.

These women worked as masseurs in the spa centres without any valid work permit.

CID raided spa centres on Vasna-Bhayli Road, Alkapuri, Old Padra Road, Akota, Akshar Chowk and Gorwa on Monday. Nearly 23 Thai women were found employed illegally in these spa centres.

While the police is yet to act against the owners, the foreigners may be sent back to their country. Such raids have been conducted by the local police in the past too.

413,['19/02/2020'],Cotton fails to get suitable market rate,"This story is from February 19, 2020

Aurangabad: Cotton growers in the state continue to suffer as cotton produce fails to bag considerable market rate despite government promising minimum support price for all the farm produce.

Subject experts said that the collapse in ginning and pressing mills across Maharashtra has forced the cotton farmers to sell their produce to Gujarat-based traders who, over a period of time, have secured monopoly in the business, leaving huge scope for exploitation of farmers in terms of prices.

In Marathwada, especially in Beed district, the then district collector Naval Kishor Ram, after carrying out series of studies on cotton growers, had initiated a drive to convince them to switch to other crops.

Failure in getting adequate price for their produce, the debt-ridden farmers were pushed towards depression and, in some cases, extreme steps such as suicide.

In 1972, cotton belonging to the H4 grade which was considered to be of the best quality, had a market rate of Rs 320 per quintal. Today, 48 years later, this high-grade cotton has managed to reach a meagre of Rs 5,550 per quintal.

The figures obtained from the Maharashtra State Co-operative Cotton Growers Marketing Federation Ltd, Nagpur, shows that after struggling to register a surge in the price for years, cotton which in the year 1994-95 was sold for Rs 1,400 per quintal, has presently registered a sudden surge of about Rs 700 and ended up at Rs 2,010 per quintal, making it one of the major leaps in cotton prices in the state.

For a period of about 15 years starting from 1995, cotton continued to get market price of about Rs 2,000 per quintal whereas the sowing, cultivation and harvesting costs multiplied each year.

For the first time in the history of cotton market, its price breached its earlier records and reached Rs 3,115 per quintal in 2011-12.

In 2012-13, cotton got yet another major hike in its price from the previous year, thus attracting more and more farmers to opt for the crop.

In 2012, cotton had a market price of Rs 3,900 per quintal, in 2013, it was Rs 4,000, Rs 4,050 per quintal in 2014, Rs 4,100 in 2015 and Rs 4,160 in the following year.

The figures show that on an average, cotton prices have got a hike of about Rs 100 in each of the following years. Farmers cry foul over it citing that the cost of growing cotton has surged several times more than what is being offered them as the market price during the same era.

According to a study about the expenditure involved in cotton cultivation, an amount of over Rs 27, 000 is required for cultivation of cotton in one hectare of land, including Rs 3,644 for seeds, Rs 8,999 for harvesting, miscellaneous expenses of Rs 1,854, pesticide costing Rs 3,421, fertiliser worth 6,199 and Rs 974 for transportation.

Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant

PANAJI: Chief minister Pramod Sawant said on Tuesday that he would “rethink” the excise duty hike on liquor, including feni , he had proposed in his budget speech.

Members of the Goa Liquor Traders Association recently met Sawant and demanded the hike be rolled back. “The association met me and requested me to reduce excise duty on four different kinds of liquors as they would be as expensive as in other states,” Sawant told reporters after the meeting. “I will consider their request and think about reducing excise duty.”

The chief minister said that he would ask the excise commissioner to recalculate revenue from reduction in excise duty on alcohol. Sawant also said that he would mull over reducing excise duty on feni. “We were not supposed to get more revenue from increase of excise duty on feni, and we will have a rethink,” he said.

Sawant said that the increase of excise duty would not have generated much revenue for the state.

In his budget speech, Sawant proposed to increase excise duty on beer and Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL) which includes rum, blended whiskey and beer. Crucially, the state government also proposed to increase excise duty on feni, which would make the heritage drink pricier by Rs 50-155 depending on the bottle’s retail selling price.

Excise department officials said the state expected to earn over Rs 100 crore from the hike in excise duties.

Recently, the All Goa Distillers and Bottlers’ Association has sought a reduction on the hiked excise duty on feni. Last week, association president Gurudatta Bhakta led a delegation to commissioner of commercial taxes Amit Satija to present their case.

The tax , which ranges between Rs 10 per bulk litre to Rs 75 per bulk litre, has been imposed for the first time on bottled feni, the association said.

Feni was granted geographical indication (GI) certification more than a decade ago. However, it is only in the past three to four years that efforts have been made to derive benefits out of this tag.

Traders said earlier China used to cater almost 80 per cent of water gun market in the city

INDORE: This Holi markets of Indore will mostly be decked up with desi water guns as outbreak of coronavirus in China has squeezed supplies. The deadly disease has also taken a toll on supply of dye intermediates.

Indore is a leading wholesale market for water guns and dyes catering to a large section of nearby markets in and around it. Most wholesale traders of water guns in Indore purchase through dealers at Delhi and Mumbai.

China has stopped taking fresh orders for most items in recent past. But a few local traders have already good stocks as inventories for festivals starts building around 2-3 months in advance.

Nandu Bhai, a trader of water guns in Ranipura market, a leading wholesale market of Indore said, “China is not accepting any fresh order and the pace of goods committed to be dispatched in coming weeks has also slowed down. In Indore most availability is of local made water guns nowadays and this trend is growing year on year.”

Traders said earlier China used to cater almost 80 per cent of water gun market in the city. But gradually its dominance is declining as local manufacturers are coming up with competitive and durable goods.

A trader of water guns at Ranipura Sanjay Choudhary said, “Supply of Chinese water guns has dropped significantly in past two years and most traders now place orders with local manufacturers, who have tremendously improved quality and costing to replace Chinese products.”

The cost of dye intermediates supplied mostly from China has also become expensive. Prices of dye intermediates have started escalating with most raw material costing 5 to 8 per cent higher, traders claimed. Traders fear supply shortage in coming months as the goods in transit has already landed at destinations but fresh orders are barred.

A dye manufacturer said, “Cost of dye intermediates are going up due to the coronavirus outbreak. Situation is under control as of now, but down the line with all stocks exhausting and no fresh orders being accepted, it will create a big vacuum in the market.”

418,['19/02/2020'],Govt rolls back notification reclassifying 56 villages as urban area,"This story is from February 19, 2020

Illustration used for representational purpose

PANAJI: In view of public outcry over the decision to declare 56 villages as ‘ urban area’, the state government on Tuesday withdrew the notification.

The moves comes a day after the state government withdrew the notification imposing Section 144 under the Criminal Procedure Code following criticism from various sections of society.

The last couple of days also saw strong opposition from political parties, including ruling MLAs, over the revenue department notification reclassifying the 56 villages.

“The public is also worried because the notification of villages as ‘urban area’ may have certain implications under other laws. Considering public concerns, the government has decided to withdraw the order with immediate effect,” the chief minister’s office (CMO) said.

The gram sabhas had passed resolutions demanding withdrawal the notification saying that it would facilitate mega projects in the village.

Given the widespread resentment over the notification and keeping in mind the upcoming zilla panchayat election scheduled for March 22, BJP requested the chief minister to withdraw the notification, sources said.

The CMO had recently announced the notification of the 56 revenue villages as urban areas under Section 2(38) of the Goa Land Revenue Code (LRC), 1968, by way of a press release.

When criticism started coming in, the government had issued a press note stating that, under LRC, notification of any village as an urban area only affects the process of assessment of land revenue and this classification does not change any building or infrastructure guidelines as far as the revenue department is concerned.

The revenue department had already clarified that these 56 villages are census towns as per Census 2011. The notification simply adopted these revenue villages as ‘urban area’ without any additional criteria, the CMO said.

File photo of Indira Gandhi International Airport

NEW DELHI: The work on the elevated cross-taxiway, part of Phase-IIIA of the Delhi airport ’s expansion plan, will start on Wednesday, leading to the closure of a road connecting Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA) from National Highway-8 for over a year, Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL) said on Tuesday. Commuters have been advised to keep 10-15 minutes in hand while travelling to IGIA.

A six-lane diversion road has been constructed with adequate signage to guide passengers, DIAL said. As per a diversion plan approved by Delhi Traffic Police, the commuters coming from the Rangpuri roundabout will be diverted to Central Spine Road, connecting terminals 2 and 3, from Mahipalpur. For passengers coming to these terminals from Shiv Murti, Dwarka and Gurgaon, DIAL will use Radisson Road, connecting Rangpuri with the airport via Central Spine Road.

The dual carriageway will connect with the existing Radisson Road/Rangpuri for Terminal 3, while the traffic from Rangpuri/Gurgaon to terminals 2 and 3 will use the signal-free western carriageway starting from the NHAI toll plaza near the Mahipalpur roundabout and merging with Central Spine Road opposite Aerocity metro station. DIAL said the eastern carriageway of the diversion road would cater to the traffic going from T2 and T3 to Rangpuri and Gurgaon.

After taking Central Spine Road, T2 and T3 passengers will have to take a right turn through a newly installed signalised junction to reach the diversion road, which will meet the existing Radisson Road opposite the NHAI toll plaza, DIAL said.

A DIAL spokersperson said signage had been put up at regular intervals and at strategic locations to help passengers with diversions. “The diversion is unlikely to have any significant impact on the commuting time. However, passengers are advised to keep 10-15 minutes extra to be on the safe side,” he added. The diversion road will also cater to the inbound and outbound traffic of Airport Health Organization though a new access road.

The 2.1km cross-taxiway is likely to be constructed by early 2022 to reduce the turnaround time for planes, allowing an increas in the air traffic at IGI.

420,['19/02/2020'],Danve first BJP minister to visit anti-CAA protest site,"This story is from February 19, 2020

Aurangabad: Union minister of state for consumer affairs and senior BJP functionary Raosaheb Danve paid a courtesy visit to the anti-CAA/NRC/NPR protest site in his hometown of Bhokardan in Jalna district, becoming the first BJP minister in the country to do so.

A video clip of his visit and speech has emerged.

Aware of the fact that several youths were recording him, Danve kept his speech short to avoid any controversy — it lasted only 3 minutes.

The minister abstained from speaking in favour or against the Act.

Danve can be heard saying: “On learning about people agitating in my hometown, I came to inquire about them. People here are sitting in an agitation like the ones across the country. I contacted Shabbir Seth (one of the organisers) and expressed my willingness to meet all my Muslim brothers. Though the fight is against the Act, but irrespective of the reason, I am duty-bound to meet the people from my town who are agitating.”

The minister, who is a four-time MP and has held the position of BJP state president in the past, said: “Me commenting on the issue will not be appropriate... A few days from now, you will get to know everything. I have not come here to convince you, or to listen to you. I belong to your village, and you belong to my village. You have been sitting here for so many days. So I felt like coming here. Neither I am your enemy, nor are you mine.”

Saying that he has been staying there for over 35 years, Danve added: “I don’t have any fight with you. I never even made any application against you, nor has there been a reason to do so. It is my duty to come and meet my fellow villagers. Whenever you need me, I will come to have a word with you.”

Local residents said that Danve had paid the visit about four days ago.

On Monday, the Supreme Court had said that people have a fundamental right to protest, but the blocking of public roads is a matter of concern. It had asked advocates Sanjay Hegde, Sadhana Ramachandran and former chief information commissioner Wajahat Habibullah to hold consultations with the Shaheen Bagh protesters and persuade them to move to an alternative site. Taking a cue from Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh, many places across the country — where agitations and anti-CAA/NRC/NPR protests are being held — have been christened Shaheen Bagh. For almost a month, residents of Bhokardan are holding a sit-in agitation next to Nagar Parishad.

A view of Palolem beach in Goa

PANAJI: The tourism department has proposed to identify picnic spots on beaches where people will be permitted to enjoy themselves with prior permission. Once the spots are identified, consumption of liquor on beaches will be restricted to notified zones, tourism minister Manohar Ajgaonkar said on Tuesday.

In 2019, the tourism department brought in a law banning drinking on beaches and penalising those held guilty, however it has not been implemented in spirit.

“Before implementing the ban on drinking on beaches, we want to create spots for picnics. A lot of local groups want to have picnics along the beach. One or two spots at each beach will be identified where people can go and drink,” Ajgaonkar said.

Traditionally, lot of locals visit beaches during the summer months. The trend of organising picnics along the coastal belts have risen during the last decade.

This section of locals would be affected when the tourism department starts implementing the drinking ban.

Tourism director Menino D’Souza said it was suggested that picnic spots be identified on beaches to allow people to consume alcohol. “It is at a proposal stage. Panchayats will be asked to identify such spots in their respective jurisdiction,” said D’Souza.

Permission for picnics, he said, will be required to be taken from the tourism department. He added that locals as well tourists will be allowed to enjoy themselves at these picnic spots.

Goa Tourists Places (Protection and Maintenance) Act, 2019, has a provision to penalise a person found drinking on the beach with Rs 2,000 fine and if it involves a group, penalty will be Rs 10,000.

Direct consequence of drinking on beaches also leads to glass litter on beaches as many dump or break bottles and leave them in the sand. A lot of incidents of visitors suffering foot injuries due to glass pieces in sand have been reported.

Lifeguards face the challenge of dealing with drunken tourists venturing into the water. Drownings due to people getting into water in an inebriated state have also been reported.

PANAJI: The cross-examination of the survivor who alleged she was raped by Tehelka founder-editor Tarun Tejpal , began in a trial court on Tuesday. Tejpal’s counsel, Shrikant Shivade, cross-examined the survivor.

Special public prosecutor Francisco Tavora told TOI that based on the directions of the high court of Bombay at Goa, cross examination has commenced and will continue on February 24. On December 12, 2019, the high court had directed the trial court not to allow Tejpal’s counsel to ask the survivor “irrelevant questions” during cross-examination in the alleged 2013 rape case.

The survivor had approached the high court saying that Tejpal’s counsel was asking irrelevant questions. “The high court will hear the survivor’s case on February 20 and 21,” he said

The cross examination had begun on October 21, 2019.

423,['19/02/2020'],Passengers fume as tollresults in bus fare hike,"This story is from February 19, 2020

Mangaluru: Buses running between Mangaluru and Kundapur have hiked the bus fare citing the toll hike at gates on National Highway 66.

Buses on the route have started collecting additional Re 1 for each stage from passengers. An action committee fighting against toll collection at Surathkal is gearing up for a protest against it. The fare now is Rs 175 for a single journey and Rs 265 for the return journey at Surathkal toll gate. Meanwhile, buses on the Mangaluru-Kundapur route also have to pay toll at Hejmadi and Sasthana.

Muneer Katipalla of the Action Committee Against Surathkal Toll Gate told TOI that administrations of Udupi and Dakshina Kannada districts should immediately look into the fare hike. “They have been collecting the additional amount without obtaining Road Transport Authority approval. Tadministrations should immediately take necessary action,” Muneer said.

However, bus owners say they have no option since the increased toll charge has affected them badly.

Canara Bus Operators Association president Rajavarma Ballal said they haven’t revised the fare, but the additional charge is being collected to make up the loss. “Each bus has to pay Rs 1,500 as toll per day. Our demand for overall hike in fare is pending with the government,” Ballal said.

Requests for fare hike were submitted several times, he said. “Many buses have stopped service since owners are not able to afford maintenance cost. The last fare revision was in 2014 when the price of diesel was Rs 56 per litre and now it’s Rs 66. During the past seven years, tax has increased by 50%, insurance premium by 40% and price of spare parts by 40%, but the fare remains the same. Memorandums have been submitted to the chief minister, ministers and transport commissioner seeking fare revision,” Ballal said.

National Highway Authority of India project director Shishu Mohan said NHAI has not hiked toll charges officially at any toll gate.

Chief minister BS Yediyurappa makes a point during the assembly session at Vidhana Soudha on Tuesday

BENGALURU: Tempers rose and jibes flew as members of the BJP and opposition indulged in a heated exchange over ""undeclared emergency"", ""Tukde Tukde gang"" and ""Bharat Mata"" in the assembly, on the second day of the legislature session on Tuesday.

Leader of the opposition Siddaramaiah, while making a preliminary submission seeking to move an adjournment motion on the law and order situation in the state, attacked the BJP governments at the Centre and in the state, for what he called ""an undeclared emergency"" in the country.

The former chief minister said a parent and headmistress of a school in Bidar, legislator UT Khader of Congress and a student from Mysuru were booked for sedition for opposing the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens ( NRC ), while Somashekara Reddy and Anantkumar Hegde, both BJP legislators, have gotten away scott free despite disparaging remarks against the Constitution.

Siddaramaiah said opposing and expressing opinions against laws and government policies is the essence of democracy, but the BJP is scuttling freedom of expression of the people.

""Bharat Mata is not your property,"" Siddaramaiah said. ""You have not taken it on lease. All 135 crore Indians are her children."" He accused the government of having ""demon instinct"" in suppressing opponents and called the current atmosphere in the country ""an emergency-like situation"".

Countering this, minister KS Eshwarappa reminded Siddaramaiah of the emergency declared by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and pointed out how he had opposed it while in the Janata Dal. ""We were put behind bars for hailing Bharat Mata and calling ourselves her sons,"" Eshwarappa said.

To this Siddaramaiah said, ""It was then a declared emergency, but now its undeclared emergency.""

Intervening, tourism minister CT Ravi and home minister Basavaraj Bommai accused the Congress of supporting the ""Tukde Tukde gang"", resulting in heated arguments between the treasury and opposition benches. Bommai also called the Congress owners of the ""Tukde Tukde gang"".

Taking exception to the remark, Congress member Priyank Kharge pointed out that the Union home ministry, in its written reply in the Lok Sabha recently, said it had no information on any group called the Tukde Tukde gang. ""Arrest us then, slap sedition charges against us. I challenge you,"" Kharge yelled.

With the house in chaos, speaker Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri, who after hearing Siddaramaiah’s submission, ruled that a discussion will be held on the law and order issue at 3pm on Wednesday, but under a different rule (short discussion). The speaker pointed out that the debate on Tuesday pertained only to the motion of thanks to governor Vajubhai Vala’s address.

However, Congress legislators insisted that the discussion continue. Postponing it, they said, would dilute the issue. Intervening, chief minister Yediyurappa said the speaker had scheduled the discussion for Wednesday and the opposition cannot dictate terms to him. This led to heated arguments between the CM and Siddarmaiah.

As the chair did not concede to their demand, Congress members boycotted proceedings. Since Siddaramaiah was reluctant to participate in the debate again, law and parliamentary affairs minister JC Madhuswamy was sent to pacify the opposition leader, who heeded his request.

The department always considered its originating year to be 1854

PANAJI: The department of posts in Goa has stumbled upon a Portuguese-era document which establishes that it’s way older than previously believed.

The department, which has always considered its originating year to be 1854 — it even celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2004 — has since discovered through a gazette notification dated February 17, 1841, that it existed well before that. Thanks to the discovery of this document, the department is now observing its 180th year.

“We have translated a gazette notification from which we learn that the Panaji post office , which was the main post office of Goa, existed before that,” said N Vinodkumar, postmaster general at India Post, department of posts, Goa region. He said that the 1841 notification mentions the expanding of postal services from Panaji to the military headquarters of Ponda, Bicholim, Margao and Mapusa.

The notification, signed by the governor general’s administrative officer Claudio Larange Monteiro de Barbudo, states that there shall be one post office for the remote areas of the Estado (the former Goa, Daman and Diu) which shall be divided into five administrative offices – one general post office and four subordinate offices.

“This post shall be delivered three times a week and the mailbags in the four subordinate offices shall be closed at 5pm on Sundays, Tuesdays and Thursdays of each week in order to reach the general post office in the mornings of the following days — Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, and from there, they shall return in the evening of the same day at 5pm,” states the official English translation by government-appointed translator Maria Rodrigues.

The notification mandates that the commandants of the provinces shall appointing competent and capable persons for the post of ‘escrivao’ (clerk) . It also sheds light on the transportation system in an era when roads and bridges were yet to be built, and connectivity depended upon river navigation. “Necessary orders shall be issued for transportation of the post from one province to another, as also from one administrator’s office to the neighbouring villages, (and) the river crossing shall be free and prompt,” the notification reads.

The postal services back then covered three distances measured in ‘legoas’ (a customary Portuguese unit of distance akin to leagues). Payments were made in ‘reis’, the currency used at the time, and the notification mentioned specific payment structures for each of the distances measures in ‘legoas’, as well as based on the weight of posted bundles.

“We have realized that we have completed 179 years of the expansion of postal services on February 17. From this day, we are marking the beginning of the 180th year,” Vinodkumar said.

426,['19/02/2020'],Coronavirus in Kolkata: Coronavirus cloud over Kolkata's airport Rs 36 crore tray retrieval project,"One of the tray-retrieval units at Kolkata airport

KOLKATA: The coronavirus (Covid-19) epidemic in China has cast its shadow over a Rs 36-crore project at the Kolkata airport. An automatic tray retrieval system ( ATRS ) that was contracted to a Chinese firm has been stalled following travel restrictions on Chinese nationals to stop the spread of the virus that has till date claimed nearly 2,000 lives.As deaths continue to be reported, airport authorities said they were not in a position to work on a revised timeline to implement the project that can increase the throughput of cabin baggage screening and reduce congestion at security check portals at the terminal’s domestic wing.The ATRS is meant to automatically send trays, on which passengers place cabin baggage items for screening, back to the preparation area for others to use. This will end the hassle of looking for trays and prevent empty trays from piling up. Automated rollers enable the trays to move into the screening machine, without the need for passengers or staffers to push their trays/bags into the X-ray machines.ATRS was installed on two cabin baggage X-ray lines in December 2019 as a pilot project. The equipment for 10 more X-ray lines are slated to arrive from China next month along with Chinese technicians and engineers who will install the system. According to the original timeline, the system would have been commissioned in April. But all that has now changed.“The coronavirus outbreak has put the timeline for installation and roll-out of ATRS in the domestic wing in jeopardy. A committee from the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) has evaluated the two ATRS lines that are in place and we expect the approval in a couple of days. Thereafter, the system was to be installed on the remaining X-ray lines. Though the Chinese company has not communicated about the delay, we are not too keen about Chinese engineers and technicians arriving in Kolkata right now and would prefer to wait till the problem is over,” a Kolkata airport official said.CISF officers who screen the bags and frisk passengers have been handed out masks to prevent them from contracting the dreaded disease. Sources said three Chinese engineers are still in Kolkata, but they have been asked to remain in quarantine. “The trio came before the outbreak. But one of them had returned to China and came back to India. So we do not wish to take a risk,” the official said.The ATRS project is intended to expedite the security-check process that currently takes anywhere between 10-40 minutes. The facility is already in use at Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Mumbai airports. Officials said the system will allow the CISF officers to screen twice the number of bags than they currently do in an hour.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74200422,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-558039,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ncov-cloud-over-airports-rs-36cr-tray-retrieval-project/articleshow/74199543.cms
427,['19/02/2020'],WELCOME DURONTO TO CHAOTIC AJNI,"This story is from February 19, 2020

Nagpur: From A1 category station to D category, passengers too are feeling downgraded after the shifting of 12289-90 Nagpur-Mumbai-Nagpur Duronto Express from Nagpur to Ajni.

The train had been temporarily shifted to Ajni from January 8 till February 8, citing work of washable apron on platform number 1. Then from February 9, Nagpur division of Central Railway extended operation of the train from Ajni for three months, at least till May. Railway sources said the plan was to permanently shift Duronto to Ajni.

However, passengers have complained of inconvenience after the shifting of Duronto operations, or for that matter other premium trains like Ajni-Pune and Hamsafar.

To cross check, TOI visited Ajni on Tuesday morning, and found a chaotic situation and a host of problems.

The train arrived on platform number 3 and all the passengers, including senior citizens, were caught in the scramble near the footoverbridge staircase, which is the only exit from the station. It was a greater struggle for those with luggage.

“A coolie first asked for Rs400 for a small bag, but later settled for Rs200, which too was quite high. I somehow managed to climb up the stairs pulling the luggage slowly and taking breaks,” said Chandra Mudliyar (65), who travelled in B6 coach and looked quite exhausted.

“How is the work being carried out at platform number 1 related to home platform?” she asked.

“Actually, the washable apron work had nothing to do with trains departing and arriving on platform number 8 (home platform) on Santra Market side. Yet, Duronto operations were shifted to Ajni for railway’s convenience,” said Brij Bhushan Shukla of Rail Yatri Sangh (RYS).

Mudliyar was not the lone weary passenger suffering the absence of a ramp or escalators. Assanand Madhrli (83) from Wardhaman Nagar started climbing the stairs when the train arrived, but reached the exit only when the train had left for the yard. “Duronto should be immediately shifted back to Nagpur,” he said.

“If at all, Central Railway wants more train to leave from Ajni then it is better to give two-minute stoppage to trains originating from Nagpur,” said Manoj Sawalkar, Ramna Maroti.

Railway officials argue there’s a ramp on Nagpur-end. “The so-called ramp is the slope at the platform end. It depends on the coach location whether differently abled or senior passengers are close to it or far away. Secondly, how will a new traveller know the slope is at the end,” said Shukla.

Another issue is that the Ajni platform is curved. So, while crossing the tracks a speeding approaching train is not visible. Besides, the station doesn’t have an ambulance or doctor. In case of emergency, immediate help won’t be available.

Another major issue was traffic chaos. The new Jail Road, from where all state and private buses are being diverted, was a scene of chaos at the timing of Duronto arrival.

Traffic goes haywire as at least 100-150 autorickshaws congest the front of the station. This is further aggravated by buses in morning peak hours.

“Even autorickshaws in the authorized parking lot cannot move, depriving them of earnings. Many autorickshaws also block Ola and Uber cabs in the drop and go lane. These cabs stop at least 100 metres away on either side of the road, creating more problems for passengers,” said auto driver Santosh Prajapati.

“It is exam time and traffic chaos in front of Ajni station causes panic among students. It is difficult for patients approaching GMCH or other private hospitals,” said Prajapati.

“Security too is scant at Ajni. Only three RPF men were manning the entire station. There is no dedicated RPF staff and no baggage scanners. Only 4-5 CCTVs have been installed. There is also no check-post for RPF personnel and GRP men were seen nowhere in the morning. If a passenger wants to register an FIR, he will have to approach GRP thana at Nagpur. The RPF men are too few to handle huge traffic,” said Bharatiya Yatri Kendra (BYK) secretary Basant Shukla.

RAILWAY VERSION

Senior railway officials from operating department, who did not wish to be quoted, said the basic reason to shift Duronto is to give momentum to Ajni station. “We have operational difficulties bringing the train back from home platform to Ajni coaching complex for maintenance,” they said. Secondly, work on one escalator and a lift is underway, which will be commissioned by March. DRM Somesh Kumar has also asked for increase in RPF personnel.

QUOTES

Mangaluru: While Dakshina Kannada district administration has decided to hold Abbakka Utsava through a committee headed by district minister Kota Srinivas Poojari, Veerarani Abbakka Utsava Samiti is gearing up to organize the fest parallelly.

Samiti honorary president K Jayaram Shetty said the district administration has ignored the contributions of the committee, which has been celebrating the festival since 1997 to commemorate the woman warrior who fought against the Portuguese. “Hence the Samiti will hold Abbakka Utsava separately on April 18 and 19 in Ullal,” Shetty told reporters.

“We have celebrated Abbakka Utsava for many years till 2017. However, Samiti has not participated in the festival organised by the district administration in the last two years. We have seen non-cooperation of people for the festival conducted by officials. The district administration has decided to hold Abbakka Utsava-2020 through a committee of 120 persons, including those who are not in government departments. However, our Samiti has been ignored while setting up the organising committee. Hence we have decided to hold Abbakka Utsava as a public festival, and by pooling in money from donors,” Shetty added.

Samiti president Dinakar Ullal said the government has not taken initiatives for the construction of Rani Abbakka Bhavan, though land was identified at Thokkottu eight years ago and funds sanctioned. Similarly, the government sanctioned Veerarani Abbakka Study Chair at Mangalore University based on the samiti’s request in 2015. “However, the Chair is not functional due to lack of funds. Meanwhile, the demand to name Mangaluru International Airport after Veerarani Abbakka has also not been considered by the government,” he said.

Govt committee

Throgh a circular on February 7, the district administration constituted a committee headed by the district minister to celebrate Abbakka Utsava for 2019-20. “We have decided to organise Abbakka Utsava meaningfully with cooperation from officials, organisations, people and their representatives. Hence we have set up a committee headed by the district minister and other sub-committees,” DC Sindhu B Rupesh said.

The committee, set up by the district administration, comprises Karnataka Legislative Council chairman K Prathapchandra Shetty, Dakshina Kannada MP Nalin Kumar Kateel, zilla panchayat president Meenakshi Shanthigodu, all MLAs, MLCs, elected representatives of local bodies and members of various organisations.

The DC has given directions to hold the festival transparently by keeping proper accounts of the money spent. However, the district administration is yet to finalise the festival schedule.

BENGALURU: Fire broke out on Bengaluru-bound GoAir flight G8-802 during takeoff from Ahmedabad due to a bird-hit on Tuesday. As many as 174 passengers, including three infants on board, had to be deplaned.

The right engine of the aircraft caught fire, following which the plane was towed off the runway and the flames doused. The aircraft was inspected by GoAir’s engineering team.

While the airline initially said the aircraft had suffered from what it called a foreign object damage, it later confirmed the engine fire was caused by a bird-hit. The flight was scheduled to leave Ahmedabad at 9.20am and reach Bengaluru at 11.25am. However, another flight took off at 1.26pm and landed after 3.40pm.

The incident impacted movement of four in-bound flights and departure of six other flights at Ahmedabad. “There is total chaos at Ahmedabad airport, Go Air flight to Bangalore broke down and passengers are suffering for no reason, it's strange to see that in India stil passengers suffer for no reason! Ridiculous,” (sic) tweeted @gauravmbhargava, one of the passengers in the flight.

“The right engine of GoAir flight G8-802 from Ahmedabad to Bengaluru is suspected to have suffered from a foreign object damage (FOD) while on take-off roll. The suspected FOD resulted in a small fire which has been doused. All passengers and crew are safe and no emergency evacuation was deemed necessary,” a GoAir spokesperson said soon after the incident.

Nagpur: On Monday, a coach attendant and Railway Protection Force (RPF) men showed rare alacrity and honesty by recovering a purse containing valuables worth Rs26 lakh and Rs42,570 cash left behind by a city doctor within 15 minutes of the loss being reported.

Dr Trishala Dhemre, a city gynaecologist and obstetrician, and her husband Krushna Kumar, who had been to Mumbai for a wedding, alighted at Ajni station at 7.10am from Duronto Express and took an autorickshaw for home in Byramji Town with their luggage.

Upon reaching home, Dr Dhemre realized she had forgotten her purse she had kept beneath her berth (No 39) in A3 coach in which she was travelling. The couple immediately returned to Ajni station in the same auto. By that time, the train had already left for the yard.

In tears, Dr Dhemre approached RPF assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Jugal Kishore Diwan, who along with two constables Anil Kumar Bhind and Manoj Kumar Choudhari, was at the station.

Diwan asked the constables to rush to the said coach. The duo found the purse very much there. Attendant Ankush Lokhande was gathering bedrolls near the same berth. They recovered the purse.

Talking to TOI, Dr Dhemre said, “I have no words to appreciate the honesty of coach attendant Ankush and RPF personnel. I’m overwhelmed and grateful to them.”

“Slightest mala fide intention would have been enough for the valuables to be stolen. While collecting bedrolls, Ankush found the purse and reported it to his supervisor Shrikant Pakde. The RPF men too reached the coach just then. I would recommend railway minister Piyush Goyal should honour these men for their honesty,” said Dr Dhemre.

RPF personnel later handed over the purse to Dr Dhemre at Ajni police station. It had all valuables, cash and credit card intact in it.

431,['19/02/2020'],"The view on Central Vista: Between India Gate and you, signage that jars","NEW DELHI: The gap between what the planners of New Delhi wanted the India Gate area to be and what it has come to resemble today seems to be ever widening. First, it was National War Memorial that came up amid some controversy and secrecy, which kept parts of the India Gate lawns off bounds for the people during its construction.Then came some ugly Delhi Police barricades that were put up due to “security concerns” after the memorial opened. Now, ugly signboards with embarrassingly inaccurate spellings have been installed around the area by the traffic police, ignoring the aesthetics of the heritage zone.Most of these are flex signage indicating ‘entry’ and ‘exit’ points. Some tell you how to enter and exit ‘Shanjhan Road’ (Shahjahan Road); another is a huge, fallen signboard that points you away from Amar Jawan Jyoti and the National War Memorial. These boards are an eyesore and jarring to the senses. Vivek Vihar resident Dhiraj Kumar thinks so.He came with his five-year-old daughter on Saturday and felt the disconnect immediately. “For every Delhiite, India Gate is a place of grandeur and a place for family outings. So many memories are associated with this place. These boards feel very out of place here. Maybe they could have used better material. Or guided people about entering and exiting in some other way,” said the 35-year-old.Nandita Aich, a young visitor from Kolkata, was aghast. “Aren’t there any norms for signage for heritage sites? I am trying to capture India Gate in one frame but look at these ugly signboards that are intruding,’” she said in exasperation. “You see this only at rallies.”The traffic police say that they consulted the civic agencies before going ahead. “The purpose of these is crowd control. These were set up after the major ruckus at India Gate on January 1 last year. The boards are temporary and can be removed when the purpose is served,” said a traffic police officer.Experts are not convinced. Dr Swapna Liddle, convenor of the Delhi Chapter of Intach, said there’s now a huge gap between what the builders of Lutyens’ Delhi had in mind when they designed the place and how the security agencies use it today. “It was an open space where people just lounged around and had picnics. It had minimal police deployment earlier. After the war memorial, deployment has increased. All these systems were put in place from the security point of view,” Liddle said.According to her, National War Memorial is a prime example of a design and usage gap. “The main gate of the memorial is from the Major Dhyan Chand National Stadium end. But it is never open. There are multiple gates which are not operational. When a signage is designed, it is done as part of the original plan. This was an afterthought for a security purpose, an ad-hoc police requirement which was not systematically planned for,” said Liddle who is also a historian of Delhi.Urban planner and conservation consultant A G K Menon thinks the common man is no longer considered when grand plans are made. “You can see that in this whole drive behind revamping Central Vista . They are not considering convenience of the people at all. This has always been a public space, designed to be used by people. Instead of enhancing the space, the effort seems to be to cut down on that space,” said Menon.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74203081,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-132837,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/the-view-on-central-vista-between-india-gate-and-you-signage-that-jars/articleshow/74199575.cms

Agra: The 24-year-old son of a Samajwadi Party functionary was shot dead allegedly by the son of a local BJP worker in Aligarh on Monday night in a clash that broke out over an accident involving two motorbikes.

According to police, victim Sachin Prajapati’s father Pooranmal Prajapati, a former state secretary of backward cell of Samajwadi Party, was travelling on a bike with his son Nagendra when it collided with the motorbike of Amit Upadhyay, son of Ishwar Chand Upadhyay, a former district functionary of BJP. Police said Amit reportedly manhandled Poornamal Prajapati and when his son Nagendra objected, he also misbehaved with him.

Later, the duo called their respective family members and in the clash that ensued Prajapati’s son Sachin was shot dead by Upadhyay’s son also named Sachin alias Pali. Prajapati’s brother Deshraj was also injured during the clash and is admitted in a hospital. The incident took place just 250 metres away from Prajapati’s house.

Police said that the two families have been old rivals and the accident was only a trigger for them to start a fight. Following the murder, local residents set Amit’s bike on fire and also created ruckus at the local police chowki in Pala.

On Tuesday, family members of the deceased and local residents placed Sachin’s body on Mathura road near Hathras adda and blocked it for an hour, demanding arrest of the accused. After getting assurance from the police and local administration, they cleared the road.

Circle officer Vishal Pandey said that three out of the six named in the FIR have been arrested and two teams have been formed to nab others. The body has been sent for postmortem and further investigations were on.

He said an FIR has been registered under sections 302 (murder), 332 (causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty), 324 (causing hurt by dangerous weapons), 386 (extortion by putting a person in fear of death or grievous hurt) of IPC.

433,['19/02/2020'],"Yermarus power plant delay cost taxpayers Rs 6,000 crore: CAG","This story is from February 19, 2020

BENGALURU: The time overrun to complete the Yermarus Thermal Power Station (YTPS) project in Raichur district was over three years, while the accumulated cost overrun was in excess of Rs 6,626 crore, a Comptroller and Auditor-General of India (CAG) report on public sector undertakings shows.

The government could have saved this money if the project had been implemented efficiently, the Comptroller and Auditor-General says in its report, which was tabled in the legislative assembly on Tuesday.

The report, which covers the financial year ending March 31, 2018, shows how costs increased with delays. The current acute resource crunch could further delay the project and push costs up further, the report observed.

YTPS was conceptualised in 2009 with the aim of bridging the gap between demand and supply between 2014 and 2017. Work on the project began in 2009 and it was scheduled to be completed by April 2014, but it was declared ready for commercial operation only in April 2017 — a delay of three years.

The project was to be fast-tracked considering the ready availability of land, water, coal transport and power evacuation, thereby gaining invaluable savings in time and money. But the delay in completion of the project increased project costs from the estimated Rs 8,806 crore in April 2009 to a provisional Rs 12,915 crore by September 2019. The cost of power generation also increased from Rs 3.2 to Rs 5.4 per unit during the same period.

Also, due to the delay, electricity companies (Escoms) were forced to procure 22,283 million units (MUs) of short and medium term power to meet the deficit between 2014 and 2018. These companies spent a staggering Rs 2,517 crore on buying power.

Even now, the report said, the plant cannot run at full capacity due to non-completion of auxiliary works including a coal handling plant, general mechanical work and railway sidings and marshaling yard works. Another shortcoming is the failure to synchronise boiler and turbine generator packages with other ancillary works.

The report said the project was delayed due to frequent changes in designs and execution of work. Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL) was on board as a joint venture partner and also the primary contractor for the project, the report said.

Agra: The online monitoring system developed to curb cheating in UP Board high school and intermediate exams, that commenced on Tuesday, failed to serve its purpose. On the very first day of the exams, a majority of the 158 exam centres remained offline due to technical glitches. The staff at the central monitoring cell set up at the Government Inter College in the city was not able to access live visuals of the exam centres.

For the first time, the state government had directed that special cells be set up in all the districts for online monitoring of the board exams.

The secondary education department had claimed that this time use of unfair means in the exams would be virtually impossible due to live monitoring through CCTV cameras installed at all the centres. But the plan failed to take off due to improper implementation.

Meanwhile, many teachers of the basic education department who were assigned invigilation duties, did not report at their respective exam centres. The exam centre coordinators and senior officials of the secondary education department somehow managed the situation and conducted the exam on time.

According to the secondary education department, duties have been assigned to over 6,000 teachers to conduct the exam. In Agra district, 62,810 students are eligible to appear for the Class X and 56,949 for Class XII exams.

On Tuesday, both high school and intermediate students wrote their Hindi paper. As many as 6,012 Class X students did not appear in the first exam and 4,738 were absent for the intermediate exams.

District inspector of schools, Ravindra Kumar said, “On the first day, the exam was conducted in a fair and transparent manner. Flying squads conducted surprise inspections at various exam centres. No case of use of unfair means in the exam was reported. Technical problems in the online monitoring system are being sorted out.”

Panaji: Around 500 traffic signs in the capital city have gone missing, causing considerable loss to the Corporation of the City of Panaji, commissioner Sanjit Rodrigues said.

Several of the signs, both no-parking and one-way signs, have been deliberately and clandestinely removed by people, including shop owners for their convenience with an intention to flout traffic rules, he said while speaking at a round table discussion on youth and road safety organised by Goa Consumer Action Network at Goa Home Science College on Tuesday.

He cited the example of the road near the post office in Panaji where a no-parking sign has gone missing on one side of the road. Once signs are removed, it makes it difficult for police to enforce rules, he said.

CCP pays Rs 5,000 to make each signboard and spends an additional Rs 2,000 to fit each board. “It’s not a cheap exercise. We spend around Rs 6,000 to Rs 7,000 on each traffic signboard,” he said.

Rodrigues urged the representatives of various educational institutions present to conduct a survey around their institutions and submit requirements to CCP with the aim of creating safe traffic zones.

Instead of blaming the corporation, he urged institutions to take efforts and take ownership and promised support from CCP.

436,['19/02/2020'],Abducted Firozabad lawyer recovered by Agra police from Rajasthan’s Dholpur district,"This story is from February 19, 2020

Agra: UP police on Tuesday rescued a Firozabad lawyer from the clutches of kidnappers after a massive operation involving its 20 teams which traced and nabbed six alleged abductors from Rajasthan’s Dholpur district over 15 days after he was taken away. Akram Ansari was kidnapped from crowded Bhagwan Talkies intersection in Agra city on February 3 evening.

He was going home in Firozabad after attending his relative at a private hospital in Agra when he had taken a taxi. “I was getting late and since there was no bus available immediately for Firozabad, I boarded the SUV in which three men were already inside posing as passengers. After traveling for 10 minutes, the gang blind-folded me and drove to an unknown location,” Akram said after the rescue.

Two days later, on February 5, the advocate’s family received a ransom call of Rs 55 lakh. Later, a total of four ransom calls were made to the family.

“Since the gang was unknown and based in a neighbouring state, it was decided to lay a trap. After hard negotiation, the ransom amount was brought down to Rs 15lakh. After the fourth ransom call on February 16, Rs 12.50lakh cash was paid to the gang in the forest of Gadi Bajna in Bharatpur district at around 6:30pm.

“The man who came to pick-up the cash bag was then traced by 20 teams of policemen who were on 10 motorcycles and cars each. On February 17, our teams found the exact location where the lawyer was held hostage and the raid was executed,” said additional director general of police (ADG) Ajay Anand of Agra zone.

A special WhatsApp group was also made to share live updates of the gang’s movement. The team led by circle officer Chaman Chawda, with eight SHOs, 12 constables and surveillance team lead by inspector Narendra Kumar managed to arrest the kingpin of the gang, Ugrasen, 56, of Badi area in Dholpur district.

Along with him, police also arrested five more persons allegedly involved in the kidnapping including Ugrasen’s wife Urmila, brother-in-laws Rakesh, 27, Mukesh, 22, and acquaintances Surender, 38 and Lakhan, 49.

Lakhan is a history-sheeter with eight FIRs against him. “He was the one who contacted the advocate’s family four times for ransom,” a police officer said.

“Two more persons involved in the plot to kidnap-- Samundre and Rakesh’s wife Rekha-- are yet to be arrested. Our team is still searching for them. Ugrasen had kept the lawyer at his brother-in-law’s home,” said ADG Agra zone. Police also said that they have recovered Rs 10 lakh cash, a mobile phone and four SIM cards used for ransom call.

After the successful operation, ADG recommended reward for the team which cracked the case. Rs 50,000 will be paid as reward to the policemen involved in the operation.

437,['19/02/2020'],Probe confirms rape of mentally ill teen by inmate at shelter home,"This story is from February 19, 2020

New Delhi: The rape of a mentally challenged woman by a fellow inmate at the Asha Kiran shelter home in Rohini was confirmed after the National Human Rights Commission, acting on the complaints of a rights activist, conducted an enquiry and substantiated the fact of the 19-year-old woman’s sexual assault. Delhi Police have registered a case of rape at Vijay Vihar police station, and police officials said on Tuesday that the medical records of the victim had been sent for expert opinion.

The complainant alleged that the teenaged woman inmate of the Asha Kiran home was raped during her stay there and got pregnant. The complainant told NHRC, “She was taken to Baba Saheb Ambedkar Hospital on January 30, 2019 and her pregnancy was aborted. After this incident, the enquiry report case file related to the matter was misplaced deliberately. I suspect that other women detenues may also be victims of rape in the Asha Kiran home.”

She requested a high-level inquiry by an NHRC team and the confiscation of the medical files and other records pertinent to the case. She also asked for further medical examination of the victim, examination of the records of Ambedkar Hospital as of Asha Kiran Hospital and registration of FIR against persons guilty of suppression of the rape.

At the shelter home, the survivor indicated the accused to the NHRC team. The commission's investigation division, after duly considering the observations of the NHRC team and medical experts of the Institute of Human Behaviour and Allied Sciences, determined that prima facie, sexual assault as alleged by the complainant had taken place.

Delhi social welfare minister Rajendra Pal Gautam said on Tuesday, “We are conducting an enquiry and the culprit will be booked.”

Police officers claimed, however, that the case was filed on the complaint of Asha Kiran itself. “The victim recorded her statement under Section 164 of CrPc. So far we have not received any document or evidence showing the woman was pregnant and her pregnancy was aborted,” a police officer disclosed. “We were told that the girl was admitted to the hospital when she complained of bleeding. One urine test proved positive for pregnancy, but another returned negative results.”

The officer added that the medical reports did not establish sexual activity. “We have sent her reports to experts for their opinion,” the officer said. “Action will be taken for any lapses discovered on the part of the shelter home.”

438,['19/02/2020'],Rs 286 Cr allocated for Agra metro rail project,"This story is from February 19, 2020

Agra: The Uttar Pradesh Government in its Budget 2020-21 allocated Rs 286 Crore for Agra metro rail project. A total of 27 stations are proposed to be developed along 29.4 km of the rail corridor in Agra. The project is targeted to be completed by 2024. So far, the state government has released Rs 100 crore out of Rs 175 crore for the project which was approved last year.

On February 28, 2019, the Union Cabinet had approved the Agra Metro Rail project with two corridors. These corridors will connect major public nodes, tourist places and city cluster areas of the city.

According to the Agra Development Authority (ADA) officials, the Metro rail project, estimated to cost Rs 8.379 crore, will prove to be a major boost to the urban public transport connectivity in Agra. Implementation of Metro rail system will result in less traffic and better movement on the roads leading to reduction in congestion, travel time, cost of journey and pollution.

According to the detailed project report (DRP) approved by the Union Cabinet, the Agra Metro Rail Project will have two corridors which will pass through the heart of the city and will connect prominent tourist places, including the Taj Mahal, Agra Fort and Sikandara as well as ISBT, Raja Ki Mandi railway station, medical college, Agra Cantt railway station, Collectorate, Sanjay Place and densely populated residential areas.

The length of Sikandara to Taj East Gate corridor is proposed to be 14 km, which is partly elevated and partly underground. This corridor would comprise 13 stations (six elevated and seven underground). The length of the second corridor from Agra Cantt to Kalindi Vihar would be 15.4 km, comprising 14 stations (all elevated).

The metro rail will cover 1km in two minutes. The distance between Sikandra and Taj East gate will be covered in 28 minutes and distance between Agra Cantt to Kalindi Vihar will be covered in 32 minutes.

According to the sources, the operation of Agra Metro Rail Project, proposed to start by November 2021, is likely to be delayed. Despite 11 months of delay, the Uttar Pradesh Metro Rail Corporation (UPMRC) lacks the required clearances to carry out the construction works in the city. Besides the fact that the Supreme Court, so far, has not permitted cutting of trees, the project is not yet approved by the Taj Trapezium Zone Authority (TTZ), forest department, Archeological Survey of India (ASI) and some other departments. The 6km-long priority corridor of the metro rail project extends from Taj East Gate to Jama Masjid.

Panaji: To strengthen its existing fleet of vehicles and as part of it modernisation plans, Goa police have purchased 56 four-wheelers and will soon be buying 27 two-wheelers and two bulletproof vehicles.

The home department recently approved Goa police’s proposal for approval to purchase, which had been pending with it for long.

While the police department has completed purchase of multi-utility vehicles (MUV) and cars, it will buy sports utility vehicles (SUV) soon. A senior officer said that these vehicles will be given to security personnel for the purpose of escorting VIPs and VVIPs, as well as for maintaining law and order.

“The final decision on distribution will be taken once and for all after the formalities are completed,” the officer said.

In the past, VIP and VVIP escort vehicles are known to have broken down and had to be replaced. “With the new vehicles joining the force, there will be minimal breakdown of vehicles on duty, and will have an impact on the overall performance of the police force,” the officer said.

TOI had reported that Goa police, which presently relies on Maharashtra or Karnataka for bulletproof vehicles whenever dignitaries visit the state, will soon procure two. The officer said that the vehicles will be purchased soon.

The last time Goa police purchased 41 four wheelers was when Manohar Parrikar was the chief minister. The senior officer said that these vehicles were distributed to police stations, sub-divisions, etc. At present, Goa police has around 600 four-wheelers.

Yavatmal/Nagpur: Controversies surrounding student protests in Jawaharlal Nehru University of Delhi have forced Maharashtra police to be extra-cautious as the police in Nagpur as well as in Yavatmal did not allow JNU student leader Umar Khalid to address anti-CAA, NRC and NPR protest meets in the respective cities.

While Khalid, who shot to limelight after Delhi police had booked him along with others in a sedition case in 2016, was not allowed to address an anti-CAA meet by Federation of Social Organizations for Social Justice, Democracy and Secularism in Jaffar Nagar of Nagpur on Sunday, Yavatmal police reportedly restricted him from addressing a meeting in Chhoti Gujari area on Monday. He was, however, allowed to speak at a meet in Amravati earlier.

In Nagpur, citing law and order situation, the police had refused to allow the event if Khalid was to speak. With cops deployed outside, Khalid was forced to spend entire day confined within the house where he was staying in Jaffar Nagar. The police had allowed six other speakers, including a former IPS officer, Khalid’s father Syed Qasim Rasool Ilyas and former HC judge BG Kolse Patil, to deliver speeches.

Khalid had reportedly reached Yavatmal to address the meeting along with his father and Kolse Patil. Though Khalid’s presence at the protest remained a mystery, the meeting was addressed by Kolse Patil and Ilyas.

Yavatmal SP Noorul Hassan, however, denied that the police had restricted Khalid from attending the protest. He said that the cops had no information whether Khalid had reached the city or not. Hassan also informed that police have served a notice to the protest organizers under Section 149 of IPC.

Ilyas, formerly associated with SIMI, is national president of Welfare Party of India and spokesperson of All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB).

Addressing the gathering, Kolse Patil slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah for the draconian law — Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). “Throughout the country, protests against the anti-constitutional and divisive law are being staged. More and more people are joining the protests,” he said.

“Police force is being used by the ruling party to muzzle the voice of the people, particularly students. Police brutalities in Jamia Millia Islamia and JNU in Delhi have evoked sharp reaction from students across 70 universities and they have come on to the streets to protest against the central government,” he added.

“BJP’s Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath directed the police to open fire on protesters in which at least 27 innocent lives were lost. Modi-led central government wants to declare India a ‘Hindu Rashtra’ by 2024, a year before the RSS celebrates its centenary in 2025,” said Kolse Patil. “The RSS’s dream of enforcing Manuwadi constitution in the country would never succeed if the people from all walks of life unitedly oppose the hidden agenda,” he said.

“Narendra Modi and Amit Shaw are liars and both are trying to fool the people by instigating Hindus against Muslims. Instead of tackling the problems being faced by the people, they have left the citizens at the mercy of Tatas, Ambanis, Adanis and etc,” said Ilyas.

“The reckless decisions of demonetization, GST and other so-called reforms have weakened the economy leading to unprecedented unemployment and industrial slowdown,” he pointed out. “Deshaat kuchh ka saath, sarva saamanyancha vinaash” is the motto of Modi government and not “Sab ka saath, sab ka vikaas,” said Ilyas.

Similar protests are in progress in Pusad, Digras and Umarkhed tehsils. A rally was also taken out at Pandharkawda in support of CAA, NRC and NPR.

Meanwhile, a section of District Bar Association members urged collector Devendra Singh and SP Noorul Hassan to take precautionary measures in the wake of ongoing anti-CAA protests.

443,['19/02/2020'],Kesoram to raise up to Rs 1.2k cr to cut debt,"This story is from February 19, 2020

Kolkata: B K Birla Group flagship Kesoram Industries would raise up to Rs 1,200 crore through equity and quasi-equity products to reduce debt further. The company has already pared debt by around Rs 1,000 crore following demerger of the tyre division of the company into a new entity Birla Tyres.

In a stock exchange filing, Kesoram has said that a fund-raising plan of an amount aggregating up to Rs 1,200 crore, by way of debt, issue of equity shares, convertible securities or any other securities, by way of one or more kinds of issues, including public issue, rights issue, preferential issue and qualified institutional placement (QIP), as may be permitted under applicable law has been decided.

A committee of the board has also been constituted, which shall look into and decide further details of the above fund-raising. Kesoram CEO P Radhakrishnan told TOI that the entire amount will be utilised to repay the debt. “As of now, we are looking for instruments like equity and convertible debt. We shall not go for pure debt,” he added.

Kesoram now has a debt pf Rs 1,900-2,000 crore. The Kesoram CEO indicated that ideally, it should being the debt to Rs 1,300-1,400 crore level. “We may not raise Rs 1,200 crore entirely. It depends on requirements. Our primary aim is to bring down debt into comfortable level,” he added. Radhakrishnan pointed out that with EBITA of Rs 350-400 crore of Kesoram, a debt of up to four times should be manageable. On the equity side, he added that it may look for rights issue and QIP. “We have not yet zeroed in on anything,” he added.

The Kesoram CEO has earlier said that the new entity Birla Tyres may demerge passenger car radial into a separate company for inducting a strategic partner. The strategic partner was likely to be inducted in to this subsidiary with 50% stake. However, he did not disclose further about his plan.

Kesoram is setting up the passenger car radial unit in Balasore near its existing unit. The estimated investment in the new plant is Rs 900 crore. It will have a capacity of four million tonne.

Representative Image

MEERUT: For two years after her marriage, the woman put up with frequent beatings, being burnt by cigarrete butts and constant humiliation in the hands of her husband for failing to meet his demand for more dowry. But something snapped inside her on Monday, when her husband allegedly thrashed her with his belt, burnt her face with cigarette butts and dragged her outside the house, keeping their one-year-old daughter.

The woman, who is in her 20s, approached the Lisari Gate police station area to lodge a complaint against her husband. She alleged that she had complained to police earlier as well but to no avail. Even now, no action had taken place on her complaint, she claimed. She is now at her parental home, awaiting justice.

“My husband thrashed me with belts and burnt my face with cigarette butts for dowry. He said that I should either get Rs 3 lakh from my family or get a share of their house for him. He dragged me outside the home. He has kept our daughter with him and thrown me out of the house. I have no option but to approach police,” she said.

On his part, Prashant Kapil, station house officer, Lisari Gate police station, claimed, “The woman had approached us a few months ago, complaining of injuries from cigarette butts and belt. A medical was done on her and it was found that she had, in fact, met with an accident; and her allegations were found to be false. Her new application has not reached us yet and, if at all we get any new complaint, it will be investigated thoroughly.”

445,['19/02/2020'],"BJP corporators protest work stoppage, Mundhe stands ground","This story is from February 19, 2020

Nagpur: Municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe on Tuesday clarified to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party corporators that new works will not be taken up until Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s financial situation improved.

“I have seen NMC’s budget targets of last five years set by both municipal commissioners and standing committee. Every year there has been a deficit of at least 20% revenue of standing committee’s budget target,” Mundhe claimed while interacting with BJP corporators led by ruling party leader Sandip Jadhav.

Corporators from ruling BJP comprising former mayors Pravin Datke, Nanda Jichkar, standing committee ex-chairmen Dayashankar Tiwari, Narendra Borkar, Chetna Tank, Ravindra Bhoyar, Sangita Girhe, Varsha Thakre, Divya Dhurde among others were present.

“I have also stopped all works, whether work orders for them were issued or not. No money, no work. Don’t carry out unnecessary works,” the commissioner reiterated his statement made during the recently held special general body meeting. BJP corporators met the municipal commissioner over stopping of many development works.

Tiwari pointed out bhoomipujan of many sanctioned works had already performed and if the works were halted, the corporators will face citizens’ wrath. Corporators and chairmen of various consultative committees should have been taken into confidence before halting works, the agitated corporators said.

Datke said, “It is injustice to the citizens if development works are stopped citing non-payment of contributions of provident fund and income tax. It is nothing but poor governance by the administration.”

Tiwari said, “It doesn’t matter who is the commissioner, the chair is important. When LBT was introduced, the financial condition of NMC was not good. Despite this, the then civic chief assured no development work will be stopped.”

Earlier, the ruling party leader Sandip Jadhav said: “There are 112 BJP corporators and each represents at least 60,000 citizens. It is completely unjust that the civic chief allotted only 15 minutes to meet them.” He also expressed anguish that security guards prevented corporators from entering commissioner’s cabin.

Senior corporators, former and current chairmen of various committees were present but no sitting arrangements was made. It is an insult of citizens, a miffed Jadhav said.

Commissioner defended himself stating chairs were not sufficient to accommodate such a big delegation. He said he did not expect so many corporators coming to meet him. “Usually a delegation of four or five people meet me,” he said. This also angered the corporators. They said that if civic chief had wished he could have arranged chairs for 30 corporators.

Corporators maintained Mundhe should patiently listen to all of them. They also objected to Mundhe’s practice of not sparing time for corporators and demanded he should fix at least one hour a day to meet them.

“If you had spared time for corporators then there would have been no reason for today’s meeting,” Tiwari told Mundhe, adding, “Keep communicating with corporators or there will be miscommunication.”

446,['19/02/2020'],Varsity hopes to fill 80-90 permanent teaching posts,"This story is from February 19, 2020

Panaji: Goa University , which has been struggling with its teaching strength, hopes that 80-90 of its 126 advertised posts will be filled with permanent faculty ahead of the new academic year. Interviews in 10 disciplines have been completed and 18 candidates have already been given offer letters.

A string of retirements saw the state’s only university operating with over 50% teacher vacancies for some years now, prompting it to make do by filling posts on a contract basis each year.

On two recent occasions, advertisements for vacant posts had to be withdrawn after some, including the youth wing of Goa Forward Party, objected to relaxations granted for some of the posts where conditions such as 15-year domicile and knowledge of Konkani were concerned.

GU said it had sought the relaxations after it was unable to find suitable candidates from within the state. The current 126 posts were then advertised with the mandatory conditions of 15-year domicile and knowledge of Konkani.

This time, however, university officials said the candidate turnout has been good, despite the conditions.

“Most candidates are coming in for the posts of assistant professors. There is a young lot in the state who have completed their doctorates and are now suitable for these positions. We are hoping to fill 80-90 of the vacant posts. Once all the interview rounds are over, we will analyse the remaining posts for which candidates have not been found. Relaxation in the domicile and knowledge of Konkani criteria may then be sought for these vacancies only,” a GU official said.

In May 2019, after vehement protests from GFP’s youth wing, the university withdrew three advertisements issued on March 8 for recruitment to 80-odd teaching posts. GFP alleged that there was a conspiracy at the university to fill teaching posts with non-Goans for which the domicile criteria had been relaxed.

In 2017, former chief minister Manohar Parrikar himself had ordered withdrawal of permissions to fill up GU teaching posts over a similar controversy about the domicile criteria.

447,['19/02/2020'],Unmarked speed-breakers pose hazard to motorists in Mangaluru city,"This story is from February 19, 2020

Inviting mishap: An unmarked speed breaker in Mangaluru city

MANGALURU: The majority of Mangaluru city roads which have speed breakers are turning into death traps for motorists , especially two-wheeler riders, due to the absence of bright white stripes marking them.

The road from Circuit House to Bejai Jail Road, a two-kilometre stretch, has about four speed breakers, but none of these have been highlighted with white stripes. The marking guides speeding motorists to slow down, before proceeding over them. “It’s just not an issue of one stretch; almost all speed breakers across Mangaluru city limits are not marked. Motorists put their lives at risk, especially at night, if they fail to notice them, which can lead to accidents. For better visibility at night, it is required that speed breakers are marked with luminous paint or strips, but this has not been done,” said an activist.

Several accidents have taken place in the past in the city limits, due to speed breakers not being marked properly. Speed breakers with no markings are damaging vehicles and also the spines of commuters. A few months ago, a youth riding a motorbike, who was going towards Mangaluru, failed to notice a speed breaker installed in front of Rosa Mystica School, Gurupura, Kaikamba, and suddenly applied the brakes, due to which he got thrown off the road. He died on the spot due to head injuries. “Till date the speed breaker installed on the national highway has no marking,” said Sadik, a resident of Addor.

According to rules, all speed breakers must be painted with alternate black and white stripes. If required, catseye can also be used to enhance visibility at night. “Apart from no markings on speed breakers, there are no warning boards installed anywhere in the city limits. MCTP has installed several speed breakers on the stretch from Nanthoor towards St Agnes College. However, none of them have been marked white, and there are no warning signboards,” criticised Santosh Rodrigues, an automobile dealer.

He appreciated that the new speed breakers installed meet the norms set by the Indian Road Congress (IRC). “It’s a very smooth ride on these new speed breakers, but they need urgent marking and warning boards,” he suggested.

“We have repaired all the speed breakers and made about 40 speed breakers in the Mangaluru city commissionerate. They will all be marked at the earliest,” said Manjunath Shetty, ACP (traffic), MCTP.

448,['19/02/2020'],"DBA, too, isn’t registered under Maha Public Trust Act","This story is from February 19, 2020

Nagpur: On a day when TOI published on how the High Court Bar Association (HCBA) is operating without being registered under the Maharashtra Public Trust Act, 1950, it has come to fore that even the District Bar Association (DBA) is not registered under the same legislation, despite being a public body.

In fact, it’s not even registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860, unlike HCBA, thus putting serious doubts on its entire functioning, DBA members said. Many of them called TOI after reading HCBA news, alleging that DBA office-bearers were indulged in massive irregularities and its accounts were not audited since last decade or so.

Admitting the lapse, DBA president Kamal Satuja clarified that their body which assumed the charge last year had started doing audit of the DBA accounts since 2011. “For registration under the Societies Registration Act, you need proper accounts. Our auditing would likely be complete within three to four months, as it a long and tedious process. Only after that we would apply for registrations under both Acts,” he told TOI.

A senior DBA member claimed that his seniors including president Kamal Satuja and secretary Nitin Deshmukh were not sharing the details of expenditure. “DBA has over crore rupees in fixed deposits and also have lakhs with them for spending on other expenditures. However, since last decade or so, the audit was never conducted despite being a public body. The functioning of our superiors is not transparent,” he told TOI.

The differences between DBA members over their functioning is coming out in open after treasurer Anil Gulhane shot of a letter to president stating that he wouldn’t be responsible for any financial transactions, details of expenditure were not shared with him. “I’ve noticed that all cheques and other expenses are directly routed through president and secretary without informing me. Moreover, many bills are cleared without my consent. I will be not be held responsible for any misconduct if noticed in future,” he warned in the letter in possession of TOI.

Satuja defended the act of clearing bills stating that DBA’s constitution didn’t grant any power to treasurer. “All powers of clearing cheques and bills are vested with the president and secretary. The treasurer is from opposite group so he is opposing our moves. Frankly, he used to skip our meetings and didn’t used to report in office for over a week. Now, we can’t wait for him endlessly, as it would lead to delay in clearing bills,” he clarified.

Shrirang Bhandarkar, who had supported Satuja during DBA polls, expressed surprise over the fact that DBA was not registered under any of the Acts. “It’s shocking that DBA and HCBA are not registered under the both legislations despite being public bodies. It’s completely illegal and must be condemned. In absence of registration, the functioning of these bodies can’t be said to be transparent. The lawyers being law-keepers and court’s friends are respected by the citizens and therefore, they must keep everything transparent,” he said.

Nagpur: People travelling towards Butibori, Wardha and beyond will continue to face congestion at the existing Khapri railway overbridge (ROB), as it will take some time before the new one is ready. The target for completing the structure was March end, 2020.

The new ROB, parallel to the existing one, is almost ready but a small portion is pending due to delay in obtaining permission from Airports Authority of India (AAI) and Central Railway (CR).

Abhijit Jichkar, project officer of National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), said that a 105 metre-long portion of the Rs50 crore ROB was not complete. “The girder is to be launched over the railway line using two cranes on both ends. The reduced level (RL) of the boom of the cranes was going up to 330m. However, AAI had allowed us permission only till 319m, as RL above this falls under aircraft landing funnel zone and would have become unsafe,” he added.

AAI had allowed NHAI to use the cranes only between 12.30pm and 2pm, when very few aircraft land in Nagpur. NHAI, however, also needed the permission of CR for doing launching work above the railway line. CR had given them the 9.30pm-12am slot. “As the two time slots were not matching, we have not been able to launch girders and complete the ROB,” said Jichkar.

NHAI officials held a meeting with AAI and CR officials but no solution was found. They then designed a revised launching scheme (RLS) for a two hour time slot, instead of two-and-a-half hours. It was submitted to the chief bridge engineer of CR, who approved it. It is now awaiting the commissioner of railway safety (CRS)’s nod.

Jichkar said that once CRS approved the RLS, NHAI would hold a meeting of AAI and CR officials again and seek permission for a common time slot. “We will complete the ROB soon after girders are launched. The approaches of the 1.02 kilometre-long ROB are ready,” he added.

The existing ROB was constructed years ago when traffic on Wardha Road was not very heavy. Over the years, it has increased manifold and traffic jams are common during morning and evening hours, when people commute to and from Butibori, MIDC and Mihan.

451,['19/02/2020'],"Round trip to Bangkok will now cost you just Rs 13,000","This story is from February 19, 2020

MUMBAI: In what is being seen as a Covid-19-led fall in demand for travel to south-east Asia, last-minute airfares to destinations such as Singapore and Kuala Lumpur have dipped to such a degree that it will cost you just over Rs 13,000 to fly to Bangkok this weekend and even the next several weekends.

The cheapest return fare on flight from Mumbai departing to Bangkok this week was Rs 12,300 and from Delhi Rs 13,400. In comparison, a Mumbai-Bagdogra was Rs 13,500 and Delhi-Bagdogra Rs 11,000. Ditto with other south-east Asian destinations. Singapore Airlines has already curtailed its flight operations scheduled in March for destinations, including Mumbai and Cochin.

Requesting anonymity, an industry insider said, “All MICE — meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions — travellers have cancelled their trips scheduled for March and April. The cancellations have been coming in in waves. Leisure travellers are not even considering these destinations. No one wants to be quarantined in south-east Asia.”

Pradip Lulla of Cupid Travels, a travel agency, said, “There are official tourism reports which show that business from India to south-east Asia has fallen 55% compared with the previous year. Airfares are ridiculously low.” He added this summer Indians will explore other places, especially those in Central Europe which are cheaper.

The effect will hit cruise tourism as well. “Cruise to the far-east is popular among Indians. Over 50,000 Indians cruise in those waters during summer. But with cruise companies withdrawing their ships from Singapore and other parts for the next two-three months, the decline in numbers will be sharp,” said an industry insider.

Subhash Goyal, general secretary, Federation of Associations in Indian Tourism and Hospitality, said people are avoiding south-east Asia and not just China. “Demand for Malaysia , Thailand and Singapore is down. Tourists are looking at west-bound destinations such as Dubai, Mauritius, Prague, Ukraine and those in Central Europe,” he said.

Like these destinations, India too might stand to benefit and get more inbound tourists in the coming months. On Tuesday, Goyal sent a letter to the tourism secretary saying around 60 million tourists visit China every year and India should identify the source markets and aggressively market the country as an alternative. According to UK-bsaed OAG, an aviation consultancy group, international seat capacity from China has now fallen by 2,70,000 seats a week bringing the overall capacity reduction since the January 20 to some 1.7 million seats; a near 80% reduction.

Nagpur: After city police’s refusal to allow Bhim Army to hold workers’ meet at Reshimbagh ground, adjoining Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh’s Dr Hedgewar Smruti Mandir, on February 22, it has moved the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court challenging the decision.

While issuing notices to respondents including state home department’s principal secretary, a division bench comprising Justice Sunil Shukre and Justice Madhav Jamdar directed them to reply before Thursday. “It’s made clear that the court would proceed to hear the petition finally whether any reply is filed or not,” the judges said before fixing the hearing at 2.30pm on Thursday.

Commissioner of police, deputy commissioner and Kotwali police inspector are other respondents in the case. Firdos Mirza pleaded for Bhim Army (Bharat Ekta Mission) and Prafulla Shende (Bhim Army district head), while Ketki Joshi appeared for the government.

According to petitioners, Bhim Army founder Chandrashekhar Azad, who was prohibited from entering Delhi after being found in the forefront of anti-CAA-NRC protests, was scheduled to address the workers on Saturday. Azad’s lawyer Mohammed Pracha will also be one of the speakers.

The event would be held in association with an outfit ‘We the citizens of India’, that had organized a series of anti-CAA-NRC agitations at Samvidhan Square in the city.

Earlier, the petitioners had approached Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT) for its no objection certificate (NOC), as the ground was under its jurisdiction. The Reshimbagh ground is the centre of many social activities and is used for various social gatherings throughout the year. The NIT had granted its NOC subject to permission from the police department.

Later, the petitioners also approached CP and Berar Education Society, owner of the ground, and deposited Rs43,000 towards maintenance and accommodation charges and security deposit on February 15.

When they approached the police for permission, the petitioners received a notice under Section 149 of the Criminal Procedure Code stating that the application was rejected. The organizers were warned that if they hold any type of programme at the said ground, strict legal action would be taken against them.

AHMEDABAD: An elderly woman was attacked by two alleged drunk men on Monday night as they were annoyed with her as she had made a bump on road to stop rash driving in Kudasan village of Gandhinagar.

In her FIR with Infocity police of Gandhinagar, Jashi Dantani, 70, a resident of Dantanivas in Gandhinagar, said that the accused brothers — Dhananjay Thakor and Ranjit Thakor — were abusing her on Monday night.

When Dantani went out to see on why they were abusing her, the duo allegedly threatened to kill her. The duo told her that she had constructed a bump on the road which was creating trouble for others.

Dantani told them that she had made the bump to stop rash driving by drunk people. The duo then became more aggressive and began beating the woman, leaving her severely injured. Dantani’s son and other neighbours rushed there and rescued her.

Dantani was later taken to Infocity police station where she filed a complaint of causing hurt, uttering abusive words and abetment against the two men.

NEW DELHI: Even as the office set up for Delhi Police’s special investigating team at the administrative block has remained locked for the past two days, students, teachers and administrative officials of Jawaharlal Nehru University remain perplexed about the completion of the probe into the mob violence on the campus on January 5.Most students and teachers summoned by the SIT feel no headway has been made in the probe. They were called for questioning just once, and professor Sucharita Sen, the teacher who had suffered grievous injuries, claimed she wasn’t even approached by the cops for her statement. In total, teachers and students filed 60 separate complaints, with none of them translating into an FIR.JNU Students’ Union president Aishe Ghosh, who was hit with a rod and suffered head and hand injuries, rued that no FIR had been registered on her personal complaint. “Police just decided not to act on our complaints, and a few days ago we even heard a senior police officer asserting there would be no arrests in the January 5 case,” Ghosh claimed to TOI. “This makes it amply clear that the investigation is not going anywhere.”As for her questioning, Ghosh revealed, “The questions were of a very general nature of what happened that day. There was nothing specific.”Despairing of any progress by SIT, Sen, professor in the Centre for the Study of Regional Development, has approached court and a hearing is scheduled for March. “Nobody came to question me or record my statement. I have filed an attempt-to-murder case. Had I not fallen to the ground, I would have been injured more seriously. As it is, my car was also damaged by the mob,” Sen alleged. “I made a representation to the vice-chancellor but he did not even enquire once about how I was.”The professor said she could not erase the image of policemen turning a blind eye to her plight as she stood at the university’s North Gate bleeding profusely from a ruptured artery. “The scabs have come off from the cuts, but there still is pain,” disclosed Sen. She decided to go on two months’ leave to cope with the murderous attack, but the incident left her centre “polarised”. “It is now pro-administration vs anti-administration and it is very depressing,” she maintained.For research scholar Surya Prakash, a visually impaired student assaulted at Sabarmati Hostel, the investigation similarly hasn’t proved satisfactory. His vandalised room has been renovated, but the memories haunt him. “Police sat in the SIT office for over 40 days, but I was called for questioning only this month,” Prakash said. “I faced a lot of problems that day, but the cops did not ask me much about them.”Many eyewitnesses allege that people identified as perpetrators of the mob attack were roaming freely on the campus. “The people identified in news television stings were back in the university immediately. They knew they wouldn’t face action,” alleged Saket Moon, JNUSU vice-president, who was also named by police as being involved in the violence.A Kaveri Hostel resident, who claimed to know one of the students caught in the TV sting, said, “He told me openly about how the attack was planned and carried out. So what is taking Delhi Police so long to act?”",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74204242,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-145169,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-headway-made-in-jnu-probe/articleshow/74199628.cms

MANGALURU: Konaje police , who are investigating the case of a missing Mumbai businessman and his son , are still clueless about their whereabouts even after three days.

On Sunday, Gopalkrishna Rai, 52, a Mumbai-based businessman, and his five-year-old son reportedly went missing. His car was found abandoned near the Nethravathi bridge , Ullal, and a death note was also found.

459,['19/02/2020'],DANGER SIGNS: Enough water to last city for 14 months will be lost this monsoon,"This story is from February 19, 2020

Nagpur: Approved two years ago, Pench Reservoirs Drought Mitigation Projects (PRDMP) of the Water Resources Department (WRD) and Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) have remained on paper only. This will result in loss of 248 million meter cube (MMC) water, enough to cater to the city’s requirement for 14 months. It will be a bigger tragedy if a situation like last year’s severe water crisis in the Pench reservoirs arises in the summer of 2021.

After construction of Chaurai dam on Pench river’s upstream, Pench reservoirs — Totladoh and Kamptee Khairi — have started to get less water. Also, water yield of Pench river has reduced. This has affected dependants of Pench reservoirs — irrigation in Nagpur and Bhandara districts, water supply in city, and Koradi and Khaparkheda thermal power stations. In 2018, there was no water for irrigation even though the reservoirs were built for it. NMC too had to enforce alternate day water supply for the first time.

Amid all this, water of Kanhan river is flowing away between June and December.

To reduce consumption of Pench reservoirs and make use of run-off water from Kanhan river, the state government had approved Rs1,015 crore Pench Reservoirs Drought Mitigation Project with WRD as nodal agency on May 30, 2018, and directed NMC to submit its proposal. Accordingly, NMC had proposed Rs40 crore — Rohana Water Project.

Under PRDMP, WRD was supposed to develop eight lift irrigation schemes (LIS), three on Kanhan river, four on Kanhan river’s tributaries, and one at WCL’s three coal mines. The eight LIS were supposed to generate 188 MMC water. The plan was to irrigate agriculture farms dependant on Pench reservoirs from this water.

NMC draws 153 MMC water from Pench reservoirs through the year to provide drinking water supply to 70% of city areas. NMC’s plan was to stop taking water from Pench reservoirs between June and December, and make use of run-off water of Kanhan river by developing Rohana Water Project. NMC had estimated it would save 60 MMC water from Pench reservoirs.

Thus, Pench reservoirs would have saved 248 MMC water in all. The city requires 213 MMC from Pench reservoirs and Kanhan river for one year. Thus, the saved quantum of 248 MMC could have catered to the city’s needs for 14 months.

WRD and NMC officials told TOI the projects will require 12-18 months to be completed after execution begins. The projects could have been completed, and water brought into use from this year’s monsoon if execution had started immediately after approval.

A WRD official told TOI it will take some more months to start execution of PRDMP. Detailed project report (DPR) took a long time, then it was submitted to state government. Four of eight LIS got administrative approval and remaining are pending. Approval of Maharashtra Water Resources Regulatory Authority (MWRRA) is must before beginning works.

“The MWRRA has asked us to revise water plans for Pench reservoirs and Kanhan river. Again, we carried out detailed study and submitted it for approval to the government. Tenders for three LIS has been completed and work orders will be issued after approval from government and MWRRA. Tenders of remaining LIS will be kicked-off after receiving all approvals,” he said.

A NMC official said Rohana Water Project has been submitted to government seeking sanction of funds. “WAPCOS was appointed to prepare DPR, which we received recently,” he said. NMC’s project is even more delayed than those of WRD.

Due to excess rainfall in Madhya Pradesh, Pench reservoirs had overflowed during last year’s monsoon. This rescued all dependants, and there would be no raw water crisis in the coming summer. However, situation may become critical after summer 2021 if there are further delays in starting the projects.

The RRTS is the first of the three prioritized corridors planned for implementation in the country

MEERUT: The Uttar Pradesh government marked Rs 900crore in its yearly budget tabled Tuesday for the ambitious Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut rapid rail corridor, which, once completed, will reduce the travel time between the national capital and Meerut to just one hour. The recent budgetary boost for the project comes days after the Central government proposed Rs 2,487 crore for it in its Union budget.

The UP has given Rs 500 crore more than what it had allocated in the previous budget for financial year 2019-20. Already in full swing, the 82-km long Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) is expected to be thrown open to public by 2025.

The RRTS is first of the three prioritized corridors planned for implementation in the country. The other two are Delhi-Gurugram-Alwar and Delhi-Panipat. NCRTC (National Capital Region Transport Corporation) has been entrusted with the task of implementing the projects.

“The budgetary allocation, both from the Centre and UP government, is certainly a big boost for the ambitious project. The construction work on the 17-km priority section of the RRTS corridor is going on in full swing. The construction of pillars has been underway between Sahibabad and Duhai. Simultaneously, the work is in progress at other sections as well. Tenders have been floated for carrying out initial pile load test in the Delhi section, from Sarai Kale Khan to Anand Vihar,” said Sudhir Sharma, NCRTC’s spokesman.

The 82-km long stretch will have 24 stations. The RRTS corridor will originate from Sarai Kale Khan station in Delhi and Modipuram in Meerut will be the last stop. In the first phase, the Meerut-Ghaziabad-Delhi corridor will be completed with a cost of Rs 30,274 crore by 2025.

NCRTC, the implementing agency of RRTS, is a joint venture of the Centre (50%) and state governments of Haryana (12.5%), NCT Delhi (12.5%), Uttar Pradesh (12.5%) and Rajasthan (12.5%).

It is mandated to design, construct, finance, operate and maintain RRTS in NCR and works under the administrative control of Union ministry of housing & urban affairs.

HYDERABAD: Close to half the women in Hyderabad 48.7 per cent are overweight. Not far behind are the city men at 33.1 per cent men, revealed the recent National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4) report. The study also revealed that Hyderabad has raced past Mumbai, Bangalore, Central Delhi, Ahmedabad and Chennai, which have an average of 31-35 percent overweight women and 20-29 percent overweight men.The alarming rate of obesity can be attributed to a variety of factors such as unhealthy eating habits, high consumption of junk food, genetics and lack of exercise, said experts. The early onset of the condition is also a serious cause of concern. Experts add that lack of playgrounds and advent of food delivery apps are the primary contributing factors of childhood obesity.“Childhood obesity has increased manifold now and at least 20 per cent of childhood obesity gets carried forward into adulthood. These days, children consume more of junk food, order edibles on food delivery apps and lead a sedentary lifestyle. Several reports show that over 70 per cent of schools do not have a playground. The increase in childhood obesity is contributing squarely to the numbers,” said Dr Sanjeev Singh Yadav, secretary, Indian Medical Association (IMA), Telangana.Although childhood obesity is a factor in most other cities too, experts say that the reason for the rise in numbers in Hyderabad’s is due to the staple food being loaded with carbohydrates .“Higher prevalence of obesity, diabetes, and hypertension stem from the fact that the staple food and snacks consumed here are high in carbohydrates. Moreover, with the advent of the western food culture, high calorie food is easily available almost round the clock. This is especially true for the IT hub. We see a lot of correlation between people who work at odd hours and obesity,” said Dr Rahul Agarwal, general physician, Medicover Hospitals.In case of working parents, both children and parents tend to have a higher incidence of obesity, the study revealed. Despite the recent increased awareness about importance of exercise and weight loss, most people are sedentary workers, say experts.Obesity much on the lines of under-nutrition is harmful and contributes directly to diabetes and hypertension. “Over half (51 percent) of women and 46 percent of men in Telangana are malnourished. They are either too thin or are obese. More men and wome--n are obese than thin.Under-nutrition among adults is particularly common in the younger age groups, in rural areas, and among scheduled castes and scheduled tribes.

AHMEDABAD: Munaf Halari alias Moosa , 56, accused in the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts case, who was caught by Gujarat ATS at the Mumbai airport on February 9, was allegedly helped by the Pakistan spy agency the Inter Service Intelligence (ISI), to travel from Kenya to Pakistan. According to the Gujarat ATS, after the blasts he went to Pakistan five times from Kenya, where he had settled, with help from the ISI and was in touch with Anis Ibrahim, brother of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, and the mastermind of the 1993 Mumbai blasts, Tiger Memon.

ATS officials said that they suspect Halari was involved in narco-terrorism by his alleged smuggling of drugs into India and was receiving money through hawala channels.

ATS officials said Halari was also involved in trafficking drugs in African countries using his grain import-export business. Investigators said Halari also used smuggled drugs into other African countries from Kenya.

ATS officials also claim that Halari was involved in the drug business at the instance of Tiger Memon and Anis Ibrahim, who are now reportedly based in Pakistan.

After evading arrest for 28 years, Halari was arrested by Gujarat ATS from Mumbai airport on the night of February 9, 2020.

Top officials of Gujarat ATS said Halari was travelling on a Pakistani passport. A red-corner notice had been issued against him at the request of the CBI, the agency investigating the Mumbai serial blasts case.

Halari allegedly bought three scooters and placed them at various locations after loading them with explosives (RDX). One of the three scooters had explosed at Zaveri Bazaar.

The serial bomb blasts in Mumbai on March 12, 1993, had killed 257 persons, injured 713, and destroyed property worth more than Rs 27 crore. According to ATS sources, Halari had fled to Bareilly from where he escaped to Bangkok and on to Nairobi with the help of the ISI. “Tiger Memon arranged a Pakistani passport for him under the assumed identity of one Anwar Muhammad Abdul Majeed with passport number BMI 799983.

Several Anglo-Indians many of whom live in and around Secunderabad are speaking up against the decision that they say will make them voiceless.

Disputing the basis for the move, Christine Skinner Lazares, a former MLA, said that, “The law minister made a mistake in stating that the community had a strength of merely 296 members. In Hyderabad-Secunderabad itself, the community has a population of over 7,000.” She says, across the county, the community would be at least 3.5 lakh strong.

Lazares and other prominent members of the community are now urging Anglo-Indians to send in their particulars to associations that are creating a database. “We have asked people to send signed photocopies of their Aadhaar cards to our associations. This is an effort to prove to the Centre that our strength is large enough to qualify for greater representation in Parliament,” she said.

The Constitution Amendment Bill, which was passed in Lok Sabha, extended the reservation provided for SCs and STs communities, but sought to stop nomination of Anglo-Indians.

Speaking about how the community is feeling demoralised, Lauren Scanlon, president, Anglo Indian Welfare Association, said, “We have been singled out. The government cited our affluence as one reason for taking away reservations. The claim ignores that there are a number of people below the poverty line.” She argued that other marginalised communities had more affluent members than the Anglo-Indian community.

Scanlon said, “The move negates all the good work the community has been doing for the past 70 years. Fine educational institutes which were created by us, and the vast pool of teachers from community who have contributed to educating India, have produced the finest leaders, lawyers and politicians.”

Community members said the move has been a ‘unilateral’ one, and Anglo-Indian representatives were not consulted on the issue.

Gargi College. (PTI photo)

NEW DELHI: The initial report of Gargi College’s fact-finding committee has found a gross lapse in the overall security of the fest that took place on February 6. The committee was formed by the college after students protested about cases of molestation and harassment.

The panel, consisting of a teacher and a student each from all 17 department of the college, was looking into the incident. The initial report was shared on Monday, when a general body meeting of the students was held with members of the committee.

“The committee found out there was a gross lapse in the overall security of the fest and the college had underestimated the number of individuals who would attend the campus fest,” said a statement by the student body.

The students have now sought the resignation of the teachers who were directly responsible for the security lapse. A more conclusive report will be prepared and submitted by the committee, for which it has sought more time.

Further, the panel has also recommended immediate sensitisation of the college staff regarding gender issues.

“The committee laid emphasis on the fact that the ICC of the college is grossly biased and compromised, and a new ICC will be formed as per the UGC requirements by the end of February,” said the statement.

Since a lot of discrepancies exist on different levels, and the Delhi Police hasn’t answered any questions posed by the committee, it shall need some time to form a final, conclusive report, the student body added.

On Monday, Delhi high court had issued a notice to the Centre, CBI and Delhi Police on a petition seeking CBI probe into the mass molestation case.

Meanwhile, Delhi Police has arrested two more teenagers for illegally entering the Gargi college during the fest on February 6. The cops have so far arrested 17-people including the duo. However all of them are now out on bail since police could not invoke charges of molestation against them due to the lack of a formal complaint.

Police have so far identified 30 people from the video footage of the college.

471,['19/02/2020'],Westward Ho! TN Budget makes clear poll strategy,"This story is from February 19, 2020

Chennai: It’s hard for anyone to miss the hectic pace of road infrastructure activity in Coimbatore. There are six flyovers under construction, something the city has never seen in the past. Add to this the 10km elevated expressway work likely to commence shortly on Avinashi Road, which is expected to spur development on the northeastern side of the city, while decongesting the arterial road.

Similar is the case with Salem, hometown of chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami, where he inaugurated a massive two-tier flyover last June. Two months later, he inaugurated bridges at Namakkal, Coimbatore, Erode, Tirupur and Dharmapuri via videoconference from Chennai.

Not just flyovers and bridges, the EPS dispensation is paradropping projects, big and small, in the Kongu heartland that is regarded as the bastion of the ruling AIADMK . Days after EPS laid the foundation stone for the Advanced Institute for Integrated Research on Livestock and Animal Sciences at Thalaivasal in Salem at a cost of `1,024 crore, his deputy, O Panneerselvam, sanctioned `500 crore for the Avinashi-Athikadavu water scheme, another `200 crore for the Coimbatore elevated highway, besides a slew of other projects like industrial parks and agro processing clusters for the west in the state Budget last week.

It’s not without logic that the AIADMK government is piling on new projects in the western districts and it’s not without reason the region — dominated by the numerically and economically strong gounders, an other backward caste community — is called the fortress of the AIADMK. Back in 1989, the west stood by J Jayalalithaa when she was fighting an internecine war with Janaki Ammal over the AIADMK after MGR’s death. Testimony of the AIADMK’s stronghold in the region was 2016 elections, when the party recorded a near sweep of western Tamil Nadu catapulting Jayalalithaa to a second consecutive term in power.

But what is unusual now is the party’s showering of development projects for a particular region. Poll watchers say, never did Dravidian patriarch M Karunanidhi attempt to nurture just one part of TN or a constituency, neither did Jayalalithaa, but for a few projects for Srirangam in her last term. ""Jayalalithaa used to express gratitude by gifting the region with lot of ministries. But this trend of piling projects is new,"" said C Lakshmanan, associate professor at Madras Institute of Development Studies.

AIADMK leaders from the region argue the biggest announcement in the state was about the special protected agricultural zone that was meant for the Cauvery delta region, not the western districts. ""There are medical colleges to be set up across the state. The government has bifurcated several districts that will spur growth in those regions. The government works for overall growth of the state,"" said former minister Thoppu Venkatachalam.

But a cursory glance at the budget 2020-21 shows what the western belt has got and what rest of TN hasn’t. DMK men too acknowledge the focus on western TN. ""This is not just vote bank politics, but an attempt at caste consolidation,"" said Dharmapuri MP S Senthil Kumar, referring to the majority gounder community to which EPS belongs. ""But most of the projects this government announces remain on paper,"" he said.

The driving force behind EPS’s action is not difficult to fathom. First, he hails from this region and so do other heavyweights in his cabinet, S P Velumani and P Thangamani, who backed him during the tumultuous post-Jayalalithaa period. Second, the party is banking heavily on western TN in the next assembly elections.

Southern Tamil Nadu too is not far behind in bagging several projects in the budget, which is regarded as another bastion of the AIADMK. This is seen as a move by OPS to cultivate his own support base and tighten the grasp of the party in the south. Lakshmanan said such strategy to reap political dividends would not work any longer. ""It may help keep the party machinery enthused,"" he said. Another AIADMK functionary pointed out that despite announcing the multi-crore Avinashi-Athikadavu irrigation scheme, the ruling party suffered a severe drubbing in the recent Lok Sabha elections in the six segments that would benefit from the scheme.

But AIADMK men feel there is nothing wrong in the strategy, irrespective of poll victories. ""We have to nurture the region that has been backing us. Even if we lose elections, this will help us strengthen the party,"" said a senior AIADMK leader.

Ahmedabad: Last rites of the seven victims in Nandan Denims Ltd fire that took place on February 8 were performed by the families on Tuesday afternoon. While five of the bodies were cremated at the crematorium besides VS Hospital campus, two others were cremated at Saptarshi crematorium at Jamalpur.

On evening of February 8, Nandan Denims Ltd, a firm owned by Chiripal Group, reported a major blaze. While several of the employees managed to rush out of the structure primarily made of metal sheets, the unfortunate seven - who were stuck on the first floor of the premises - could not escape and got burnt alive. The team of Ahmedabad Fire and Emergency Services (AFES) could only salvage skulls and bones.

Investigators in the case had roped in forensic science experts for the DNA profiling as the only way to identify the victims.

473,['19/02/2020'],Western Ghats bird species hit air pocket,"This story is from February 19, 2020

Kochi: The numbers of the 12 bird species endemic to the Western Ghats are also coming down. The State of India’s Birds 2020 says that they are almost 75% lower in their abundance index today when compared to data available in 2000. The worrying fact is that the long-term declines are visible even among common species like crimson-backed sunbird and yellow-browed bulbul. The current trend is roughly stable but warrants careful monitoring.

Other subcontinental endemics (38 species) and non-endemic resident species have also shown declining long-term trends, albeit not as steep as that experienced by Western Ghats endemics. The status of endemic species is of particular interest and importance because their native range is limited to the subcontinent. This region is home to a high diversity of endemic species. Over 200 species are considered endemic to the subcontinent, of which about 80 are found only within the borders of India.

The main centres of bird endemism in India are the Western Ghats and the Andaman & Nicobar Islands. There are also a number of species that are widespread across the peninsula, but still restricted to India. The analysis presented in the report compares Western Ghats endemics (some of whose range covers Sri Lanka), other subcontinental endemics, and non-endemic residents.

Several endemic birds depend on shola forests, including Nilgiri sholakili , whitebellied sholakili, four laughingthrushes (chilappans), two flycatchers (including the spectacular black-and-orange flycatcher) and the shy and little-known Nilgiri thrush.

Others like Nilgiri pipit, broad-tailed grassbird and an endemic subspecies of golden-headed cisticola are almost entirely restricted to shola grasslands. Sky island ecosystems face a number of threats, placing many of these charismatic endemic species at risk. Over the past century, shola grasslands in the central and southern Western Ghats have been extensively replaced by tea plantations and stands of exotic species like Eucalyptus and wattle (now naturally expanding further into grasslands), leaving very little habitat for grassland specialist species.

Birds in shola grasslands have also shown behavioural changes in response to recent fragmentation, but demographic impacts are still not known. Aside from Palani laughingthrush (Chilappan) which has adapted well to fragmented habitats and tea plantations, other endemics like Nilgiri pipit and Nilgiri thrush show recent declining trends, the report said.

475,['19/02/2020'],Muslims won’t find a better leader than Modi: Shahnawaz Hussain,"This story is from February 19, 2020

INDORE: Amid countrywide protests over CAA, BJP national spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain on Tuesday said that Indian Muslims will not find “any better country than India, a better friend than Hindu and better leader than Narendra Modi”.

Hussain, who was in Indore, said the Muslim leaders who have left BJP did so because of “some issues in the community and not because of lies spread by opposition that CAA and NRC and threats to their nationality”. “People, who couldn’t defeat Modi ji in election, have started misguiding people in the name of CAA,” Hussain told reporters here, challenging opposition leaders to a debate on CAA.

Scores of Muslims have quit BJP in Madhya Pradesh , especially in Indore-Malwa region, calling CAA a “divisive move”. Hussain said: “Some Muslim leaders have left BJP by using CAA as an excuse, but party still has support of most of the people of minority community.”

“NPR (National Population Register) was brought by Congress. It’s a process carried out before Census and nobody has any objection to it. But it has become fashion among states to refuse to implement it and it’s unfortunate that Madhya Pradesh government is one of them,” he remarked, adding: “The entire world knows that CAA does not affect people residing in India, and is meant to provide shelter to people of minority communities in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan, who are being tortured there on the basis of their religion.”

Taking a dig at the ruling party in MP, he said: “Congress ke hi ghar me lag gai aag, usi ke chirag se (Congress’s house has caught fire from its own lamp). Congress leaders themselves are raising questions over implementation of promises made by the party to farmers and teachers.”

Pointing out that senior Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia is threatening to hit the streets on non-fulfilment of manifesto promises, he said: “Kamal Nathji is a ‘kaam chalau mukyamantri’ (makeshift CM) and working under pressure.”

On speculation that AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra is being considered as a Rajya Sabha candidate from Madhya Pradesh, Hussain said, “Priyanka worked hard towards bringing down Congress seats by 50% in UP in Lok Sabha elections. They earlier had two seats, and now they have one.”

476,['19/02/2020'],2008 serial blasts: Gujarat government moves high court to bring 10 accused from Madhya Pradesh jail,"This story is from February 19, 2020

Gujarat high court

AHMEDABAD: The state government has moved the Gujarat high court seeking directions to the Madhya Pradesh government to send 10 of the 2008 serial blasts accused from MP jail to Sabarmati Central Jail.

The state government has requested the HC to direct the authorities to bring the accused including main suspect Safdar Nagori to Gujarat so that the trial court can record their statements under Section 313 of the CrPC. This is because the prolonged recording of prosecution’s evidence got over in this case last month only, more than eight years later.

The 10 accused were transferred to MP jail a couple of years ago after they were convicted in a terrorism-related case in the neighbouring state.

The HC was also moved by the state government following the complication that arose after the MP government did not send the 10 accused to Gujarat on directions issued by the trial court last year.

The MP government did not send the accused to Gujarat citing invocation of Section 268 of CrPC, the provision restricting a prisoner’s movement outside the jail, as well as availability of video-conferencing facility available to attend the trial that is going on in Ahmedabad.

When the MP government did not send them to Gujarat, the trial court threatened to undertake contempt of court proceedings against MP officials, including the jail authorities, for disobeying its orders.

The MP government approached the high court, which stayed the trial court to initiate contempt proceedings. The HC had termed the trial court’s order as general and vague.

However, the Gujarat government has contended that the accused persons’ presence is required in Ahmedabad because their statements are going to be recorded. Earlier, witnesses were examined and advocates representing these accused persons were cross-examining the witnesses, but now the situation is different, sources said.

In July 2008, 56 persons were killed and nearly 200 were injured in 19 bomb strikes across the city. An outfit named Indian Mujahideen (IM) claimed the responsibility for the strikes. Seventy-eight persons are facing the trial.
