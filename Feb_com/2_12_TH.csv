0,2020/02/12,Abhishek gets the better of Rahul,"Saurav and Joshna advance with comprehensive victories

Abhishek Pradhan became a pro last year when he was 25-years old. Busy working in the pharmaceutical company of his father, the Mumbaikar realised that he was missing squash when he took the plunge professionally in 2019. He did justice to his huge decision when he reached the final of the PSA Challenger Tour in Jaipur early this month.

Ranked 170 in the world and seeded two, Abhishek played a compact game to defeat his State-mate and 19-year-old Rahul Baitha 11-9, 11-9, 11-6 in the men’s first round (pre-quarterfinals) of the SRFI-77th Senior National squash championships at the ISA courts here on Wednesday.

Later, the top seeds in men and women’s sections, Saurav Ghosal and Joshna Chinappa, reached the quarterfinals with ease. While Saurav scripted a facile 11-4, 11-3, 11-8 win over Sandeep Jangra of Services, Joshna thumped Madhya Pradesh’s Radhika Rathore 11-5, 11-3, 11-4.

Rahul, who took to senior pro squash only six months ago, did match Abhishek (6’ 1”) with his reach and drops. The first two games were close with Abhishek and Rahul stretching each other to the limits. At 9-9 in the first game, Rahul’s drop hit the tin and the next point, Abhishek was awarded a stroke.

Similarly in the second game, the scores read 9-9. Abhishek won the next two points — one when a stroke was awarded to him and the other when Rahul’s drop hit the tin. The third game turned out to be one-sided after Abhishek took a 10-3 lead.

The results (first round): Men: Saurav Ghosal (TN) bt Sandeep Jangra (Services) 11-4, 11-3, 11-8; Rutvik Rau (Mah) bt Vikas Mehra (TN) 11-9, 11-5, 7-11, 11-8; Abhay Singh (TN) bt Suraj Chand (Mah) 11-3, 11-5, 11-2; Abhishek Agarwal (Mah) bt Jamal Sakib (Services) 11-4, 11-4, 11-7; Harinder Pal Singh Sandhu (TN) bt Ravi Dixit (Services) 11-9, 11-1, 11-9; Yash Fadte (Goa) bt 9/16-Vijay Kumar (Services) 11-8, 11-2, 11-7; Gaurav Nandrajog (Del) bt Guhan Senthilkumar (TN) 11-8, 12-10, 11-6; Abhishek Pradhan (Mah) bt Rahul Baitha (Mah) 11-9, 11-9, 11-6.

Women: Joshana Chinappa (TN) bt Radhika Rathore (MP) 11-5, 11-3, 11-4; Sachika Balvani (Mah) bt Sushmita Panigrahi (Kar) 11-3, 11-4, 11-2; Sanya Vats (Del) bt Abhisheka Shannon (TN) 11-9, 11-7, 11-6; Urwashi Joshi (Mah) bt S.

1,2020/02/12,"AICF elections: Returning officer declares Ajay Patel as president, Chauhan as secretary","In all, five office-bearers were declared winners by Returning Officer, former Supreme Court judge, Justice Fakkir Mohammed Ibrahim Kalifulla. The new set of office-bearers will hold their positions till 2023.

Ajay Patel will succeed P R Venketrama Raja as the new President of the All India Chess Federation (AICF) after being elected unopposed along with incumbent Secretary Bharat Singh Chauhan.

In all, five office-bearers were declared winners by Returning Officer, former Supreme Court judge, Justice Fakkir Mohammed Ibrahim Kalifulla. The new set of office-bearers will hold their positions till 2023.

Naresh Sharma (treasurer), M Arun Singh (joint secretary) and Vipnesh Bharadwaj (vice-president) were also elected unopposed.

The AICF has been split into two camps - one headed by Venketrama Raja and one led by Chauhan. Those elected belong to the Chauhan faction.

In his three-page order, Kalifulla said the proposed election scheduled on February 23 in Hyderabad will not take place now.

“As the election process has been concluded, all original relevant files will be forwarded to the Registry of the High Court, Madras on February 12,” he said.

However, the opposing camp still remained hopeful.

Sources in the Raja camp said the final outcome of the election will be decided by the Madras High Court.

Earlier on Tuesday, Raja and others had approached the Madras High Court seeking relief against the rejection of their nominations by the returning officer.

Kalifulla, on Sunday, rejected the nomination forms of 23 contestants, including that of Venketrama Raja, as they did not file in person as specified in the para 6.4 of the National Sports Development Code.

The High Court had appointed Kallifulla as the returning officer to conduct the elections after the two factions had approached it after calling for general body meetings on different dates.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/4c6uah/article30798769.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AICF,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/aicf-elections-returning-officer-declares-ajay-patel-as-president-chauhan-as-secretary/article30798770.ece
2,2020/02/12,"AICF election: Chauhan, four others elected unopposed","As widely anticipated, incumbent secretary Bharat Singh Chauhan and four members of his panel have been duly elected unopposed to the principal posts of the All India Chess Federation (AICF).

Since M/s. Ajay Patel (president), Vipnesh Bhardwaj (vice-president), Bharat Singh Chauhan (secretary), Arun Singh (joint-secretary) and Naresh Sharma (treasurer) were found to be the only nominees with valid nomination papers, such an announcement was on cards.

An order issued late on Tuesday evening by Madras High Court-appointed Returning Officer Justice F.M. Ibrahim Kalifulla stated: “Having regard to the said ultimate outcome of the Election process for the Office Bearers of All India Chess Federation (AICF) for the period 2020-2023, the proposed election scheduled on 23.02.2020 cannot take place and the same is declared as such.”

In his order under “Proceedings of the Returning Officer”, the former judge of Supreme Court stated, “Form-6 in respect of the posts of president, honorary secretary and treasurer consists of a single candidate only for the three posts.

“The number of posts to be filled indisputably for each of the above three posts is one post only.

“The number of contesting candidates in Form-6 for the posts of president, honorary secretary and treasurer being equal, all such contesting candidates should be deemed to be duly elected unopposed to those posts as per para 9 (1) of the National Sports Development Code, 2011.

“There, it has become unnecessary to take a poll for election to such posts.”

“In respect of the posts of vice-president and joint-secretaries, here again the arrangement in Form-6 reveals that as against six posts of vice-president and six posts of joint-secretary, the name of only one candidate each respectively alone could be arranged. Therefore, there is no scope for a poll for election to the said posts of vice-president and joint-secretary also.”",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/aicf-election-chauhan-four-others-elected-unopposed/article30797369.ece

5,2020/02/12,BMW aims to slash CO2 output by 20% in 2020,"One-third of the carbon reductions would come from less-polluting combustion engines, and two-thirds from electric-powered vehicles, says BMW’s CEO Oliver Zipse

German high-end carmaker BMW aims to slash the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted by its cars sold in Europe this year by 20%, its Chief Executive said on Wednesday.

The pledge comes as new European Union regulations bite this year, requiring carmakers to sharply reduce fleet-wide emissions on pain of massive fines.

“We will achieve an improvement of 20% in Europe this year alone” compared with 2019, CEO Oliver Zipse said during a speech in western German city Bochum.

Manufacturers and experts agree that sales of battery-electric and hybrid cars must rise massively if companies are to squeeze CO2 output below the threshold of 95 grammes per kilometre on average.

In 2018, new BMWs sold averaged 128 grammes per kilometre.

The firm only forecast a “slight decrease” last year and has not yet published final figures for 2019.

Slightly more generous limits for heavier cars could work in favour of the carmaker, which tends to offer larger vehicles.

Ola Kallenius, Chief Executive of Mercedes-Benz parent Daimler, said Tuesday the group’s adjusted per-kilometre CO2 target was slightly “north of 100 grammes“.

But the longtime BMW rival is “not guaranteed” to meet even that laxer limit this year or next, he added.

By contrast, Mr. Zipse said “it’s clear for the BMW group that we will achieve our goals.”

One-third of the carbon reductions would come from less-polluting combustion engines, and two-thirds from electric-powered vehicles, he added.

Mr. Zipse, who took over BMW from Harald Krueger in July, aims to lift EU electric and hybrid sales from 8.6% in 2019 to 25% next year, one-third in 2025 and 50% in 2030.

Like other German manufacturers, the Munich-based company plans a slew of such models in the coming years.

But car companies must battle high upfront research and development costs at the same time as a wider economic slowdown, with many resorting to job cuts to slash costs.",technology,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/4ftcc/article30800606.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BMW,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/bmw-aims-to-slash-co2-output-by-20-in-2020/article30800607.ece

Cisco and Facebook have become the latest big tech firms to drop out of the worlds largest mobile industry exhibition, the Mobile World Congress 2020 (MWC) citing concerns related to the coronavirus (2019-nCoV).

The social media giant and Cisco have joined the growing list of companies -- including LG electronics, Ericsson, Nvidia, Sony, Amazon, now Intel, Vivo, and NTT Docomo deciding not to attend the mobile trade show.

“Out of an abundance of caution, Facebook employees would not be attending this year’s Mobile World Congress due to the evolving public health risks related to coronavirus. We will continue to collaborate with the GSMA and our partners and thank them for their efforts,” a company spokesman said in a statement on Tuesday.

Cisco took to Twitter to announce that it would not be at MWC.

“We have made the difficult decision to withdraw from participating in Mobile World Congress scheduled for Feb 24-27 in Barcelona due to concerns about the current outbreak of coronavirus,” the company tweeted.

7,2020/02/12,Multilingual robot waitress serves up fries in Afghanistan capital,"Named ‘Timea’, the robot speaks Dari and Pashto, as well as English, and her head is designed to appear as though she is wearing a hijab

In downtown Kabul, a robotic waitress named ‘Timea’ rolls across a restaurant to serve a pizza and fries to a customer.

Zahra Barakzai, 30, cheerfully receives her meal from the robot, who has drawn curious diners since she was unveiled at Time Restaurant last month.

“It was very interesting to me because it was the first robot to come into a restaurant in Afghanistan and serve food. It was nice to see the robot here, it’s kind of fun,” said Barakzai.

Though manufactured in Japan and serving American-style fast food such as cola and burgers, Time Restaurant’s team designed the robot with locals in mind.

The robot speaks Dari and Pashto, as well as English, and her head is designed to appear as though she is wearing a hijab, the headscarf worn by most Muslim women in Afghanistan.

Decades of war in Afghanistan have hampered the development of the country’s technology education and innovation sector, though bright spots exist as access to education, including for girls, improves.

In 2017, an all-female robotics team from Western city of Herat rose to global fame when they were initially refused and later cleared to compete in a robotics competition in the United States. Their solar-powered robot later won an award at an international robotics festival held in Estonia.

Zuhal, 13, a customer at the restaurant, said she was inspired, having previously only seen robots in cartoons.

“I never thought I would see a robot one day in my own town, but now I’m happy to see the robot in my favourite restaurant, it means that Afghanistan is developing,” she said.",gadgets,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/o51ao6/article30799991.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12NETROBOT2,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/multilingual-robot-waitress-serves-up-fries-in-afghanistan-capital/article30799992.ece

Introducing its first full 5G flagship lineup, Samsung Electronics on Tuesday unveiled Galaxy S20 series -- with S20 Ultra variant with a massive 16GB RAM -- that comes with a brand new Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven camera architecture, superfast charging and 8K video shooting.

Galaxy S20 comes in Cosmic Grey, Cloud Blue, Cloud Pink colours; Galaxy S20+ comes in Cosmic Grey, Cloud Blue, Cosmic Black and Galaxy S20 Ultra comes in Cosmic Grey, Cosmic Black colours.

The Galaxy S20 series comes with a 25W fast charger (S20 Ultra supports 45W superfast charging). S20 houses 4000mAh battery, S20+ has 4,500mAh battery while Ultra has a huge 5,000mAh battery.

The entire series is equipped with massive storage as standard -- S20 in 128GB variant LTE version with 8GB variant while S20+ and S20 Ultra in in 128GB, 256GB and 512GB variants.

“As all three Galaxy S20 variants come with 5G connectivity, Samsung is providing a next-generation device for transforming people’s lives. With an incredible, AI powered camera, you can capture the moments as they happen and connect more seamlessly with the people you love,” said Dr TM Roh, President and Head of Mobile Communications Business, Samsung Electronics.

The Galaxy S20+ and Galaxy S20 Ultra are the first devices able to power new mobile experiences that take advantage of both sub-6 and mmWave technologies while Galaxy S20 supports sub-6 technology.

All three devices are capable of delivering non-standalone and standalone 5G capabilities, said the company.

S20 and S20+ have a triple camera system at the rear with main 64MP camera and a 10MP selfie shooter while S20 Ultra has main 108MP camera and 40MP front camera.

The S20 Ultra takes things a step further with the option to shift dynamically between a high resolution 108MP mode and a 12MP mode, thanks to “nona-binning” technology which combines nine pixels into one at the sensor level.

The devices have groundbreaking zoom capability. The users will be able to use up to 30X zoom on the Galaxy S20 and S20+ and can experience Super Resolution Zoom up to 100X with a clearer view ever than before on S20 Ultra.

Owing to its AI camera technologies, the Galaxy S20 can capture a number of photos and videos, such as Live focus, cropped, Ultra Wide and more that captures your moment the best.

The Galaxy S20 offers 8K video shooting. When you are done shooting, you can stream video to a Samsung QLED 8K TV.

Samsung said it has partnered with YouTube for buyers to upload your 8K videos directly to YouTube.

“Netflix and Samsung are working together to put the Galaxy S20 in the hands of renowned directors to capture bonus content based on popular Netflix Originals,” said the company.

The Galaxy S20 series takes mobile gaming to the next level. With a 120Hz display, the users will have the ability to experience incredibly smooth gaming.

Samsung will partner Microsoft later to launch its popular Forza Street in the Galaxy Store, marking the first time the game is coming to mobile.

9,2020/02/12,"Samsung unveils compact foldable phone, 5G Galaxy S to fend off Apple, Huawei","Galaxy Z Flip Phone will start at $1,380 and be available from February 14 in purple, gold and black, executives said in San Francisco.

Samsung Electronics on February 11 unveiled a foldable smartphone shaped like a large makeup compact and put 5G mobile network capabilities into all of its other flagship devices as it strives to retain the mantle of biggest global phone company.

Samsung’s second attempt at a folding phone after a delayed rollout last year comes as the South Korean firm fends off its traditional rival in the premium smartphone market, Apple Inc., along with ascendant Chinese makers such as Huawei that have eaten into its sales in China and Europe.

Huawei has only released its own folding phones in China, and Apple has yet to release a 5G iPhone of any kind.

Analysts see the folding screen as a nod to fashion-focused consumers, while the 5G phones aim to give Samsung technology bragging rights over Apple.

Available from Feb. 14

The Galaxy Z Flip, with folding glass, starts as a large square when closed and expands to look like most smartphones. It will start at $1,380 and be available from February 14 in purple, gold and black, executives said in San Francisco.

Last year’s Galaxy Fold, a larger unit that folds like a book and was panned for its construction, had a plastic screen.

Both phones may have creases at the center of the folding screens. Samsung has called the crease a “natural characteristic” of the technology.

Samsung announced a Galaxy S20 phone, starting at $999 and available in March, which will have a 5G option. The Z Flip, however, is a 4G phone.

“Everybody wants it to have 5G, but with the segment they’re targeting of style-conscious younger folks, right now I think they are going to be OK,” without 5G in the Z Flip, said Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy.

Stiff competition

Samsung was the No. 1 smart phone company overall in 2019, with 21.6% of the global market, according to IDC. But it lost that title to Apple in the December quarter, as cheaper prices for the iPhone 11 launched in the fall helped the U.S. firm mark its best growth since 2015.

Globally it also faces stiff competition from Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., which was a close third in market share in the fourth quarter, although the Chinese company is caught in a U.S.-China battle over security and technology, especially in 5G.

The new S20 devices will come equipped with chips that can handle the multiple kinds of 5G networks being built out by different carriers, the first for a phone sold in the United States.

“It’s really about delivering the full potential of 5G,” Cristiano Amon, president of Qualcomm Inc., which supplied the chips for many of devices announced Tuesday, told Reuters in an interview.

It moved rear camera lenses of the new Galaxy S20 devices, which compete head-to-head with iPhones, into a squarish black panel, bringing cameras closer to the design of the iPhone 11 series. It also showed off two other Galaxy S phones. The device also shoots so-called 8K video, the highest resolution video now commonly available, and Samsung showed how 8K video on its phones could be sent to its televisions.

‘Super-premium product’

“The camera battles in smartphones are absolutely back,” said Bob O’Donnell of TECHnalysis Research.

“Foldables are expensive and very hard to manufacture. It will take time for foldables to become mass-market products,” said Neil Mawston, an analyst at Strategy Analytics, expecting a mass-market takeoff by 2022 or 2023.

“For now, foldables are a super-premium product that can drive profits or a ‘halo effect’ for the Samsung brand.”

Limited foldable display productivity will constrain Samsung, industry officials and analysts say.

Sales are seen at 5 million units at maximum this year, or less than 2% of Samsung’s total smartphone shipments in 2019, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters.

While China’s coronavirus outbreak has started straining the global supply chain and disrupting smartphone production, the South Korean firm is seen the least affected among major producers, as its main manufacturing base is in Vietnam, analysts said.",gadgets,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/7p8lx8/article30797821.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-SAMSUNG2-AP,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/samsung-unveils-compact-foldable-phone-5g-galaxy-s-to-fend-off-apple-huawei/article30797823.ece

Arvind Kejriwal and his Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) were voted back to power with a massive mandate in the Delhi Assembly election as the party won 62 seats in the 70-member House.

Analysis | Arvind Kejriwal’s campaign does the trick for AAP | Defeat of BJP in Delhi election points to lack of strong face and local narrative in States | Delay in decision-making, absence of clear strategy and factionalism led to Congress wipeout in Delhi

The UN health agency on February 11 announced that ""COVID-19"" will be the official name of the deadly virus from China, saying the disease represented a ""very grave threat"" for the world but there was a ""realistic chance"" of stopping it.

The number of fatalities from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,110 nationwide on February 12 after hard-hit Hubei province reported 94 new deaths.

A person was killed after some unidentified people opened fire at AAP MLA Naresh Yadav’s convoy in southwest Delhi’s Kishangarh village late on February 11 night, police said.

The number of people who died while cleaning sewers and septic tanks in the country increased by almost 62% from 68 in 2018 to 110 in 2019, according to a reply given by the Social Justice and Empowerment (SJE) Ministry to the Lok Sabha on Tuesday.

The CBI on Tuesday filed a chargesheet in a case of alleged bribery against its former second-in-command Rakesh Asthana and others, giving a clean chit to him and another official. “The chargesheet has been filed against accused Manoj Prasad. The investigation has not revealed any role of public servants. Responses to the letters rogatory sent overseas are still awaited,” said a CBI official.

12,2020/02/12,"Political ad spending rises, Facebook leads digital space","Facebook expected to take 60% share

Political ad spending is surging for the U.S. election, with digital campaigns — led by Facebook — accounting for nearly one-fifth of the total, researchers said on Wednesday.

A report by eMarketer predicted total campaign media spending jumping 63% from four years ago to $6.89 billion, attributing the rise to the “intensity” of the presidential race as well as congressional contests.

The forecast for the 2019-2020 election cycle covers spending on federal, state and local ads, including political action committee ads and lobbying activities.

“The highly partisan political environment is driving more Americans to donate money to their preferred candidates than in past election seasons, which in turn is funneling more money into advertising,” the eMarketer report said.

Television will account for the largest share of political advertising at $4.5 billion or 66% of the total.

14,2020/02/12,WHO to decide on emergency status of Ebola in DR Congo,"The outbreak was first identified in August 2018 and has since killed more than 2,300 people in eastern DR Congo

UN health agency experts meet on Wednesday to decide whether the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo should still be considered a global health emergency, following a sharp decline in reported cases.

The World Health Organization last July declared it a “public health emergency of international concern” — a designation that gives the WHO greater powers to restrict travel and boost funding.

The outbreak was first identified in August 2018 and has since killed more than 2,300 people in eastern DR Congo.

‘Situation improving’

WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Tuesday said he was “encouraged” by an improvement in the situation, with only three cases reported in the past week. But he added: “It’s not over. Any single case could reignite the epidemic.”

For the epidemic to be declared over, there have to be no new cases reported for 42 days — double the incubation period.

“We cannot and must not forget Ebola,” Mr. Tedros said, adding that he would travel to DR Congo on Thursday to meet President Felix Tshisekedi.

The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby has called the Church of England “deeply institutionally racist” and apologised for Britain’s treatment of black people and other minorities since Second World War.

Anglican clerics adopted a motion late on Tuesday seeking forgiveness from the so-called Windrush generation that moved to Britain from former Caribbean colonies since 1948.

The mass migration was promoted by the government to help rebuild the U.K. from the ruins of war. Yet none received documents confirming their U.K. citizenship and many were denied basic rights.

17,2020/02/12,Bernie Sanders wins New Hampshire primary,"He beats Buttigieg; Warren and Biden finish 4th and 5th

Independent Senator from Vermont, Bernie Sanders narrowly won the New Hampshire vote on Tuesday, establishing his position as the candidate of choice of the progressive wing of the Democratic party. The vote was mostly split between Pete Buttigieg, who came a close second, followed by moderate Amy Klobuchar.

Both former Vice-President Joseph R. Biden and progressive Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren had a bad night.

Mr Sanders got 25.8% of the vote followed by Mr. Buttigieg, 38, at 24.4% with 89% of the vote counted. Each of these candidates had won 9 delegates (officials who will vote for them in the nominating convention in August). Ms. Klobuchar was at 19.8%. Ms Warren, who came in at 9.3%, and Mr. Biden, who won 8.4% of the vote, failed to secure any delegates.

“Let me say tonight, that this victory here is the beginning of the end for Donald Trump,” Mr. Sanders told jubilant supporters on Tuesday night. Mr. Sanders offered his “appreciation” and “respect” for his fellow Democrat candidates and said Democrats would unite together to defeat Mr. Trump.

Mr. Sanders, who at 78, who is more than twice Mr. Buttigieg’s age (38), said he was putting together a “ multi-generational, multi-racial, political movement.” He also made a veiled reference to Mr. Buttigieg accepting contribution from wealthy donors.

Speaking to his supporters at the end of the day, Mr. Buttigieg made a pointed reference to independents and “newly former Republicans”, a term he has used before.

“So many of you turned out. Die hard Democrats, independents unwilling to stay on the sidelines and even some newly former Republicans, ready to vote for something new,” he said. “Ready to vote for a politics defined by how many we call in, instead of who we push out.”

Once again, he suggested Mr. Sanders’s choices of “revolution or status quo” were untenable for most voters faced with a divisive incumbent in the White House.

Ms. Klobuchar, who did better than in Iowa splitting the moderate vote with Mr. Buttigieg, also made a pitch to the middle at her speech on Tuesday night.

Worst nightmare

“Donald Trump’s worst nightmare is that the people in the middle, the people who have had enough of the name-calling and the mudslinging have someone to vote for in November,” Ms. Klobuchar said.

Entrepreneur and Asian American candidate, Andrew Yang, announced that he was dropping out of the race after Tuesday’s performance. Mr Yang’s signature policy was a universal basic income of $1,000 a month for every American.

“While there is great work left to be done, you know I am the math guy, and it is clear tonight from the numbers that we are not going to win this race,” Mr. Yang told the “Yang Gang” — his supporters, adding that he did not want to accept donations for a race that could not be won.

Ms. Warren has said she would remain in the race. “Our campaign is built for the long haul, and we are just getting started,” she told supporters.

On the Republican side, President Trump easily won New Hampshire’s primary. He was facing token opposition from former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld. With most of the vote in, Mr. Trump’s vote share was approaching the modern historical high for an incumbent President, 86.43% set by Ronald Reagan in 1984.

The political spotlight is now shifting to Nevada, where Democrats will hold caucuses on February 22.

18,2020/02/12,"China’s virus cases fall, world still scared","Beijing reports lowest number of new cases since Jan. 30; outbreak ‘beginning’ outside China: expert

China reported on Wednesday its lowest number of new coronavirus cases in nearly two weeks, lending weight to a forecast by its foremost medical adviser for the outbreak to end by April — but a global expert warned it was only beginning elsewhere.

The 2,015 new confirmed cases took China’s total to 44,653. That was the lowest daily rise since January 30 and came a day after epidemiologist Zhong Nanshan forecast the epidemic would peak in China this month before subsiding.

Stocks surge

His comments gave some balm to public fears and to markets, where global stocks surged to record highs on hopes of an end to disruption in the world’s second largest economy.

But the World Health Organization (WHO) has likened the epidemic’s threat to terrorism and one expert said that while it may be peaking in China, this was not the case beyond.

“It has spread to other places where it’s the beginning of the outbreak,” Dale Fisher, head of the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network coordinated by the WHO, said in an interview in Singapore. “In Singapore, we are at the beginning of the outbreak.”

Singapore has 47 cases. Its biggest bank, DBS, evacuated 300 staff on Wednesday after a case at head office.

Hundreds of infections have been reported in dozens of other countries and territories, but only two people have died outside mainland China: one in Hong Kong and another in the Philippines.

China’s latest figures also showed that the number of deaths on the mainland rose by 97 to 1,113.

But doubts have been aired on social media about how reliable the data is, after the government last week amended guidelines on classification.

The biggest cluster of cases outside China is on the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined off Japan’s port of Yokohama, with about 3,700 people on board. Japanese officials on Wednesday said 39 more people had tested positive for the virus, taking the total to 175. One of the new cases was a quarantine officer.

There was a happy ending in sight for another cruise ship, the MS Westerdam, which Thailand, Japan, Taiwan, Guam and the Philippines had refused to let dock over fears one of its 1,455 passengers and 802 crew may have the virus.

Cambodia lets ship dock

Cambodia finally agreed to let it land, the Holland America Line said. Passengers have been whiling away time playing chess and doing puzzles.

Measures by the U.S. and others to curb visitors from China have offended Beijing, which says they are an unscientific, fear-based over-reaction. There has been a wave of anti-Chinese sentiment, some of it in ugly social media posts.

19,2020/02/12,"CIA spied on countries including India, Pakistan through secretly-owned Swiss encryption firm: report","The report described how the U.S. and its allies exploited other nations’ gullibility for years, taking their money and stealing their secrets.

The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) read the encrypted messages of several countries, including India, for decades through its secretly-owned Switzerland-based company trusted by governments all over the world to keep the communications of their spies, soldiers and diplomats secret, according to a leading American daily.

According to a report by The Washington Post and German public broadcaster ZDF published on Tuesday, the company, Crypto AG, entered into a deal with America’s CIA in 1951 and came under its ownership in the 1970s.

The joint reporting project, which uncovered the secret operation from CIA classified documents, described how the U.S. and its allies exploited other nations’ gullibility for years, taking their money and stealing their secrets.

The company specialised in communications and information security and was founded in the 1940s as an independent firm.

The CIA and the National Security Agency (NSA) spied on allies and adversaries alike through Crypto AG specialising in making cryptography equipment, the report said.

For more than half a century, governments all over the world trusted the Swiss firm to keep the communications of their spies, soldiers and diplomats secret, the Post said.

The company had clients such as Iran, military juntas in Latin America, India, Pakistan and even the Vatican, it said.

There was no immediate official reaction from New Delhi.

However, none of its customers ever knew that the Swiss firm was secretly owned by the CIA in a highly classified partnership with West German intelligence. These spy agencies rigged the company’s devices so they could easily break the codes that countries used to send encrypted messages, according to the report.

“It was the intelligence coup of the century. Foreign governments were paying good money to the U.S. and West Germany for the privilege of having their most secret communications read by at least two (and possibly as many as five or six) foreign countries,” the CIA report reads, according to the Post.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/4a28ke/article27020954.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/USA-CHINAESPIONAGE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/cia-spied-on-countries-including-india-pak-through-secretly-owned-swiss-encryption-firm-report/article30800969.ece
20,2020/02/12,Pakistan jails Jamaat-ud-Dawa chief Hafiz Saeed for terror financing,"Found guilty of being part of a terrorist outfit and for possessing illegal property.

Hafiz Saeed, the alleged mastermind of the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks that killed 166 people and injured hundreds more, has been sentenced to jail in Pakistan for five-and-a-half years on terror finance charges.

Saeed, a UN-designated terrorist and head of the Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD), was found guilty of “being part of a banned terrorist outfit” and for “having illegal property” by an anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Lahore.

The ATC sentenced him and his close aide Zafar Iqbal to five-and-a-half years each and imposed a fine of ₹15,000 in each case. A total of 11 years sentence will run concurrently.

The FIR against Saeed and his associates was registered in July 2019 on charges of terror financing at the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) in Gujranwala.

Saeed, Abdul Ghaffar, Hafiz Masood, Ameer Hamza and Iqbal were indicted in December 2019.

This is the first time that Saeed, who has a $10 million bounty on his head by the U.S. government, has been formally convicted of an offence.

Legal experts say Saeed can appeal the verdict but he will be sent to jail immediately. He is currently lodged at Lahore’s high-security Kot Lakhpat jail. The government prosecutor, Abdul Rauf Wattoo, confirmed the news of Saeed’s conviction to the media.

The sentencing comes days ahead of a crucial meeting of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an intergovernmental organisation combating money laundering and terror financing, that has put Pakistan on its grey list.

Also Read Black and grey: On terror funding and Pakistan

Soon after the verdict was announced, Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Hammad Azhar tweeted: “Pak. remains committed to the earliest completion of its FATF Action Plan. FATF Plenary is a technical process. Irrespective of and without speculating on any final decision at the plenary, we look forward to acknowledgement of significant progress that Pak. authorities have made.”

The FATF’s next meeting will take place later this week in Paris to decide whether Pakistan stays on the grey list or not.

Foreign policy analyst Hassan Akbar believes that this is a significant step in the right direction. “Hafiz Saeed has been convicted of two terror financing cases and this demonstrates the slow yet steady progress that Pakistan is making towards improving its financial and judicial systems to deal with terror financing cases,” Mr. Akbar said.

The timing has brought up the question of whether this is related to Pakistan’s FATF case. Mr. Akbar says that while it is a fact that terror financing has been under the lens due to the need for improved systems under FATF compliance, “the fact that Saeed has been convicted speaks to a much wider systemic change. The hope is that this change is sustained and not back-peddled in the days to come”.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/nmkofh/article30800501.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PAKISTAN-MILITANT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pak-court-sentences-hafiz-saeed-to-11-years-in-jail-in-terror-financing-cases/article30800502.ece
21,2020/02/12,Singapore bank clears office after virus case found,"""We are also currently conducting detailed contact tracing with all employees.”

The Singapore bank DBS on Wednesday cleared a downtown office and told some 300 employees to work from home after one of its staff was infected with the new virus, adding to concerns that also led authorities to scale back an air show drawing thousands of visitors.

Singapore’s Health Ministry had confirmed 47 cases of the virus as of Tuesday.

DBS said in a statement it was informed Wednesday morning that an employee was confirmed to be infected and that as a precautionary measure it told all staff working on the same floor to work from home.

""We are also currently conducting detailed contact tracing with all employees and other parties that the infected person may have come into contact with,” DBS said.

The virus outbreak, which is centered in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, has prompted numerous cities inside China to go into lockdown, left thousands of cruise ship passengers stranded aboard their vacation vessels and led many governments in the region to impose unprecedented travel restrictions.

The air show’s events went ahead as scheduled Wednesday, as rival aircraft makers Boeing and Airbus sought to draw attention to the aviation industry’s future potential while acknowledging the shadow cast by the outbreak that has led to cancellations of tens of thousands of flights.

Boeing, already struggling over the grounding of its 737 Max fleet after two crashes that killed nearly 350 people, reported zero orders for new jets in January and forecast the cargo business will likely contract in 2020.

""We, like our customers, are trying to figure out the depth and breadth of this virus and the impact on the airlines,” Boeing’s vice president for commercial marketing, Randy Tinseth, said Wednesday at the Singapore Air Show.

""Without doubt, we will see an impact,” he said.

Mr. Tinseth said that the cargo business will likely be flat this year and that growth in aircraft sales is likely to fall below its forecast of 2.5-2.7% in 2020.

""If we’re not seeing goods travel, not seeing planes fly, it’s going to be tough to see any growth in the cargo market this year,” Mr. Tinseth said. “We see 14 months of contraction in the freight market.”

The outbreak of the COVID-19 virus has prompted many airlines to halt flights to and from China and devastated travel within the country as many cities halted public transport, seeking to slow its spread.

Asked about the impact of the crisis on suppliers based in China due to extended closures of many factories, Ihssane Mounir, vice president of Boeing’s commercial sales and marketing, said it was not yet an issue.

""The immediate impact is more a logistics impact. we do have a number of deliveries ready for Chinese customers that they cannot come to Seattle to take delivery,” Mr. Mounir said.

Still, in the longer term Southeast Asian airlines will need 4,500 new aircraft over the next 20 years, worth $710 billion, Boeing forecasts. Commercial aviation services, an area Boeing is pursuing as it weathers hard times in airport orders and deliveries, are likely to be worth $785 billion in 2019-2038.

Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia are among the 10 biggest markets for aircraft, helping to make the region one of the world’s biggest and fastest growing.

Worldwide, Boeing is forecasting the world will need 44,040 new commercial aircraft worth $6.8 trillion in the next 20 years, with after sales services valued at more than $9 trillion.

""The fundamentals of our business tend to be strong. Our customers tend to understand these are long lived assets that demand tends to be durable,” Mr. Tinseth said.

A key challenge for airlines and the industry as a whole is availability of pilots and technicians. The Asia-Pacific region will need 182,000 such personnel to fly and maintain growing airline fleets, Mr. Tinseth said.

While the longer-term outlook for the industry is still vibrant, Boeing has a lot of work to do to restore confidence after the crashes of its 737 Max jets in 2018 and 2019 led regulators to ground the aircraft, he acknowledged.

Boeing is working methodically to gain certification to return the aircraft to service, and hoping to resume production even before it gains final approval from the Federal Aviation Administration and other regulators, a process also requires the aircraft maker to win over pilots, ground staff, airlines and potential passengers, he said.

""The only way you build trust is one step at a time, one action at a time, and that’s what we’re going to try to do as a company,” he said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/60dupw/article30799837.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SINGAPOREBANKDBS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/singapore-bank-clears-office-after-virus-case-found/article30799838.ece

23,2020/02/12,"U.S., Taliban close to 'reduction in violence' agreement","However, withdrawal of U.S. forces not ‘imminent’, official says

The Taliban have issued an ultimatum to Washington after weeks of talks with a U.S. peace envoy, demanding a reply on their offer of a seven-day reduction of violence in Afghanistan, or they would walk away from the negotiating table, two Taliban officials said Wednesday.

The development comes as Washington said late Tuesday that an agreement on the insurgents’ ""reduction of violence” offer was days away. Also, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani tweeted that he had received a phone call from U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo telling him of “notable progress” in the talks with the Taliban.

Also Read In Afghan peace derailment, a wagon of hope

The ultimatum came from the chief Taliban negotiator Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, who met earlier this week with White House envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and the Qatari foreign minister, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, according to two Taliban officials familiar with the negotiations. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the media.

There was no immediate response from Washington on the ultimatum, which appeared designed to focus the negotiations on Taliban demands. The Taliban maintain a political office in Doha, the capital of the Gulf Arab state of Qatar, where Khalilzad often meets their representatives in the talks that are seeking to find a resolution to Afghanistan’s 18-year war, America’s longest conflict.

Withdrawal ‘not imminent’

President Donald Trump’s national security adviser, Robert O’Brien, said Tuesday he is cautiously optimistic that there could be a U.S. agreement with the Taliban over the next days or weeks, but a withdrawal of American forces is not “imminent.”

The agreement, which Mr. Trump would still have to sign off on, calls for both Taliban and U.S. forces to pledge to adhere to a “reduction of violence” that would lead to an agreement signing between the United States and the Taliban. That would be followed, within 10 days, by all-Afghan negotiations to set the road map for the political future of a post-war Afghanistan.

The details emerging from Washington on the agreement are similar to details released weeks earlier by Taliban spokesman in Doha, Suhail Shaheen, and would appear to give the Taliban all they have asked for.

Another Taliban demand is that in any all-Afghan negotiations, representatives of President Ghani’s government cannot come to the table in an official capacity but only as ordinary Afghan citizens. The Taliban do not recognise the government in Kabul and have refused to negotiate directly with Mr. Ghani.

Mr. Ghani, whose political future remains uncertain following last September’s presidential election, which still has no official winner, has previously demanded that the Taliban negotiate with his government. His political opponents, other prominent Afghans and his partner in the so-called Unity Government, Abdullah Abdullah, have sharply criticized Ghani’s intransigence and accused him of trying to sideline their involvement in the peace process. Mr. Ghani has also blasted the “reduction of violence” offer, demanding a permanent cease-fire and a halt in the near-daily attacks by the Taliban.

Pact first, cease-fire next: Taliban

The Taliban have refused, saying they first want agreements in place that would be guaranteed by international powers such as Gulf Arab states, Russia, China and the U.N. before agreeing to a permanent cease-fire.

The “reduction of violence” deal would call for the Taliban and U.S. to refrain from conducting attacks or combat operations for seven days, according to a person familiar with the ongoing discussions who was not authorised to discuss the proposal and spoke only on condition of anonymity.

Asked about whether Mr. Trump would sign off on such an agreement, Mr. O’Brien said there has been “significant progress” in the months-long on-again, off-again talks with the Taliban and that the U.S. is “cautiously optimistic that some good news could be forthcoming.”

""The president had made it very clear that there will have to be a reduction in violence and there will have to be meaningful intra-Afghan talks for things to move forward,” Mr. O’Brien also said, speaking at an event hosted by the Atlantic Council in Washington.

Other conditions in the deal would include a Taliban pledge not to associate with al-Qaida, the Islamic State group or other militant groups.

""We have contributed a tremendous amount of blood and treasure to Afghanistan, but it’s time for America to come home,” Mr. rien said. “We want to make sure that Afghanistan doesn’t become a safe haven for terrorism again.”

The Taliban, which ruled Afghanistan with a harsh version of Islamic law from 1996 to 2001 and hosted al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden as he masterminded the 9/11 attacks, say they no longer seek a monopoly on power. But the militant group now controls or holds sway over roughly half of the country.

There are fears that a full withdrawal of some 20,000 NATO troops, including about 12,000 U.S. forces, would leave the Afghan government vulnerable, or unleash another round of fighting in a war that has killed tens of thousand of Afghans and also claimed the lives of 2,400 U.S. service men and women.

Afghan civilians have paid the heaviest price — the United Nations says that between 2009, when it first began documenting civilian casualties, and October 2019, a total of 34,677 Afghan civilians have been killed, either in insurgent attacks or being caught in the crossfire of battles between militants and Afghan security forces and their U.S.-led coalition allies.

The State Department declined to comment on negotiations beyond saying that the “U.S. talks with the Taliban in Doha continue around the specifics of a reduction in violence.” Mr. Ghani, Mr. Pompeo and Defense Secretary Mark Esper will all be in Munich, Germany, this week for the annual Munich Security Conference, which is also expected to discuss Afghanistan.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/yag8xj/article30371903.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-ASHRAFGANI-AP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-taliban-close-to-reduction-in-violence-agreement/article30799252.ece
24,2020/02/12,Iraqis wake up to snow for the first time in over a decade,"It was a rare moment of respite during which residents took selfies

Iraq’s capital of Baghdad woke up to a sight not seen in over a decade — their city covered in snow on Tuesday.

It was a rare moment of respite during which residents took selfies and children played in parks, lobbing snowballs before the fluffy flakes disappeared and the white cover dissolved into grey puddles.

Iraq has grappled with months of unrest, beginning with an anti-government protest movement which engulfed the country in October, and the U.S. killing of a top Iranian general in Baghdad in early January, which brought the region close to war amid soaring U.S.-Iran tensions.

Over 500 people have died in the protests as security forces used live rounds and tear gas to disperse crowds in Baghdad and southern Iraq. The movement is entering a critical phase, after influential Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, who initially threw his weight behind demonstrators, withdrew it. Tensions have since then seethed between protesters and al-Sadr’s followers.

In the city’s central Tahrir Square, the epicenter of the protest movement, protesters took a moment to observe the snowfall and dusted the flakes off their sit-in tents.

""Thank God it is snowing this morning,” said Aymen Ahmed, a protester. “The atmosphere is beautiful ... the people are very happy because this is the first time snow falls in Iraq.”

Annual snowfall is common in the mountainous northern region of Iraq, but very rare in Baghdad. The last time the capital saw snow was in 2008.

By midday, the snow had melted in most parts of the city. “It was a beautiful moment,” said Mariam, another protester. She gave only her first name, fearing reprisals like most anti-government protesters.

""Now life goes back to normal,” she added.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/uqbh9x/article30799159.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IRAQSNOW,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/iraqis-wake-up-to-snow-for-the-first-time-in-over-a-decade/article30799160.ece
25,2020/02/12,Two patients in Russia with COVID-19 have fully recovered,"On Tuesday, a hospital in the Tyumen region in western Siberia discharged a female student.

Two Chinese nationals hospitalised with COVID-19 in Russia last month have fully recovered from the disease and were discharged from hospitals this week, officials said.

A tourist from China hospitalised in the Zabaykalye region in eastern Siberia was discharged on Wednesday after a series of tests revealed that he was no longer infected. He is “completely healthy and poses no danger to people around him,” local health officials said.

On Tuesday, a hospital in the Tyumen region in western Siberia discharged a female student who was also diagnosed with COVID-19. Both patients, officials said, suffered from a mild form of the disease.

Russia reported two confirmed cases on Jan. 31. Since the start of the coronavirus outbreak, the country’s government has halted most of its air traffic to China. All trains connecting Russia to China and North Korea have been suspended, and the Russian land border with China and Mongolia is closed.

Moscow has temporarily stopped issuing work visas to Chinese citizens and Chinese students who had left for the Lunar New Year vacation have been asked not to resume their studies in Russian universities until March 1.

26,2020/02/12,Joe Biden looks to South Carolina to resurrect his campaign,"""We just heard from the first two of 50 states. Two of them,” Mr. Biden said. “That’s the opening bell, not the closing bell.”

Joe Biden brought his wounded presidential campaign to South Carolina on Tuesday, staking his hopes for a comeback on the loyalty of black voters in the state after a dismal finish in the New Hampshire primary magnified his disappointing finish in Iowa.

“I know this is going to be the fight of my life,” Mr. Biden told about 200 enthusiastic supporters gathered near the South Carolina Capitol to hear the 77-year-old former vice president deliver an emotional appeal. Mr. Biden eagerly looked ahead as the nomination fight moves beyond the overwhelmingly white opening states to Nevada, South Carolina and a Super Tuesday slate where African Americans and Latinos will hold considerable sway.

""We just heard from the first two of 50 states. Two of them,” Mr. Biden said. “That’s the opening bell, not the closing bell.”

The candidate argued that no Democratic nominee has succeeded without significant support from African Americans, the core of his base in a fractured primary field. The electorate in South Carolina’s Feb. 29 primary, the first in the South, is expected to be more than 60% black and could approach 70%, according to state party leaders.

Still, there is no Democratic precedent for the kind of comeback Mr. Biden is trying to pull off. No Democrat has claimed the nomination in the modern primary system without winning either Iowa or New Hampshire.

Mr. Biden’s campaign had said for months they didn’t have to win either state, but that strategy didn’t necessarily consider finishing so far off the pace. In recent days, Mr. Biden’s donor base has since grown nervous, raising questions about his financial viability if he doesn’t rebound quickly.

Mr. Biden boarded a private jet in Manchester on Tuesday evening – even before New Hampshire primary polls closed – ending an eight-day whirlwind that saw the former vice president go from a national front-runner for the nomination to a battered underdog.

In his remarks Tuesday night, Mr. Biden praised Iowa’s and New Hampshire’s opening roles, but argued that 99.9% of African Americans and 99.8% of Latinos haven’t yet had the opportunity to cast Democratic primary ballots.

""Do not let anyone take this election away from you,” he said in a speech that touted his deep political ties to South Carolina and to the black community.

Mr. Biden mentioned his relationship with South Carolina’s lone Democratic congressman, Jim Clyburn, the highest ranking black lawmaker on Capitol Hill. He noted his service as President Barack Obama’s top lieutenant. He recalled meeting South African leader Nelson Mandela. And he promised black Americans a seat at the table in the Oval Office.

""Too often your loyalty, your commitment, your support for this party has been taken for granted,” he said. “I give you my word as a Biden that I never, ever, ever will.”

Mr. Biden was introduced by his campaign co-chairman, Cedric Richmond, a Louisiana congressman and former chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus. Richmond recalled for the crowd the first question he asked himself when deciding who to support – “Who do I trust?”

South Carolina has been a springboard for the nominee before. Four years ago, Hillary Clinton and Mr. Sanders battled to a draw in Iowa and Mr. Sanders beat her in New Hampshire, prompting a round of hand-wringing from some party leaders and national media. Ms. Clinton went on to crush Mr. Sanders in South Carolina and the diverse states that immediately followed, building a delegate lead he could never overcome. Eight years earlier, it was Mr. Obama, the nation’s first black president, who used the black vote to put distance between his campaign and Ms. Clinton.

This isn’t a two-person race, though, and Mr. Biden is looking merely to return to contender status. But 2020 already has proven unusual, with no candidate having demonstrated the ability to build a broad coalition across the party’s racial, ethnic and ideological factions. Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg achieved a split decision in Iowa and Sanders barely edged out Mr. Buttigieg in New Hampshire.

Mr. Sanders, a Vermont senator and democratic socialist, has paltry support among the party’s establishment core, and for months he has trailed Mr. Biden in support among non-white Democrats. Mr. Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has struggled to corral meaningful support from black or Latino voters.

The same is true for Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who finished just behind Mr. Biden in Iowa but finished third in New Hampshire.

Mr. Biden does have competition for the black vote in South Carolina. Billionaire businessman Tom Steyer has spent large sums on advertising, while Mr. Biden’s financial struggles have left him largely absent from the state’s airwaves. The former vice president will depend on voters like Tina Herbert, a Columbia attorney who was eager to see him Tuesday night.

""I thought it was important that I showed my face and showed my support for him tonight,” she said. “I’ve been with him since Day One.”

""We are not really receptive to outsiders, so we don’t listen to their opinions, even when we should, good or bad,” she said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/a3xavt/article30798863.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ELECTION2020JOEBIDEN1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/joe-biden-looks-to-south-carolina-to-resurrect-his-campaign/article30798864.ece
27,2020/02/12,Bernie Sanders narrowly beats Buttigieg in New Hampshire Democratic primary as Biden lags badly,"It was also a good night for Senator Amy Klobuchar, who rode a wave of momentum from a strong debate on Friday into a third-place finish.

Bernie Sanders narrowly won New Hampshire's Democratic presidential primary on Tuesday, solidifying his front-runner status in the White House race and dealing a setback to moderate rival Joe Biden, who finished in a disappointing fifth place.

Moderate Pete Buttigieg, the 38-year-old former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, finished a close second after edging out Mr. Sanders in last week's chaotic and disputed first nominating contest in Iowa. Both campaigns have asked for a partial recanvass of Iowa results.

Mr. Sanders, a progressive senator from neighboring Vermont, prevailed after fending off attacks from rivals who warned his far-left views would lead the party to defeat in the Nov. 3 election against Republican President Donald Trump.

“This victory here is the beginning of the end for Donald Trump,” Mr. Sanders told supporters in Manchester, New Hampshire.

Mr. Sanders' supporters booed when Mr. Buttigieg's post-primary speech was shown on screens, and chanted “Wall Street Pete.”

It was also a good night for Senator Amy Klobuchar, who rode a wave of momentum from a strong debate on Friday into a third-place finish.

Mr. Biden, the former vice president who was once the front-runner in the Democratic race, limped to his second consecutive poor finish after placing fourth in Iowa. He is certain to face growing questions about his campaign's viability and his ability to consolidate moderate support against a surging Buttigieg and Klobuchar.

Mr. Biden fared poorly in two previous runs for president before winning election in 2008 as President Barack Obama's No. 2. He hopes to stay afloat this time until the Feb. 29 contest in South Carolina and a series of contests in other Southern States on Super Tuesday on March 3, where his support among African Americans will be a strength.

Without strong showings there, his race could be over.

'It ain’t over’

“It ain't over, man. It's just getting started,” Mr. Biden told supporters in South Carolina.

U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a progressive ally of Mr. Sanders who was considered a favorite in New Hampshire three months ago, also had a bad night. She finished fourth, and also will face questions about her continued viability.

For Mr. Sanders, who won New Hampshire in 2016 with 60% of the vote against eventual nominee Hillary Clinton, the results offered new momentum but not the overwhelming win he had hoped for given his history in the State. Exit polls showed he only won about two-thirds of his 2016 primary supporters.

The results began to thin the field of Democrats seeking the right to take on Mr. Trump in November, with businessman Andrew Yang and Senator Michael Bennet dropping out after it became clear they would finish well out of the running. CBS News reported that Deval Patrick, the former Massachusetts governor, would drop out on Wednesday.

Democratic voters in New Hampshire chose a candidate from a ballot with 33 names, including those who dropped out weeks ago. But it did not include former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a billionaire who is not competing in any states before the 14 Super Tuesday primaries on March 3.

Mr. Bloomberg has been rising in polls, aided by his massive personal spending on campaign advertising, and is betting on doing well in bigger states such as California and Texas.

In New Hampshire, turnout was approaching the record 287,000 who cast ballots in the 2008 New Hampshire Democratic primary, when the battle between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton energized the party. That could ease Democratic concerns about the smaller-than-expected turnout in Iowa last week.

Democrats in New Hampshire and in the other States that will vote in the state-by-state battle for the Democratic nomination are trying to decide whether they want to pick a moderate like Buttigieg, Klobuchar, Bloomberg or Biden, or progressive leaders like Sanders and Warren, who represents neighboring Massachusetts.

After Iowa and New Hampshire, small and rural states with predominantly white populations, the race will move on to more diverse battlegrounds that pose new tests.

Up next will be the Feb. 22 caucuses in Nevada, which has a large Latino population, and the Feb. 29 primary in South Carolina, which has a large African-American population.

“We have beaten the odds every step of the way,” Ms. Klobuchar told supporters in Concord, New Hampshire. “Because of you, we are taking this campaign to Nevada. We are going to South Carolina. And we are taking this message of unity to the country.”

Ms. Warren said it would be a long, drawn-out battle for the nomination and the race was far from over. She decried the party's infighting and called for unity as the contest moves on.

“These tactics might work if you're willing to burn down the party to be the last man standing,” Ms. Warren said. “We win when we come together.”

The late attacks on Sanders in recent weeks were a shift in tactics for his rivals, who had mostly ignored him out of worry about a backlash from his fervent cadre of supporters and out of doubts that Sanders could expand his base.

Mr. Buttigieg, who would be the first openly gay U.S. president if elected, still faces questions about what polls show is his weakness with African-American voters, one of the most loyal and vital Democratic voting blocs.

He also decried the growing polarization of politics and the Democratic infighting of recent weeks.

“In this election season, weve been told by some that you must either be for revolution or you are for the status quo. But where does that leave the rest of us?” Mr. Buttigieg asked supporters in Nashua, New Hampshire.

“A politics of my way or the highway is a road to re-electing Donald Trump,” he said.

On the Republican side, Mr. Trump easily won the State's presidential primary, defeating rival William Weld, the former governor of neighboring Massachusetts.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/4ctc43/article30798434.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BERNIE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/bernie-sanders-narrowly-beats-buttigieg-in-new-hampshire-democratic-primary-as-biden-lags-badly/article30798435.ece
28,2020/02/12,Nepal shuts resort where eight Indian tourists died,"Tragedy struck a group of 15 tourists from Kerala when eight of them died on January 21 due to possible asphyxiation after they fell unconscious probably due to a gas leak from a heater in their room at a mountainous resort in Makwanpur district.

Nepal has suspended the licence of a mountainous resort for three months due to poor security management and managerial weakness at the hotel where eight Indian tourists, including four minors, died of possible asphyxiation, according to media reports.

Tragedy struck a group of 15 tourists from Kerala when eight of them died on January 21 due to possible asphyxiation after they fell unconscious probably due to a gas leak from a heater in their room at a mountainous resort in Makwanpur district.

The tourists were airlifted to HAMS hospital here where they were pronounced dead on arrival. Makwanpur police said the victims might have fallen unconscious due to asphyxiation.

The Department of Tourism on Sunday imposed a ban on the operation of Daman-based Everest Panorama Resort for three months based on the report submitted by a probe committee formed to investigate the death of the Indian tourists from Kerala, the Kathmandu Post reported on Tuesday.

The department decided to shut down the resort as the report submitted by a probe committee pointed out poor security management and managerial weakness at the resort for the incident, it said.

The Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation had formed the probe committee under Surendra Thapa, the director of the Department of Tourism. After a field inspection, the committee had submitted its report a few days ago, pointing to the shortcomings of the resort.

During the investigation, the committee found the resort had not been following the recommended safety measures and was providing substandard services to its guests, The Himalayan Times reported.

Moreover, the committee discovered that the resort had not fulfilled the criteria set by DoT to be categorised a ‘resort’, it said.

Mira Acharya, director of DoT was quoted as saying by the report that the resort’s operations have been halted as per Section 15 of Tourism Act-1979.

“If the resort owner wishes to resume services after three months of suspension, the resort should be upgraded as per the Hotel, Lodge, Restaurant, Bar and Tourist Guide Rules-1981 and also meet the criteria mentioned in a notice published in the Nepal Gazette under the title ‘Hotel Classification and Criteria’,” Acharya said.

She added that the resort would also have to undergo the Environment Impact Assessment to get the permission from DoT to resume operation.

Meanwhile, the resort management has said that they will work towards meeting the standards fixed by the department and run the resort efficiently.

“We will work towards meeting the standards fixed by the department and run the resort efficiently. We are saddened by the tragic incident. We will ensure that such incidents don’t occur in the future, said Sudesh Gautam, the operator of the resort was quoted as saying by the Kathmandu Post.

The group, after travelling to Pokhara -- a popular mountainous tourist destination -- was on their way back home and stayed at Everest Panorama Resort in Daman.

Those who were killed were Praveen Krishnan Nair, his wife Saranya Sasi and their three children and Ranjith Kumar Adatholath Punathil, his wife Indu Lakshmi Peethambaran Ragalatha and their son.

Everest Panorama Resort was established 28 years ago in Daman Simbhajyang area, a tourist destination in Bagmati Province. The tourist numbers, according to Thaha Hotel Association, have plunged after the tragic accident of January 27.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/401zup/article30614715.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NEPAL-INDIATOURISTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/nepal-shuts-resort-where-8-indian-tourists-died/article30798221.ece
29,2020/02/12,Businessman Andrew Yang announces withdrawal from Democratic presidential race,"Son of Taiwanese immigrants, he was bidding to be the country's first Asian-American president

Andrew Yang, an entrepreneur whose unlikely White House bid evolved into a serious campaign, pulled out of the Democratic presidential race on Tuesday after New Hampshire delivered him a second straight poor showing.

Yang, 45, who ran for president despite having no political background, surprised many observers by qualifying for debates and remaining in the contest longer than some veteran politicians.

The Ivy League-educated son of Taiwanese immigrants, who was bidding to be the country's first Asian-American president, launched his long-shot candidacy in 2017 as a virtual unknown.

Yang's signature proposal, a universal basic income that would pay every American $1,000 a month, was his answer to the ”fourth industrial revolution,” the rise of automation that he said destroyed millions of manufacturing jobs and, as a consequence, paved the way for Donald Trump's 2016 election.

Yang told supporters in New Hampshire on Tuesday night he would support whoever wins the Democratic nomination to take on Trump in November, while continuing to push his own message. “This is just the starting line. This campaign has awakened something fundamental in this country and ourselves,” he said.

On the trail, Yang warned that automation would hit major industries like retail, customer service and trucking. He noted that technology companies were paying almost no taxes despite profiting from people's personal data, and vowed to impose new taxes on tech giants to finance his “Freedom Dividend.”

Supporters said they were drawn to Yang's diagnosis of the country's problems, saying it resonated much more than a typical politician's speech. His devoted followers, fueled in part by his campaign's savvy use of social media, called themselves the ”Yang Gang.”

'Make America Think Harder'

He had long pointed to New Hampshire as a natural place for him to succeed given its large proportion of independent voters. But the results on Tuesday — and last week in Iowa — made it unlikely he could raise enough money to continue campaigning.

As senators and governors saw their campaigns fizzle in what was the largest field of presidential candidates in U.S. history, Yang qualified for almost every debate thanks to a broad donor base and solid polling figures. He was fond of noting he was the “opposite” of Donald Trump: ”An Asian guy who likes math.”

He often sported a MATH hat, which also stood for “Make America Think Harder.” He was a funny and amiable presence on the campaign trail, cracking jokes and occasionally breaking into dance.

At a CNN town hall in New Hampshire last week, Yang got several questions from undecided voters until he finally smiled and said, “One of you should just pretend to be for me,” drawing laughs from the crowd.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/gy606k/article30797946.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ELECTION2020ANDREWYANG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/businessman-andrew-yang-announces-withdrawal-from-democratic-presidential-race/article30797947.ece
30,2020/02/12,Japan cruise ship virus cases jump to 175 including quarantine officer,"The Diamond Princess cruise ship was placed in quarantine for two weeks upon arriving in Yokohama, south of Tokyo, on Feb. 3, after a man who disembarked in Hong Kong was diagnosed with the virus.

Another 39 people have tested positive for the coronavirus on the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan as well as one quarantine officer, bringing the total to 175, the health ministry said on Wednesday.

The Diamond Princess was placed in quarantine for two weeks upon arriving in Yokohama, south of Tokyo, on Feb. 3, after a man who disembarked in Hong Kong was diagnosed with the virus.

About 3,700 people are aboard the ship, which usually has a crew of 1,100 and a passenger capacity of 2,670.

The ministry said tests are being conducted for others who are deemed to need them and it will announce the results later.

The U.K.-flagged Diamond Princess is managed by Princess Cruise Lines, one of the world's largest cruise lines and a unit of Carnival Corp.

The government was considering allowing elderly and those with chronic illnesses to disembark before the Feb. 19 target date for ending the quarantine, some media reported, but added it would take time to figure out where they could be sent.

As of last week, about 80% of the passengers were aged 60 or over, with 215 in their 80s and 11 in the 90s, the English-language Japan Times newspaper reported.

Kyodo news agency, citing the health ministry, said that of the 39 cases, 10 were crew, 10 were Japanese nationals and the others were from 11 countries including the United States and China.

31,2020/02/12,"COVID-19: death toll reaches 1,110 in China","There are now more than 44,200 confirmed cases across China

The number of fatalities from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,110 nationwide on February 12 after hard-hit Hubei province reported 94 new deaths.

In its daily update, Hubei's health commission also confirmed another 1,638 new cases in the central province, where the outbreak emerged in December. There are now more than 44,200 confirmed cases across China, based on previously released figures from the government.

The new virus is believed to have emerged last year in a market that sells wild animals in Hubei's capital Wuhan, the city at the centre of the outbreak.

The virus was officially named ""COVID-19"" at a conference in Geneva held by the World Health Organization, where the body's chief said countries had a chance of stopping its global spread.

WHO head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Tuesday that although 99% of cases are in China, where it remains ""very much an emergency,"" it also ""holds a very grave threat for the rest of the world.""

He urged countries to share data in order to further research the disease.

32,2020/02/12,WHO names deadly viral disease from China as 'COVID-19',"Addressing scientists at the first international conference on combating the virus, WHO chief Tedros warned that the virus was a ""very grave threat”

The UN health agency on February 11 announced that ""COVID-19"" will be the official name of the deadly virus disease from China, saying the disease represented a ""very grave threat"" for the world but there was a ""realistic chance"" of stopping it.

""We now have a name for the disease and it's COVID-19,"" World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters in Geneva. Tedros said that ""co"" stands for ""corona"", ""vi"" for ""virus"" and ""d"" for ""disease"", while ""19"" was for the year, as the outbreak was first identified on December 31.

Tedros said the name had been chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location, animal species or group of people in line with international recommendations for naming aimed at preventing stigmatisation.

WHO had earlier given the virus the temporary name of ""2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease"" and China's National Health Commission this week said it was temporarily calling it ""novel coronavirus pneumonia"" or NCP.

Under a set of guidelines issued in 2015, WHO advises against using place names such as Ebola and Zika — where those diseases were first identified and which are now inevitably linked to them in the public mind. More general names such as ""Middle East Respiratory Syndrome"" or ""Spanish flu"" are also now avoided as they can stigmatise entire regions or ethnic groups.

WHO also notes that using animal species in the name can create confusion, such as in 2009 when H1N1 was popularly referred to as ""swine flu"". This had a major impact on the pork industry even though the disease was being spread by people rather than pigs.

People's names — usually the scientists who identified the disease — are also banned, as are ""terms that incite undue fear"" such as ""unknown"" or ""fatal"", the WHO said.

The virus has killed more than 1,000 people, infected over 42,000 and reached some 25 countries, with the WHO declaring a global health emergency.

Addressing scientists at the first international conference on combating the virus earlier on Tuesday, Tedros warned that the virus was a ""very grave threat"". ""Viruses can have more powerful consequences than any terrorist action,"" he told reporters later.

About 400 scientists were taking part in the two-day international meeting in Geneva called to review how the virus is transmitted and possible vaccines against it. ""We are not defenceless,"" Tedros said, adding: ""If we invest now... we have a realistic chance of stopping this outbreak.""

Participants will also discuss the source of the virus, which is thought to have originated in bats and reached humans via other ""intermediary"" species such as snakes or pangolins.

WHO sent an advance team to China this week for an international mission to examine the epidemic.

Roadmap for research

No specific treatment or vaccine against the virus exists, and WHO has repeatedly urged countries to share data in order to further research into the disease.

""That is especially true in relation to sharing of samples and sequences. To defeat this outbreak, we need open and equitable sharing, according to the principles of fairness and equity,"" Tedros told the scientific conference. He said he hoped the scientists could agree a roadmap ""around which researchers and donors will align"".

33,2020/02/12,U.S. President Donald Trump says looking forward to visiting India,"“He [Prime Minister Narendra Modi] is a friend of mine. He’s a great gentleman,” President Donald Trump said in response to a question

U.S. President Donald Trump has said that he is looking forward to his visit to India later this month where millions of people would welcome him.

“I look forward to going to India,” Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, a day after the White House announced that he will be travelling to Ahmedabad in Gujarat and New Delhi on February 24 and 25.

“He [Prime Minister Narendra Modi] is a friend of mine. He’s a great gentleman,” Mr. Trump said in response to a question.

Mr. Trump said that he spoke to Mr. Modi over the weekend and during the conversation, the Prime Minister told him that millions and millions of people would welcome him from the airport to the cricket stadium.

Referring to his New Hampshire rally held a day earlier, which was attended by an estimated 40,000 to 50,000 people, the President said in a lighter vein that he might not feel so good with that number.

“When we have 50,000 people, I’m not going to feel so good we’ll have five to seven million people just from the airport to the new stadium. And you know it is the largest stadium in the world. [They are] building it now. It’s almost complete and it’s the largest in the world,” Mr. Trump said.

Responding to a question on a potential trade deal with India, Mr. Trump said that he will do it, if “we can make the right deal”.

Mr. Modi on Wednesday said he is “extremely delighted” that Mr. Trump and his wife will be in India later this month and added that they will be accorded a memorable welcome.

In a series of tweets, the Prime Minister said India and the US share a common commitment to democracy and pluralism.

“Our nations are cooperating extensively on a wide range of issues. Robust friendship between our nations augurs well not only for our citizens but also for the entire world,” he said.

Mr. Modi said the visit is a very special one and will go a long way in further cementing the India-US friendship.

“India will accord a memorable welcome to our esteemed guests,” the Prime Minister said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/he6rrx/article30797786.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-DONALDTRUMP-REUTERS-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-president-donald-trump-says-looking-forward-to-visiting-india/article30797787.ece
34,2020/02/12,"London police deploy face scan tech, stirring privacy fears","It’s the first time London’s Metropolitan Police Service has used live facial recognition cameras in an operational deployment since carrying out a series of trials that ended last year.

London police started using facial recognition cameras on February 11 to automatically scan for wanted people, as authorities adopt the technology that has raised concerns about increased surveillance and erosion of privacy.

Surveillance cameras mounted on a blue police van monitored people coming out of a shopping centre in Stratford, in east London. Signs warned that police were using the technology to find people wanted for serious crimes. Officers stood nearby, explaining to passers-by how the system works.

It’s the first time London’s Metropolitan Police Service has used live facial recognition cameras in an operational deployment since carrying out a series of trials that ended last year.

London police are using the technology despite warnings from rights groups, lawmakers and independent experts about a lack of accuracy and bias in the system and the erosion of privacy.

Activists fear it’s just the start of expanded surveillance.

“We don’t accept this. This isn’t what you do in a democracy. You don’t scan people’s faces with cameras. This is something you do in China, not in the U.K.,” said Silkie Carlo, director of privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch.

Britain has a strong tradition of upholding civil liberties and of not allowing police to arbitrarily stop and identify people, she said. “This technology just sweeps all of that away.”

Police Commander Mark McEwan downplayed concerns about the machines being unaccountable. Even if the computer picks someone out of a crowd, the final decision on whether to investigate further is made by an officer on the ground, he said.

This is a prompt to them that that’s somebody we may want to engage with and identify, he said.

London’s system uses technology from Japan’s NEC to scan faces in the crowds to see if they matched any on a watchlist of 5,000 faces created specifically for Tuesday’s operation.

The watchlist images are mainly of people wanted by the police or courts for serious crimes like attempted murder, Mr. McEwan said.

London police say that in trials, the technology correctly identified 7 in 10 wanted people who walked by the camera while the error rate was 1 in 1,000 people. But an independent review found only eight of 42 matches were verified as correct.

“Police are using the latest most up-to-date algorithm we can get,” Mr. McEwan said. We’re content that it has been independently tested around bias and for accuracy. It’s the most accurate technology available to us. Opinion was split among people passing by the cameras.

“I’m not really concerned because I didn’t commit any crime or I’m not someone that is being wanted, I’m fine. Safety comes first,” said Charles Enyorsi, who works at a property management company.

But Silvan Bennett-Schaar, a law student from Germany, said he was opposed, partly because of his country’s experience with communist-era mass surveillance. He also thought police efforts to be transparent about the technology’s deployment were counterproductive.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/m8ks7i/article30796424.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-FACIALRECOGNITION-AP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/london-police-deploy-face-scan-tech-stirring-privacy-fears/article30796426.ece

38,2020/02/12,How common ransomware variants attack victims,"One of the ways ransomware spreads is by replicating itself rapidly to other computers for maximum impact, researchers from cybersecurity firm Sophos said in a report ‘How Ransomware Attacks’

There are three main modes of distribution for the major ransomware families that are poised to increase their attacks this year, security researchers warned on the occasion of Safer Internet Day on Tuesday.

One of the ways ransomware spreads is by replicating itself rapidly to other computers for maximum impact, researchers from cybersecurity firm Sophos said in a report ‘How Ransomware Attacks’, a playbook for defenders that explains how ransomware variants attack and impact victims.

Ransomware that spread by replicating itself is called a ‘cryptoworm’. The WannaCry attack that caused damage worldwide in 2017 is an example of this kind of ransomware.

These malware also spread as ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS), which are sold on the dark web as a distribution kit (for example, Sodinokibi).

The third most common way of their spread is as automated active adversary attack, where attackers manually deploy the ransomware following an automated scan of networks for systems with weak protection.

This automated, active attack style was the most common approach seen among the top families listed in the report, which includes detailed analysis of 11 of the most prevalent and persistent ransomware families, including Ryuk, BitPaymer and MegaCortex.

The research highlights how ransomware tries to slip unnoticed past security controls by abusing trusted and legitimate processes, and then harnesses internal systems to encrypt the maximum number of files and disable back-up and recovery processes before an IT security team catches up.

“The creators of ransomware have a pretty good grasp of how security software works and adapt their attacks accordingly. Everything is designed to avoid detection while the malware encrypts as many documents as possible as quickly as possible and makes it hard, if not impossible, to recover the data,” said Mark Loman, Director of Engineering for Threat Mitigation Technology at Sophos, and the author of the report.

“In some cases, the main body of the attack takes place at night when the IT team is at home asleep. By the time the victim spots what’s going on, it is too late. It is vital to have robust security controls, monitoring and response in place covering all endpoints, networks and systems, and to install software updates whenever they are issued,” Loman said.

To protect against ransomware, check that you have a full inventory of all devices connected to your network and that any security software you use on them is up to date, the researchers recommended.

Always install the latest security updates, as soon as practicable, on all the devices on your network.

You should also keep regular back-ups of your most important and current data on an offline storage device as this is the best way to avoid having to pay a ransom when affected by ransomware, the researchers said.

Administrators should enable multi-factor authentication on all management systems that support it, to prevent attackers disabling security products during an attack, they added.",internet,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/h9p8x4/article30799748.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12NETMALWARE,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/how-common-ransomware-variants-attack-victims/article30799749.ece

Pharma major Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories is acquiring select divisions of Wockhardt’s branded generics business in India and a few other international territories of Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and Maldives for ₹1,850 crore ($260 million).

Besides a portfolio of 62 brands in multiple therapy areas, the transaction involves transfer of Wockhardt’s related sales and marketing teams and manufacturing plant in Baddi, Himachal Pradesh with all employees to Dr. Reddy’s.

The business undertaking is being transferred on a slump-sale basis. The transaction is expected to be closed in the first quarter of 2020-21, Dr. Reddy’s said.

43,2020/02/12,Pharma council seeks data on Chinese imports,"Eyes action plan post nCov outbreak

The Pharmaceuticals Export Promotion Council of India has begun reaching out to drugmakers, seeking details of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), key starting materials (KSMs) and intermediates they import from China as part of a preparedness plan India wants to ready, following the coronavirus outbreak.

The information would enable the government to address the situation, in the event of the deadly virus continuing to impact supplies for a longer term, in the best possible manner.

A database would help working towards alternatives, according to a Pharmexcil statement.

“Coronavirus has created an impact on China and the industrial units producing APIs have stalled production in many areas of China. As a result, supplies to India are likely to be affected in the coming weeks till the official announcement of China on the restoration of API supplies,” a circular said.

Pharmexcil director general Ravi Uday Bhaskar said pharma companies in India were unlikely to be impacted immediately as they, at all times, maintained an inventory of material required for two-three months. The information sought is more on what ought to be done in the event of coronovirus impact on the supplies, from China, remaining longer.

The scare comes in the backdrop of the robust growth in pharmaceutical exports in the first nine months of the fiscal. He said pharma exports during the April-December period were $15.54 billion or a growth of 11.5% from the $13.94 billion in the corresponding period of 2018-19. The 14.64% growth in the third quarter (September-December) this fiscal was the highest thus far this fiscal.

Mr.Bhaskar said Pharmexcil was hopeful of the exports touching at least $21 billion this fiscal. Last year, the exports were about $19.13 billion.

46,2020/02/12,‘Bank the unbanked to achieve $5-tn goal’,"More lenders must figure among top 100 global banks, says the President

To achieve the goal of a $5- trillion economy, commercial banks will need to focus on those who are still deprived of formal finance and the country will need more than just one bank in the top 100 global banks, said President Ram Nath Kovind said.

“India has become one of the largest economies in the world. Banks have been a constant part of India’s growth saga. As India aims to become a $5-trillion economy, the banking sector has to start preparing for the next big leap. This mainly involves “banking with the unbanked” and “securing the unsecured,” he said in a speech at the National Institute of Banking Management. He also said India’s future journey will be greatly helped if banks exhibit deeper reach and become more efficient.

“Given the growing size of our economy, we should aim to have more than just one name in the world’s top 100 banks,” he added.

Last month, the economic survey said at least eight banks were needed, which are large enough to belong to the top 100 banks globally, for India to become a $ 5-trillion economy. At present, only State Bank of India is among the top 100 global banks. He pointed out the success of the ‘Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana’ and said almost 35 crore bank accounts had been opened under this scheme. “This number is larger than the population of all countries except ours and China’s,” he said.

Mr. Kovind added that banks needed to take proactive measures to bring greater gender parity in ownership of financial assets. “As part of social responsibility, banks can adopt certain geographical areas for increasing financial awareness among women.” He reminded that as custodian of public money, banks had significant fiduciary responsibility in the economy. He added the recent proposal to hike deposit insurance coverage from ₹1 lakh to ₹5 lakh was a positive step towards assuring savers.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/95wxu2/article30803551.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13THBUKOVIND,https://www.thehindu.com/business/bank-the-unbanked-to-achieve-5-tn-goal/article30803552.ece

Nasscom also said that the IT services sector garnered the highest revenue of $97 billion (growth of 6.7%), followed by e-commerce which stood at $54 billion (growth of 25.6%).

The sector generated exports of over $147 billion in revenue in FY2020, growing at 8.1%.

The maiden report for this decade showcased the growth of the industry commemorating several milestones between FY2009-FY2019 such as crossing $105 billion in overall revenue, adding 2 million employees/jobs and creating 10k new technology companies in overall consolidation.

Keshav Murugesh, chairman, Nasscom, said, “The IT-BPM industry continues to be a key catalyst for India’s overall growth. Over the past year, the performance from the industry showcased the increasing focus on the digital transformation of businesses and also the expansion of digital-driven services to cater to clients across the globe. We are hopeful that this trend will continue to drive the growth of the industry in the coming years, and evangelizing innovation in the domain.”

A key trend witnessed last year was the continued focus on digital revenues, which grew by over 23%, once again a testimony to the prominence digital technologies and systems are gaining across portfolios.

Investing in digital skills continues to rise as an imperative for the industry, with organisations building their capabilities and aligning business models to digital practices as up to 28% of organisational revenues was recorded for digital. Indian enterprises spent over $2 billion domestically to accelerate digital transformation.

Debjani Ghosh, President, NASSCOM, said, “Talent, Trust and Innovation remain our key imperatives as we move into the first year of this decade. The industry continued its hiring momentum with 205,000 new hires, and today we are proud to have 884,000 digitally skilled talent in the country.

“Currently, our teams are working on actually mapping of the supply chains, right up to the raw material. And more often than not, you’ll find that supply chains of different parts, at times, cross through China... there are a few parts which are dependent on that. But people are now focussing on trying to get alternative supply streams activated, so that the impact is minimised,” Girish Wagh, president, Commercial Vehicles Business Unit, Tata Motors, told The Hindu.

To a query on revival in the commercial vehicle segment, Mr. Wagh said it may happen in the second half of the coming financial year (2020-21). “We have to keep a close track of some of the fundamental demand drivers, but we are expecting that in the second half of next financial year, most of these demand drivers will start getting into green. And, therefore, we should see year-on-year growth probably happening somewhere in H2 of next fiscal because then the base effect will also come into play.”

Mr. Wagh added that commercial vehicle purchase was always dependent on actual business demand. Hence, the recovery depends more on fundamentals in the economy than just the consumption power, which is important in case of car sales. “So it could be at what rate of infrastructure projects are being executed, how is the industrial index of production doing, how are some of the end-use industry such as steel, cement and mining doing.”

On the commercial vehicle product roadmap, Mr. Wagh said the company would continue to work on internal combustion engines, electric vehicles and CNG-powered vehicles. “We've also made some LNG vehicles which are running on trial purpose. So we know that this fuel also has some potential going ahead. So therefore, we will continue to work on alternate fuel.”

On adoption of electric vehicles in commercial vehicle segment, he said it has been good in buses, wherein Tata Motors has delivered 215 electric buses to five cities in the country -- Jammu, Lucknow, Kolkata, Guwahati and Indore, which have clocked over 2.5 million kilometres cumulatively.

Mr Wagh believes that after the mass passenger transportation segment, the next segment that is likely to see a good pull for electric will be last mile distribution goods. “In goods transportation, good interest being shown by companies in e-commerce and retail space...Some of the MNCs are doing it for their global sustainability targets and they have been talking to us, they’ve been looking at some of the vehicles.”",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/2oip82/article30803500.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13THBUTATA,https://www.thehindu.com/business/coronavirus-threat-tata-motors-eyes-alternative-supply-chain/article30803501.ece
51,2020/02/12,"After consecutive losses, IOB set to make profit in fourth quarter","Slippages mainly due to corporate sector: Karnam Sekar

State-run Indian Overseas Bank, which has been making losses for almost half-a-decade due to climbing bad loans, is set to make profit in the January-March period, as slippages are expected to come down, said Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Karnam Sekar.

“Slippages will be less in Q4. We will be in clear net profit from this quarter. This, after being in red for almost four-and-a-half years,” Mr. Sekar said on the sidelines on an event at the National Institute of Bank Management here.

“Our slippages have been mainly due to the corporate sector. That is more or less addressed. I don’t see any corporate accounts which are likely to slip. We have not taken any exposure in the last four-five years. So, the corporate sector problems which have been there, have been addressed,” he said.

The Chennai-based lender’s net loss for the October-December quarter widened to ₹6,075 crore on higher provisioning for non-performing assets (NPAs) and investments.

“In December, we made higher provisions and therefore we incurred a huge loss,” he said. IOB had a gross NPA ratio of 17.12% as at end December, while net NPA ratio was at 5.81%. He also expected the lender to come out of RBI’s prompt corrective action framework since net NPA ratio has fallen below 6%.

Mr. Sekar added that the bank expected ₹1,000 crore recovery in Q4 and said the bank did not have any immediate capital requirement.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/v53mq8/article30803489.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13THBUIOB,https://www.thehindu.com/business/after-consecutive-losses-iob-set-to-make-profit-in-fourth-quarter/article30803490.ece

53,2020/02/12,Lapp Mobility eyes entering Indian EV charging market,"Lapp Mobility, a 100% subsidiary of Lapp Group of Germany and a leading supplier of integrated solutions and branded products, including cables for the global electric vehicles (EV) charging infrastructure, has initiated talks with India OEMs and charging infrastructure providers to explore the possibility of entering the Indian market.

The company’s top brass recently visited India and were evaluating the prospects of laying a distribution channel along with Lapp India which has been manufacturing and selling power cables in India for decades.

“We can provide reliable and good products to the Indian market. We have decided to enter this market through the existing organisation. Lapp India has regional offices and our products can be expanded into the market through them. We are discussing about it,” said Frank Hubbert, Managing Director - LAPP Mobility GmbH in an interview.

To begin with the company plans to supply to India from its factory in Germany and if volumes pick up, they may consider setting up a manufacturing unit in India.

As per Lapp’s group’s strategic initiative, mobility services is expected to add to its growth in the next 5 years.

“ We have clearly identified India as a growth market due to the opportunities. We want to work with infrastructure providers and charge point operators and also with classic OEMs like Tata Motors and others. We have been working with JLR so there is a natural fit may be in next couple of months we might see some development.

“Though the number of EVs in India is very less, we believe that there will be more vehicles on the street. We would like to participate in that growth,” he said.

The company has two products, one a cable for charging EVs at public charging stations and a cable that one carries in the car that can be plugged into a regular outlet during emergency.

Both the products are certified for India. In five years, the company plans to generate a revenue of €5 million.

Approximately 1.1 million passenger EVs (cars) were sold in 2017, up by about 57% from the previous years. China contributed 600,000 vehicles, the United States had 200,000 and Europe 1,25,000. EV sales in Norway constituted 50% of all vehicle sales. Several nations have announced that their vehicles will be fully electric by 2025, 2030, or 2040 and Lapp Mobility is betting big on this opportunity.

54,2020/02/12,"Tech-clash a challenge, but can be solved: Accenture","Dazzled by the promise of technology, many organisations created digital products and services just because they could, without fully considering the human, organisational and societal consequences, said Paul Daugherty, chief technology and innovation officer at Accenture.

“Today, we’re seeing a tech-clash caused by the tension between consumer expectations, the potential of technology, and business ambitions — and are now at an important leadership inflection point. We must shift our mindset from ‘just because’ to ‘trust because’ — re-examining our fundamental business and technology models and creating a new basis for competition and growth,’’ he said.

According to Accenture Technology Vision 2020 released on Wednesday, continuing with existing models doesn’t just risk irritating customers or disengaging employees, but could permanently limit the potential for future innovation and growth. But tech-clash is a challenge that can be solved.

Accenture’s Technology Vision identifies five key trends that companies must address over next three years to defuse tech-clash and realise new forms of business value that will be driven in part by stronger, more trusting relationships with stakeholders.

While some (respondents) have referred to today’s environment as a “tech-lash,” or backlash against technology, that term failed to acknowledge the extent to which society was using and benefiting from technology, observed the vision report.

“Rather, it’s a tech-clash — a clash between business and technology models that are incongruous with people’s needs and expectations,’’ it further said.

To compete and succeed in a world where digital is everywhere, companies need a new focus on balancing “value” with “values,” aligning their drive to create business value with their customers’ and employees’ values and expectations, as per the report.

Of the more than 6,000 business and IT executives worldwide that Accenture surveyed for the Technology Vision report, 83% acknowledged that technology has become an inextricable part of the human experience.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/tech-clash-a-challenge-but-can-be-solved-accenture/article30803161.ece

To further enhance electronic toll collection, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has decided to waive FASTag fee till February 29, the government said on Wednesday.

The government has rolled out the FASTag-based toll collection system across more than 527 National Highways in the country.

“In order to further increase digital collection of user fee via FASTag at NH fee plazas, the NHAI has decided to waive off the FASTag cost of ₹100 for NHAI FASTag between February 15 and 29,” the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways said in a statement.

56,2020/02/12,Union cabinet okays changes in ‘Vivad se Vishwas’ Bill to reduce direct tax litigations,"The Bill will also cover disputes pending in various debt recovery tribunals

The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved changes in the ‘Direct Tax Vivad se Vishwas Bill, 2020’ with a view to increase its scope to cover litigations pending in various debt recovery tribunals (DRTs).

The Bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha earlier this month with the aim of reducing litigations related to direct taxes. It was proposed to cover tax disputes pending at the level of commissioner (appeals), Income Tax Appellate Tribunals (ITAT), high courts and the Supreme Court.

Briefing reporters here, Union Minister Prakash Javadekar said it has been decided to cover disputes pending in DRTs also.

He said that cases involving over ₹9 lakh crore of direct taxes are pending in various forums.

The minister hoped that people will take advantage of the scheme to settle the tax disputes before March 31, 2020 as 10% more will be charged for settlement of disputes after the end of the current financial year.

58,2020/02/12,EIU lowers global growth forecast for 2020 amid coronavirus scare,"The Economist Intelligence Unit’s baseline scenario is that the public health emergency within China will be under control by end-March.

The Economist Intelligence Unit has revised downwards its global growth forecast for 2020 to 2.2%, from 2.3% previously, citing new risks that have emerged following the novel coronavirus outbreak in China.

The virus originated in Wuhan, a city of around 11.3 million people in central Hubei province, China, and has spread to most provinces in mainland China and overseas.

“The Chinese authorities are taking unprecedented quarantine measures to halt the spread of the pathogen, which is likely to have consequences on the global economy,” The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) said in a report.

Global growth was sluggish throughout 2019 amid trade tensions, a sharp deceleration in real GDP growth in the US, China and India and political uncertainty in a number of EU countries.

In addition, since the start of 2020, concerns related to coronavirus have increased threats to global growth, it said.

Noting that the virus is a “threat” for global growth, the EIU has revised China’s growth downwards.

“On the assumption that the spread of the virus will be under control by end-March, we are lowering our real GDP forecast for China in 2020 to 5.4%, from 5.9% previously,” The EIU said in a report.

The Economist Intelligence Unit’s baseline scenario is that the public health emergency within China will be under control by end-March.

“The suggested case fatality rate had stabilised at 2.2% as at February 1; nevertheless, the risk of virus mutation and of heightened transmission during the post-Chinese New Year travel period, and strains on the Chinese healthcare system are grounds for concern,” The EIU said.

The EIU was bullish about India growth forecast, provided the coronavirus epidemic does not spread to India.

“In Asia, we believe that India and Japan, respectively, recorded the best and the worst rates of quarterly growth among G7 and BRICS countries in October-December,” it noted.

The report further said “a series of government stimulus measures, coupled with a low-interest-rate environment, are likely to spur demand and investment in 2020 and to cause a rebound in full-year real GDP growth, to 6.1% (up from an estimated 4.9% in 2019), provided that the coronavirus epidemic does not spread to India.”

Adding a word of caution the report said, “there is a risk that the coronavirus will spread to countries that do not have the resources to implement robust quarantine policies“.

This is based on the latest scientific studies and comparisons with a similar coronavirus outbreak (severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS) in 2002-03, it noted.

The report further noted that crude prices have lost about USD 10/barrel since mid-January, owing to coronavirus-related fears.

Following this, the EIU has revised its forecast for average oil prices in 2020 downwards, to USD 63/barrel (from USD 65/barrel previously).

Sensex rose on Wednesday, tracking gains in Asian markets, on hopes that the worst of the coronavirus in China may have passed.

The broader NSE Nifty 50 index rose 0.8% to 12,207.60 by 0932 IST and the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex was up 0.89% at 41,582.60.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.31% as China's senior medical adviser on Tuesday forecast the epidemic would peak this month, bringing cheer to global investors.

In the domestic market, metal stocks and state-owned banks led gains among sectors.

“Markets know that the epidemic risk will subside in a quarter or two,” said Saurabh Jain, assistant vice president at SMC Global Securities, in New Delhi.

“There is also a lot of liquidity in markets.”

The Nifty metals index rose about 1% as global metal prices saw modest gains on subsiding virus worries. The Nifty PSU index, which tracks state-owned banks, gained 0.75%.

Carmaker Tata Motors led gains on the blue-chip index, rising 1.6%, followed by steelmaker Tata Steel, which rose 1.7%.

Indusind Bank was among the top laggards of the day, down 1.6%, after rating agency Moody's changed its outlook to “negative” on the lender.

Meanwhile, investors also awaited key inflation data for the month of January. A Reuters poll from last week showed retail inflation likely rose to a near six-year peak in January as food prices stayed high.

60,2020/02/12,25 Ambassadors reach Srinagar on two-day visit,"They sought inputs from locals — including select politicians, elected grass-roots representatives, editors, traders and members of the civil society — on the measures required to move ahead.

Twenty five foreign Ambassadors arrived here on a two-day visit to Jammu and Kashmir to assess the situation after the Centre’s August 5 decision to revoke the erstwhile State’s special status. This is the second such trip in just 33 days.

They sought inputs from locals — including select politicians, elected grass-roots representatives, editors, traders and members of the civil society — on the measures required to move ahead.

Around 100 local delegates formed separate groups and met the envoys, including 10 from the European Union (EU). They were the same who met the Members of the European Parliament in October 2019 and 17 foreign envoys in January 2020. No politician from the regional parties, such as the National Conference (NC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), figured on the list of delegates drafted by the administration.

Significance of visit

The visit assumes significance because of U.S. President Donald Trump’s upcoming visit to India, and the EU’s plan to discuss the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and reading down of Article 370 in the European Parliament in March.

Because of the inclement weather, the delegation cancelled its visit to Baramulla in north Kashmir. The envoys stationed themselves in Srinagar and used the time to surf on the waters of the Dal Lake in local boats, called shikaras.

“A Kashmiri woman paddling her boat through the Dal Lake, Srinagar. Like Venice, lots of shopping points selling local handicrafts and boat resorts in the middle of the lake. Undoubtedly, the valley has a lot of potential for boosting tourism,” said Tahir Qadiry, the envoy from Afghanistan who tweeted a number of pictures.

Describing the situation “normal”, Mr. Qadiry said, “We saw schools and shops were open on our way from the Airport to the city.” Most envoys avoided talking to the media, though they said the visit was aimed at “assessing the situation”. During their interactions with local delegations, the envoys sought inputs on the situation arising after revocation of J&K’s special status and measures required to move ahead.

Calling Kashmir “the most beautiful place”, Frank Hans Dannenberg Castellanos from the Dominican Republic said, “We are here just as tourists.”

Later, the envoys met several delegations, including panch, sarpanch, ex-armymen, fruit growers, traders etc, at the Lalit Hotel, house next to the sub-jail where NC vice president Omar Abdullah is held.

“Article 370 was dare to all Kashmiris. The fact is it’s no more. We highlighted the need to provide domicile rights to people of J&K and restrict any urbanisation of the place that is home to many glaciers,” Congress leader Shoaib Lone told The Hindu. Mr. Lone was served a show-cause notice by the party for meeting the envoys in January. Besides three senior Congress leaders, two BJP leaders also briefed the envoys.

Tabish Habib, a female entrepreneur, said she desisted from raking up the issue of Article 370. “I have no views on it. I drew attention to underdeveloped education and health sectors, opening up the space for people to express their views and ensuring accountability of money infusion and economic reforms,” Ms. Habib told The Hindu.

On pointed question from the envoys if the situation has improved since August 5, Ms. Habib said, “It’s too early to say if there is change on the ground as the access to basic facilities remain denied.”

A delegation of local editors, sources said, told the envoys that “Article 370 has resulted in escalation in anger on the ground and demanded restoration of broadband internet services”. There were pointed questions, sources said, on measures to move on from the post August 5 situation.

Interestingly, several delegates praised the government’s move to book Dr. Farooq Abdullah, Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah under the Public Safety Act (PSA).

“The past regimes are responsible for the current situation in J&K. It has been 70 years of betrayal,” said Voice of Kashmir (VoK) general secretary Shujaat Wani, who demanded opening up of J&K for foreign direct investment.

Meanwhile, three youth who belonged to little-known group, Kashmir Youth Power, were detained by the police when they flashed placards and termed “envoys’ visit as wastage of money”. “Let the government focus on development of the Union Territory (UT) instead of spending money on these trips,” said one of the three detained youth.

In the evening, the envoys met the civil administration and the Army, which briefed them about Pakistan’s role in fomenting trouble and terrorism in J&K. They will visit Jammu on Thursday and meet Lieutenant Governor, Girish Chandra Murmu.

Kim will be proud

Iltija Mufti, daughter of PDP president Mehbooba Mufti, on Wednesday took potshots at the visit of the envoys.

“How lovely! [North Korean leader] Kim Jong-un would be proud of such orchestrated diplomacy. The only thing missing is presence of three former J&K ex-CMs in this ‘curated shikara’. I’m sure they’d have lots to share,” she wrote on Twitter.

She was responding to the tweets of Mr. Qadiry. “Upon our arrival, we enjoyed a Shikara ride on Dal Lake in Srinagar, Kashmir. Beautiful lake and hospitable people. I bought a beautiful Kashmiri ring from a boat serving as a shop,” was one of the tweets tagged to the Ministry of External Affairs by Mr. Qadiry.

In a direct tweet to the EU envoys, Ms. Mufti’s daughter wrote, “Hope the EU question the Government of India about Internet ban since 5th August, economic losses suffered, muzzling local media in Kashmir, 3 ex-CMs slapped with draconian PSA and troop deployment to create fear amongst people normalcy’s an illusion.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/m1y8fy/article30804226.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12THRDKASHMIR2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/25-ambassadors-reach-srinagar-on-two-day-visit/article30804227.ece
61,2020/02/12,Bhim Army calls for Bharat Bandh against Supreme Court ruling on reservation in promotions,"He has issued a call for a Bharat Bandh, or all-India strike, on February 23, and also announced a protest march in the capital, from Mandi House to Parliament, on February 16.

Bhim Army chief Chandra Shekhar Aazad has called for a nationwide agitation against the Supreme Court’s recent ruling that reservation in promotion for public posts could not be claimed as a fundamental right.

He has issued a call for a Bharat Bandh, or all-India strike, on February 23, and also announced a protest march in the capital, from Mandi House to Parliament, on February 16.

Mr. Aazad urged Members of Parliament and Legislative Assemblies, especially those from Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe, OBC (Other Backward Class) and minority communities, to put pressure on the government to bring out an ordinance that would nullify the ruling.

In a February 7 verdict, the top court had said that State governments are not bound to make reservations, adding that even courts cannot issue any mandamus directed States to provide reservations.

Review plea

On Tuesday, Mr. Aazad had filed a review petition in the Supreme Court seeking a reversal of its order. On Wednesday, speaking to journalists in Delhi, he said that even the top court could “make mistakes.”

“I respect the court. We all do. But it has made mistakes, including in this case,” he said.

“The court has said we cannot claim reservation in promotion if State governments do not grant it. They have left us to the mercy of the States. But we will not accept it. This is our fundamental right,” Mr. Aazad said.

He cited the court’s previous verdicts on the amendment of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, as well as on the demolition of the Sant Ravidas temple as examples of cases where the apex court had “made a mistake”. Dalit groups had agitated against both decisions.

Mr. Aazad, garbed in his trademark blue scarf, brandished a blue-covered copy of the Constitution with a picture of B.R. Ambedkar, as he urged legislators and social justice organisations to build pressure on the government. “Ambedkar’s Constitution very clearly provides for reservation in both public and private education, in public jobs and in promotions. If you believe in Ambedkar’s constitution, you should support our demand,” he said. “Don’t support us if you are a believer in Manusmriti. We will then take to the streets, and take action for our rights.”

The “Samvidhan Bachao” (Save the Constitution) slogan that has been a mainstay of the ongoing protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act at Shaheen Bagh and elsewhere must be clubbed with a call for “Samvidhan Aarakshan” (Save Reservations), he added.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bhim-army-calls-for-bharat-bandh-against-supreme-court-ruling-on-reservation-in-promotions/article30803919.ece
62,2020/02/12,"Don’t detain children in jails, lockups, Supreme Court tells police","A juvenile in conflict with law has to be placed under the care of special juvenile police unit or child welfare officer

The Supreme Court has made it clear that the police have no right to detain children in conflict with law in a lockup or a jail.

A juvenile in conflict with law, if apprehended, has to be placed immediately under the care of the special juvenile police unit or a designated child welfare officer. The child has to be produced before the Juvenile Justice Board (JJB).

“Once a child is produced before a JJB, bail is the rule,” a Bench of Justices Deepak Gupta and Aniruddha Bose declared. And even if, for some reason, bail is not granted, a child cannot be put behind bars. He has to be lodged either in an observation home or in a place of safety.

The law is meant to protect children and not detain them in jail or keep them in police custody. The police cannot torture children.

The eight-page order on February 10 came after the court’s attention was drawn by the recent media reports about “children being detained in police custody and tortured in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh”.

The order sends a significant message to the authorities in the light of news reports about children detained in Delhi and at Bijnor in Uttar Pradesh in connection with the protests against the Citizenship (Amendments) Act.

The Bench has issued notice to the Uttar Pradesh and Delhi Commissions for Protection of Child Rights and directed them to file their responses within three weeks. The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights has also been asked to look into the matter and submit a report through the Centre within three weeks.

The court said the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, is a welfare law. The JJBs, formed under this Act, are not intended to serve the authorities as “silent spectators”, the court observed.

63,2020/02/12,Centre clears Major Ports Authority Bill,"The Bill, approved by the Cabinet at a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, will replace the existing regulations under a 1963 law, he said.

The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved the Major Ports Authority Bill 2020, which will be introduced in the ongoing session of Parliament, Shipping Minister Mansukh Mandaviya said.

The Bill, approved by the Cabinet at a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, will replace the existing regulations under a 1963 law, he said.

He said there had been many changes in the manner ports were operated since the 1960, including private players and public private partnership (PPP) model being used.

The 12 major ports in India would get a boost through the new law, he said, adding that disputes with private companies and PPP operators had been cropping up, but the existing law had no provisions to deal with them.

64,2020/02/12,Union Cabinet clears Bill to regulate pesticide business,"It provides for compensating farmers in case of losses from use of spurious agro chemicals

The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved the Pesticides Management Bill, 2020, which, the government claims, will regulate the business of pesticides and compensate farmers in case of losses from the use of spurious agro chemicals.

“As far as farmers are concerned, that is our primary concern. The Pesticides Management Bill will be introduced in this session. Today the pesticide business is regulated by 1968 rules which have become age-old and need immediate rewriting,” Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar told reporters.

Mr. Javadekar said farmers would also be empowered to get all information as the data would be in open source and in all languages. “More importantly he will know about the strength and weakness of pesticides, the risk and alternatives and this will be an open data in digital format also.”

Centre’s draft

In February 2018, the Centre released a draft of the pesticides Bill that aims to replace the existing Insecticides Act of 1968. A key proposal in the 2018 version of the Bill was to raise penalties on the sale of prohibited or spurious pesticides to ₹50 lakh and up to five years’ imprisonment, from the current ₹2,000 and up to three years’ imprisonment. It is unclear if these provisions have been retained in the latest version of Bill that was cleared by the Union Cabinet.

“If there is any loss because of the spurious or low quality of pesticides then there is a provision for compensations This is the unique feature of this Bill. If required, the government will form a central fund which will take care of compensation,” Mr. Javadekar said.

Power to States

The Centre for Science and Environment, in 2018, had criticised the Bill for falling short. “State governments must have a greater role in case of decision making on pesticide management. The existing draft provides inadequate representation to States in both pesticide board and the registration committee. The States should have a say in final decision making on pesticide, as they have the best understanding on the agro-ecological climate, environment and soil conditions,” it said in a statement.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/iuvucd/article30803306.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH12PESTICIDE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/union-cabinet-clears-bill-to-regulate-pesticide-business/article30803307.ece
65,2020/02/12,"News Analysis | What Delhi election results mean for Mamata Banerjee, Nitish Kumar","Trinamool will follow the “Kaam ki Rajniti” template set by the AAP, and the Bihar Chief Minister may be emboldened to cut the cord with the BJP.

Now that the celebrations are done with the BJP’s convincing defeat and the Aam Aadmi Party’s victory, it’s time to see how these results will impact the next two eagerly awaited Assembly polls in Bihar and West Bengal.

Leaders across the political parties agree that the Delhi results has won the perception battle for the Opposition. It has again reiterated that the BJP is not invincible coming close on the heels of Maharashtra, Haryana and Jharkhand results. Second, it provides empirical evidence that the BJP narrative on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the NRC is not drawing the dividends they were expecting.

There are many obvious parallels between Delhi and West Bengal that goes to the polls in April 2021. For one, in both the States the BJP is in the Opposition. Both the Kejriwal and the Mamata Banerjee governments run strong social welfare programmes and distribute many services, which pejoratively are called freebies. Third, both Chief Ministers are careful not to be seen in direct clash with Hindutva politics.

Mr. Kejriwal in an interview to The Hindu before the elections had said he believes in Kaam ki Rajniti. Soon after the Delhi results, the Trinamool Congress leaders spoke a similar language. In an interview to NDTV, Derek O’Brien listed out his government’s development projects. “Today is not a day of big talk, we are just quietly doing our work,” he said making it clear that the TMC will follow the template set by the AAP.

A senior Left leader said one major difference between Delhi and West Bengal is that Ms. Banerjee, unlike his Delhi counterpart, faces severe anti-incumbency. The Congress leader from West Bengal, however, feels that anti-incumbency alone would not be enough to challenge her. “It didn’t suffice in 2016 so we are sure whether it will suffice now. The question in Bengal is who do you hate the most, Modi or Mamata,” he said.

The Left is keen that the Delhi model of bipolar contest between the AAP and BJP should not be replicated in West Bengal since it feels that the BJP will profit in such a case. “In 2016, when the Left and the Congress fought together, the BJP vote share was restricted to 10.6%. The surge that we saw in 2019 for the BJP was essentially because of the absence of a third alternative,” a senior Left leader said. The BJP got 41% votes in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls and 18 seats.

The Delhi results have effectively demonetised the Congress as an alternative to the BJP. Both the Left and the Congress are worried about the sentiment carrying over to West Bengal.

Bihar is an altogether different story. There are no obvious parallels that can be drawn between the Delhi results and Bihar with the BJP being a junior partner in the government. Bihar will go to the polls in October. The Delhi results can only be a morale booster at the best. What many are hoping is that the Delhi results should provide confidence to Janata Dal (U) president and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar to cut the cord with the BJP. He has often shown signs of rebelling against his junior partner since the BJP has been flexing its muscles and trying to carve out a bigger role for itself in the State.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/78xrsb/article30803001.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Mamata-Nitish,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/news-analysis-what-do-delhi-election-results-mean-for-mamata-banerjee-nitish-kumar/article30803002.ece

68,2020/02/12,Plea to forcibly remove Shaheen Bagh protesters filed in collusion with Centre: Bhim Army chief,"Alternative routes deliberately closed to pile pressure on activists, apex court told

Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad and first Chief Information Commissioner Wajahat Habibullah have jointly moved the Supreme Court to raise their voices in support of the ‘iconic’ Shaheen Bagh protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens.

They have sought to be impleaded in a petition filed by advocate Amit Sahni seeking a direction to forcibly remove the peaceful protesters. Mr. Sahni said the protests, which have been going on for over 50 days, has hampered the lives of ordinary commuters. The thoroughfares which usually see busy traffic have been sealed off.

Monday saw a Bench of Justices S.K. Kaul and K.M. Joseph gently draw the attention of the protesters, who are mostly mothers and senior citizens, to the inconvenience caused when protests are held on thoroughfares for days. The court had orally said protests cannot be carried on indefinitely in a common area. The court had however refused to pass any interim directions for the removal of the protesters. “The protests have been going on for over 50 days, you can wait. We like to hear the other side [police],” Justice Kaul said.

The court had issued formal notice to the Delhi police and listed the case for further hearing on February 17.

In their impleadment application, Mr. Habibullah and Mr. Azad said the petition has been filed in collusion with the Centre.

The application alleged that alternative routes through Shaheen Bagh have been deliberately closed to disrupt traffic to and fro Delhi, Noida and Faridabad to pile pressure on the protesters to stop. It contended that the blockade across these routes is done by the police on instructions from the Centre.

The application said any direction to stop the protests would have a “far-reaching impact on human rights of the citizens of this country”.

Mr. Sahni had asked for the setting up of a panel led by a retired Supreme Court judge or a sitting judge of the Delhi High Court to supervise the situation to avoid any violence.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/j29aam/article30801090.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Azad1jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/plea-to-forcibly-remove-shaheen-bagh-protesters-filed-in-collusion-with-centre-bhim-army-chief/article30801088.ece
69,2020/02/12,Nirbhaya case victim’s mother protests outside court over delay in hanging of convicts,"A trial court had offered one of the death row convicts legal aid

Nirbhaya’s mother Asha Devi on Wednesday protested outside a trial court premises here over the delay in hanging of the four convicts in the gang rape and murder case of her daughter.

Her protests come right after the trial court offered Pawan Gupta, one of the four death row convicts in the case legal aid saying a condemned convict is entitled to legal aid till his last breath.

Additional Session Judge Dharmender Rana expressed displeasure over delay from Pawan’s side, who claimed that he removed his lawyer and will need time to engage a new one.

District Legal Services Authority (DLSA) provided Pawan’s father with a list of its empanelled advocates to chose from.

Nirbhaya’s parents and the Delhi government had moved the court on Tuesday seeking fresh death warrants for the four convicts after the Supreme Court granted liberty to the authorities to approach the trial court for issuance of fresh date for the execution of these convicts.

The date of execution, first fixed for January 22 in Tihar jail, was postponed for 6 am on February 1 by a January 17 court order. The trial court later, on January 31 stayed, “till further orders” the execution of the four convicts in the case, who are lodged in Tihar Jail.

The Tihar jail authorities had filed a status report on Tuesday before the trial court stating that no legal option was preferred by any convicts — Mukesh Kumar Singh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Vinay Kumar Sharma (26) and Akshay Kumar (31) — in the last seven-day period, granted by the Delhi High Court.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/792u7f/article30796758.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH11-KDR-NirbhaG3273QU7H3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nirbhayas-mother-protests-outside-court-over-delay-in-hanging-of-convicts/article30800874.ece
70,2020/02/12,NIA files charge sheet against 4 Jaish-e-Mohammed aides of Pulwama attack mastermind,"The NIA had last September filed a charge sheet claiming that JeM’s Sajjad Ahmad Khan, a close aide of Pulwama attack mastermind Mudassir Ahmad Khan, was conspiring terror acts across India.

The National Investigation Agency (NIA) filed a supplementary chargesheet against four Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) aides of the Pulwama attack mastermind in a case of conspiracy to carry out terror acts nationwide.

Last September, the NIA filed a chargesheet alleging that Sajjad Ahmad Khan of the JeM, a close aide of Pulwama attack mastermind Mudassir Ahmad Khan, was conspiring to carry out terror acts nationwide.

The supplementary chargesheet was filed against four JeM operatives under Sections 120-B (criminal conspiracy) and 121-A (waging, or attempting to wage war, or abetting waging of war, against the government of India) of the IPC, and various Sections of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and the Explosive Substances Act.

Besides Sajjad Ahmad Khan, 27, the agency filed the chargesheet against Bilal Ahmad Mir, 23, Ishfaq Ahmad Bhat, 24, and Mehraj-ud-Din Chopan, 22. All of them, are residents of Pulwama in Jammu and Kashmir.

“Investigation has established that the accused persons are members of the proscribed terrorist organisation JeM, who were planning to carry out terrorist attacks and propagating the activities of JeM,” the NIA said.

“The slain terrorist Mudassir Ahmad Khan was the mastermind of this conspiracy. He was one of the main conspirators in the Pulwama terror attack as well, and was killed in an encounter with the police and security forces in the Tral area of Pulwama on March 10 last year,” the NIA said.

The charges against Mudassir abated after he was killed in an encounter in March 2019, the NIA said in the final report.

According to the agency, Sajjad was in touch with Mudassir while Ishfaq was involved in the transport of arms and ammunition for strengthening the JeM in Kashmir, besides harbouring JeM operatives.

One hand grenade was recovered from Mehraj-ud-din Chopan, and it was procured to be used against the security forces for snatching their weapons. This case pertains to a criminal conspiracy hatched by senior commanders of the JeM to carry out terror attacks in different parts of India, including Delhi-NCR, the NIA said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ah045o/article26273255.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/pulwamajpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nia-files-charge-sheet-against-4-jaish-e-mohammed-aides-of-pulwama-attack-mastermind/article30799880.ece

A day after the Delhi Assembly poll results were announced, the price of the non-subsidised LPG cylinder weighing 14.2 kg was on February 12 increased by ₹144.50 to ₹149, the steepest since January 2014.

However, the government almost doubled the subsidy for domestic users.

While in Delhi the cost per cylinder rose from ₹714 to ₹858.50 compared to the January 1 rate, it went up by ₹149 to ₹896 in Kolkata. The price in Mumbai rose by ₹145 to ₹829.50 and by ₹147 to ₹881 in Chennai.

The subsidy to domestic users has been increased from ₹153.86 per cylinder to ₹291.48. The domestic users are entitled to get 12 cylinders of 14.2 kg each in a year at subsidised rates.

The subsidy for the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) beneficiaries has been increased from ₹174.86 to ₹312.48 per cylinder. The subsidised 14.2-kg cylinders would cost ₹567.02 for domestic users and ₹546.02 for the PMUY beneficiaries.

In January 2014, the prices had gone up by about ₹220 to ₹1,241 per cylinder.





Congress demands LPG rollback

The Congress demanded the hike be rolled back and accused the Union government of ‘electrocuting’ household budgets.

“Modiji increased the price by ₹144. Cooking gas price price has been increased by ₹200 in one year from 2019-2020,” said chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala.

The women’s wing of the party has also decided to take out protests on Thursday.

“While talking about current, they have struck the pockets of the public with current,” said Mr. Surjewala in a dig at Home Minister Amit Shah’s statement during the Delhi election campaign where he had asked “voters to press the button so hard that protesters in Shaheen Bagh feel the current”.

“We demand this, on behalf of the Indian National Congress, that as the price of the international crude oil has fallen, why should there be such surreptitious and uncalled for increase in the price of gas cylinder. This increase in the price should immediately be rolled back.”

TMC, CPI(M) flay Centre

In Kolkata, the Trinamool Congress and the CPI(M) slammed the BJP-led government for the hike, alleging that the objective of the move was to avenge the saffron party’s drubbing in the Delhi Assembly polls.

“The BJP is an anti-people party and its decisions and policies are a reflection of that. Despite its series of defeats in several Assembly polls, they are yet to learn their lessons,” TMC secretary-general Partha Chatterjee said.

“They are trying to take revenge for the defeat in the Delhi assembly polls. Just because people did not vote in BJP’s favour, they are punishing them by increasing the LPG price,” said CPI(M) legislative party leader Sujan Chakraborty.

Reacting to the remarks, BJP state president Dilip Ghosh said the hike in LPG price was not related to the Assembly election results.

“The LPG prices increase and decrease periodically. It has nothing to do with elections or poll results,” Mr. Ghosh said.

In Lucknow, BSP supremo Mayawati attacked the Centre terming the hike as a “cruel decision” against the poor.

73,2020/02/12,Indian armed forces are at cusp of transformation: General Rawat,"General Rawat also rejected criticism that the armed forces are suppressing the rights of the people in Jammu and Kashmir

India’s armed forces are at the cusp of transformation, Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat said on Wednesday, noting that proxy war and cross border terrorism remained the key security challenges facing India.

General Rawat also rejected criticism that the armed forces are suppressing the rights of the people in Jammu and Kashmir, saying required steps are being taken, considering the ground realities and threats of terrorism.

Asked about his controversial comments that India has de-radicalisation camps, he said, what he meant was classification of people based on their views and the impact of relentless efforts to de-radicalise young people.

“When I said camps — I meant groups of people,” he said.

In an address at the Raisina Dialogue last month, General Rawat said, “De-radicalisation camps are operating in the country as it is necessary to isolate people who are completely radicalised.”

Girls and boys as young as 10 and 12 years are being radicalised in the Valley, he said, describing it as a matter of concern. “We have got de-radicalisation camps going on in our country.”

Talking about evolving a regional security matrix, General Rawat said, “Developments beyond India’s immediate neighbourhood like in West Asia, may impinge on the country’s security interests. India needs to fulfill a larger responsibility in context of global peace. We have to expand our influence,” General Rawat said, addressing a conclave.

Asked whether creation of the chief of defence staff has added another layer of bureaucracy, the former Army chief said it was a long-pending proposal aimed at ensuring greater integration in functioning of the three services.

He said that both the CDS and the defence secretary have clear responsibilities and both will work in coordination to bring in transformational changes in the military.

“Indian armed forces are at the cusp of transformation. If we look at the future of warfare, then the military has to grow. Our priority is quality, not quantity,” he said.

General Rawat also talked about plans to have an air defence command as well as a separate logistics command.

“The focus will be to ensure better utilisation of resources,” he said.

The CDS also said that the armed forces are ready to deal with any challenge along the borders with China as well as Pakistan.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/n9onix/article30368431.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BIPIN-RAWAT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/indian-armed-forces-are-at-cusp-of-transformation-general-rawat/article30799222.ece

A special NIA court in Mohali has issued non-bailable warrants (NBWs) against two terrorists belonging to the Khalistan Zindabad Force in a case of dropping of arms and ammunition in Punjab by drones originating from Pakistan, the National Investigation Agency said on Wednesday.

Non-bailable warrants have been issued against Ranjeet Singh Neeta, a resident of R.S. Pura in Jammu, who is now based in Pakistan, and Gurmeet Singh alias Bagga, a resident of Hoshiyarpur district in Punjab, who is based in Germany now, an NIA spokesperson said.

The case pertains to dropping of arms, ammunition, explosives, communication devices and fake Indian currency notes (FICN) in September last year in the Indian territory at Chola Sahib in Punjab by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones that originated from Pakistan.

“During investigation, the role of Neeta, Pakistan-based chief of Khalistan Zindabad Force (KZF), a proscribed terrorist organisation, and Singh, a key operative of KZF based in Hamburg, Germany has been found in the conspiracy of trafficking of illegal arms, ammunition, explosives, communication devices and FICNs into India to further terrorist activities,” the NIA spokesperson said.

The NIA had taken over the case as this act was considered “to cause loss of life and property of citizens as well as to threaten the security of India.”

India will give a memorable welcome to United States President Donald Trump when he arrives here in the last week of February, said Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday. Preparations for a public event are under way in Ahmedabad where Mr. Trump will address a public gathering. In a set of messages, the Indian leader highlighted the common values that India and the United States share and reiterated India’s commitment to take bilateral ties to greater heights.

“India and U.S. share a common commitment to democracy and pluralism. Our nations are cooperating extensively on a wide range of issues. Robust friendship between our nations augurs well not only for our citizens but also for the entire world,” Mr. Modi said in a social media message.

Mr. Trump and First Lady Melania Trump will be visiting Ahmedabad and New Delhi on February 24 and 25, and the U.S. leader is expected to address a public meeting, ‘Kem Chho Trump’, at the 1.1-lakh seater Motera stadium in Ahmedabad.

Government insiders told The Hindu that an additional 10,000 spectators would be accommodated on the floor of the stadium.

Trade bodies FICCI and CII have been roped in to bring in top business executives for the event. Gujarat’s Industry Department has also been instructed to bring in crowds from different industrial zones of the State.

Over 2,500 buses have been hired to ferry people to the stadium where the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation has created parking facilities for 3,000 buses and 4,500 cars.

BCCI president Saurav Ganguly, Sachin Tendulkar and Kapil Dev will be among the dignitaries who will likely attend the event, besides Bollywood stars.

77,2020/02/12,Delhi HC dismisses plea seeking voting rights for prisoners,"Panel refers to a 1997 judgment of the Supreme Court, that any person confined in prison while serving a sentence or is in lawful confinement in a prison or in a police custody is not entitled to vote in an election

The Delhi High Court has dismissed a PIL seeking voting rights for prisoners, saying the facility was provided under the law and it can be taken away by law.

A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice C. Hari Shankar said the Supreme Court has held that the right to cast vote was neither a fundamental right nor a common law right and was only provided by a statute.

The Bench noted the right to vote provided under the statute — Representation of the People Act — was subject to restrictions imposed by the law, which does not allow prisoners to cast vote from jails.

The High Court said in view of the apex court rulings and the statutory position, it saw no reason to entertain the plea, and dismissed it.

The decision came on a plea by three law students — Praveen Kumar Chaudhary, Atul Kumar Dubey and Prerna Singh — seeking voting rights for all persons lodged in jails across the country.

The petition challenged the constitutionality of Section 62(5) of the RP Act, which deprives prisoners of their right to vote.

The Election Commission opposed the plea, saying prisoners do not have voting rights under the Act and it has been upheld by the Supreme Court. The panel told the court the right to vote is a statutory right under Section 62 of the RP Act and “being a statutory right (it) is subject to restrictions prescribed in the RP Act“.

The panel referred to a 1997 judgment of the Supreme Court, which held that the effect of sub-section (5) of Section 62 of the Act is that any person confined in prison while serving a sentence or is in lawful confinement in a prison or in a police custody for any reason is not entitled to vote in an election.

But this restriction does not apply to a person subjected to any kind of preventive detention, the apex court judgment said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/w1ytnl/article30798789.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VOTEFILE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/delhi-hc-dismisses-plea-seeking-voting-rights-for-prisoners/article30798790.ece
78,2020/02/12,Has Congress outsourced task of defeating BJP to State parties: Sharmishtha Mukherjee to Chidambaram,"Chidambaram, the former Finance Minister, had welcomed the AAP victory in Delhi polls, saying AAP won, bluff and bluster lost.

Senior Congress leader Sharmistha Mukherjee, a day after the Congress put up a miserable performance in the Delhi Assembly election, asked if the party should shut shop if it had decided that others will take on the BJP across States.

Replying to a tweet by P. Chidambaram who welcomed the AAP win as “defeat of bluff and bluster”, Ms. Mukherjee asked “With due respect sir, just want to know - has @INCIndia outsourced the task of defeating BJP to State parties? If not, then why r we gloating over AAP victory rather than being concerned abt our drubbing? And if ‘yes’, then we (PCCs) might as well close shop! (sic)”

The former Finance Minister had tweeted saying “AAP won, bluff and bluster lost. The people of Delhi, who are from all parts of India, have defeated the polarising, divisive and dangerous agenda of the BJP. I salute the people of Delhi who have set an example to other states that will hold their elections in 2021 and 2022.”

Ms. Mukherjee has been vocal since the party defeat on Tuesday, saying that the time for introspection was over and it was time for action.

“BJP playing divisive politics, Kejriwal playing ‘smart politics’ and what r we doing? Can we honestly say that we’ve done all to put our house in order?” Ms. Mukherjee asked. She added that the Congress was busy capturing Congress whereas other parties are capturing India. “If we are to survive, time to come out of exalted echo chambers!,” Ms. Mukherjee said.

79,2020/02/12,Asthana case: court expresses displeasure over CBI probe,"Why certain accused, who seem to have a bigger role in the case, were roaming free, asks Special CBI judge

A city court on Wednesday pulled up the CBI over the probe in a case against its former Special Director Rakesh Asthana and others, wondering why an accused having a bigger role was roaming free but the agency arrested its own Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP).

Special CBI Judge Sanjeev Aggarwal placed the charge sheet filed by the agency against Manoj Prasad, an accused in the case, for consideration on February 19. The CBI charge sheet says that its investigation did not reveal any role of public servants, giving a clean chit to Mr. Asthana and DSP Devender Kumar.

The court observed that the names of Mr. Asthana and Mr. Kumar, who was arrested in the case in 2018 and later released on bail, were mentioned in column 12 of the charge sheet as there was no evidence against them.

Also Read Who is Rakesh Asthana?

The CBI filed the charge sheet on Tuesday, a day before the matter was to come up in Delhi High Court, which in January set a four-week deadline for its submission in the lower court.

On a complaint from Hyderabad-based businessman Sana Sathish Babu, the agency registered the FIR in October 2018 naming Mr. Asthana, Mr. Kumar, Dubai-based investment banker Manoj and his brother Somesh Prasad as accused. The CBI has not yet arrested Mr. Manoj’s brother.

Mr. Babu had alleged that he paid over ₹3 crore in bribes through Mr. Manoj and his brother to get relief in a case against meat exporter Moin Qureshi.

In July 2019, the Enforcement Directorate arrested Mr. Babu in the money laundering case against Mr. Qureshi, who has been accused of receiving money from several people on the pretext of getting favours from public servants holding influential positions in the government.

80,2020/02/12,Supreme Court judge recuses himself from hearing plea by Omar Abdullah’s sister,"Sara Abdullah Pilot filed a petition against the government’s move to charge the former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister under the Public Safety Act

Supreme Court judge Justice Mohan M. Shantanagoudar recused himself on Wednesday from hearing a petition filed by Sara Abdullah Pilot, sister of former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah, against the government’s move to charge him under the Public Safety Act (PSA).

“I will not hear this matter,” the judge said immediately after the case was called for hearing before the three-judge Bench led by Justice N.V. Ramana and also comprising Justice Sanjiv Khanna.

Also Read Discourse on Kashmir has changed from independence to autonomy: Muzaffar Hussain Baig

The case is likely to be listed before another Bench on Thursday.

Ms. Pilot urged for issuance of a writ of habeas corpus for authorities to forthwith produce Mr. Omar Abdullah before the Supreme Court and set him at liberty.

The petition is represented by senior advocates Kapil Sibal and Gopal Sankaranarayanan.

Ms. Pilot said she was gravely concerned about the welfare, safety and security of her brother. He was already under detention from August 5 last year — the day the Centre removed the special rights of the Kashmiri people under Article 370 — when the PSA was slapped on him on February 5, 2020.

Ms. Pilot said she was shocked to learn that, just like what happened to their father, the government, had imposed a fresh lease of detention under the PSA on her brother too.

The petition explained that Mr. Omar Abdullah’s detention from August 5 under Section 107 Cr. PC (security for keeping the peace) was scheduled to end on February 5, 2020. His release was imminent. He had served the maximum period of detention.

‘Arbitrary exercise of power’

On February 5, the Executive Magistrate, instead of releasing him, ordered his further detention under Section 8 of the PSA of 1978 in an “arbitrary exercise of power”.

Ms. Pilot asked what the point was of detaining a man already detained through the long months of lockdown suffered across Jammu and Kashmir.

In fact, during the past six months there had been no effort by authorities to verify the truth behind the “information” that Mr. Omar Abdullah was a threat to peace. On the other hand, there were reams of material in the form of tweets and public statements vouching for his exemplary conduct to maintain peace, she said.

Ms. Pilot urged there was danger to her brother’s life and liberty.

The government, in its PSA dossier against charging Mr. Omar Abdullah, described him as a threat to public safety. It said he was “planning activities against the Union government”. It also highlighted “his popularity and potential to draw voters to polling booths”.

The writ petition argued that the detention order was illegal as it conflated ‘governmental policy’ with the ‘Indian State’, suggesting that any opposition to the former constituted a threat to the latter.

“This is wholly antithetical to a democratic polity and undermines the Indian Constitution,” it added.

Both the dossier and detention order contain “patently false and ridiculous material, essentially accusing the detenu of becoming a popular figure among general masses”. The grounds of detention were at best “illusory, vague and irrelevant”, Ms. Pilot contended.

The petition argued that if a petitioner’s personal liberty had already been taken away, there would be no fresh material or grounds for his further detention. Hence, the new detention order under the PSA was simply “motivated by malice”.

The petition narrated how at one point of time during his over six-month detention, Mr. Omar Abdullah had refused the government’s overture to set him free in exchange for an undertaking that he would not participate in public assemblies in connection with the de-operationalisation of Article 370.

Two other former J&K Chief Ministers — Mr. Omar Abdullah’s father Farooq Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti — remained detained under the PSA along with other leaders.

Mr. Omar Abdullah had been an MP from 1998-2009 and subsequently a member of the J&K Legislative Assembly, the petition said. He had been a Minister at the Centre twice, as Minister of State for Commerce and MoS for the Ministry of External Affairs.

“It is rare that those who have served the nation as Members of Parliament and have always stood by the national aspirations of India, are now perceived as a threat to the State,” the petition said.

Mr. Sibal, appearing for Ms. Pilot, came back to mention before Justice Ramana's Bench that he would not be available on Thursday. The court has now agreed to list the case on Friday.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/aelczl/article30798483.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDOMAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/supreme-court-judge-recuses-himself-from-hearing-plea-by-omar-abdullahs-sister/article30798485.ece
81,2020/02/12,"Assam’s final NRC data safe, says Home Ministry","The data went offline, leading to an uproar in Assam; technical issue is being resolved, says the Ministry.

The Ministry of Home Affairs on Wednesday claimed that all data of the Assam’s final National Register of Citizens (NRC) were “safe” after the data of exclusions and inclusions could not be accessed through the government portal.

A ministry spokesperson said “some technical issue regarding visibility in cloud storage was being resolved soon.”

IT major Wipro was given the contract to store the data in its cloud platform. Wipro said in a statement that “the IT services contract was not renewed by the authorities upon its expiry in October 2019. However, as a gesture of goodwill, Wipro continued to pay the hosting service fee until January end, 2020.”

The contract with Wipro expired in October last year and it was not renewed as the new NRC coordinator Hitesh Dev Sarma assumed charge only on December 24, an official explained.

Transferred to M.P.

Previous NRC coordinator Prateek Hajela was transferred to Madhya Pradesh in October last year on the orders of the a Special Bench of the Supreme Court led by former Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi. After Mr. Hajela’s transfer, Assam BJP chief Ranjeet Kumar Dass demanded that he give an account of ₹1,600 crore spent on the NRC.

The data went offline, leading to an uproar in Assam with the Opposition questioning the move.

Congress MP from Assam Gaurav Gogoi tweeted on Wednesday, “The loss of NRC data in Assam is deliberate by the BJP. How can a ₹1600 cr project be so unprofessional and not renew their membership of a cloud platform? This is to derail the current NRC exercise in Assam and demand a new one which will be independent of the Supreme Court.”

The final NRC published on August 31, 2019 was uploaded on www.nrcassam.nic.in. Around 19 lakh of the 3.4 crore applicants were excluded from the final list.

Plea to Registrar

Leader of the Opposition Debabrata Saikia wrote to the Registrar General of India and requested him to look into the matter urgently.

“It is a mystery as to why the online data should vanish all of a sudden, especially as the appeals process has not even started due to the go-slow attitude adopted by the NRC Authority. There is, therefore, ample scope to suspect that the disappearance of online data is a mala fide act,” he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/zlu52/article30435705.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH30RDNRC1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/assams-final-nrc-data-safe-says-ministry-of-home-affairs/article30798301.ece

To help the tribals shed the fear of Maoists, a weekly market has been established in Malkangiri district of Odisha.

The Thursday market opened on February 6 at Kartanpali village, a Maoist stronghold once. It caters for 30 remote villages in the Mathili block as well as villages of the Tentuliguma panchayat in adjoining Koraput district.

Chitrakonda Sub-Divisional Police Officer (SDPO) Sunaram Hembram opened the market, which he says will help to promote communication and trading among the inhabitants of remote villages. It will also bring the police and the administration closer to the public of the Maoist-affected region. Officials also get to know from those visiting the market the issues of amenities in their areas.

Earlier, residents of Kartanpali and other villages had to travel 20 kilometres to Mathili every week to buy and sell farm and forest produce. They had also faced the threat of being branded by Maoists as informants.

The residents of these areas themselves wanted a weekly market and they wholeheartedly supported the project when the administration proposed it. “The market has also enhanced the relationship between residents and security forces,” Mr. Hembram said.

Kartanpali Sarpanch Phulmati Jiram said the market would strengthen the relationship among the people and their living standards.

Forty-seven differently abled and underprivileged couples tied the nuptial knot at a mass wedding ceremony and took a pledge against the dowry system in Udaipur. Narayan Seva Sansthan, a philanthropic institution, organised the ceremony on Sunday for persons it has helped out through corrective surgery.

Thirty of the married couples were skilled through the Sansthan’s vocational training programmes. The institution has also recruited a few couples by offering them jobs that fit their capacities, making them financially independent and employable.

Gifts given

During the ceremony, the newly married couples were given household items and sarees, while social activists and guests present on the occasion wished them a happy conjugal life. The marriage was a celebration like any other wedding, which included the procession, photography, music and the wedding rituals.

Narayan Seva Sansthan president Prashant Agarwal said the institution had so far organised 34 mass weddings in which over 2,000 differently abled couples were married. “Differently abled people find it difficult to marry because of financial constraints and physical difficulties. This platform has enabled them to find their soul mates, who would support them in their struggle,” he said.

Mr. Agarwal said the objectives of mass weddings were social inclusion, accessible atmosphere and accountability of every differently abled person in order to help the couples lead a normal life and become a part of mainstream society.

New phase

Ramu Kumari and Ganpat from Pratapgarh, both of whom suffered from polio and had lost their fathers, were hopeful that their marriage would initiate a new phase in their lives. Arvind and Sonam from Barabanki took a pledge not to take dowry and generate public opinion against the social evil.

The Narayan Seva Sansthan has taken up activities such as artificial limb distribution, corrective surgery, skill education, healthcare support, free food offering and talent nurturing along, with mass wedding ceremonies for the differently abled to bring them to the mainstream.

90,2020/02/12,Society must take ownership to conserve water: Rajendra Singh,"M.P. government holds meet to discuss draft Right to Water Bill

Water conservationist Rajendra Singh on Tuesday asserted that it was imperative that society at large embrace the need to conserve water and take ownership of resources in order to ensure the revival of rivers and streams.

Speaking at the National Water Rights Convention to discuss the draft of the Right to Water Bill in Madhya Pradesh, he said, “Until now, activists been working alone. But with the government’s support, on the one hand water bodies could be protected, and on the other water use could be made judicious.”

Popularly known as the ‘Waterman of India’, Mr. Singh, who’s advising the State government on the proposed law, said, “Ownership of water bodies among masses has led to the revival of several rivers in a parched State like Rajasthan. With such laws, the model could be replicated across the country.”

Under the law, he added, streams, rivers and other water bodies would be identified, panchayats roped in, people would take the lead and an effort would be made to curb mining on riverbeds.

Pointing to the waning water resources in the State, Chief Minister Kamal Nath said, “11 of the Municipal Corporations and Councils get water once in four days, 50 once in three days and 117 once in two days. It’s a big challenge.”

Mr. Nath observed that despite rain, streams and rivers were drying up owing to negligence. “As many as 65 dams in the State have dried up due to unavailability of water and 164 reservoirs have met the same fate. Instead of moving ahead, we are going back,” he added.

The chief minister said new technologies must be leveraged in devising strategies to conserve water. “Technologies such as producing water from air could be useful. But those valid 20 years ago, aren’t relevant anymore. So there is an imminent need to figure out where new technologies could be used,” he added.

Stating that his political life was inextricably linked to water, Mr. Nath related an anecdote from 1979 in Chhindwara district. “I started my political career due to water problems. One night, as I walked on the road, I met 15-20 women carrying earthen lamps and plates, waiting at a spot for three hours. They said one of their sons couldn’t find a prospective bride as the water source was 12 km away. This was a lesson for me, and I decided to join politics to make my contribution.”

Mr. Nath cautioned that the next generation would not forgive the current one for its negligence. “During the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, I had said the talk of environment and forests was incomplete without the issue of water being raised.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/society-must-take-ownership-to-conserve-water-rajendra-singh/article30795812.ece
91,2020/02/12,SC backs move to demolish restaurants near Hampi site,"It says constructions were in violation of Mysore Act, 1961

The Supreme Court on Tuesday confirmed the Karnataka government authorities’ decision to demolish restaurants, hotels, guest houses and other buildings constructed in Virupapura Gaddi, an oval islet formed by the Tungabhadra river and located west of the Hampi World Heritage site.

Spelling relief for conservationists and a victory for the State government, a Bench of Justices Mohan M. Shantanagoudar and R. Subhash Reddy concluded that the constructions were in violation of the Mysore Ancient and Historical Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act of 1961.

Agreeing with the Karnataka High Court decision that the Hampi World Heritage Area Management Authority was empowered to order the demolition of the illegal buildings on the islet, the apex court ordered the authorities to proceed with their demolition work within a month of this judgment. “It is incumbent upon the authority not to turn a blind eye,” Justice Shantanagoudar, who authored the verdict, held.

The court upheld the validity of a 1988 State notification that “clearly indicates the entire village of Virupapura Gaddi as a protected zone.” It said a place need not necessarily boast a monument to be protected.

“It is possible for certain areas to be protected independent of the existence of monuments, if there is a reasonable belief that they contain ruins or relics of historical or archaeological importance,” the court observed

Historical importance

The court further notes how the Archaeological Survey of India has itself recognised the historical importance of Virupapura Gaddi.

“It appears that the government had considered the comprehensive geographical entity of the area, including attributes like its landscape, prehistoric vestiges and water systems. Thus, the 1988 notification issued under Section 19(3) of the 1961 Act declaring Virupapura Gaddi as a protected area can’t be said to be without basis,” the court said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pe17ps/article30795727.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11BGVIRUPAPURA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-backs-move-to-demolish-restaurants-near-hampi-site/article30795728.ece

The CBI on Tuesday conducted searches in connection with the case against Educomp Solutions Limited (ESL) and others for allegedly cheating an SBI-led consortium of 13 banks to the tune of ₹1,955 crore.

Those named in the case are the company, its managing director Shantanu Prakash, guarantor Jagdish Prakash, subsidiary Edu Smart Services Private Limited and directors Vijay Kumar Choudhary and Vinod Kumar Dandona.

“The searches were carried out at eight places in Delhi, Dehradun and Gurugram,” said a CBI official.

According to the FIR, the fraud was detected during a forensic audit of the report submitted by the company. The accused persons had falsified the accounts and forged the documents to “gain unlawfully” at the cost of the banks’ funds.

The ESL, incorporated in 1994, was the flagship company of the Educomp group. Edu Smart Services, Educomp Infrastructure & School Management, Educomp School Management Limited and Educomp Infrastructure Services Private Limited were the other major companies of the group, said the FIR.

The flagship company’s primary operations were to create, develop and provide digital educational content in classrooms. It operated under brand ‘Smartclass’ and Information and Communications Technology and vocational education under brand ‘Edureach’.

It entered into a tripartite agreement with schools for smart classes. It also supplied hardware and digital content to its subsidiary on a tripartite agreement basis. The subsidiary securitised the contracts and raised loans from various banks, passed on the loan proceeds to the ESL as part of consideration for the hardware and content.

The balance was paid to the ESL over the contract period, typically of five years, as and when received from the respective schools. Later, the subsidiary’s receivables were transferred to the ESL.

The accused facilitated diversion of funds. Loans to the related parties were written off, sales were booked without contractual obligations, forged documents were used to get the credit facilities sanctioned and siphon off funds, alleged the banks.

The outstanding as on May 31, 2017, was ₹1,955 crore against the loans, which were declared non-performing assets in 2016.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/educomp-case-cbi-conducts-searches-at-eight-locations/article30795805.ece
93,2020/02/12,"1 killed, another injured in firing at AAP MLA Naresh Yadav’s convoy in Delhi","The victim, Ashok Mann, was with the Mehrauli MLA in the open car when the incident happened

A 45-year-old Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) volunteer was shot dead and another injured after unidentified miscreants allegedly fired at an open car of the party’s Mehrauli MLA Naresh Yadav while he was returning from a temple following his win in the Assembly election.

Police says the prime suspect in the case has been held.

Ingit Pratap Singh, ADCP (South West), said that the incident happened around 11 p.m.

Ashok Mann and Harender were in the vehicle with Mr. Yadav when a man came out of the crowd and opened fire, aiming at Mr. Maan.

“The man fired eight rounds out of which Ashok received six bullets injuries while Harender suffered two bullet injuries. They were rushed to a hospital by other volunteers and police was informed,” said a police officer.

During treatment Mr. Mann succumbed to injuries while Mr. Harender is undergoing treatment.

“The attack was the outcome of personal enmity, and Ashok was the only target. In November, an FIR was registered against Ashok under IPC Section for attempt to murder, and attack could be related to it. They were verifying other details in the case,” said Mr. Singh.

Mr. Singh added that an FIR under IPC for murder and attempt to murder has been registered in Kishangarh Police station.

94,2020/02/12,Congress knew of its fate: Kamal Nath,"Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath on Tuesday said the Congress was aware of its performance in the Delhi Assembly election, where it didn’t secure even a single seat.

“We knew it, our organisation did,” he told reporters in Bhopal. “However, the biggest thing is the BJP’s fate. They make so many tall claims; even the Centre is in Delhi.”

He said the BJP’s “real face” was being recognised across the country. “They employ only diversionary tactics. Any Central Minister or Prime Minister Narendra Modi doesn’t talk about unemployment or the agrarian sector... [They talk only about] nationalism, Pakistan and the CAA.”

Writing on Twitter later, Mr. Nath said, “Although the verdict is not favourable to the Congress, we’ll review it at the party level and discuss it too, but this is a strong lesson for the BJP.” “The BJP gave everything in this election, made strident efforts to distract voters from issues and mislead everyone and served lies, but they didn’t succeed.”

On the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, Mr. Nath asked the Centre, “Is there a war? Is there a refugee crisis? Then what was the need to pass the law, that too, by holding a session of Parliament until midnight. They just want to send across a divisive message.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/congress-knew-of-its-fate-kamal-nath/article30795682.ece
95,2020/02/12,State to set up Financial Services Limited,"‘The new entity, an NBFC under Finance Department, will help in proper utilisation of funds’

The State Cabinet has decided to establish the A.P. State Financial Services Limited, a Non-Banking Finance Corporation (NBFC), under the Finance Department.

The new entity will help in proper utilisation of funds, according to Information and Public Relations (I&PR) Minister Perni Venkataramaiah (Nani).

Gujarat model

Addressing the media after the Cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Mr. Nani said that the government departments could park their surplus funds with the corporation and earn interest on it.

“It will help in better and optimum utilisation of the resources. The Government of Gujarat had done a similar exercise in 1992 and achieved good results,” the Minister said.

Agri council

Mr. Nani said the Cabinet also decided to set up the A.P. State Agriculture Council on lines of the medical council and the higher education council to monitor the standards, infrastructure, agricultural and horticultural courses offered at colleges and universities.

The proposed council would also be a regulating mechanism for supply of quality seed, fertilizers, pesticides, irrigation technology, marketing and promotion of agriculture produce. It would also monitor the functioning of the public and private organisations in the sector, he said, adding, “There is no such council at the national level.”

Free power

The Cabinet approved the proposal to establish the A.P. Green Energy Corporation for providing free power for nine hours during day time to the agricultural sector. The Genco would be permitted to establish solar parks to generate 10,000 Mega Watts.

“The Non-Conventional Energy Resources Ministry will provide financial assistance of ₹20 lakh per MW. The State government will tap these funds,” the Minister said.

“It is estimated that ₹35,000 crore to ₹40,000 crore is required for the project. The Genco can sell power to the government at ₹3 per unit, while it is ₹7 per unit now. The government is incurring a huge expenditure on free power to agriculture. The subsidy will be around ₹8,000 crore. Between 50,000 and one lakh new pump-sets will be added every year,” the Minister said.

The demand for power and subsidy was on the rise. The previous government paid ₹3,000 crore to ₹4,000 crore towards free power to the Discoms. As a result, the Discoms were debt-ridden. About ₹32,000 crore dues were pending.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/state-to-set-up-financial-services-limited/article30804054.ece
96,2020/02/12,"‘Plans afoot to set up skill varsity,centres of excellence in State’","Idea is to churn out job-ready youth, says Industries Minister Mekapati

Minister for Industries and Commerce, IT and Skill Development and Training Mekapati Goutham Reddy said the government was in the process of setting up a university for skill development and 25 centres of excellence (one each in 25 Lok Sabha constituencies) to equip youth with the skills that were required to land decent jobs.

He observed that though the Apprentices Act had come into force in the early 1960s, nothing much happened on the skill development front.

The government was striving to bridge the skill gap to meet the needs of job-seekers and employers, he said

Participating as chief guest in a workshop on the National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme (NAPS) organised by the A.P. State Skill Development Corporation (APSSDC) here on Wednesday, Mr. Goutham Reddy said countries like Singapore, Germany and Japan attached top priority to skill development and by doing so, they could vastly improve the quality of their human resources which was crucial for economic growth.

The scope of the Apprentices Act in India had been expanded to all sectors after certain amendments were made to it in 2016.

Mr. Goutham Reddy said the government laid greater emphasis on the improvement of skills of youth and it was making a good progress.

The government took the skill development programmes beyond ITI, engineering and polytechnic courses to areas where jobs were available on a large scale.

Advanced courses

APSSDC Chairman Challa Madhusudan Reddy said advanced courses were being offered to youth to give them the competitive edge and that the apprenticeship programs were considered by the government as a significant step towards providing 75% employment in industries to the local youth.

“We are not opposed to the setting up of High Court in Kurnool,” said JSP president Pawan Kalyan.

Clearing the air on the party’s stand on the issue while addressing a public meeting here on Wednesday, Mr. Pawan Kalyan said that comprehensive development of the Rayalaseema region was necessary.

“Besides High Court, the people of the region need water and jobs,” he said.

Referring to the shortage of water, Mr. Pawan Kalyan questioned, “Why should there be water scarcity in district when all the canals and pipelines run through it? Water is directly going to the lands of powerful leaders, instead of the people.”

“Party activists of Kurnool and Panyam recently told me that they had not been getting water for the last 10-12 days,” he added.

“Why are farmers migrating despite having 10-15 acres of land? Why is water not reaching the farms though the Handri-Neeva canals are in the district? Why aren’t tanks being filled through lift irrigation? Kurnool will not have water shortage if a project worth ₹244 crore is constructed. Why is it not being done?” he questioned.

Stating that the district lacked strong leaders, the JSP president said, “Leaders have to come from the people. Justice will be done only if they come forward.”

Referring to the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), Mr. Pawan Kalyan said, “No one can separate Muslims from India.” He later accused the Congress of spreading misinformation on CAA.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/jsp-not-opposed-to-setting-up-of-hc-in-kurnool-pawan/article30804017.ece
98,2020/02/12,The ‘mountain men and women’ of Visakha Agency,"Tribal people of various hamlets join hands to lay a 15-km road in Anantagiri mandal

We heard about Dashrath Manjhi, a poor labourer, who, on his own, had laid a road by cutting across a rocky mountain at Gehlaur village near Gaya in Bihar, after his pregnant wife died as medical care was beyond reach due to lack of road connectivity.

An award-wining biopic was made on him, ‘Manjhi – The Mountain Man’, in 2015, starring Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Radhika Apte.

Probably, the tribal people living in the interior hamlets of Anantagiri mandal in Visakha Agency do not know who Manjhi is and may not have seen the film.

But they turned out to be the ‘mountain men and women’, as they set on an onerous task of laying a 15-km road, cutting across dense forests and hillocks.

‘No connectivity’

“I have not seen a road connecting my village to the mandal headquarters since my birth. Many people, as a result, died as proper medical care was out of reach. Pregnant women and newborns died while being carried in crude dolis,” said Madala Karriamma, a 65-year-old woman, from Bonneru in Anantagiri mandal.

The Agency, which is spread across 6,200 sq km, has over 2,200 tribal hamlets, and about 1,100 of them do not have any form of road connectivity.

The situation in Anantagiri, one of the 11 mandals in the Agency, is similar.

Team effort

But there seems to be light at the end of the tunnel as the residents of nine hamlets in Anantagiri decided to lay the road on their own. They are led by Madala Venkata Rao, a third year civil engineering student hailing from Bonneru.

“Araku is about 80 km from my hamlet and Devarapalli, the nearest town, is located at a distance of 30 km. And my hamlet has no road connectivity to these places. There is no road till Cheedimetta, which is about 15 km from Bonneru. From Cheedimetta, there is a road to Devarapalli. We decided to lay a ‘kuccha’ road on our own up to Cheedimetta as our efforts to convince the authorities to lay one went in vain,” Mr. Venkata Rao said.

About 300 people, who included men, women and even senior citizens, from hamlets such as Bonneru, Nadummavalasa and Pandirimamidi in Vinukota panchayat; Putikaputtu and Jagadalamamidi in Kevarala panchayat; and a few others joined hands to lay the road that would benefit about 2,000 tribal people living in the nine hamlets.

“We have been working for the last 10 days, and about 10 km of the road has already been laid. The remaining 5 km will be completed in another week’s time,” said Mr. Venkata Rao.

A person with knowledge in civil engineering, Mr. Venkata Rao first motivated the educated youth of the village and later took up the cause with the village elders.

“It took some time to convince them. But once they agreed, there is no looking back,” he said.

Since there is no funding or payment, the villagers have decided to depute at least one person from each family for the work on a daily basis. They are using their own tools and bring their own food and water.

Pucca roads

Upon coming to know of the development, Integrated Tribal Development Authority (ITDA) Project Officer D.K. Balajim said a report for laying roads had been sent to the government. “Once we get the technical sanctions, pucca roads will be laid by the year of this end,” he said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/h2101x/article30804004.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13VJPG4-ROAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/the-mountain-men-and-women-of-visakha-agency/article30804005.ece

‘Perali Poguru,’ a wetland near Bapatla, finds a place among the five wetlands in the State of the 100 identified by the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) for restoration and preservation. The tiny wetland, just about 4 km from Suryalanka beach, is frequented by migratory birds and has emerged as a new tourist destination.

The other four wetlands — Coringa (near Kakinada), Pulicat (Nellore), Kolleru (West Godavari ) and Nelapattu (Nellore) —are among the five identified by the A.P. Forest Department for preservation. The decision to preserve the endangered wetlands, taken at the Conference of Parties to United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD CoP 14), is part of the Union Government’s ‘har ghar mein jal’ (water in every house) programme.

The 30th meeting of Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals is being held from February 15 to February 22 at Gandhi Nagar in Gujarat. The Forest Department would showcase marine biodiversity and coastal conservation of the State at this event.

Endangered species

“The long coastline of AP is home to some of endangered aquatic mammals such as dophins, sperm whales, and olive ridley turtles and a vast mangrove forest cover. We will showcase the rich biodiversity of the State at the special Indian pavilion being set up at the conference,’’ Principal Chief Conservator of Forests and Chief Wild Life Warden D. Nalini Mohan told The Hindu on Wednesday.

The Forest Department recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Greenco Systems Pvt Ltd to preserve the Great Indian Bustard, a rare bird species, at Orvakal in Kurnool district with the latter promising ₹11.63 crore for solar fencing.

Rayalaseema Rashtra Samithi (RRS) president Kuncham Venkata Subba Reddy appealed to Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy to set up the capital city anywhere in Rayalaseema or give statehood for the backward region.

In a memorandum which he submitted to the CM on Wednesday, Mr. Venkata Subba Reddy said that the proposed Rayalaseema State would comprise Kadapa, Kurnool, Chittoor, Anantapur, Nellore, Prakasam, Ballari, Kolar, Krishnagiri and Vellore.

He said it was fair to carve out the separate State to undo the injustice which had been meted to it for decades.

As far as Amaravati and Visakhapatnam were concerned, since all committees have advised against their development as the capital cities, the government should consider Rayalaseema for capital location, Mr. Venkata Subba Reddy said.

Rayalaseema remained backward as the Sribagh Pact was brushed aside by successive governments.

BJP leader Byreddy Rajasekhar Reddy has said that a representation would be submitted to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking construction of reservoirs worth 200 tmcft in Rayalaseema.

Mr. Rajasekhar Reddy protested outside the irrigation office in the city on Wednesday seeking construction of irrigation projects to the drought-hit region.

Gundrevula reservoir

The BJP leader claimed that water is being sent downstream as there is no storage capacity in the district. He demanded that the government take up construction of Gundrevula reservoir and increase its capacity. “Gundrevula must have 50 tmcft capacity instead of the proposed 20 tmcft,” he said.

Speaking about the Tungabhadra dam at Hospet in Karanataka, Mr. Reddy said that the capacity of the dam must be increased so that the issues of three States — Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Telangana — could be solved.

“Muchumarri Lift Irrigation Scheme must be dedicated to Rayalaseema. Half of Handri Neeva Lift Irrigation Scheme must be dedicated to HNSS canals and the other half must be dedicated to KC canal,” he added.

Winning is important, but playing with good sportsmanship is even more important, according to N. Arjuna Rao, international kabaddi player and Chief Staff and Welfare Inspector of the Sports Department in South Central Railway, Vijayawada. He was addressing the inaugural of the sports and cultural festival of School of Planning and Architecture (SPA), Vijayawada, on Wednesday.

Mr. Rao said students should not be hesitant to opt for a career in sports as it offered a bright future and cited the example of P.V. Sindhu, who had become a popular face across the world by excelling in badminton.

SPA Vijayawada director Minakshi Jain urged the students to make use of the platform to showcase their talent in the series of activities lined up for them. She said sports not only help people connect with each other, but also promote unity and harmony in a big way.

Sports secretary in Krishna University N. Srinivasa Rao said the students pursuing professional courses should also participate in sports activities on a regular basis. It was imperative not just for physical fitness but also for wholesome development of an individual.

He said sports also promote self-confidence, team spirit, leadership qualities, social skills, discipline and brain power besides improving the energy levels.

A technical team from RITES, a public engineering agency, on Wednesday started the Standard Penetration Test (SPT) on land and at sea, assessing the soil properties and penetration resistance in 2,800 acres of land where it is proposed to develop the Machilipatnam deep sea port at Tapasipudi village in Krishna district.

The test is being carried out under the aegis of the Machilipatnam Urban Development Authority (MUDA).

Transport Minister Perni Nani, who accompanied the RITES technical team, said: “The SPT, commonly known as soil test, is being done in six locations in the proposed port area on the land front and three locations in the deep waters as a part of preparations for the port construction.”

“The agency has been entrusted with the task of preparing estimations and technical studies to begin construction activity of the port. The State government has set up a Special Purpose Vehicle to develop the port by 2022,” said Mr. Nani.

CCIL role

On the role of the Container Corporation of India Limited (CCIL) in the port project, Mr. Nani said: “The State government alone will develop the port through the SPV and the CCIL will be roped in the port operations.”

The State government, in principle, recently agreed to allow the CCIL to be part of developing the deep sea port as one of the prime stakeholders.

105,2020/02/12,MUDA expansion plan gets CM’s nod,"12 mandals to be included in the urban development authority

Now, it is official. Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has okayed the proposal to expand the jurisdiction of the Machilipatnam Urban Development Authority (MUDA) by including 12 mandals into it.

Information and Public Relations Minister Perni Nani said on Wednesday that the Chief Minister gave his nod for the expansion of the MUDA’s jurisdiction.

In January, the MUDA submitted the plan on expanding its jurisdiction to the Department of Municipal Administration and Urban Development.

The total area to be included in the MUDA is 2,076 square km in 242 villages of 12 mandals -- Pedana, Gudiwada, Gudlavalleru, Batnumilli, Kruthivennu, Mudinepalli, Kalidindi, Mandavalli, Kaikaluru, Koduru, Nagayalanka, and Avanigadda. The total population of these mandals is 6.55 lakh as per the 2011 Census.

Once the mandals are included, the total extent of the MUDA jurisdiction will be 2,503 sq. km. In 2017, the State government constituted the MUDA, primarily to acquire land required for the Machilipatnam port and Machilipatnam industrial corridor, apart from encouraging the investors on various fronts.

More investments likely

It has been stated in the proposal that the jurisdiction expansion will attract more investment on the Machilipatnam coast.

“The State government is preparing to design the MUDA into a complete urban development body instead of an agency binding itself with the task of acquiring land for the projects. The discussions are also in progress to merge some areas in the CRDA region with the MUDA,” said Mr. Nani.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/qmqf5r/article30801984.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13ONGMUDA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/muda-expansion-plan-gets-cms-nod/article30801985.ece
106,2020/02/12,Plan to give facelift to 45-year-old Karveti Nagaram PHC,"Steps will be taken to upgrade it to 50-bedded hospital, says medical officer

The government primary health centre (PHC) at Karveti Nagaram in Chittoor district, which suffered years of neglect, is now all set to turn into a 50-bedded community health centre much to the happiness of over one lakh population in several mandals of GD Nellore Assembly constituency.

The PHC was inaugurated at Karveti Nagaram in 1975 by the then Chief Minister Jalagam Vengal Rao on a sprawling 10-acre land donated by a local philanthropist. The hospital then catered to the medical needs of about 50 panchayats in the present mandals of S.R. Puram, Vedurukuppam, Palasamudram and Karveti Nagaram. Hundreds of pregnant women were served with institutional deliveries, apart from family planning operations.

Interestingly, the epidemic of anthrax was reportedly first detected in the country at Karveti Nagaram mandal in early 2000, creating a commotion in the public and government circles. This development turned the PHC at Karveti Nagaram into the centre of attraction. However, since a decade, the hospital slowly started slipping into the oblivion. The issues such as allegations of non-availability of doctors and paramedical staff and defunct operation theatre had crept in. The quarters meant for the duty doctors and staff are now in a dilapidated condition.

Thousands of patients from half of the GD Nellore Assembly constituency are now depending on the government hospital at Puttur, and SVRR Hospital and SVIMS hospital at Tirupati, particularly the pregnant women, poison and post-mortem cases.

Deputy Chief Minister K. Narayanaswamy, who represents GD Nellore Assembly constituency, is planning to resurrect the lost glory of the hospital, promising ample funds. The district medical and health authorities have deputed senior medical officer (Nagari constituency in-charge) P. Ravi Raju to accomplish the task.

The medical officer, who inspected the hospital at Karveti Nagaram on Wednesday, said that the immediate steps would include clearing of bushes and repairs to the defunct infrastructure such as wards, toilets and disused blocks. “The operation theatre, which is now dysfunctional, is going to be ready by the next one week,” Dr. Ravi Raju said.

Emergency drugs

The official said that in tune with the government’s decision to upgrade the PHC into 50-bedded hospital, “we are going to procure all the emergency drugs, besides initiation of family planning operations and institutional deliveries.” This would help a population of more than 75,000 in several panchayats to avoid travelling to Puttur, Nagari or Tirupati hospitals, he added,

He said that a decision to either reconstruct or repair the staff quarters would be taken after consultation with the district administration. “Mr. Narayanaswamy is seriously contemplating to keep the Karveti Nagaram hospital on track and to cater to a large number of population in the region. This would bring additional number of medical officers and paramedical staff to the hospital, apart from rapid changes in the emergency services and mobile health care,” Dr. Ravi Raju said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/hqomzb/article30801446.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13-VJ-PHC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/plan-to-give-facelift-to-45-year-old-karveti-nagaram-phc/article30801447.ece

YONO (You Only Need One), the bank’s integrated digital banking platform that lets its customers access various financial products such as online transfer, train/flight booking and utility payments, gained strength recently with the introduction of ‘YONO Cash.’ It is a feature claimed to be the first by any bank in India, including private and foreign banks. The feature does away with the ATM card and facilitates cash withdrawal at any of the bank’s cash points (ATMs) through the app with the help of a One Time Password (OTP). A customer can withdraw up to ₹20,000 a day through this app, which is apart from the maximum limit available for withdrawal through an ATM card.

‘Entirely free’

“Around 10 lakh Savings Bank customers in Andhra Pradesh have started using our app in the current financial year starting April 1, 2019. Similarly, we have over two lakh customers in the Tirupati zone comprising Chittoor, Kadapa and Nellore districts. In Tirupati city alone, 48,000 customers have downloaded this application,” SBI Deputy General Manager (Tirupati zone) P. Krishna Balaji said, adding that the service was entirely free and no amount would be levied on the amount withdrawn.

Addressing a media conference here on Wednesday, he said the bank was always ahead in upgrading its facilities and offering new schemes to its customers. The SBI would work in tune with the Union government’s aim to promote digital banking and offer enhanced transparency. “The new system will obviate the need for one to carry the ATM card, thus eliminating the scope for security compromise in the form of password theft or card cloning,” Mr. Balaji added.

SBI Regional Manager (Tirupati) R.B. Manoj Kumar, Chief Manager (digital banking) Sriman Narayana and Public Relations Officer B. Bhaskar Reddy were among those present.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/l8gj4o/article30801432.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13-VJ-SBI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/sbi-keen-to-popularise-yono-cash-says-official/article30801433.ece
108,2020/02/12,"Bless or compliment, or just sit silently in a corner of your house, YSRCP MLA Roja to Naidu","People of the State are just heaving a sigh of relief after having undergone ordeals during the five-year TDP rule, she quipped

TIRUMALA Fire brand and YSRCP Nagari MLA R.K. Roja appealed to TDP supremo N. Chandrababu naidu to either congratulate and compliment the Chief Minister Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy for implementing a slew of welfare schemes and riding the State on the path of development, or just sit silently in a corner of his house.

Speaking to the media on Wednesday, Roja who is known for her lung power and ascerbic style said: “People of the State are just heaving a sigh of relief after having undergone tumultuous ordeals during the five year TDP rule with the progressive schemes implemented by the state government. At this juncture if Naidu again embarks on a Chaitanya Yatra there is every danger that the State will be back under the cruel grip of drought which is not at all desirable.”

Only for political mileage

Going hammer and tongs she wondered: “With what face will Mr. Naidu undertake the State tour after having voted against the proposed three capitals? The people of the State are very intelligent, and am sure will never fall a prey to his deceptive tactics whose ultimate aim is to gain political mileage.”

Even though there are several lakh beneficiaries under every welfare scheme being implemented by the State like Rythu Bharosa, Amma Vodi, Pensioners, Auto Mitra, YSR Cheyutha, it is really unfortunate that Mr. Naidu is indulging either in mud slinging or politicizing them to serve his political interests, Ms. Roja rued.

State is testimony

“The State stands testimony to the way Mr. Naidu, who boasts of serving the State for 13 long years encouraged the Speaker to abuse his powers by sitting in the galleries of the revered Council Hall,” she alleged.

She also charged Naidu for trying to downplay the newly commissioned Disha Police Station and Disha App which she said was introduced with a sole intention of protecting the women, school and college going girls and working women.

Mincing no words she alleged the Nara Lokesh sponsored social media was spitting venom against the YSRCP cadres. Should her party cadres also start lodging complaints against the wrong and humiliating messages posted with a malafide intention of belittling them than more than 70 to 80 percent of TDP leaders will be behind bars she warned.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/bless-or-compliment-or-sit-silently-mla-roja-tells-naidu/article30799868.ece

111,2020/02/12,8-member ‘rice-pulling gang’ held in Chittoor,"Businessman from Tamil Nadu was cheated of ₹2.10 crore

Chittoor police on Tuesday nabbed an eight-member inter-State rice-pulling gang at Gudupalle-Kamasandra road near Kuppam, and seized ₹1.29 crore in cash besides two SUVs, a motorcycle, and a trunk.

Naveen Kumar, a merchant from Tirupattur in Tamil Nadu, had lodged a complaint against the accused with the Gudupalle police last month, claiming that he was cheated of ₹2.10 crore by the gang who had promised to give him a ‘rice-pulling vessel’.

Superintendent of Police S. Senthil Kumar and Additional SP K. Krishnarjuna Rao formed a special party headed by Palamaner DSP S. Arifulla. After a month-long investigation spread over Tamil Nadu and Karnataka States, police were able to gather vital leads pertaining to the case.

On Tuesday (February 11), the special party obtained reliable information that the gang members were on the move at Gudupalle (Kuppam rural)-Karnataka border, carrying huge cash. Around 1.30 p.m., the special party intercepted two SUVs and a motorcycle at a culvert near Gudupalle and nabbed all the eight accused. Police seized ₹1.29 crore in cash from their possession.

The seized cash included ₹75 lakh which the accused had allegedly wrapped in a polythene bag and buried in a pit near a hotel at Gudupalle while attempting to evade a police patrolling team a few weeks ago.

The accused were identified as Mahadeva and Sivakumar of Kamasandra town, S. Gangadhar of Chikballapur, Dhanasekhar of Srirampur in Bengaluru Rural, Ramachandra Naidu and Sekhar of Krishnagiri district, S. Vinayagam of Kanchipuram, and Seenappa of Gudupalle in Chittoor district — all aged between 19 and 43.

The accused were constantly travelling between the villages near Kuppam junction, luring gullible villagers and merchants with the ‘rice-pulling vessels’.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/m6uu7v/article30798109.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12-VJ-CHITTOORGANG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/8-member-rice-pulling-gang-held-in-chittoor/article30798110.ece

Former India cricket captain M.S. Dhoni visited Prashanti Nilayam in Puttaparthi for the first time on Tuesday.

He arrived at the Puttaparthi airport on a chartered flight in the morning and had a darshan of Sri Sathya Sai Baba’s samadhi at Sai Kulwant Hall.

From Prashanti Nilayam, he went to the super-speciality hospital to meet Dr. Muthu Kumar, who is on the panel of external doctors for the Indian cricket team and also for Dhoni.

113,2020/02/12,Police officer’s son says he hasnot done business with govt.,"‘Never used my father or his office for any business activity or financial gain’

With the needle of suspicion pointing at him, A. Chetan Sai Krishna, son of IPS officer A.B. Venkateswara Rao, who has been placed under suspension, sought to clarify that he has not done any business with any government till now.

He said that he was forced to ”declare the facts” as his father was a government servant having certain limitations in speaking out. “Being a victim of (a) politically motivated disinformation campaign and mudslinging, I’m making a request to stop dragging my name on to the streets. Otherwise, I have no option but to seek legal remedies for defamation,” he said.

In a statement on Tuesday, Mr. Krishna said that he never used his father or his office for any business activity or financial gain. He said he had not done any business with any government or government organisation, either in Andhra Pradesh or any other State in India, until now. Neither did he participate in any government-related tenders till today. All the business activities had been in the private sector, he said.

Mr. Krishna said he graduated in engineering in the U.S. and worked in California for three years before returning to India in 2017. Stating that he was born and brought up in Hyderabad, he said he was native of Andhra Pradesh.

Though Hyderabad was more suitable for the initial business idea, Vijayawada was chosen to start the business expecting better opportunities and growth in the new State, even with the expected delay. And also wanted to be nearer to the family, he said.

Mr. Krishna said he registered a start-up in May 2017 and started to work. Since then, launched many startups till October 2019, having partners in some of them. None of them was a shell company. “Some of them did not do well due to lack of opportunities and lack of time on my part.” That’s the nature of startups — some of them don’t progress, some don’t succeed. “I have been filing statutory returns,” he added.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/police-officers-son-says-he-hasnot-done-business-with-govt/article30798041.ece
114,2020/02/12,Gas leak creates panic on highway,"LPG tanker hit by heavy vehicle

A gas leak of a different kind had sent panic waves on a State highway in East Godavari on Tuesday. This is the second gas leak reported in about 10 days. No casualties were reported in the fresh incident. This happened even before people of the district could overcome the trauma of a natural gas pipeline leak.

According to Ravulapalem police, an earthmover being transported by a multi-wheel vehicle hit an LPG tanker from behind making a hole in it and gas began leaking with high pressure on the national highway, near Eethakota toll gate. The tanker was proceeding from Visakhapatnam to Hyderabad with 18 tonnes of gas when the accident occurred.

Regional Fire Officer (RFO) G. Srinivasulu said the AP State Disaster Response Force and a HPCL rescue team with the help of police plugged the leak after one and a half hours. “Fire tenders from Kothapeta, Tanuku, Kovvur and Tadepalligudem participated in the operation,” the RFO told The Hindu.

“It was a minor leakage and no casualties were reported,” said an HPCL official of East Godavari district.

“Gas started leaking around 2.45 p.m. and it was stopped at 4.10 p.m. Police diverted traffic as a precautionary measure and alerted the HPCL officials, who deputed the rescue team from Veeralankapalli HP gas plant in Gokavaram mandal of the district,” said Ravulapalem circle inspector V. Krishna.

Driver booked

A case has been registered against the earthmover driver under Sections 336 and 285 IPC. The tanker has been sent to the nearest gas plant for safe unloading.

“Traffic has been diverted at Divancheruvu and Gundugolanu and measures taken to prevent ignition at the spot,” said a DSP.

On February 2, gas leakage occurred from a well at Uppudi village in Katrenikona mandal in the district which created panic in the region. The ONGC, fire and expert teams from other private gas exploration companies plugged the leakage after two days.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/1w0fy4/article30796106.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12VJRJGASLEAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/gas-leak-creates-panic-on-highway/article30796107.ece

118,2020/02/12,Not many takers for onions at ₹35 a kg in Chittoor!,"Consumers expect price to drop below ₹20, say observers

After remaining a cause of constant bother for consumers for nearly three months, onion prices are no longer a hot topic in tail-end Chittoor district, though being sold at ₹100 for 3 kg, as against ₹240 a kg in November first week. In spite of the vast difference in price and availability of good quality onions, it seems the consumers are in no hurry to stock them.

The onion prices took a sudden jump in October from below ₹20 a kg to ₹60. In a couple of weeks, the price crossed ₹100 a kg, and went up to ₹240. With the intervention of the vigilance and marketing officials, the prices eased a bit but onions kept trading at ₹140 a kg till the first week of January. Later, the prices fluctuated between ₹80 and ₹60 till the last week.

All of a sudden, vendors have hit the roads and streets selling onions at ₹100 for 3 kg in the past four days. They have been procuring the stocks in bulk from Kurnool and surrounding areas, and hawking it in streets and at arterial junctions of Madanapalle, Chittoor, Palamaner, Puttur, Nagari and Srikalahasti. However, the recorded announcements on public address system like “3 kg onions for ₹100” have largely failed to enthuse buyers, who, observers say, expect the prices to fall below ₹20 a kg by month end.

Consumption levels

Meanwhile, consumption of onions has not yet reached liberal proportions in the kitchens, both at homes and hotels. The onion crisis came as a first of its kind in tail-end Chittoor district. While a majority of families had drastically cut consumption, hoteliers resorted to alternative measures with cabbage and garlic, and avoiding certain dishes. This development had also indirectly impacted the meat, poultry and fish business.

Assistant Director (Marketing) P. Gopi told The Hindu that the traders were now procuring onion stocks from Kurnool region. “This Kurnool variety is generally not liked much by the consumers due to its mild flavour compared to the Nagpur and Pune varieties. The Nagpur variety is now selling at ₹42 a kg in most markets. We are expecting that the prices of both varieties will drastically come down by month end,” he said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/1vh2jn/article30796056.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12VJONIONS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/not-many-takers-for-onions-at-35-a-kg-in-chittoor/article30796057.ece

120,2020/02/12,"Fearing corona virus attack, man kills self","Doctors had advised him to wear a mask to check spread of viral fever

A middle-aged man, who reportedly feared to have contracted the corona virus (nCoV), allegedly committed suicide near Srikalahasti town on Tuesday.

As news trickled in on the virus-related deaths from all over, an ailing K. Balakrishna (50), a resident of Seshamanaidu Kandriga in Thottambedu mandal in Chittoor district, was admitted to Sri Venkateswara Ramnarain Ruia Government General Hospital in Tirupati last week for fever. The doctors diagnosed him of some viral infection and suggested him to wear a mask to prevent its spread to others, which made him suspect that he had contracted the dreaded virus.

On return to his village two days later, the “delusional” patient was allegedly “strongly convinced” that he had indeed contracted the virus and underwent extreme stress. More than the fever, it was the suspicion that he might have contracted the virus that reportedly gave him sleepless nights.

“He was also worried that the virus could spread in the family and also in the town because of him,” his son K. Balamurali told a section of the media. Apart from staying away from family members, he even started chasing his own kin away

Balakrishna left his home on the intervening night of Monday and Tuesday and allegedly hanged himself to a tree near his mother’s grave.

As he had bolted the house from outside, the family members realised his absence only after some time and were shocked to find his body hanging from the tree. The victim’s wife, Lakshmi Devi, blamed her husband’s excessive fear for the extreme step.

When contacted, Thottambedu Sub-Inspector K. Venkatasubbaiah said the family members had not filed any complaint over the issue.

121,2020/02/12,"Unseasonal rain hits crop quality, productivity in Prakasam","Tobacco, Bengal gram yield likely to fall below target

Fifty-seven-year-old Srinivasa Rao, a farmer in Mangamoor village in Prakasam district, was caught unawares as a fresh wet spell overnight left his tobacco farm water-logged at a time when processing of plucked leaves was going on on a brisk note.

“We were hoping to get a good grade out-turn at least this year. But the rain has come at a most inopportune time. We are saddled with 30 to 35% of low grade varieties,” said the farmer along with fellow farmers in the village.

The e-auctions of the main commercial crop are set to commence in the traditional tobacco growing areas coming under Southern Light Soil (SLS) and Southern Black Soil (SBS) auction platforms in three phases from February 17, 26 and March 4.

The farmers who have been reeling under the impact of severe drought in the last five consecutive years, were hoping to recoup the losses at least this year thanks to good precipitation during both khariff and rabi cropping seasons. But the unabated rain even at the time of harvest has hit hard productivity and the quality of crops including tobacco and Bengal gram, the main commercial crops grown under rain-fed condition in the district.

As a result, tobacco production, which was earlier estimated to cross the 100 million kg mark, is likely to hover around the 90 million kg mark in SLS and SBS regions, according to Indian Tobacco Association sources. It was estimated that bright grade varieties will account for only 40 to 45% of the total crop and medium grade varieties 25 to 30% of the total crop.

Wastage goes up

“Seven to eight leaves per plant have gone waste following the untimely rain,” said a tobacco grower from Vellampalli village K. Venkateswara Rao. Curing of the tobacco crop has so far been completed in 50% of the total cropped area in SBS region and 70% in SLS region said a group of farmers who geared up to market their produce.

The unseasonal rain during the flowering stage had also hit Bengal gram productivity by about 3 quintals from the normal yield of seven to eight quintals per acre, complained a group of farmers in N.G.Padu village. So was the case with red gram with productivity declining by 50% from the the normal crop of about six quintals per acre.

Farmers have taken up rabi crops in 2.29 lakh hectares. Bengal gram accounted for a lion’s share of 84,378 hectares, tobacco 47,708 hectares during this winter, according to a report compiled by the Agriculture department.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/b0kxj4/article30796005.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12VJCROPS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/unseasonal-rain-hits-crop-quality-productivity-in-prakasam/article30796006.ece

The owners of assigned land will be given compensation on a par with those owning patta land. The pension for landless labourers has been doubled to ₹5,000.”

This apart, the government would be fulfilling the unmet promise of the previous government — handing over developed plots to farmers — soon.

Farmers of Amaravati who had parted with over 33,000 acres for the capital have been protesting ever since the government declared its intention to make Visakhapatnam, Amaravati and Kurnool the Executive, legislative and judicial capitals respectively.

The CM asserted that development at Amaravati would continue at its own pace. The probe into alleged insider training in the region by the Enforcement Directorate would continue. “The Special Investigation Team (SIT) constituted for the purpose will be assisting the ED,” he added.

Focus on agri sector

The YSR Congress government is highly focused on boosting the agriculture sector, the CM said. Besides an assistance of ₹13,500 per year to each family of farmers, the government is working on game-changing Rythu Bharosa Kendras (RBK) in villages. The kendras, besides ensuring availability of quality seed, fertilizers, pesticides, would pass on relevant information to farmers through e-cropping.

“We have constituted a ₹3,000-crore price stabilisation fund for farm produce. The RBKs will orient farmers towards declared MSP and guide them to relevant markets to sell their produce. Over 70% farmers will be covered,” the CM said.

On making Visakhapatnam the Executive capital, Mr. Jagan said it is an ideal location as it is already a developed city and can give a good competition to cities like Chennai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad within in a decade.

“The Amaravati development plan requires over ₹one lakh crore investment which is unviable. In contrast, Vizag can be developed with minimum investment. The shift to Visakhapatnam will be made in three to four months,” Mr. Jagan added.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/jagan-promises-good-package-to-amaravati-ryots/article30795989.ece

124,2020/02/12,Naidu asks party mento ‘stand like a rock’,"YSR Congress govt. destroying the State, he alleges

Telugu Desam Party (TDP) national president N. Chandrababu Naidu has asked party leaders and cadres to stand by people notwithstanding any pressure.

“For the future of the next generation, stand like a rock. Activate workers in every village,” he said.

Mr. Naidu was addressing an extended meeting of the party on Tuesday.

The TDP chief said he wanted to develop all cities but the present government was “destroying” the State. The CRDA repeal Bill and Decentralisation Bill would cause hurdles in the development of the State. There is no logic in the three capitals idea. It only a ruse to carry out a witch-hunt against the TDP government. The former Chief Minister claimed that the decision to build the capital at Amaravati was based on the recommendations of the Sivaramakrishnan Committee.

The YSR Congress was not implementing the promises made to the public in the run-up to the elections in letter and spirit. The schemes and programmes such as Navaratnalu, Rythu Bharosa, Amma vodi etc were watered down. The government was not extending the assistance as promised, he said.

Pat for MLCs

In 1984, it was an agitation to save democracy. Now, it was to save Amaravati. Then MLAs were heroes, now MLCs. They remain in the hearts of the people forever by proving that money and posts were not important. One has to take inspiration from them and strive to save the future of the State, he said.

126,2020/02/12,Elephants’ migration to Kabini may be delayed this year,"Officials say parts of Bandipur and Nagarahole received late rains which helped augment the availability of water in the national parks

The annual migration of wild elephants from Bandipur and Nagarahole to Kabini backwaters that commences with the onset of summer could be delayed by a few weeks this year.

This is because parts of Bandipur and Nagarahole received rains as late as November last year which has helped augment the availability of water in both the national parks.

Forest officials say the herd movement had not yet begun this season and attributed it to the availability of fodder and water in the jungles.

However, officials and wildlife activists claim the summer heat would dry up the water sources and deplete the fodder availability, which could trigger the annual migration within the next few weeks.

There are upto140 waterholes in Nagarahole and 370 in Bandipur, besides a few streams.

T. Balachandra, Director, Bandipur Tiger Reserve, said that the delay in migration could not be more than two weeks at the most.

“This is because the searing heat is already building up in Bandipur and, out of the 370 waterholes, only 220 of them have water. Each passing day, the waterholes will dry up forcing the elephants to migrate,” he added.

What is equally significant is that the live storage in the Kabini reservoir as on Wednesday was 12.24 tmcft. There is a vast quantity of water in areas, where elephant herds could otherwise be spotted.

The Kabini backwaters holds a special attraction for the elephants as they converge there for the plentiful grass that sprouts up, when water depletes from the reservoir. But the Irrigation Consultative Committee (ICC) for Kabini is yet to discharge water from the reservoir to the downstream region.

Meanwhile, farmers in the downstream area of Kabini reservoir are up in arms against the authorities for delaying the water discharge to help them save the standing crops. There was a meeting of farmers in T. Narsipur recently where it has been resolved to lay siege to Cauvery Neeravari Nigama Ltd. and Command Area Development Authority offices in Mysuru if there was no water discharge from the reservoir by February 18, said Atahalli Devaraj of Karnataka Sugarcane Cultivators’ Association.

In the event of the discharge of water commencing by February 18 or 20, as demanded by the farmers, the backwaters will slowly dry up and the depletion will help the sprouting of grass and trigger elephant migration by the second week of March. It is expected to peak during late March and early April and the elephants will remain there till the monsoon showers lash the region, according to the officials.

The Kabini backwater hosts the single largest concentration of wild elephants in Asia during summer and is a paradise for wildlife.

The backwater forms the boundary of both Bandipur and Nagarahole which together has about 2,900 to 3,000 elephants some of which congregate here during summer.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/elephants-migration-to-kabini-may-be-delayed-this-year/article30804292.ece
127,2020/02/12,Rangayana Director’s remarks slammed,"Calls for him to be removed from post grow louder

Newly appointed Rangayana Director Addanda Cariappa’s utterances against 18th century king Tipu Sultan have ruffled feathers among theatre circles in Mysuru, and there are now calls to remove him from the post ahead of Bahuroopi, the national theatre festival.

Mr. Cariappa drew sharp criticism from different quarters after using harsh words at a recent function here to describe the theatre fraternity in Mysuru, who had a high regard for Tipu Sultan.

At the same function, the Rangayana chief even questioned the struggles launched in the name of B.R. Ambedkar, Mahatma Gandhi, and the Buddha and claimed that those invoking the three icons had no exclusive rights over them.

Former Rangayana Director Janardhan sought his immediate removal from his post.

“The government should immediately remove him from the post and hold the Bahuroopi under somebody else’s leadership,” said Mr. Janardhan. He is pursuing the “divisive agenda” of RSS and bringing disrespect to the post of Director of Rangayana, which is a public office, Mr. Janardhan alleged.

Meanwhile, Mr. Cariappa said his secularism cannot be questioned just because of his remarks about Tipu Sultan. “I remain committed to theatre,” he said in a Facebook post.

Stating that Mahatma Gandhi’s principles were his aim in life, Mr Cariappa made a plea against hatching any conspiracy to spoil the Bahuroopi. He appealed to the people to come and watch the theatre festival.

However, Mr. Janardhan sought to clarify that they were not against the conduct of Bahuroopi.

“Bahuroopi will go on. But, we are against this person leading the show,” he said.

He asked Mr. Cariappa to apologise for his remarks.

Meanwhile, the remarks also drew criticism from Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) spokesperson M. Lakshmana.

Mr. Lakshmana said Mr. Cariappa should conduct himself as Rangayana Director and not as a “RSS spokesperson”.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/rangayana-directors-remarks-slammed/article30804285.ece

Addressing a press conference here, he said that it was a shame on the part of the Congress to gloat over the victory of AAP when its own 67 candidates have lost deposit in the elections.

He said the BJP had increased its vote percentage from 29 in 2013 to 32 in 2015 and 38 in 2020 whereas the Congress vote share has depleted drastically from 9.7% in 2015 to 4.29% in 2020 in the Delhi polls. “That is the pathetic state of affairs of the 130-year-old party,” he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/congress-suffering-from-mental-and-electoral-bankruptcy-says-bjp/article30803954.ece
130,2020/02/12,"15th Finance Commission gives ₹4,766 cr. to State’s local bodies","This constitutes 5.29% of the total ₹90,000 crore allocated to 28 States

The 15th Finance Commission (FFC) has allocated ₹4,766 crore to rural and urban local bodies in the State from the central pool of funds in the financial year 2020-21, which is way lower than the allocation made to local bodies in the State’s annual budgets.

The Centre’s allocation constitutes 5.29% of the total amount (₹90,000 crore) allocated to 28 States across the country. Interestingly, rural local bodies have been allocated ₹3,217crore and urban local bodies ₹1,549 crore in the State in the financial year 2020-21. The FFC has allocated funds to rural and urban local bodies in the ratio of 67.5:32.5.

Experts say that the amount allocated does not take into account the fact that 38.6% of the State’s population lives in urban areas (7th most urbanised State) and the demand for basic facilities is growing every day.

According to ICRA, a rating agency, the State budget allocated ₹6,000.76 crore in 2015-16, ₹5,600.86 crore in 2016-17, ₹6,400.9 crore in 2017-18, ₹5900.12 crore in 2018-19, and ₹6800.56 crore in 2019-20 budgets for rural and urban local bodies. All these allocations were much higher than the Centre’s own allocation.

Focus on poorer States

In its interim report for 2020-21, the FFC has focussed on improving infrastructural facilities in poorer States with low per capita income and high population. The country’s biggest BJP-ruled State Uttar Pradesh has received the highest share (16.05%) amounting to ₹14,447 crore followed by Maharashtra – ₹8,633 crore (9.59%) and Bihar – ₹7,434 crore (8.26%).

Across all States, the FFC has allocated ₹60,750 crore for rural local bodies and ₹29,250 crore for urban local bodies. The total size of the grant for rural and urban local bodies in 28 States would be ₹90,000 crore and this is equivalent to 4.31% of the divisible pool estimated by the commission for 2020-21 against ₹87,352 crore (3.54%) of the divisible pool for 2019-20.

Karnataka has more than 275 urban local bodies and 5,659 gram panchayats. The FFC has given focus to critical sectors of sanitation and drinking water in rural and urban local bodies.

To ensure quick disbursal of funds released by the Centre, the FFC has recommended that the States should transfer grants-in-aid to local bodies within 10 working days of receipt from the Union government. Any delay beyond 10 working days will require the State governments to release the same with interest as per the effective rate of interest on market borrowings/State Development Loans (SDLs) for the previous year.

While 50% grants to rural local bodies are untied, the remaining 50% would be tied as grants for sanitation and water supply, which are identified national priorities. For rural local bodies, no conditions have been prescribed for getting the grants in 2020-21. However, from 2021-22 onwards, the entry level conditions for rural local bodies getting these grants is timely submission of audited accounts, the FFC said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/qplqmo/article30803920.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12BGROADWORKTENDERSUREPROJECT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/15th-finance-commission-gives-4766-cr-to-states-local-bodies/article30803922.ece
131,2020/02/12,"Katti, Yogeshwar take up their case with central leaders","Both have gone to New Delhi to seek ministerial berths

Two senior MLAs from the Bharatiya Janata Party, who are disappointed over not getting ministerial berths, took their case to the central leaders in New Delhi on Wednesday.

Former Minister and MLA Umesh Katti, whose name is believed to have been part of the list of probables to be inducted into the Ministry, went to Delhi along with his brother. He met party national president J.P. Nadda and reportedly sought intervention of the central leadership to set right the “injustice” meted out to him. Speculation is also rife that he sought Rajya Sabha seat for his brother. Mr. Katti is said to be upset over not getting ministerial berth even in the second chance despite being a senior and an influential MLA.

The appointment of several other MLAs from his home district of Belagavi as Ministers despite being juniors to him has reportedly rubbed salt into his wound.

Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa did not induct any of the senior MLAs from the party cadre into the Ministry during the recent Cabinet expansion, which was confined to inducting only the newly elected MLAs who migrated from other parties. He has, however, said that Mr. Katti would be eventually inducted.

Meanwhile, former Minister C.P. Yogeshwar, who too was reportedly among the ministerial probables, camped in Delhi for a few days to take up his case with the central leaders. According to sources, he met some leaders and expressed pain over not getting ministerial opportunity despite playing a key role in wooing MLAs from rival political parties.

132,2020/02/12,Some coronavirus samples from State test positive for H1N1,"Symptoms for nCoV and H1N1 similar; Karnataka records 128 H1N1 cases from Jan.

While panic over the novel coronavirus infection is making news worldwide, there seems to be no respite from Influenza ‘A’ H1N1 in the State. As many as 128 persons have tested positive for the air-borne disease in Karnataka from January till date.

What is interesting is that some of the samples of suspected coronavirus (nCoV) cases that tested negative for the virus have tested positive for H1N1. Also, with symptoms of coronavirus similar to H1N1, several people are seeking medical advice and getting tested out of panic.

So far, 131 samples of symptomatic persons have been tested for coronavirus and of this 129 have tested negative. “Of the 129, some tested positive for H1N1 when they were investigated for other infections. As symptoms and precautions for both infections are similar, there is more awareness now,” B.G. Prakash, Joint Director (Communicable Diseases), told The Hindu.

Of the 1,204 samples tested for H1N1 from January this year, 128 have tested positive till February 11. In 2019, 96 deaths and 2,030 positive cases were reported.

This year too, the highest number of cases are from Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) areas followed by Udupi. While 51 positive cases have been reported from BBMP areas, Udupi recorded 28 cases. In fact, BBMP has been recording the highest number of cases since the last two years. The number of H1N1 deaths that saw a decline from 2016 are on the rise again. While there were 15 deaths in 2017 and no deaths in 2016, the State witnessed 94 H1N1 deaths in 2015 and 3,565 positive cases. The number was significantly lower in 2014 with 303 positive cases and 34 deaths. Dr. Prakash said the numbers are high because more people are getting screened now.

High transmission

V. Ravi, senior professor and Head of virology in NIMHANS, said that although the novel coronavirus is related to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), the only difference is that the efficiency of person to person transmission is high in the novel coronavirus. “That is why it spreads fast. But, soon there will be herd immunity like in H1N1 and this outbreak too will subside,” he said.

Stating that symptoms and precautions of H1N1 and the novel virus are similar, Dr. Ravi said the most important precaution is hand hygiene.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/qk8c3n/article30803812.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13BGFEBH1N1col,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/some-coronavirus-samples-from-state-test-positive-for-h1n1/article30803813.ece
133,2020/02/12,‘Investment climate has changed in NK’,"‘Invest Karnataka, Hubballi Conference’ will showcase scope of region, says Shettar

Breaking the norm of investors’ meets being held in Bengaluru, Friday will see Hubballi hosting a meet with the objective of attracting investments to tier-2 and tier-3 cities in northern districts of Karnataka.

In an interview with The Hindu, Minister for Large and Medium Industries and former Chief Minister Jagadish Shettar spoke about ‘Invest Karnataka, Hubballi Conference’, scheduled be inaugurated by Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on February 14, and the government’s new approach towards industrial development outside the State capital.

Why the meet in Hubballi?

Most events related to investors including global investors meet are being held in Bengaluru. This is an event to introduce and showcase North Karnataka to the investors and the scope it has for investments in various fields. The event is not just limited to Hubballi or Dharwad but to the entire northern districts of Karnataka.

Previous attempts to get investments to the region have failed. What is new now?

The obvious reason is that we were not well-equipped and lacked basic infrastructure and air connectivity. Now, the investment climate has changed. While Hubballi and Belagavi are well connected by air to important destinations in the country, Kalaburagi and Bidar are on the air map. Earlier, investors had many reasons to reject our invitation. But now, they have more reasons to invest here than look at other cities. We are making an all-out effort.

How prepared are you now?

I went to Mumbai and Hyderabad along with Union Minister Pralhad Joshi, who too has taken personal interest in getting investors to the region. There is a positive response to the event after our efforts. Moreover, land is not an issue now as the State has created a land bank of sorts through land acquisition.

There is a complaint that one has to go to Bengaluru each time for clearance of proposals. Is there a move to set up a Regional Development Authority to deal with investment proposals?

We are bringing about certain changes in the forthcoming industrial policy with focus on developing tier-2 and tier-3 cities. There is a dire need to develop other regions and ensure they grow independently. To facilitate this, the new industrial policy will have requisite changes. Consultations have been made and it is almost through. The policy will usher in industrial development in tier-2 and tier-3 cities.

What are the focus areas?

We are mainly focusing on the FMCG (Fast Moving Consumer Goods) sector this time and plan to develop a FMCG cluster. There is a positive response particularly from those operating from Guwahati. I visited Guwahati and many entrepreneurs are interested in coming to this region. But, we are also looking at investment in textile, solar power, electric vehicles, and other sectors.

Will old proposals that did not take off, particularly with regard to IT investments, be revived?

They did not take off due to lack of proper coordination particularly from Urban Development Department. After this government came into power, those pending issues have been tackled and while framing the industrial policy, UD officials too were roped in to sort out pending issues and facilitate industrial development. After this event, I will personally follow up those investment proposal.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/72ox0i/article30803776.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13BGSHETTAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/investment-climate-has-changed-in-nk/article30803777.ece
134,2020/02/12,"CCI’s order for probe ignores its own study on online marketplace, Amazon tells HC","The order of the Competition Commission of India (CCI) to hold an investigation, through its Director-General, on Amazon and Flipkart for alleged anti-competition activities was passed without application of mind as the CCI has ignored its own recent study on e-commerce market in India, which dealt with the operation of online marketplaces, including Amazon, it was contended on behalf of Amazon before the High Court of Karnataka on Wednesday.

The investigation was ordered following a complaint by the Delhi Vyapar Mahasangh (DVM), which had alleged that Amazon and Flipkart were giving preferential treatment to certain sellers, giving deep discounts. It was complained that the alleged preferential treatment was in violation of the provisions of the Competition Act, 2002.

Appearing for the petitioner, Amazon Seller Services Pvt. Ltd., which has questioned the CCI’s order, senior counsel Gopal Subramanium contended that the CCI’s January 13 order also failed to take into account an order passed by the CCI in a similar case filed by All India Online Vendors’ Association (AIOVA) against Flipkart, in which the CCI had suo motu called upon Amazon to give its inputs on its business model of online marketplace.

As the DVM had alleged that Amazon had violated conditions of the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) policy, Mr. Subramanium said that Amazon has not violated FDI norms while contending that the CCI had no jurisdiction to go into the question of whether Amazon has violated any provisions of the FDI policy as it is the prerogative of the Union government to examine such issues.

The investigation was ordered despite lack of sufficient materials to pass such an order, Mr. Subramanium said and added that the CCI could have at least called upon Amazon to respond to the allegations made in DVM’s case before ordering an investigation.

While pointing out that Amazon was only an online marketplace and was not offering discounts as they were offered by the sellers, the senior counsel said that Amazon was not giving “preference” to any particular seller but the preference on the online platform was shown due to algorithm that analyses performances of sellers based on customer review, orders placed and other parameters.

Alleging that a series of attempts were being made to “harass” Amazon by a group of traders, Mr. Subramanium claimed that when an information by AIOVA was pending before CCI, the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) had filed a petition before the Delhi High Court making similar allegations against the petitioner.

After failing to get a favourable verdict from the Delhi HC, the CAIT filed a similar petition in Rajasthan HC but failed to get any injunction order against the petitioner and hence another petition was filed before Rajasthan HC by another trade body. Though DVM moved CCI, it was CAIT that had paid the fee for DVM’s information filed by the CCI, Mr. Subramanium claimed.

Proceedings adjourned

He reiterated his government’s commitment to developing all other cities in the State on the lines of Bengaluru at the inauguration of ‘Municipalika’, the 16th international exhibition and conference on ‘smart and sustainable city solutions’ on Wednesday.

The three-day event is organised by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, and the Urban Development Department.

“These cities must be equipped to tackle natural disaster such as floods and landslips,” Mr. Yediyurappa said. He also spoke about the ongoing expansion of Kempegowda International Airport and the government’s commitment to implement the suburban rail and high-speed rail links to improve connectivity.

He admitted that rampant urbanisation was posing a set of challenges and that Karnataka stood fourth among all States. To tackle these issues, the centre had launched Smart City Mission, Amrut Mission, Swachch Bharat Mission, Pradhan Mantri Awaz Yojana, and others to tackle the same. Smart City project is being implemented in seven cities in the state, including Bengaluru, while Amrut was taken up in 27 cities. The Swachh Bharat Mission was being implemented in all the towns and cities in the state.

He also stressed on the need to conserve natural resources and pointed out that urban local bodies need to prioritise solid waste management, waste water treatment and rain water harvesting.

Burden of rising urban population

BBMP Commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar, who attended the inaugural event, raised the rise in urban population. Bengaluru has the highest urban growth rate in Karnataka. “The phenomenal growth poses serious challenges to planners, especially in Bengaluru and its civic body. The city already has a population of 12.9 million, which exerts pressure on civic services in its 550 sq m area. Key challenges are basic urban services, water, sanitation, roads, environmental sustainability, urban transportation, solid waste management and infrastructure among others,” he said.

137,2020/02/12,Here’s recipe for a good class strength,"Govt. college in Holenarsipur betters enrolment after introducing lunch for students

An initiative to provide lunch for students has brought in many positive changes at the Government First Grade College in Halli Mysuru of Holenarsipur taluk. The students’ strength has improved and the number of courses offered by the college has also gone up.

In the academic year 2018-19, only 15 students took admission in the college. As in many colleges located in rural areas, students from distant places take admission. They leave home early in the morning to reach college and miss breakfast at home. They then leave college early, skipping classes in the afternoon.

“It was a challenge to increase the strength and also make the students stay put in the college till evening. During one of the meetings, Arkalgud MLA A.T. Ramaswamy suggested providing lunch. With the help of donors, we started the programme on October 2, 2018,” said Punith, principal of the college. Since then, the college has been providing lunch for students for free.

A.C. Somashekhar, working president of the College Development Committee, took extra care to make it a success. Now, after nearly 15 months since the programme was launched, it has yielded desired results. The admissions in 2019-20 increased to 40. Now, the total strength is 75.

Besides B.A., the college is offering B.Com. and BBM courses as well. “Probably, this is the only college in the State where students get lunch for free. There are a few colleges where students get food at subsidised price,” said the principal.

The college has hired two women to cook. They are paid ₹300 per day. “On an average, the total expenses per month towards lunch would be anywhere between ₹25,000 and ₹30,000. All these days, our working president has managed the resources,” Mr. Punith said.

Interestingly, the college has entrusted the responsibility of handling the programme to the students.

The students decide the menu for the day in consultation with the cook in the morning. They look after the requirements and procure ingredients with the help of college administration. “We are confident of improving the strength in the coming years as well. The villagers have been supporting our effort. Babu, a resident of Halli Mysuru, built a kitchen for us on the campus,” the principal said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/1pnyny/article30803734.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12BGHASSANCOLLEGE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/heres-recipe-for-a-good-class-strength/article30803735.ece

With no high school nearby, these children from a village close to the forests in Hanur taluk of Chamarajanagar district used to trek through the forest area to reach the nearest village for pursuing their secondary school education. Some used to trek 10 km daily.

The village in question is Pacchedoddi, about 15 km from Hanur. As many as 18 children used to walk daily to schools in nearby villages since their village lacked higher primary and high school. The village also lacks proper road connectivity and transportation.

The travails came to light after Minister for Primary and Secondary Education S. Suresh Kumar, who is also the Minister in-charge of Chamarajnagar district, announced his wish to stay overnight in the school, as a part of his School Stay programme.

The Minister promised to arrange transportation for the students of Class 6 to 10 to reach schools where they had taken admission. All school students from Pacchedoddi will get the facility, he added.

The Minister had earlier stayed at a school in Gopinatham, a village located on the foothills of Male Mahadeshwara.

The children had sought a Kannada medium school at the village besides demanding drinking water, laboratory and other benefits. The Minister promised to look into them.

141,2020/02/12,‘Mysuru doing better than other regions in GST collection’,"In January, there was 12 p.c. growth, says Principal Commissioner, GST Commissionerate, Mysuru

Mysuru has done better than other regions of the State in terms of GST collection, according to Sanjay Pant, Principal Commissioner, GST Commissionerate, Mysuru.

He said at the annual conference of Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Mysuru, Finance and Taxation Panel here on Wednesday that ₹1,100 crore had been raised from GST in Mysuru. TVS and Automotive Axles alone accounted for more than ₹100 crore. The State GST revenue had been growing at 9 per cent, he said, adding that the growth had been due to better tax compliance by the industry. In January 2020 alone, the revenue collection has grown at 12 per cent. Out of the collections, 29 per cent was from service tax.

Mr. Pant suggested that sectors having potential such as entertainment and tourism should be harnessed for achieving higher growth. This would result in increase in revenue collections.

N. Muthukumar, Past Chairman of CII Karnataka and President and Executive Director, Meritor India Ltd; and Bhaskar Kalale, Chairman, CII Mysuru and President and GM-India Operations, Theorem India Private Limited addressed the gathering. Amit Kumar, Vice-Chairman, CII Mysuru and Vice-President and Business Unit Head, L and T Ltd., was present.

Rabinder Sahoo, Co-Convenor of CII Finance and Taxation Panel and Vice President-Finance, Cyient DLM, was present.

Mr. Muthukumar said the industry in Mysuru had been growing significantly, contributing to the GDP. The business environment had become uncertain, complex and volatile. Inclusive growth of economy required the support of all - individuals, industries and the government. The industry needs to know the changes in government policies to get the best out of these policies.

Mr. Kalale said the conference was the need of the hour and called for “thinking like an economist”.

‘Science of resources’

Pointing out that economics was “a science of resources”, he called upon the industrialists to put a positive spin on the budget and fiscal policies that are framed from time to time. The key takeaway from the conference should be “the impact of the technology options on finance”.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/sp484x/article30803214.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12MYSGST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mysuru-doing-better-than-other-regions-in-gst-collection/article30803215.ece

According to the NGO, on Tuesday the wild sloth bear fell victim to man-animal conflict. “Farmers were shocked to find the injured bear dragging itself along the forest floor and keening in pain. They immediately reached out to the Forest Department, who in turn called for reinforcement from the Wildlife SOS team operating out of Bannerghatta Bear Rescue Centre,” said a release. Forest officials tended to the bear while a five-member team from Wildlife SOS made it to Pavagada.

A preliminary check-up by the NGO’s veterinarians unearthed a “deep bullet wound” close to the spinal cord of the animal. There were also burn-like marks on the hindlimbs, the release stated. “Authorities surmised that the animal was shot by a panicked farmer after it entered a farm in search of food. The severe wounds could not be treated on site, so the traumatised bear was carefully immobilised and shifted to the Wildlife SOS facility for a closed clinical examination,” the release said.

145,2020/02/12,Experts lay stress on documentation of lesser-known languages,"Need to study the culture and livelihood of people who speak endangered languages, says former CIIL Director

* ‘Such an effort was very important in safeguarding the individual speech of the community’

Shankar Bennur

A two-day national seminar on ‘Documentation of Lesser-Known Languages: Deliberation and Medium’ began at the Central Institute of Indian Languages (CIIL) here on Wednesday. The seminar was organised by the CIIL, Mysuru, in collaboration with Regional Centre of the Central Institute of Hindi (CIH), Mysuru.

Inaugurating the seminar, Rajesh Sachdeva, former Director, CIIL said all regional languages should come together harmoniously and efforts should be made to document, describe and develop the mother tongue concerned for preserving the lesser-known languages and the country’s diverse multilingual society.

Prof. Sachdeva stressed the need for research and development of lesser-known languages while undertaking fieldwork, survey and data collection, research, analysis, archiving and documentation of indigenous languages. To realise this, one should interact closely with the community members and use technologies to study their livelihood and culture, he suggested.

Shilendra Kumar Singh, Head, Department of Linguistics, North-Eastern Hill University, Shillong, in his keynote address, said the documentation of lesser-known languages was very important in safeguarding the individual speech of the community. The researcher should be properly trained with knowledge of descriptive and socio-linguistic studies.

D.G. Rao, Director, CIIL, in his presidential address, said during documentation of lesser-known or endangered languages, research should have a reasonable timeframe and completed in time with concrete parameters and uniform output. The research output should be primarily in Indian languages with a focus on Hindi and other major Indian languages of the region.

As many as 40 delegates will present their research papers in eight academic sessions of the seminar to be held for two days.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/experts-lay-stress-on-documentation-of-lesser-known-languages/article30801384.ece

Mangalore University Vice Chancellor P.S. Yadapadithaya on Tuesday said the university administration planned to turn the campus into a ‘clean, green and fit’ one through various measures.

Speaking at the Meet the Press programme organised by Dakshina Kannada District Working Journalists’ Union at Mangaluru Press Club here, Mr. Yadapadithaya said every student getting admission to a PG programme would be required to plant and nurture a sapling on campus.

The plant would have a bar-code system containing the details of the student and the information would be stored. The student could see the grown up sapling whenever they visited the campus after studies.

Focus on fitness

As a part of Fit Campus, the varsity has provided a gymnasium in hostels and colleges. A public gymnasium park too will be opened on campus. The administration plans to ban movement of conventional vehicles on campus and introduce battery-operated vehicles as well as bicycles. The public thoroughfare would be relocated outside the campus with the help of the Public Works Department, Mr. Yadapadithaya said.

The university can mobilise funds through internal resources by regulating minor expenditure besides putting a leash on extravaganza. He said efforts were on to get funds from corporates through their corporate social responsibility initiatives to develop the University campus, including Konaje village.

The VC said every decision was being taken with consequences in mind. He has assumed office with the ambition of making Mangalore University stand apart among all universities in the country and had taken steps in this direction from very first day.

About seven acres of university land had been encroached upon; as such, it was decided to secure the lands through compound walls. Even encroached land would be fenced. Besides installing closed circuit television cameras at vantage points on campus, the university may also deploy personnel from Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), provided the Governor concurred with a proposal in this regard, Mr. Yadapadithaya added.

It is imperative to infuse a sense of competition in trade, Mr. Choudhary noted, and said that without this, it would be difficult to face competition from other countries, especially China. He stressed that Mangaluru, despite its development potential, had not realised the same to the extent that it should have had and the opening of an exclusive Chapter would help the coastal city achieve the same with concerted focus.

The Principal District and Sessions Court in Bidar, on Tuesday, heard the bail petitions filed in the sedition case booked against the authorities of Shaheen School after its students staged a play in which some of them delivered dialogues that “insulted” Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Two petitions were filed in the case — one for securing regular bail for Najbunnisa, mother of the child who delivered the controversial dialogue during the play, and Farida Begum, head teacher of the school who supervised the play, who are already in judicial custody, and the other for obtaining anticipatory bail for Abdul Qadir, chairman of Shaheen School and four members of the school management.

After the hearing of both sides ended at around 6.15 p.m., the judge, Managoli Premavati Mallikarjuna, posted the regular bail petition involving Najbunnisa and Farida Begum for Friday for order and the anticipatory bail petition for next Monday for order. The judge, however, asked the Public Prosecutor to file objections before Saturday in the second bail petition case.

A study by the National Institute of Advanced Studies and the Institute for Social and Economic Change found that skill centres often do not follow up with their graduates as promised after they have completed the course and are placed.

According to researchers, owing to poor mentoring, many from the skill India programmes returned to their hometowns or villages after course without even obtaining certificates. The researchers described the centres as ‘ill designed and dysfunctional’.

These findings were based on field research and surveys in Bengaluru and Raichur. Researchers focused particularly on beauty and wellness, retail and transportation sectors. They noted that while youth may aspire to move to cities and seek ‘urban’ jobs, they often are compelled to return owing to the paucity of decent and well-paid work. Many were also unable to meet the high cost of sustaining themselves in the city with the salaries offered.

The youth said they were disappointed with available opportunities and were unable to save money for their families and ended up going back to their villages, where, due to the agrarian crisis, they took up odd jobs or worked as labourers. Some resumed their education, while others remained idle.

“Low wages and uncertain tenure create a context where workers are encouraged to move from one job to another, and one place to another, in search of a pay hike of even a few hundred rupees or less onerous working conditions,” read the study. Supriya RoyChowdhury from ISEC who did the study along with Carol Upadhya from NIAS, said they found a disconnect between the aims of skill training programmes, youth aspirations and the urban job market.

In Raichur, for example, many centres were imparting skills like tailoring and sales management, but there are no garment factories or malls offering sales jobs in the area. “This shows that a local employment market analysis, which should be a prerequisite, was not sone ,” she said.

The study also pointed to the shifting of focus in employment opportunities from manufacturing to the service sector and has recommended the need to introduce a regime of regulations suitable to the sector and to protect employee interests.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/cf17yc/article30795716.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11BGSKILLINDIA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/skill-training-centres-poorly-designed-and-dysfunctional-shows-study/article30795717.ece
155,2020/02/12,Golden Chariot 2.0 back on track from March 22,"Three-nights short duration trips will be added to the itinerary

After a two-year break, the Golden Chariot, which completed a decade’s run in 2018, will be back on track from March.

The Karnataka State Tourism Development Corporation (KSTDC) and Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) officials said the train’s first run will be on March 22.

The marketing and operations of the luxury train was handed over to the IRCTC in November 2019 after the KSTDC signed an agreement with it. Before that, south India’s only luxury train was not operated during its usual October to March season as the KSTDC was looking for a new agency to take over certain aspects of operations. Last year, the new BJP government which came to power took note of the ₹41 crore losses the train had incurred and decided to temporarily suspend operations.

Through its 10-year run, the Golden Chariot was plagued by low occupancy rates, which was only around 35% on an average. The tourism corporation had also repeatedly raised the issue of high haulage charges by the Indian Railways, that had refused to come on board for a revenue sharing model, causing a huge burden to the Golden Chariot’s finances. The Railways ultimately agreed to a revenue-sharing ratio of 56:44.

Three tours

Speaking to The Hindu, Mahendra Pratap Mall, CMD, IRCTC, said the train would run three tours – two existing routes, and a third one – a short trip of three nights.

The train’s two tours were: Pride of South, which traversed through Bengaluru, Kabini, Mysuru, Hassan, Hampi, Badami and Goa, and Southern Splendour, through Bengaluru, Chennai, Mahabalipuram, Puducherry, Thanjavur, Madurai, Thiruvananthapuram, Kovalam, and Kochi.

Kumar Pushkar, MD, KSTDC, added that the March-April operation will run three trips of one tour – Pride of Karnataka (earlier Pride of South).

“The next season onwards from October, we will start running all three – Pride of Karnataka, Southern Splendour, and a third new one of four days and three nights that covers Bengaluru, Mysuru, Bandpur, Chikkamagaluru, Hampi and back. Badami and Goa have been excluded. This tour is aimed at giving the chariot experience to more people at a reduced cost,” he said.

Off-season from May to July, that also sees lower foreign tourist footfalls, will see some overhauling of the train, including a change in the vestibule (passage between the two coaches), which will be more on the lines of the seamless vestibules on modern trains such as the Shatabdi, and replacement of the air suspension, which the Railways will carry out at a cost. This will improve the ride quality, Mr. Pushkar said.

The train’s iconic purple exterior will remain the same. However, Mr. Pushkar said the motif decoration will be made more meaningful by including the yakshagana kirita (headgear) now, while the yellow band running across the train will explain tourist monuments.

Passengers can also expect to see a lot of physical changes in the interiors. “We have undertaken refurbishment of all the coaches and common areas such as the restaurant and kitchen. The interiors are more plush. They had to be changed as they were 10 years old,” Mr. Mall added.

Asked if there would be similarities between the southern luxury train and the IRCTC’s Maharaja Express which covers the north, Mr. Mall said the latter was in a much higher segment, but added that the refurbished Golden Chariot will also be superior quality-wise.

‘Marginally lower’ tickets

The IRCTC, which had earlier mentioned that there were plans to reduce the ticket prices, has stuck to its promise. The 2018-19 season tariffs ranged from ₹3.85 lakh to ₹6.8 lakh for foreign passport holders and between ₹2.45 lakh to ₹3.78 lakh for Indian nationals.

The IRCTC CMD Mahendra Pratap Mall said the ticket prices would be slightly lower than before due to various factors. “Haulage charges need to be paid to the Railways, which will have to be shared by passengers. This is a huge input and there is limited manoeuvrability in ticket prices due to this,” he explained.

As for improving occupancy rates, he said there is a special scheme for Indians, while the train will be launching publicity in the upcoming ITB Berlin, which is said to be one of the world’s leading travel trade shows.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/5vqoww/article30795699.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11BGGOLDENCHARRIOT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/golden-chariot-20-back-on-track-from-march-22/article30795700.ece
156,2020/02/12,‘Implementation of Skill India policy is at odds with political economy’,"The implementation of the Skill India policy has not sufficiently anchored the reality of India’s political economy, reveals a recent study by researchers from two Bengaluru institutes — the National Institute of Advanced Studies (NIAS) and the Institute for Social and Economic Change (ISEC).

According to the researchers, skill training is pushing “needy young people” into precarious, informalised and low-paying jobs that are unlikely to lead to a better economic future or social mobility, or equip them with the means to improve their own lives.

The study titled, ‘India’s Changing Cityscapes: Work, Migration and Livelihoods’, was funded by the Indian Council of Social Science Research. “The preponderance of informal service work — even in the organised sector — makes the future of the skilled service worker almost as bleak as that of the unskilled worker,” said Supriya RoyChowdhury from ISEC who did the study along with Carol Upadhya from NIAS.

“While greater attention to the relevance of skills to local job markets will certainly make skill training more useful for workers, there is also a need for more focussed and critical attention to what kind of jobs are available and to the institutional framework of urban service work,” she said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/implementation-of-skill-india-policy-is-at-odds-with-political-economy/article30795669.ece
157,2020/02/12,Workers get middaybreak as mercury soars,"A 3-hour break from 12 noon to 3 p.m.

The Labour Commissioner has issued orders rescheduling work hours of labourers toiling in the sun in the wake of the rise in daytime temperatures in the State.

Those working the morning shift will get a three-hour break from 12 noon to 3 p.m. till April 30.

Their work hours have been fixed at eight hours between 7 a.m and 7 p.m. The rejig in the work hours as per the Kerala Minimum Wages Rules, 1958 is a precaution against the possibility of sunstroke. Areas 3,000 ft above sea level where there is little possibility of heatstroke have been excluded.

The temperatures this year have been higher than normal. Going by the trend, March and April are likely to be very hot months, with mercury between 37 and 40 degrees Celsius in most parts of the State, says Fahad Marzook, hazard analyst (meteorology), Kerala State Disaster Management Authority (KSDMA).

Humidity

In Palakkad, the temperature will be in the range of 37-40 degrees Celsius. The seasonal forecast for the summer from the IMD is yet to be received though, he says. Temperatures above 37 degrees Celsius are problematic because of the humidity.

Their cumulative effect causes extreme discomfort. Last year, 1,600 cases of health issues caused by heat were reported in March, April, and May. Nearly 800 were of sunburn or sunstroke.

Temperatures in 2019 were not as high as that in 2016, but were still critical. This year too looks to be going the same way. However, temperatures in January this year have been higher than that last year, points out Mr. Marzook.

From January 1 till date, there has been a departure of 3 to 4 degrees Celsius in temperature in Alappuzha, Kannur, Kozhikode, and the Cochin airport. Kottayam has shown the maximum departure - 4.3 degrees Celsius.

The warm sea surface temperature of Arabian Sea is a reason for the increase in temperature, he says.

The KSDMA has urged the people to take precautionary steps as the exam season approaches. Plenty of drinking water in classrooms should be ensured.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/4wlu99/article30804809.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13tv-temperaturecol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/workers-get-middaybreak-as-mercury-soars/article30804033.ece
158,2020/02/12,COVID-19: patient to be discharged from hospital,"Latest samples collected from him test negative

A student admitted to the Government Medical College Hospital, Alappuzha, with novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection will be discharged from the hospital after samples collected from him tested negative for the disease, District Collector M. Anjana has said.

The student was admitted to the hospital on January 30. On February 2, he was tested positive for COVID-19. The student would be sent home on Wednesday night or Thursday morning.

“The result of the latest test conducted at the National Institute of Virology, Pune, has come out negative. The medical board has found the patient's health to be satisfactory and we have decided to discharge the person from the hospital. Although discharged, the person will be put under observation at his house till February 26,” Ms. Anjana said.

The Collector said all suspected COVID-19 cases in the district had been discharged from hospitals. However, 139 people had been put under house quarantine, she said.

2,455 on quarantine

Special Correspondent adds from Thiruvananthapuram: The Health Department took down its stringent surveillance and monitoring norms for COVID-19 by a notch and released 1,040 persons from enforced self-quarantine in houses.

The number of those on quarantine in the State on Wednesday was 2,455, out of whom only 24 are in isolation wards in hospitals. The remaining 2,431 are on house quarantine.

Of the 389 samples sent to the National Institute of Virology so far, 354 have been reported as negative and the rest of the results are awaited.

The Health Rapid Response Team that met here reviewed the current situation involving COVID-19 infection and recommended revising the current quarantine guidelines.

Though 1,040 persons on surveillance were released from the quarantine, the department will continue its vigil. Those returning from China or other nations where COVID-19 has been imported should remain in house quarantine for 28 days even if they are not ill. They should also avoid huge gatherings or visits to public places, an official bulletin issued by the Health Department said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/3ykxdm/article30780969.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NCOV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/covid-19-patient-to-be-discharged-from-hospital/article30804029.ece
159,2020/02/12,An intimate sage who belonged to the true Indian guru-shishya tradition,"‘Ayyappa Paniker Forever’ offers a few glimpses of the life and philosophy of the great master

An intimate sage. That’s how litterateur K Satchidanandan sums up the poet and writer in his foreword to Ayyappa Paniker Forever, a collection of 42 memoirs of the guru – glimpses of his personal life and philosophy -- brought out by his students here early this month, 13 years after he passed away.

A great teacher never bids farewell. He continues to inspire his disciples. And the bond is in keeping with the guru-shishya relationship of India’s unique tradition: guide, well-wisher, friend…

Anecdotes

Peppered with anecdotes, mostly drawn from their classroom experience, the disciples lend greater insights into his personal life and philosophy. And how he changed the course of their destinies.

Modernism

To the outside world, Ayyappa Paniker is the forerunner of Modernism in Malayalam poetry. The poet who penned such great works as Kurukshetram, Gopika Dandakam, and Gothrayanam. But the memoirs portray the guru more as a good human being, affectionate, compassionate, and considerate. Always radiating the rustic charm and innocence of Kuttanad.

He had the practice of inviting his students, especially research scholars and those doing MPhil, to his home. And they attest to the guru’s large-heartedness, more than a poet or teacher of genius, in such encounters. And the humane education of literary study.

Scheme of teaching

As a teacher extraordinaire, his students remember, he held his books closer to his heart in every sense. And how he made ‘‘the dry as dust history of... Old English, Middle English and Modern English eminently palatable’’. Some of them explain how they picked up the right priorities for a teacher from the guru. His scheme of teaching comes in for praise more often in the memoirs.

‘‘He was unconventionally unique in helping his students find their way out of the academic labyrinth... helping them reach independent shores.’’ A man who believed that he and his students were in the same class.

Dr. Ayyappa Paniker was in University College here from 1955 to 1964 and Institute of English (Department of English, University of Kerala) from 1964 to 1990.

Irony was the hallmark of his poems. ‘‘How did he become a man of irony? It was his disposition towards life, born out of his experiences,’’' writes Priyadas G. Mangalath, secretary, Ayyappa Paniker Foundation. Some of the memoirs concur that his irony was a valiant attempt to overcome the agony of living. A sort of catharsis? His black humour and poetic works were a sublimation of the wailing of a wounded heart, they seem to ponder.

Man of many talents

Ayyappa Paniker was many things to different people. And his disciples compliment his little-known wide canvas. His deep-rooted knowledge in the theoretical framework of Indian literature, drama and the arts in general, his Socratic love for knowledge, his support for little magazines…. A man of many parts.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/3qpceq/article30804026.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Ayyappapanickar,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/an-intimate-sage-who-belonged-to-the-true-indian-tradition/article30804027.ece
160,2020/02/12,NIT-C students offered stellar salaries,"Over 550 receive offers with packages ranging from ₹5 lakh to ₹50 lakh per annum

Like in the previous year, students at the National Institute of Technology, Calicut, ( NIT-C), have been offered stellar salaries with the placement process reaching the final stage.

Over 550 students have received job offers from leading companies with packages ranging from ₹5 lakh to ₹50 lakh an annum. The average compensation is also expected to be higher than last year.

The placement process that began in August last saw even the Indian Space Research Organisation and the Indian Air Force visiting the campus for recruitment for the first time.

As of now, 412 BTech and 148 MTech students have received offers and the recruitment will continue till April. “While post graduate placements are on the higher side as compared to last year, we are trying to reach last year’s figure for undergraduate placements despite the slight decline in core branches,” S.M. Sameer, Head, Training and Placement, NIT-C, told The Hindu.

Students of the NIT-C, which is ranked number one among the engineering colleges in Kerala by the Ministry of Human Resource Development, getting envious salary packages is not new. Last year, 600 BTech students were hired and the highest annual compensation offered was ₹50 lakh.

“One interesting trend observed this year is that companies are focussing on internships for second year BTech students, as a policy to spot talented students in the early stage of academic programmes,” Dr. Sameer said.

He said recruiters were primarily scouting for students who had an edge over others in terms of academic and co-curricular activities. “Grades and CGPA are important. But students who have achievements in terms of prizes and active participation in hackathons, special projects, internships were preferred over the others,” he said, adding that summer internship for third-year BTech students was also on the high.

Certainly computer science has surpassed all other core branches of engineering. Recruiters also preferred students of electronics and communication, electrical engineering, mechanical and chemical engineering even as fresh opportunities opened for software domains.

Some of the recent recruiters includes Reliance Industries, Vedanta, IFB Limited, IBM, Thermofisher, Baker- Huges, ADP, and DXC.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/50nyc0/article30804928.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13TVNITC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/nit-c-students-offered-stellar-salaries/article30804009.ece
161,2020/02/12,Rijosh murder: accused brought to take evidence,"Body found in a pit in a farmhouse at Santhanpara

The police on Wednesday collected evidence in the case of murder of Rijosh, 31, whose body was found buried in a pit near a farmhouse at Santhanpara here on October 31 last year.

Wasim, the prime accused and manager of a resort, was taken to the spot where the body was buried.

Wasim and Liji Kurien, wife of Rijosh, had escaped to Mumbai. They had taken her three-year-old child along with them. The police later found them in a serious condition after consuming poison at a lodge at Panvel. The child was dead by then. The Panvel police registered a case against them for the death of the child.

They were produced before the Nedumkandam magistrate court on Monday. The police said Liji was not taken to the spot as she was not directly involved in the murder. If evidence leading to her direct involvement was received, she would also be brought for collecting evidence.

Body burned

The accused was taken to an outhouse at the farmhouse and then near the pit where the body was buried. The accused had confessed to the police that there was a quarrel between him and Rijosh over his relationship with Liji .

The accused pushed him and his head hit the floor. Believing that he was dead, the body was burned using kerosene. It was pulled to the pit and covered. Wasim also deployed an earthmover to fill the pit, telling the driver that a carcass of a cow was buried there.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/m4rklv/article30803990.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13tvid-rijosh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/rijosh-murder-accused-brought-to-take-evidence/article30803991.ece

Model Residential School, Kulathupuzha, will soon undergo an infrastructure and academic upgrade as part of the efforts to bring down the dropout rate.

A decision in this regard was taken at a school executive committee meeting chaired by Sistrict Collector B.Abdul Nasar recently.

Drinking water

The school building and toilet block will be renovated and a well will be dug to ensure the supply of drinking water. While these works will be completed shortly, a water storage tank will be installed with the support of the Haritha Keralam Mission and Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) workers.

The Collector instructed PWD officials to prepare an estimate for the construction of a playground in consultation with the Kerala Sports Council.

An extensive awareness campaign will be launched in tribal areas this year to stop students dropping out. The campaign will focus on ‘oorukootams’ (community meets) and a pravesanolsavam will be held for Class 5 students next academic year.

Landscaping

Landscaping and well-recharging will be done as part of the renovation and the school will start the cultivation of organic vegetables and herbs.

A natural and heterogeneous green habitat will be created in connection with the Pachathuruthu project of the Haritha Keralam Mission.

As part of improving academic standards, general staff meetings will be held on February 15 and 29.

The teachers have been directed to conduct weekly review sessions to assess general and academic activities.

The school currently has a strength of 265 students from Class 5 to Plus Two. While the school has been scoring 100% pass percentage, the first Plus Two batch is getting ready for public examination this year.

163,2020/02/12,Joseph Mar Thoma lauds CM for passing Cemeteries Bill,"CSI moderator opens ecumenical meet at Maramon

Society was in grave need of liberation from the horrors created by crippling lives in modern times. Koodathai murders, snakebite death in a classroom, murder of a tribal youth, suicide of an expatriate, and the demolition of apartments at Maradu in Kochi are suggestive of the sad state of affairs in the State, Church of South India (CSI) moderator Bishop Dharmaraj Rasalam has said.

He was inaugurating an ecumenical meet at the 125th Maramon Convention at Maramon, near Kozhencherry, on Wednesday.

He said the Christian testimony also was being challenged when a priest who ascended the Madbaha of church required a court order to come down from the sacred place.

The CSI Bishop said spirituality must be above caste and religious considerations or thought and this could be possible through harmony with the fellow people.

Churches’ duty

“Churches have a responsibility to bring spirituality to the outside world and their mission is to fulfil God’s will, not to tire out. Criticisms may arise, insults may come, and we should be able to move forward boldly with strong faith in God,” he said.

The CSI moderator also urged the young generation to seek refuge in God in the face of adversity.

Delivering the presidential address, Joseph Mar Thoma, Metropolitan of Mar Thoma Church, lauded Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and the Assembly for unanimously passing the Kerala Christian Cemeteries (Right to Burial of Corpse) Bill, 2020.

Sensing trouble, Mr. Vijayan maintained a safe distance from the gangsters and as they unleashed a violent attack with hockey sticks, he sought cover inside the house.

“They tried to break open the door, but soon fled the scene as my mother and wife screamed for help,” said the RTI activist.

Based on a complaint lodged by Mr. Vijayan, the police booked a case under IPC Sections 448 (house trespass), 294(b), 506(2) (criminal intimidation), 427 (mischief causing damage) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention). He will be filing a fresh complaint with the District Police Chief on Thursday.

170,2020/02/12,Kollam to get major railway infra facility,"First Multipurpose Disciplinary Training Centre in State

Railways’ first Multipurpose Disciplinary Training Centre in the State will come up in Kollam, said N.K. Premachandran, MP, after a meeting with the Thiruvananthapuram Divisional Railway Manager and other officials on Wednesday.

“The only Multipurpose Disciplinary Training Centre under Southern Railway is in Thiruchirappalli and the new project in Kollam holds great potential,” he said.

The Railway Board had earlier decided to upgrade the Kollam railway station to global standards and Indian Railway Stations Development Corporation has been given the responsibility to coordinate the works. As part of the initial procedures, a meeting with the Corporation managing director will be held in Delhi, followed by a land inspection.

The meeting also decided to complete various construction works to improve the amenities of commuters at the earliest. The construction of a foot overbridge, lift, and escalator will be completed and the new facilities will be commissioned in April. The construction has been delayed owing to technical issues in the contract.

Pit lines

Mr. Premachandran said a proposal for the construction of pit lines to increase MEMU services, which are more efficient compared to passenger trains, will be submitted.

“Another proposal will be submitted to the Railway Board for allowing a stop for Gandhidham Express in Kollam,” he added.

The construction works of the Mayyanad railway station will be scheduled in a manner to be completed by August. A passenger train services from Thriuvananthapuram reaching Kollam before 10 a.m. will be started. The Eravipuram railway station will be upgraded as a fully operational station from halt station.

“The general alignment of the overbridges at Kavalpura, Polayathodu, and S.N.College has been submitted for approval. Railway authorities have agreed to consider our demand and take necessary steps to improve the functioning of the Kollam goods yard,” he said.

Mr. Premachandran, Divisional Railway Manager S.K.

173,2020/02/12,Energy conservation at govt. offices in focus,"Oorjakiran awareness campaign held for employees

Every government office should have an energy manager who should take the initiative to control the energy consumption in that office, said Sijesh.N, District Coordinator of Energy Management Centre.

Speaking at the opening of Oorjakiran 2019-20, the energy conservation awareness campaign organised by Darsanam Samskarika Vedi for the employees of the District Treasury here on Wednesday, he said that a large portion of energy being distributed in the State was being wasted one way or the other.

“Around 66.4 million units of electricity was used in Kerala on Tuesday. But we produced only 19.97 million. The huge gap is being filled using electricity bought from other States and the Centre, and we are wasting it,” he said pointing out the need to conserve energy in day-to-day life.

Some tips

Mr. Sijesh gave tips to save energy in offices with a little care, such as using LED lights, keeping windows open, as it would provide natural lighting and air movement, reducing the use of lights and fans to a minimum level.

He suggested offices to follow the concept of carbon neutral by minimising the use of paper and planting trees on premises.

“You can resort to emails as much as possible,” he said explaining the amount of energy and trees being used for manufacturing A4 papers.

He said computers should be adjusted to enter sleep mode if they are not being used for a few minutes and could be switched off if not being used for over an hour.

This is the first time the Oorjakiran campaign is being carried out in government offices.

The programme so far has focused on schools through Smart Energy Programmes, and homemakers through Energy Clinics carried out with the help of the Kudumbashree.

The concept of Energy Leaders being implemented in schools in the district will be extended to all schools in the State in the next academic year.

Around 50 employees of the District Treasury took part in the awareness programme.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/energy-conservation-at-govt-offices-in-focus/article30803843.ece

“If secular parties in each State are coming together to fight, it will be our priority,” he said.

Mr. Karat said people of Delhi rejected the communal campaign of the BJP and voted back the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) to power because of its work in the past five years.

He added that the CPI(M) contested the Delhi election to make its presence felt. “So it was decided that the party will fight in two or three seats and support the AAP in other seats,” he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/secular-forces-should-unite-against-bjp/article30803834.ece

177,2020/02/12,CAG doubts SPC’s fiscal probity in procurement,"Report says police violated CVC guidelines and store purchase norms

The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India, General and Social Sector, has faulted State Police Chief (SPC) Loknath Behera for violating the statutory guidelines established for ensuring fiscal probity in the procurement of equipment for modernising the force.

The CAG report for the year ended March 2018, tabled in the Assembly on Wednesday, also flagged the “shortage of 25 numbers of 5.56 mm INSAS rifle and 12,061 live cartridges”.

The finding triggered television news breaks and prompted the Opposition to highlight its national security implication.

NIA probe sought

Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala demanded a probe by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) into the ‘missing ordnance’. He said the CAG's report also necessitated an inquiry by the Central Bureau of Investigation against Mr. Behera.

The State Police said it would answer the points raised by the CAG to the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), which is the final word on audit findings.

The CAG said the SPC had ‘persistently’ violated Modernisation of Police Force (MOPF) guidelines by purchasing bulletproof luxury vehicles for VVIP use instead of vans for the law enforcement.

The findings

The auditors found that 15% of the vehicles purchased by the police were luxury cars for the exclusive use of “high-level officers and non-operational units” such as the CBCID. Ideally, the SPC should have used the funds to make up for the dire deficit of vehicles in police stations.

The CAG found that the police headquarters had diverted funds meant for construction of staff quarters for subordinate officers to build luxury villas for the SPC and Additional Director General of Police.

The auditors determined that the Police Department had repeatedly violated Store Purchase Manual norms and guidelines issued by the Chief Vigilance Commissioner in the procurement of a wide range of costly equipment.

The CAG said lack of state-of-the-art digital ‘mobile radios’ had hobbled anti-Maoist operations.

CM refutes charge

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan did not comment on the CAG’s report but had dismissed similar allegations raised against Mr. Behera by Congress legislator P.T. Thomas in the Assembly on Tuesday.

The Congress sought to politicise the CAG’s findings with Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee president Mullappally Ramachandran demanding an anti-corruption probe against Mr. Behera.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/n13m0e/article30804913.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13tv-CAG-FindingsPoliceTCRcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cag-doubts-spc-fiscal-probity-in-procurement/article30802399.ece
178,2020/02/12,Pinarayi hails AAP victory in Delhi,"‘People’s verdict against the BJP’s politics of communal polarisation’

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the victory of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) headed by Arvind Kejriwal in the Delhi Assembly elections reflected the people’s verdict against the BJP’s politics of communal polarisation.

The electoral outcome also presents an opportunity for the Congress to learn from its mistakes.

“The verdict means that voters are ready to embrace a viable alternative to the BJP. It should impart strength to the ongoing struggle by secular, democratic forces for protection of Constitutional values,” he said here on Tuesday.

The Congress, Mr. Vijayan said, had failed to read the popular sentiment in favour of the AAP and join hands with the party to hand out a more crushing defeat for the BJP. The Chief Minister rang up Mr. Kejriwal and congratulated him on the impressive victory of the AAP.

‘Body blow for BJP’

179,2020/02/12,Tribal man wins ₹12-crore bumper lottery,"52-year-old Porunnan Rajan is a member of the Kurichiya community

A day after the draw of the Kerala Christmas New Year Bumper lottery of the State government, the winner of the first prize, which is a whopping ₹12 crore, has been identified: 52-year-old Porunnan Rajan, a member of the Kurichiya community and a resident of Puralimala in Malur grama panchayat in Kannur.

The draw of lots was held on Monday. But the authorities who confirmed that the ticket was sold by Payyana Lottery failed to trace the winner. Amidst rumours and claims regarding the winner, Mr. Rajan arrived at the bank and handed over the prize-winning ticket to the bank manager.

Luck showered upon him when he was going through difficult times. Mr. Rajan told The Hindu that he desperately needed money. He was in debt after borrowing money for the marriage of his daughter and other purposes. The prize has come as a blessing, he said.

“I took the lottery when I visited a bank for a loan. However, I was refused loan and it was during my second visit to the bank that I got to know that I had won the prize,” he said.

Mr. Rajan, who has two daughters and a son, wants to pay off his loans of ₹7 lakh. “I wish to pay off the debt and build a new house,” he said.

“The roof of my house is damaged and water seeps in during the rains. I will utilise this money for constructing a proper house here,” he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/zidqun/article30796143.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12tvlottery,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/tribal-man-wins-12-crore-bumper-lottery/article30796140.ece
180,2020/02/12,VACB raids expose real estate mafia,"Govt. regulators bend law to help them raze hills, reclaim wetlands

The Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB) has spotlighted how government regulators bend the law to aid the real estate mafia raze hills and use the excavated earth to reclaim ecologically fragile wetlands for construction.

In a Statewide surprise inspection codenamed ‘Operation Save Earth’ on Tuesday, anti-corruption investigators raided several excavation sites across the State to target destructive laterite mining that had spawned a powerful mafia responsible for scores of violent crimes, including a murder at Kattakada near here recently.

The activities of the mafia, a potent amalgam of corrupt law enforcers, ruling front politicians, owners of trucks and earth movers, mobsters and real estate developers, posed a threat to environmental activists and imperilled the safety of citizens who lived in natural disaster-prone regions.

Investigators found that the land mafia routinely exploited the provisions in the law that enabled citizens to excavate a limited amount of earth for construction purposes. They used thugs to muscle people into selling their land and used the names of their victims to get permission from the Mining and Geology Department to excavate and remove earth from the plot.

The VACB found that geology officials, possibly for hefty bribes, sanctioned the applications for excavating earth without visiting the site, verifying the genuineness of the applicant, or specifying the quantum of the laterite to be removed.

The officials also issued ‘mineral transit’ passes to the mafia who used the permits with free abandon to transport the excavated earth on dumper trucks to wetland sites they sought to convert into housing plots.

The mafia acquired wetlands by recruiting landless persons to buy less than five cents of paddy land at their behest.

The purchaser then made an application in the local village office for permission to reclaim the wetland for building a house.

The land mafia used the method to acquire large swathes of environmentally fragile paddy and wetland incrementally for sale as housing plots.

The police and Revenue officials, who reportedly made a fortune in monthly bribes from the real estate mafia, generally turned a blind eye to the violations.

The Vigilance seized several dumper trucks, earthmovers and allied equipment during the raids. DG, VACB, Anil Kanth, and IG, H. Venkatesh, supervised the operation.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/lvv4gj/article30800637.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12tvsaveearth,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/vacb-raids-expose-real-estate-mafia/article30796004.ece
181,2020/02/12,Diet debate enlivens a tense House,"Pot belly, diets and P.C. George’s demand to ban rice

Veering away from high-pitched debates, legislators engaged themselves in a brief banter on pot belly and low-carb diets in the Assembly on Tuesday, following a demand by P.C. George to ban rice, the staple food of Keralites.

The hilarious exchange unfolded during question hour when Health Minister K.K. Shylaja fielded questions on the efforts being made by her department to tackle the increasing prevalence of lifestyle diseases.

Chipping in, Mr. George remarked that rice and its various dishes were at the root of all lifestyle diseases and demanded that the Minister adopted steps to discourage its use.

The six-time MLA also proposed an alternative – to source the rice cultivated by actor Mammootty in his fields. Reason? The rice variety, which he said cost ₹250 a kilo, was apparently ‘sugar-free’.

Joining the issue, Speaker P. Sreeramakrishnan wondered whether Mr. George attributed his tummy to rice products, to which the latter replied it had nothing to do with his eating habits and was due to his lifestyle that involved frequent travels. Adding this was no laughing matter, Mr. George said he did not consume rice. “In fact, I chose to order a set of poori masala when several of my colleagues (in the Assembly) had idlis for breakfast,” he said.

Prompted to respond, Ms. Shylaja said one could restrict the intake of carbohydrates, adopting a balanced diet with a small serving of rice with larger portions of vegetables or fish. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan also chipped in with his view that traditional eating habits could not be replaced at one stroke through policies.

Bringing an end to the diet debate, Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala endorsed Mr. Vijayan’s view and advocated daily exercise to stay in shape. He concluded only after remarking, “PC (Mr. George) will have a hard time convincing others that he avoided rice with that pot belly of his.”",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/diet-debate-enlivens-a-tense-house/article30795970.ece

Reiterating the government’s stance against the preparation of the National Population Register (NPR), Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has accused the Opposition of whipping up panic over the Census exercise. He has dismissed United Democratic Front allegations that the government intends to establish detention centres.

“In fact, it was Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala who was the then Home Minister who signed and forwarded a file to the Social Justice Department on December 18, 2015 for setting up detention centres,” Mr. Vijayan said, responding to questions raised by Congress members A.P. Anil Kumar, P.T. Thomas, and Sunny Joseph in the Assembly on Tuesday.

The claim was soon countered by Mr. Chennithala, who maintained that the endeavour was intended to establish facilities to lodge foreigners whose visas were found to have expired during their stay in the State.

Mr. Vijayan informed the House that the government would go ahead with the Census, but refrain from facilitating enumeration for the National Population Register. The government had, through the Chief Secretary, conveyed to the Centre its objections in carrying out the task.

184,2020/02/12,House passes cemeteries Bill,"The new legislation will now be limited to Malankara Church factions

The State Assembly on Tuesday unanimously passed the Kerala Christian Cemeteries (Right to Burial of Corpse) Bill, 2020 that seeks to overcome the impasse over the funeral of the deceased following the tussle between the Orthodox and Jacobite factions of the Malankara Church.

The scope of the legislation will now be limited to the Malankara Church as the Subject Committee had taken into account the concerns raised by the legislators and other Churches over extending the provisions of the law to other denominations, Law Minister A. K. Balan told the House while replying to the Bill as reported by the committee.

The new law seeks to protect the rights of the deceased to be buried in the cemeteries of the parishes they belonged to.

Following the July 3, 2017 Supreme Court verdict that upheld the 1934 constitution of the Malankara Church, many parishes that were in the possession of the Jacobites were handed over to the Orthodox faction and consequently the Jacobites found it difficult to conduct the funeral rites of their deceased in the parishes and cemeteries. The Minister, who moved the Bill in the House for Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, said the government had tried all means to sort out the issues through talks . ""There were recent incidents of undue delay in burial of bodies. Those incidents were a shame on Kerala's culture. It can lead to social and religious conflicts and law and order situations,"" he said. The Supreme Court and the High Court had observed that the last rites of no devotee should be disrupted in the name of faith. The government stepped in with legislation after the efforts of the Cabinet subcommitte led by the Industries Minister E.P. Jayarajan also failed to resolve the dispute, the Minister said.

Title of Bill changed

The Minister said the title of the Bill has been changed to convey the message that it would be applicable only to the Orthodox and Jacobite factions.

Speaker, P. Sreeramakrishnan said the change in the title of the Bill would come into effect only after Governor gives the nod to the Bill passed by the Assembly

Leader of the Opposition, Ramesh Chennithala, and Deputy Leader, M. K. Muneer, who registered dissent in the Subject Committee, told the House that they were agreeing to the spirit of the Bill and supporting it.

“The dissent was for not drafting the Bill properly and for not holding consultations before pilotiing the Bill on such a sensitive issue,” Mr. Chennithala said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/aqenzs/article30795772.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07tv-CemeteriesCTY-revcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/house-passes-cemeteries-bill/article30795729.ece
185,2020/02/12,Processing of LiDAR survey data begins,"It has picked up contours along semi-high-speed railway route

The processing of the LiDAR survey data for finalising the alignment of the proposed 531.45-km semi-high-speed railway (SHSR) corridor from Kochuveli to Kasaragod has commenced.

The Director General, Survey, has cleared the high-resolution data picked up using the Partenavia P68 aircraft to enable Kerala Railway Development Corporation Limited (KRDCL) to commence processing work.

A team of the Hyderabad-based GeoKno India Pvt. Ltd, tasked with the field survey, has started comparing the survey data for the first 100 km with the worked out alignment at the KRDCL office in the capital, sources told The Hindu.

Land surveyed

Although land at a width of 600 m was surveyed for the project, named Silver Line, it will be set up in the suitable 25-m width. The LiDAR eye picked up buildings, people-inhabited areas, forests, bridges, stone benches, and bushes along the proposed north-south corridor.

Through LiDAR technology, the survey of the entire section was carried out to prepare the complete digital elevation model, digital terrain model, digital surface model, L-sections, C-sections, contour, topographical mapping, vegetation mapping, hydrographic/ sonar/ bathymetric surveys, wherever required, and submit the processed geographical data for engineering design of the entire length and lateral construction.

The changes needed in the alignment will be made after the data are compared with the worked out alignment, he said. The initial 300 km of the third and fourth lines from Kochuveli to Thrissur will be mostly parallel to the existing track. From Thirunavaya to Kasaragod, it will be parallel to the existing line with rail bypasses at Vadakara and Thalassery as proposed in the feasibility report by the Paris-based engineering and consulting group Systra, the general consultant of the KRDCL.

Only after the alignment is finalised can the DPR be completed by Systra and the KRDCL can seek the mandatory approval from the Centre and the State government.

A new traffic and transportation survey for the corridor has revealed a daily ridership of 73,000 in 2024 when the ₹66,079-crore project is completed.

Project in 3 years

Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac has announced in the 2020-2021 Budget that the project will be completed in three years after the land is acquired.

186,2020/02/12,"‘Relationships are like elastic’: Imtiaz Ali on 'Love Aaj Kal', modern romance and more","The director talks about his upcoming spiritual remake, the characters of Veer and Zoe, and the manic pixie dream girls in his films

Eleven years after their story wound up neatly, Meera and Jai have a rather tumultuous relationship. “They have split and met many times ever since,” says director Imtiaz Ali about the two characters from his 2009 romantic comedy, Love Aaj Kal (LAK), “They’ve repeated their story, though nothing has reduced in terms of their passion,” he says.

Changing equations

Ali is chatting with The Hindu at his Window Seat Films office in Andheri about his upcoming release, also titled Love Aaj Kal. His interview is peppered with pensive pauses, and he frequently shuts his eyes with his hands as he navigates his thoughts and replies. On why he decided not to revisit Meera and Jai’s tale (played by Deepika Padukone and Saif Ali Khan), he says, “There’s nothing new for me to say. I’m more interested in the concept rather than the players.” So the writer-director rediscovered a story in the dynamism of love and romance through the decades. “I’d like to shout it from the rooftops, it’s not a sequel!” he laughs.

This year’s film follows entirely new characters and the present-day relationship between Sara Ali Khan’s Zoe and Kartik Aaryan’s Veer, while weaving in a love story from the ’90s (with characters essayed by Arushi Sharma and Kartik Aaryan in a second role).

Poetic repetition

Ali’s oeuvre of romantic films – from Socha Na Tha (2005) to Tamasha (2015) – is rooted in his ongoing quest to understand and unpack what love means. This time around, the script started taking shape six years ago: “It’s about the romantic moments of your past – [the ones] that you think about. Are they equally valuable to you if the relationship hasn’t worked [out]?” Delving into where his stories and characters come from, he adds, “There’s a certain sense of inhibition that I have as a person – so [there’s something] aspirational [to it].”

While the director is often criticised for retelling the same stories, Ali finds poetry in the repetition. “Something repeats in my stories,” he shares, “[the relationships are] like elastic. The more you stretch them [apart], the more tension there is to come together.” This imagery echoes clearly in the original LAK – whose working title was Elastic – which begins on the separation of its protagonists, before slipping into the newfound ease Meera and Jai find in each other while apart. The upcoming film carries this theme forward – as the trailer attests to the oft-memed scene of Zoe tearfully telling Veer he has started to irritate her.

With Zoe pivoting the narratives, Ali admits her questions and apprehensions about love reflect his. Describing the confident and career-driven 22-year-old woman, Ali says, “[She] cannot help but go into a romantic situation with a little baggage of what her previous generations have gone through. The disarming way in which people could be romantically indulgent, this girl cannot.” He adds that an inability to attach permanently with anything today leads to a sense of loneliness amongst youngsters: “[She knows] only too well [about] all the heads that have rolled in the previous [generation’s] marriages.” While decades separate the filmmaker rom his character, she carries many of his questions like, “She wonders if it’s natural for a man and a woman to be in a monogamous relationship – there’s something innately errant about that, which is why relationships don’t work and we blame ourselves,” says Ali.

Endearing characters

While the author’s voice is evident in his films, Ali admits that he’s probably most attached to Ranbir Kapoor’s Jordan from Rockstar (2011) because he is most unlike him. “He’s sensitive, but brute and inarticulate – anybody else would reason,” the director explains, pointing out how Jordan doesn’t hide his love for Heer despite her marriage, “I like that attitude about him – there’s an innocence.”

Ali’s women are often desi variations of the manic pixie dream girl – whether it’s the bubbly Geet from Jab We Met (2007) or the animated Sejal from Jab Harry Met Sejal (2017) – who aid the coming-of-age of the men they’re paired with. When asked how he deals with the criticisms surrounding his characterisations, the writer-director says he isn’t resistant to hearing people’s opinions, and stayed focused on staying true to his story. Instead, Ali turns to those closest to him for counsel. For instance, his 19-year-old daughter Ida often helps shape his ideas and narratives. “That’s the tone of this film,” says Ali as he wraps up, “As though I’m talking to her – an older person to a younger person.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/k28s9h/article30803158.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13bm-pg5-Imtiaz-Ali-2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/relationships-are-like-elastic-imtiaz-ali-on-love-aaj-kal-modern-romance-and-more/article30803159.ece
187,2020/02/12,Chief Minister Pramod Sawant upset with ‘Malang’ maligning the image of Goa,"It was unfair for the film starring Aditya Roy Kapur and Disha Patani to portray the state as a destination for drugs, said the CM

Claiming that Mohit Suri’s Malang projects Goa in a poor light as a drug haven, the state government will henceforth only permit shooting of movies after a thematic inspection, Chief Minister Pramod Sawant said on Wednesday.

“After this, while giving permission, the Entertainment Society of Goa will check the story and they will not be allowed to malign the image of the state. Only then, will we will give the permission,” Sawant told reporters when asked if he felt that the recently released “Malang”, which has many scenes of drug and rave parties in Goa, maligned the image of the coastal state.

The Entertainment Society of Goa is a government agency that serves as a nodal body for granting of shooting permissions in the state.

Sawant also said that Goa boasts of a good law and order situation, among many pluses, and therefore it was unfair to portray the state as a destination for drugs.

“Our state has good law and order. Why should they focus (and) portray the state as a place (with) drugs and other things? Before giving permission, now we will at least go through the theme and see what are they showing about Goa,” Sawant reiterated.

Asked if he was aware that the film’s opening credits have a thank you note for ‘Chief Minister Pramod Sawant’ for cooperation, Sawant said that he was not aware of it.

Malang stars Anil Kapoor, Aditya Roy Kapur, Disha Patani and Kunal Kemmu in pivotal roles, and has been shot in Goa and Mauritius.

Although the state is regarded as one of the most popular beach and nightlife tourism destinations, Goa over decades has also earned infamy as a destination for narco-tourism, especially the state’s beach-fronted coastline.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/kq3szv/article30801034.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/malang,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/chief-minister-pramod-sawant-upset-with-malang-maligning-the-image-of-goa/article30801035.ece
188,2020/02/12,Will Arnett: ‘It is still hard to say goodbye to BoJack Horseman’,"The Netflix show, created by Raphael Bob-Waksberg, ended with the second part of its sixth season on January 31

Actor Will Arnett is feeling “bittersweet” with the conclusion of his Netflix series BoJack Horseman as he admits that it is hard for him to let go of it.

The show, created by Raphael Bob-Waksberg, ended with its sixth season, which was divided into two parts. The first installment came out on October 25 last year, while the second part started streaming from January 31.

The animated series narrates the story of a depressed alcoholic horse called BoJack (Arnett), who plans his return to celebrity relevance with an autobiography.

Talking to Variety, the actor said he is “satisfied” with the way the show ended.

“It’s bittersweet. I feel satisfied with what we did. (Raphael) is an incredible writer and I feel fortunate I got to be a part of something like that, and ride his coattails a bit,” Arnett said.

The actor, who has also featured in shows such as Arrested Development and Riviera, admitted that it is still “hard to say goodbye“.

“Last week, we had a little screening in LA and Raphael, (Paul F. Tompkins) and (Aaron Paul) and I were talking. We were like, ‘What (else) can we do?’ We’re always doing that because it’s hard to let go,” Arnett said.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/jk43kq/article30800023.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/bojackkk,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/will-arnett-it-is-still-hard-to-say-goodbye-to-bojack-horseman/article30800024.ece

190,2020/02/12,‘Hope ‘Oh My Kadavule’ starts a romcom trend in Tamil cinema’: Ashok Selvan and Ritika Singh,"Actors Ashok Selvan and Ritika Singh go hammer and tongs at each other in this Friday’s release. But up, close and personal, they are a different story

Observing the lead cast of Oh My Kadavule (OMK) — Ashok Selvan and Ritika Singh — interact with each other at The Hindu’s office, is a study in organic chemistry. It is not the factually accurate definition, but you get the idea.

And what is chemistry without its equations?

Sample this: we ask Ashok who he would prefer to have his fanboy moment with, and he says, “Ritika Singh!”, before continuing, “Because she is amazing! Ayyo, what a performer and as a person... I love her. I’m a fan.”

We look to Ritika only to find her blushing, and in her turn she says, “It is him (Ashok) only. I’m genuinely a fan of this guy. I love the way he carries himself. There are not many men like him, who are secure enough in their masculinity to not get intimidated by someone like me.”

Ashok interrupts with: “Yeah, she intimidates a lot of men... wherever she goes,” before breaking into a smile, as Ritika continues, “I’m not praising myself but I have a very strong personality. I come across as... tough, and overpowering. Many men I have known have been very insecure, and they have made me feel like I’m the wrong kind of girl. He (Ashok) is not like that. He makes you feel that you are good enough the way you are.”

Edited excerpts from an interaction with the duo:

Ritika, you said that you agreed to do OMK because you’d get to wear a Christian bridal dress... True?

Ritika Singh (RS): (laughs)... That was a joke.

Ashok Selvan (AS): Don’t lie! (laughs)

RS: No! That was also one of the big pluses. But mainly it was the fact that it is a romantic comedy. I always wanted to do a film where I get to be a little normal. (Ashok sniggers, Ritika notices and smiles back). In all my other movies, I have been been a little ‘Grr’, so this is more normal. It is a very girl-next-door kind of character, and then I head that Vijay Sethupathi was doing an integral part in the film. I was sold.

AS: Wait, so not for me? (makes a playful frown)

RS: (smiles) Ashok is... the main reason actually.

AS: Now in the next interview, she is going to say that was a joke! (laughs)

Why choose Vijay Sethupathi to play God?

AS: The role required somebody the audience would love to listen to. I mean, I’m a fan, so is she (points at Ritika) and my whole team is a big fan of Vijay Sethupathi. We like to see his interviews: his mind space is very interesting, his way of looking at things and answering questions. We wanted somebody who can project warmth. Simply put, he has that aura.

Tell us about your character, Ritika?

RS: My character’s name is Anu. She and Arjun have been best friends, but she has always had these feelings towards him ever since she was young. She has always known but he never realised, and suddenly, one day, he goes, ‘I cannot marry somebody I don’t know’. So I say, ‘You have me. You have known me all your life. Why don’t we get married?’ He doesn’t have a reason to say ‘No’ to me, and we end up getting married. I’ve always wanted to take things forward with him and....

AS: Ok, wait! (and puts his hand across)

RS: That’s just the trailer (she bats his hand away and continues)

AS: Okay, just keeping a check (smiles)

RS: Yeah, so... you have seen it (trailer) right? He doesn’t reciprocate really well, and that is where the insecurities begin. Anu is insecure and she is uncertain of what this guy is going to do...

AS: (In a hushed tone) I’m mysterious like that...

RS: Ptch! There is no mystery (Ashok laughs). He is like an idiot in the film.

AS: Only the character...

RS: Yeah, character. Not in real life. He is very mysterious I must say in real life... Quite the Scorpio!

AS: (Rolls eyes)... every conversation with her will lead to sun signs... I’m warning you now! Anything you say will lead to...

RS: (Asks the writer) When is your birthday?

AS: See, I told you (laughs).

RS: (Laughs)... like I was saying, Anu is a very normal girl and I enjoyed playing a character that is more relatable. I am sure many women would relate to her.

Tamil cinema is giving us a pure romcom (romantic comedy) after a long time. Ashok, you are aware how this industry has made it a habit to follow a trend. Are you scared that it will be similar with OMK?

AS: I’m hoping that OMK creates a trend, because I’m bored of horror and thriller films. Romcom films, right now, may look like a risky thing for producers. If OMK creates a pattern, then that (notion) gets broken, but I can only hope that more versatile films come. Maybe, the films that always work have a good script. If that becomes a trend, that will be nice and not a trend based on the film’s genre.

It’s complicated A romcom film, Oh My Kadavule chronicles the life of Arjun (played by Ashok) and Anu (played by Ritika) — two best friends who choose to get married because Arjun does not want to get hitched with someone he “does not know” (read as: arranged marriage). But problems begin soon after the wedding as Arjun struggles to romance his best friend, and things are further complicated when a high school crush, Meera (played by Vani Bhojan), gatecrashes the party. Throw a God act by Vijay Sethupathi into the mix, and Oh My Kadavule promises to be a fun Valentine’s Day watch.

Ritika, you have spoken about how enjoyable it was shooting for the film. Could you share any fun moments from the set?

RS: Every day was fun. He (Ashok) is always embarassing himself...

AS: (With a confused look) ...excuse me?!?

RS: Yeah, that’s true! (smiles)

AS: (Nods affirmatively) Kinda true.

RS: Honestly, so am I. (Looks at Ashok) Go on, you can say it.

AS: (Takes a deep breath) She is so calm and composed on the set. She is sooo normal (Ritika starts to laugh)... NOT! (both laugh). But she has got that energy which made a lot of difference to the movie. It was nice. All I can think about making this film is happiness.

RS: Yeah, I never once felt tired. I was never... like stressed, even after working for 24 hours. It felt like I was on a holiday, working with my favourite people every day. I actually miss shooting. I want to go back on the set and shoot again with these people. That is how much I loved it.

Long time coming Produced by Ashok Selvan and Abinaya Selvam for Happy High Pictures and Dilli Babu for Axess Film Factory, Oh My Kadavule is filmmaker Ashwath Marimuthu’s debut feature. Ashok and Ashwath go a long way back to when the latter was a contestant in the television programme, Naalaiya Iyakkunar. “We made short films, and one of them won the best film and best actor award on the show. That is how this whole trust came about, and we are friends basically. It was an unwritten agreement that we were going to make a film someday,” says Ashok.

Given that shooting again is not happening anytime soon... what is the feeling like?

Ashok gestures a silent “Oh no!” and shakes his head. He says in a hushed voice, “She will break down” (laughs)

RS: (Smiles) There is this thing I have in my head. I don’t want to watch the film because if I do, then OMK will be over for me. The end. Full stop. I don’t want that full stop to come. I don’t want it to end, that is the feeling I have right now.

AS: All of us have that feeling. There is a sense of ownership in all of us because we involved everybody in the script.

RS: That is the best part about him and his sister (Abinaya Selvam, who is co-producer). They kept all of us involved. They would send messages saying what was happening, like the music is being composed now etc. No one does that, and in the film’s poster also they have written my name. They (producers) never do that. It is always the actor’s name. I called Abinaya to tell her that it was very nice of her to put my name up there. I feel like this is my film, and I genuinely want it to do well.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/4gueyi/article30799713.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MPOMK1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/hope-oh-my-kadavule-starts-a-romcom-trend-in-tamil-cinema-interview-with-ashok-selvan-and-ritika-singh/article30799714.ece
191,2020/02/12,A long story in Kakinada,"Director Chandu Muddu’s second Telugu film ‘O Pitta Katha’ looks promising

Chandu Muddu is no debutant. His first Telugu film Ma Voorlo O Sari Yem Jarigindhante, an independent venture, released a few years ago. Though his concept and directorial skills were lauded, he did not get the push. Now, after seven years of struggle, he has come up with another concept-based film called O Pitta Katha . The recently-released poster of the film based in Kakinada and with many twists stirred enough interest — it has three pairs of footwear belonging to three characters Venkatalakshmi, Krish and Prabhu. One is a worn out chappal, other is a decent slipper and the last one is a good pair of shoes.

Speaking of how the film came about, Chandu says, “It took three years to write the script of O Pitta Katha. After I was introduced to Brahmaji, he helped me put the script in place. Before this I had directed another film Ee Cinema Super Hit Guarantee. Directors Sagar Chandra and Merlapaka Gandhi were of great support and felt that I have the potential. Things moved from there.”

The story of O Pitta Katha is narrated in the perspective of two people. Nitya Shetty, a child artiste-turned-heroine plays the leading lady Venkatalakshmi. Chandhu says, “It is a complicated screenplay with strong village naivete. We shot in Hyderabad, Kerala and Kakinada, first in 5D, showed it to the producers and once we got the approval went ahead and shot it again. Vishwant, Sanjay, Balraju and Brahmaji are the principal characters.”

Armed with a MA in Telugu literature from Amalapuram, Chandhu is a low profile man who spends all his time in an orphanage writing stories despite having a family of his own. That he has a fetish for village-based subjects is evident. He adds, “It is a clean movie and if you see it, you’ll get a feeling you are in a village for Sankranthi. Yet, nothing that you expect happens, it will be a sweet surprise.”

Praveen Lakkaraju who had earlier worked in Express Raja and Gitanjali scored the music. Sunil Kumar is the cinematographer; a DFT graduate, he had earlier worked in Jessie, a horror film. “My film is not inspired or adapted from any book or film. If an accident happens, we blame the opposite person and that person blames us. But actually what happens there is something else,” says Chandu explaining the essence of the film, and adds, “I hope to make it big with this film because I have the support of a production house, Bhavya Creations.”

For his last film, Chandu had released it on his own though he was a novice in marketing cinema. Producer Yash Rangineni has the remake rights of Chandu’s Ma Voorlo… and has plans to remake it. Director Trivikram Srinivas gave it O Pitta Katha the tagline It’s a long story... The project has been planned by director Chandrasekhar Yeleti.

The film is scheduled to release a day before Holi.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/mif9ng/article30799686.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hym13chendu-2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/director-chandu-muddus-second-telugu-film-o-pitta-katha-looks-promising/article30799687.ece

The little girl in Drishyam who acted as the daughter in the Malayalam, Tamil and Telugu versions is now a lead heroine. Her film Johar will be releasing this month. Directed by Teja Marni, a newcomer, the entire cast features debutants. Esther has been getting offers for sometime and she has been discussing about them with her parents till she came across the script of Johar. She immediately told her parents she is interested in doing it. It is a compilation of stories and each story is connected to the other; she plays the lead in one of them. The film which was shot in Varanasi and Hyderabad is due for release in February and Esther had dubbed for it.

Speaking about her entry into the world of showbiz, Esther says, “My mom used to host a cookery show on TV in 2010 in Wayanad. I was in the third standard then and the crew saw me and asked if I would be interested in anchoring for a TV show for children. At that age you don’t know what you are doing and aren’t shy of the camera. May be now I am scared but back then it was an easy job.” While Esther’s mother, over the years shifted to becoming an organic cooking expert, Esther and her younger brother Eric moved towards acting.

Ask her the influence that the beautiful Waynad had on her, she says whatever she is today, it has got to do a lot with Waynad. She reminisces, “I was surrounded by trees and fresh air. Dad would tell us that the land belongs to ants and birds and not us, we were connected to nature very early in life.”

While managing her acting career, Esther has not abandoned her academics. “By the time I came to tenth standard, I became serious about my studies. Right now I am pursuing BA in St Xavier’s, Mumbai. There have been lot of instances when I wanted to quit acting. As a child I missed out on a lot of things. I got to work with legendary filmmakers in the south and I realised I had some talent and not pursuing a career in films will be a waste of talent. I’ve decided to manage both — films and studies — well.”

Having done 29 films so far in south languages, Esther says a film’s success or failure has an impact on her but adds that she wouldn’t have been the person she is now without films.

On the transition from child artiste to heroine, Esther says, “ Lot of people think I am still that little girl. The reactions are quite funny actually. When they see me on screen, they comment I’ve grown up but when they see me in person they exclaim, ‘You look small!'. I’m getting used to all this,” she laughs.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/3yrn9w/article30799438.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hym12esther2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/child-no-more-drishyam-actor-esther-anil-turns-leading-lady-with-johar/article30799439.ece

What a sweet sequel this movie is! Amidst all the horrors of global warming, random acts of cruelty and the hideously plastic Valentine’s Day celebrations, here is a movie so full of charm that you can’t help falling in love with it.

A sequel to 2018’s To All the Boys I've Loved Before directed by Susan Johnson based on Jenny Han’s 2014 novel of the same name, To All the Boys: P.S. I Still Love You is also based on Han’s novel and follows its delightful protagonist, Lara Jean.

Lara Jean (Lana Condor) and Peter (Noah Centineo) are officially dating and Lara Jean experiences many firsts: kiss, date, and heartbreak when John Ambrose McClaren (Jordan Fisher), who Lara Jean had a crush on and written a letter, comes back into her life. Lara Jean’s widowed father, (John Corbett — Aidan from Sex and the City) has a chance at love. While mean girl Gen (Emilija Baranac) has a secret.

Cast: Lana Condor, Noah Centineo, Jordan Fisher, Janel Parrish, Anna Cathcart, Trezzo Mahoro, Madeleine Arthur, Emilija Baranac, Kelcey Mawema, Ross Butler, Sarayu Blue, John Corbett, Holland Taylor

Storyline: Lara Jean and Peter are negotiating the tricky landscape of coupledom when another recipient of Lara Jean’s letters turns up

Apart from Fisher, newcomers include Sarayu Blue as Trina, the Covey’s neighbour and Holland Taylor as Stormy, who gives Lara Jean sage advice such as “sometimes you have to kiss the wrong man to know the right one”. As spunky Stormy, Holland seems a continuation of her Ida character from Mr Mercedes.

194,2020/02/12,‘Master’ co-star Vijay Sethupathi defends Vijay over IT raids conspiracy theory,"Actor posts on Twitter shutting down rumours about the recent raids pertaining to the profits of Vijay’s ‘Bigil’

Vijay Sethupathi is a star who’s been known to bond with his co-stars in movies easily, and his presence at several launches and events by other actors only exemplifies that.

Now, with the shooting of his Master with Vijay well underway, the actor has stuck up for his co-star on social media, addressing several conspiracy theories over the IT raids that happened at Vijay’s house.

Posting screenshots of a document that is titled ‘Key truths behind IT raids on Vijay’, Sethupathi commented on his Twitter account, “Poi vera velai irundha paarungada” (Why don’t you guys go do something else?)

The document traces a theory that Jeppiar’s daughter Regina is spearheading the Christian Conversion movement in TN, and wanted to accomplish this with the inclusion of actors like Sethupathi, Arya and other actors who have been ‘converted’ already. It goes on to mention the funding behind Vijay’s film Bigil and that the black money from the proceeds went to Vijay, producers AGS and Anbu Chezian who transferred the funds to Regina. It also adds that more skeletons would be uncovered in the coming days.

Clearly, Vijay Sethupathi hasn’t taken kindly to these accusations that is floating around on Whatsapp, and the normally-reticent star wants the industry to move on from the incident.

Meanwhile, the first single of Master titled Oru Kutti Kathai is set to release on Valentine's Day. Directed by Lokesh Kanagaraj, the film also stars the likes of Malavika Mohanan, Andrea Jeremiah, Shanthnu Bhagyaraj and Arjun Das, and is set for a April 2020 release.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/gr3da4/article30799088.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/master,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/master-co-star-vijay-sethupathi-defends-vijay-over-it-raids-conspiracy-theory/article30799089.ece

Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey actor Margot Robbie will co-star Oscar winner Christian Bale in a new film from filmmaker David O Russell.

According to The Hollywood Reporter, Russell has penned the script for the untitled film, which hails from New Regency, and he might direct it if things go as per the plan.

Plot details are being kept under wraps but it is said to be based on an original idea from the director. Matthew Budman of American Hustle fame will produce.

Bale, 46, previously collaborated with Russell on 2010’s The Fighter, which earned the actor his maiden Oscar for best supporting actor, and 2013’s American Hustle.

He most recently starred in James Mangold’s Ford vs Ferrari, where he portrayed professional racer Ken Miles opposite Matt Damon as Carroll Shelby.

Robbie, 29, was recently nominated at the Academy Awards for her role in Bombshell. She currently features in DC-Warner Bros’ Birds of Prey movie.

196,2020/02/12,Dance crew V Unbeatable perform Rajinikanth’s ‘Marana Mass’ from ‘Petta’ at finale of ‘America’s Got Talent: The Champions’,"The Indian dance team left the audiences and judges Simon Cowell, Heidi Klum, Howie Mandel and Alesha Dixon completely flabbergasted with their act

Indian dance crew V Unbeatable captured the fancy of audiences across the world with their incredible moves on America’s Got Talent season 14. The team ended up finishing in fourth spot, with many rooting for them to win.

However, they are back now in the US for America’s Got Talent: The Champions Season 2, and now have reached the show’s finale.

Guess what song they picked for their epic showcase in the final? Rajinikanth’s Marana Mass from Petta!

The infectious track composed by Anirudh Ravichander was a super-hit when it released last year, and now it was the turn of US audiences to groove to the beats when V Unbeatable danced through the number with a series of twirls, jumps and jaw-dropping stunts.

The judges Simon Cowell, Heidi Klum, Howie Mandel and Alesha Dixon (who were all given garlands before the performance) were left completely confounded, as they could only watch the energy and enthusiasm unfolding on stage.

The performance ended to a standing ovation, after which Simon Cowell stated, “The appeal for me is that you are not a professional act. You are just regular guys and girls who have got together and done something remarkable. The fact that you had so little time to prepare, it makes it even more amazing.”

Howie Mandel even tweeted, “This is BY FAR the BEST act that has ever graced any of the stages on any talent show. @v_unbeatable brings more passion and dedication than ANY group I’ve ever seen. I hope they WIN! #AGTChampions.”

197,2020/02/12,13 students hospitalised in Dharmapuri,"The students had accidentally eaten laddus mixed with rat posion that had been meant to kill rodents

Thirteen students, who had accidentally consumed sesame laddus mixed with rat poison meant to kill rodents in a government school, were rushed to hospital. The students are said to be out of danger.

All the students, aged 17 or 18 years, of Begarahalli government higher secondary school were rushed to the nearest primary health centre, after they ate some sesame laddus bought by a fellow student to the school.

A student of Gejanayakkanahalli village had reportedly bought to school sesame laddus in a packet as a snack and shared it among his friends and classmates. It was later found that his father had mixed rat poison in the laddus and set them aside, to be used to kill the rodents at home. Unaware of this, the boy had brought the packet to school.

The boys complained of giddiness and a few vomited and fainted, before they were rushed to the nearest primary health centre. From there, the boys were taken to the government medical college hospital, Dharmapuri.

198,2020/02/12,Students in Tamil Nadu governement schools to soon have health and wellness programme,"Curriculum will focus on physical and mental health, gender sensitivity, safe internet use and prevention of substance abuse

Students across all government and government-aided schools in Tamil Nadu will now have a structured health and wellness programme which will cover several aspects ranging from emotional well-being to gender sensitivity.

The curriculum framework for the programme, which has been drawn up by NCERT (National Council of Educational Research and Training) in collaboration with UNESCO and other experts from across the country, will focus on the physical and mental health and well being of students and also focus on gender sensitivity, safe internet use and prevention of substance abuse among other aspects.

“We are moving towards an inclusive curriculum where students are exposed to a balanced education system. Education is moving towards learning outcomes and this programme will ensure a more holistic and well-rounded experience for students,” said Sigy Thomas Vaidhyan, Commissioner of School Education.

Dheeraj Kumar, School Education secretary, stressed the importance of a sustained effort to be taken to ensure that students go through an all round development.

The School Education Department plans to introduce one hour every week for students from classes 6 to 11 from the coming academic year for the health and wellness program.

Minister for School Education K.A. Sengottaiyan launched a tool kit for the program on Tuesday, and inaugurated an orientation session for district level officials and DIET (District Institute of Education and Training) principals from across the State. On Wednesday, the Union Ministry of Health released the facilitator guide, training material and curriculum for the programme.

Officials from the School Education Department said that following this, nearly 26,000 teachers from across the State will be trained for the effective implementation of this programme. “From each school, two teachers will be chosen as the health ambassadors and they will then take this forward to the students,” an official said.

As a part of the orientation session, the officials participated in discussions about issues and concerns of adolescents in Tamil Nadu and how the school health programme can be implemented to address them.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/mgi13p/article30799813.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12FEBTH--GOVTSCHOOL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/students-in-tamil-nadu-governement-schools-to-soon-have-health-and-wellness-programme/article30799814.ece
199,2020/02/12,​Analysis | Countering Opposition: The Palaniswami strategy​,"Tamil Nadu Chief Minister has acceded to demands for abolishing common examination for classes 5 and 8 and proposing to declare the Cauvery delta a Protected Special Agricultural Zone

Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, who will be completing three years in office on Saturday next, appears to have taken the wind out of the Opposition’s sails by acceding to demands for abolishing common examination for classes 5 and 8 and proposing to declare the Cauvery delta a Protected Special Agricultural Zone (PSAZ).​

The proposed PSAZ has even won endorsement from some allies of the DMK, such as the State Congress chief K. S. Alagiri and founder of the Indhiya Jananayaga Katchi T. R. Paarivendhar, who got elected to Parliament from Perambalur on a DMK ticket. The significance of the decision has to be viewed against the backdrop of a series of protests the Delta has witnessed in the last three years over proposals for the implementation of hydro-carbon projects. Farmers felt that the projects, if taken up, will reduce the fertile zone of the State into a “region of wasteland.”​

DMK unimpressed

Expectedly, the DMK is not impressed. “Except that the decisions have been made purely keeping in mind the ruling party’s political and electoral interests, they will serve no public purpose,” contends I. Paranthaman, DMK’s spokesperson.​

If the government is really keen on the welfare of school students, it would have ensured the distribution of laptops to eligible students. The government cancelled the common examination perhaps realising that it would not be advisable to hold it, in the light of reports of the State recording an “unprecedented rise” in the rate of school dropout.​ ​

As for the PSAZ, Mr. Paranthaman argues that Mr. Palaniswami’s announcement is meant for future projects and not for existing or initiated ones. He does not agree that the ruling party has rendered an important issue, being raised by the DMK, into a non-issue. “By the time the Assembly elections take place [next year], everyone will realise that the Chief Minister’s announcement has remained only on paper,” he feels. ​​

There is a view that the PSAZ proposal was triggered by the AIADMK’s “continuous poor” performance in the Delta region, traditionally deemed a DMK stronghold.​

The region had seen an erosion of the Opposition party’s base when Jayalalithaa was around. But, the 2016 Assembly election results dropped enough hints that the DMK might shortly re-establish supremacy in the region. During the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and by-polls to three Assembly constituencies in the central region, the AIADMK faced a washout. Its senior leader, M. Thambi Durai, who was Lok Sabha’s Deputy Speaker, had lost by a huge margin of about 4.2 lakh votes in Karur. In the rural local bodies in 27 districts in December last, except in Karur and Ariyalur, the AIADMK faced an embarrassment as the DMK had secured higher number of seats. ​ ​

Strongly disputing the point of electoral considerations, K. P. Munusamy, the AIADMK’s deputy coordinator, says the “Amma [Jayalalithaa] government’s decision has been governed by long-term interests of the State alone. Food security has been the top priority of the government, overlooking any other factor. When a government takes such a decision, it cannot allow itself to be influenced by petty political considerations,” he responds. He adds that those who cannot stomach that the government is getting laurels from all around over the decision are only criticising it.​ ​

Mr. Munusamy disagrees that the declaration has been made with an eye on the Assembly election. “Had this been so, would we not have announced it long back? Those accusing us of being subservient to the BJP should now understand that the government will go to any length to safeguard the interests of the State and will even take on any government [Centre]. On this issue [hydrocarbon exploration], ours is a regime that takes a stand against that of the Centre,” he explains. ​ ​

Notwithstanding the points and counterpoints, the coming election to urban local bodies will demonstrate on which side lie voters.​",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/8d0w9x/article30799444.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDNEDUVASAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/analysis-countering-opposition-the-palaniswami-strategy/article30799445.ece

202,2020/02/12,Four arrested for smuggling ganja,"112 kg of contraband seized

Police arrested two persons for smuggling ganja and seized 56 kg of the contraband in the Dhanbad – Alappuzha Express.

Police said S. Deivam, 33, of Polliyampatti village in Usilampatti, and A. Thavamani, 55, of Meiyanampatti village in Usilampatti, boarded the train at Narsipatnam station near Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh around noon on Monday. They picked up the contraband in four bags from another gang and boarded the train.

When the train neared Arakkonam in the early hours on Tuesday, the Railway Police guard in the train, acting on a tip-off, questioned the two men. Initially, they were asked why they were travelling in a reserved compartment with an ordinary ticket. The police eventually checked their bags and found the ganja worth around ₹6 lakh. They were brought to the Railway Protection Force office at Arakkonam railway station. “They have been handed over to the Narcotics Intelligence Bureau Central Intelligence Department (NIB-CID) Vellore unit,” the Railway Police said. A NIB-CID office in Vellore, said they were heading to Madurai but were nabbed mid-way. “The contraband was sold to them by two persons at Narsipatnam station. We have launched a probe to find them,” he said. Deivam and Thavamani were arrested under various sections of the Narcotics, Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) act and remanded in judicial custody, he said.

203,2020/02/12,Farmers in Ranipet to rear sheep to supplement their income,"An official said the animals could fetch ₹250-₹300 per kg depending on their age

The Animal Husbandry Department has provided varieties of sheep to farmers with the aim of creating more opportunities to increase their livelihood through self-employment.

The Mukundarayapuram Sheep Farm, located on the foothills of Kanchanagiri near Lalapet in Ranipet, maintains around 300 Madras Red Sheep breed for this purpose.

Fodder crops are maintained on around 479.65 acres in the specially created farmland close of the Animal Husbandry Inspectors’ Training Centre. Farmers can buy sheep at rates fixed by the government from here.

According to official sources, there are 12 shepherds identified from nearby villages working in the farm, who provide every aspect of healthcare by monitoring the animals closely.

There are support staff to attend to the issues in the centre as well to the needs of animals. In case of an emergency, the animals would be shifted to a veterinary hospital in nearby Ranipet, they said.

Officials said the efforts taken by the Animal Husbandry Department supplemented the income of small and marginal farmers and landless labourers. It generated gainful employment opportunities, especially self-employment, to a substantial part of rural and urban population, many of whom were women who played major roles in the care and management of livestock, they said.

With dedicated and sustained effort, the department implemented various beneficiary-oriented programmes and fostered judicious utilisation of animals and the natural resources in an eco-balanced way. As a result, the cattle and livestock sector of the State has been elevated to a prominent position, the officials added.

An official said above one-year-old sheep fetched ₹250 per kg and those below one-year fetched ₹300 per kg.

Fodder crops

Fodder crops like Napier grass are grown in around 15 acres, while other grass varieties are also grown in the farmlands by the Animal Husbandary Department and fodder such as Agathi, Kalayanamurungai, Neem, Glyricedia, Camellia are grown in around in 5 acres.

204,2020/02/12,"Residents protest against merger, de-merger of villages","Pernambut villagers stage walkout at consultative meeting in Vellore Collectorate

Villagers protested against the merger and de-merger of villages in panchayat unions of Ranipet, Vellore and Tirupattur districts. They also staged walkouts at the consultative meeting organised at the Vellore Collectorate on Tuesday.

The meeting was organised after the district administrations submitted proposals for delimiting the administrative areas of villages in Madhanur, Alangayam and Tirupattur panchayat unions in Tirupattur district; Kaveripakkam, Nemili, Arakkonam and Sholingur panchayat unions in Ranipet district; Anaikattu, Gudiyatham and Pernambut panchayat unions in Vellore district.

The meeting invited suggestions from the public in the form of petitions. Collectors of Vellore, Tirupattur and Ranipet respectively, A. Shanmuga Sundaram, M.P. Sivanarul and S. Divyadharshini, District Revenue Officer-Vellore, J. Partheeban and DRDO-Project Director, S. Malathi participated.

State general secretary of Federation of Tamil Nadu Farmers’ Associations, A.C. Venkatesan said 26 villages under Pernambut panchayat union are being drafted into the Madhanur panchayat union.

‘Requests not heeded’

“We have been demanding a separate panchayat union for these 26 villages for several years and this was communicated to the State government at the time of consultative meeting conducted for district bifurcation. But without heeding our requests, if the officials take decisions on their own, it is not acceptable to the people. We staged a walkout from the meeting and if they go ahead with the plan, these villages will not participate in local body polls which are likely to be conducted in the next few months,” Mr. Venkatesan said.

Likewise residents living around Ponnai have protested against the alignment of a few villages with the Katpadi panchayat union in Vellore district.

They suggested that they should be brought under the Sholingur panchayat union instead.

Residents who came from Ranipet district said, “The residents pointed out that officials took decisions and then try to convince us. This is not a consultative meeting. They should give credence to peoples’ voices, otherwise there is no point in continuing with these meetings.”

Mr. Shanmuga Sundaram, who spoke at the meeting said their suggestions would be taken into consideration and replies would be sent by post. The village panchayats were reorganised under different panchayat unions to finalise the formation of new districts, he added.

As per the new arrangements, there are no changes in Vellore, Kaniyambadi and K.V. Kuppam panchayat unions in Vellore district.

Likewise there are no changes in Kandhili, Natrampalli and Jolarpet in Tirupattur district and there are no changes in Thimiri, Walajah and Arcot panchayat unions in Ranipet district.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/uzr0xu/article30795813.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11FEBTHVILLAGEMEET,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/residents-protest-against-merger-de-merger-of-villages/article30795814.ece
205,2020/02/12,8 held in connection with illegal adoption of babies,"Couples allegedly gave away their infants in exchange for cash

In separate cases, the Tiruverumbur police on Tuesday arrested eight persons, including two couples, on the charge of adopting babies illegally.

The rescued infants were sent to a recognised adoption centre in neighbouring Ariyalur district, after being produced before the Child Welfare Committee in Tiruchi.

Acting on inputs, a police team from the Tiruverumbur station, along with personnel from the Anti Human Trafficking Unit and the District Child Protection Unit, found that 29-year-old Ashwini of Tiruverumbur, a mother of two girl children, had wanted to adopt a male child. She had allegedly paid ₹1 lakh to N. Velammal, who works as a sweeper at the Mahatma Gandhi Government Hospital in Tiruchi, through her neighbour Lourdumary, who is said to have been the go-between.

The baby was born to K. Bhuvaneswari, 42, a labourer, at the government hospital, and Velammal had arranged the sale of the infant.

The police arrested Ashwini, Velammal, Bhuvaneswari and Lourdumary. Ashwini’s husband R. Govindan, 32, is absconding.

₹82,000 recovered

A case was registered against the five accused under Sections 317 (exposure and abandonment of child under twelve years by parent or person having care of it) and 370 (4) (trafficking of a minor) of the IPC, read with Sections 80 and 81 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act.

A sum of ₹82,000, said to have been part of the amount that Ashwini had allegedly paid Velammal, was recovered.

In another case, a couple, identified as R. Dharmaraj, 30, and D. Rani, 28, allegedly gave away their newborn for adoption without following the prescribed procedure. They had handed over the baby to their relatives P. Kumar, 30, and K. Saradha, 27, who were childless, after allegedly receiving ₹7,000 from the latter.

The offence was brought to light by a village health nurse, who had been monitoring the health of Rani. The police arrested both couples and booked them under the same provisions as the ones that were used in the first case.

Both cases were registered on the basis of separate complaints lodged by the District Child Protection Officer, Tiruchi.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/8-held-in-connection-with-illegal-adoption-of-babies/article30796152.ece

With this, all 24 patients who were admitted to the isolation wards of various government hospitals in the State over symptoms of the novel coronavirus (nCoV) had been discharged, after testing negative for nCoV, health officials said.

The patient who was discharged from the Government Stanley Medical College Hospital was treated for a lung infection. An X-ray showed that the patient had been cured of the infection.

Forty-four other persons, who had returned from nCoV-affected countries, had been put under home quarantine across the State.

207,2020/02/12,Octogenarian moves High Court seeking divorce,"Judge dismayed over rise in cases of marital discord, says ego is prime reason for broken marriages

Justice S. Vaidyanathan of the Madras High Court was taken aback on Tuesday when a case seeking divorce for an 80-year-old ex-serviceman was listed before him.

Suprised at the octogenarian being adamant on obtaining divorce from his estranged wife, with whom he had got married in 1970 and from whom he had separated in 1982, the judge initially wanted to know whether there was any possibility for reunification. When he was told that the aged man from Tiruvannamalai was very particular about getting his marriage nullified, the judge simply admitted the case and ordered notices to the appellant’s wife, now 70 and a mother of three, and a person with whom she reportedly had an illicit affair. Expressing dismay over the rise in marital discord cases, the judge said ego was the prime reason for the rising instances of broken marriages.

On going through the records, the judge found that the appellant as well his wife had accused each other of adultery. While the appellant’s case was that his wife was living an adulterous life and had begotten three children through some other individual, the wife, in turn, had accused the appellant of insisting upon getting divorced only to ensure that his pension, properties and other finances go to a woman with whom he was living illicitly.

He had filed a divorce petition before a district court in Tiruvannamalai in 2007 on two grounds - adultery and desertion. However, when it was taken up for final hearing in 2017, the ex-serviceman gave up the ground of adultery and pressed the ground of desertion alone. The trial court found that the wife separated only because of the illicit relationship between her husband and another woman. “So, there is justifiable reason for R1 (respondent 1- wife) living separately from the petitioner and therefore, the petitioner is not entitled for decree of divorce on the ground of desertion,” the trial court had concluded, pointing out that the witnesses examined on behalf of the ex-serviceman had not supported the allegation of adultery levelled against his wife, and had instead confirmed his own .

Assailing the trial court’s refusal to grant him divorce, the octogenarian contended before the High Court that there could be no scope for reunion between a couple living separately for nearly 38 years, and hence, it was a fit case for grantof divorce.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/octogenarian-moves-high-court-seeking-divorce/article30796125.ece
208,2020/02/12,HC calls for report on steps to tackle virus outbreaks,"Litigant highlights threat of coronavirus

The Madras High Court on Tuesday directed the State government to file a report by April 24 on steps taken by it to check the spread of various viruses after it was brought to its notice that people were living in constant fear of the deadly coronavirus, which had its origin in China and is spreading to other southeast Asian countries.

Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi and Justice Subramonium Prasad issued the direction on a public interest litigation petition filed by advocate A.P. Suryaprakasam, 66, last year seeking effective action against dengue.

On Tuesday, the litigant filed an additional affidavit in his case apprising the court of the new threat posed by coronavirus.

Expert committee

Though the petitioner sought for a direction to the government to constitute an expert committee comprising health, transport and civil supplies secretary to take steps such as quarantine of those affected by the virus, the judges told him that such effective steps appear to have been taken by the government already as per the reports published in newspapers.

They stopped short of directing the government to file an affidavit, in the nature of a white paper or roadmap, listing out the steps taken by it to address the health issues so that people gain confidence on the State machinery. The affidavit should contain details of the steps taken so far, their adequacy as well as the results achieved, the judges insisted.

The Bench further wanted to know whether the steps taken now were sufficient to tackle exigencies that may arise in the future.

In his additional affidavit, Mr. Suryaprakasam said the coronavirus was spreading fast in China, Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. Yet, people who come to Tamil Nadu from there were not being screened properly, he alleged.

Referring to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak which, according to him, killed 777 in 2003 and the influenza A (H1N1) that infected over two billion people in six months, the coronavirus now posed a similar threat to humanity, he said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/edv4lw/article30796116.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH12MADRASHIGHCOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hc-calls-for-report-on-steps-to-tackle-virus-outbreaks/article30796117.ece
209,2020/02/12,HC asks govt. to eradicate polythene bags outside places of worship,"‘Vendors could be encouraged to sell goods in reusable baskets’

The Madras High Court on Tuesday impressed upon the need to eradicate use of polythene bags by vendors outside temples, churches and dargahs. The court suggested that traders should be sensitised to the harmful effects of plastic and encouraged to sell their goods in reusable handwoven baskets.

Justices S. Vaidyanathan and P.T. Asha gave the suggestion to Additional Advocate General (AAG) P.H. Arvindh Pandian, who assured the court that he would take earnest steps to get a circular issued, at the earliest, to the executive officers of all temples under the control of Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR&CE) department.

On January 8, the Bench directed the State government to list the steps taken by it to implement a complete ban on all kinds of plastic products and not just single-use plastics. It also wanted government officials to act tough against all those who were continuing to use the already banned ‘use and throw’ plastic products.

2018 Govt. order

The directions were issued during the hearing of a batch of cases filed against a 2018 Government Order aimed at banning single-use plastics in the State from January 1, 2019. After upholding the validity of the GO, the judges opined that even products exempted under the GO should be banned to make the State completely plastic-free.

However, when the AAG on Tuesday expressed certain personal inconvenience in not being able to file a report in the court regarding the complete ban on plastic products and sought four more weeks’ time, the judges accepted his submission and directed the Registry to list the case for March 3 for filing of a report by the government.

During the course of hearing, the judges expressed concern over the use of polythene bags outside places of worship. Justice Vaidyanthan said Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) officials should conduct surprise inspections outside temples to find out large-scale prevalence of the banned polythene bags used to carry puja articles. Justice Asha said even during events such as a marathons conducted at the Elliott’s beach in Besant Nagar and other places, it had become a common practice to litter the roads with plastic bottles and cups. She suggested that organisers be asked to arrange water cans, along with dust bins, at regular intervals to address the menace.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/85apni/article30796094.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12THPLASTIC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hc-asks-govt-to-eradicate-polythene-bags-outside-places-of-worship/article30796095.ece
210,2020/02/12,Farmer Producer Organisations set for a major fillip in State,"Government has decided to offer a host of concessions and incentives to them

The State government is planning to promote Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) in a big way.

As a measure of its commitment towards FPOs, the government has decided to offer a host of concessions and incentives to them. It will also act as a facilitator, according to the State government’s policy document on FPOs, which was released by Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami in Salem on Sunday. Last year, Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam, who holds the Finance portfolio, announced during his Budget speech that the government will come out with a policy document.

Among the sops being offered to FPOs are portions of unutilised land in State Horticulture Farms for vegetable seed production. Organic farming will be promoted through FPOs, and they will be able to avail themselves of incentives for organic conversion, inputs and on-farm infrastructure. Installation of solar pumpsets on the common land of the bodies will be prioritised.

Explaining the importance of the policy document, a senior official in the Department of Agricultural Marketing and Agri Business said it had spelt out the intention of the State government to support farmers by promoting and assisting FPOs. Till now, support from the State government had come only through the schemes of the Union government, the Small Farmers’ Agribusiness Consortium and the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), the official noted.

As only a few FPOs are able to make use of institutional financing through non-banking financial companies, the document spells out how the organisations can get assured, adequate and affordable financing through various measures, such as the credit guarantee scheme, the interest subvention scheme and mezzanine financing.

An exhaustive account of various concessions available to FPOs has been given in the document. “There had been a lot of ambiguity in this regard, which made farmers run from pillar to post,” the official said.

More importantly, the document is a “rallying point” for farmers and FPOs to know what is due to them. “So far, there has been no official statement regarding the locus standi of FPOs in the government policy space,” the official noted.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/mod654/article26219527.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09THAGRICULTURE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/farmer-producer-organisations-set-for-a-major-fillip-in-state/article30795822.ece
211,2020/02/12,Special agri zone status may not affect ongoing projects in T.N.,"Officials say government only intends to bar fresh attempts at exploration of gas, minerals

Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami’s announcement on Sunday last that the Cauvery delta region would be declared ‘Protected Special Agricultural Zone’ (PSAZ) may not affect various ongoing projects in the districts, including hydrocarbon exploration. Mr Palaniswami had said no “new projects such as the hydrocarbon project” would be allowed in delta districts.

The primary intention of the government is to prohibit any “fresh” attempts at exploration of gas and minerals in the Cauvery delta region, senior bureaucrats indicated. “This is wet-land ecology and such explorations would affect agriculture severely. Moreover, such explorations would also lead to seawater intrusion.”

Since the ongoing projects in the Cauvery delta have already obtained necessary permission from the authorities concerned, they may not be affected by the announcement,” informed sources said.

The proposed ₹50,000 crore investment in Cuddalore by Haldia Petrochemicals would be allowed since “the unit is outside” the Cauvery delta core region. Besides, it is only replacing another private player.

CM yet to clarify

The Chief Minister has so far not clarified about the fate of the ongoing projects in the region. The proposed PSAZ would cover the entire Nagapattinam, Tiruvarur and Thanjavur districts. The remaining five districts would be covered only partially.

The declaration was to primarily to stop “local exploitation of underground minerals and gas.” That way, refineries could be allowed since they would only use imported oil, officials explained.

Though the contours of the policy are yet to be outlined, sources hinted that infrastructure projects such as laying of roads and railways and construction of bridges would not be affected.

“We need electricity and roads for agriculture and we also need employment for people there,” an official said.

The State government is actively pursuing a proposal to set up a food processing park in Tiruvarur district, as such projects are needed for job creation for local youth.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/dg188d/article30795753.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH12EXPLORATORYWELL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/special-agri-zone-status-may-not-affect-ongoing-projects-in-tn/article30795754.ece
212,2020/02/12,Officials demolishing unauthorised structures in Mahabubabad attacked,"Police register case against eight persons, including local councillor

Mild tension prevailed at Babu Naik thanda in Mahabubabad Municipality limits on Wednesday when officials had gone there to demolish the unauthorised structures. Municipal Commissioner Indrasena Reddy, a woman police constable and a male constable were attacked by the locals. The vehicles of the officials were also pelted with stones.

Following this, the officials stopped the demolition drive and lodged a complaint with the town police against eight persons, including the local councillor Banoth Ravi.

Gautham, who ordered the officials to remove all the structures in the government lands. They demolished around 150 such structures in the three localities on Tuesday. Meanwhile, they again went to Babu Naik Thanda on Wednesday to demolish the remaining structures. However, enraged by the razing of the houses, the locals, allegedly provoked by the local councillor Banoth Ravi, resorted to stone pelting and attack in an attempt to protect their houses.

Implementation of schemes of the Central government and ensuring that their benefits reached the intended population was the responsibility of all officials and they should not discriminate among schemes, Bhongir MP Komatireddy Venkat Reddy said on Wednesday.

“Officials should take the support of local legislators in implementing the schemes. Only by proper implementation of the schemes can pressure be put on the government for more funds for districts’ development,” the MP said.

Addressing a meeting of the District Development Coordination and Monitoring Committee (DISHA), attended by officials and legislators of the Bhongir Lok Sabha constituency, its chairman Venkat Reddy said officials should utilise the funds allocated for specific departments to address local issues.

He advised the officials to integrate the funds of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, under plantation and horticulture, to encourage farmers to grow more creeper vegetables in mandals such as Turkapally, Rajapet, Bommalaramaram and Valigonda as they were close to the capital city and would have better marketing facility.

He directed the officials of Mission Bhagiratha to take action, when a member from the Alair segment said the pipeline under the scheme was delivering dirty and undrinkable water. Other members also pointed out the absence of anti-rabies and tetanus vaccines in hospitals.

Rajya Sabha member Badugula Lingaiah Yadav stressed the role of the officials in achieving the objectives of schemes and said people’s representatives should have wider awareness of the various schemes and fund allocation.

Both MPs asked the officials to submit implementation reports on Central schemes of the Agriculture, Electricity, Irrigation and Health departments.

Justice G. Sridevi of Telangana High Court on Wednesday posted the 11 writ petitions filed by Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy seeking exemption from appearing in CBI Special Court to April 9 for final hearing.

When the petitions came up for hearing, the judge asked Mr. Reddy’s counsel S. Niranjan Reddy if he had received the copy of the counter affidavit filed by the CBI. As the judge announced the date for final hearing of the petitions, the counsel requested for a direction to the special court for exempting Mr. Reddy from appearance in the court.

The judge suggested to the counsel to inform the special court that the HC was seized of the matter and had posted the matter for final hearing. The judge said since the CBI counsel was present in the court, the latter can inform the special court about the development in the HC on the matter.

216,2020/02/12,HC tells TS govt. not to demolish Secretariat building,"Demolition plans at conceptual stage: AAG

The existing Secretariat building should not be disturbed until the State government takes a final decision on construction of a new Secretariat, the Telangana High Court said.

A division bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A. Abhishek Reddy passed this order after hearing a couple of PIL petitions challenging the government’s decision to demolish the existing Secretariat building. The bench said, however, the petitioners were at liberty to approach it if the State Cabinet takes a decision to demolish the Secretariat building.

The petitions were filed separately by Congress Malkajgiri MP A. Revanth Reddy and professor P.L. Vishweshwar Rao seeking an order to restrain the government from bringing down the Secretariat building. They contended that the present Secretariat building was strong enough to last several more years.

Presenting arguments on behalf of the State, Additional Advocate General J. Ramchander Rao told the bench that the government had not yet taken any specific decision on demolition of Secretariat building and construction of a new one. The matter was at the conceptual stage and the government invited designs from national and international consultants for a new Secretariat.

Some proposals had come and some were yet to be received, the AAG said. The matter was in ‘pre-mature stage’ and hence the court cannot review the government’s action, the AAG submitted to the court. A process was involved in taking a final call on the matter and beginning to work on the new building. In this interregnum period, the courts cannot review the government’s proposals and the petitions would not sustain, Mr. Rao said.

Recalling the order it had passed during the previous hearing on January 27 seeking information about the proposed new Secretariat building design and spaces to be made available to different departments, the bench said the government was bound to provide clear details on the matter. Why the government had planned earlier for demolition of the existing Secretariat building when the designs for the new Secretariat were not finalised, the bench sought to know.

Gone were the days when architects used to draw building plans on papers and take longer time, the bench said. In this era of virtual reality world, the architects and designers can create their plans in shorter time and show how the new buildings would look like using technology, the bench added.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/dul4v4/article30804854.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY13HGIHCOUR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/hc-tells-ts-govt-not-to-demolish-secretariat-building/article30802939.ece

218,2020/02/12,Adilabad farmers reap benefits of improved water management,"Check dams built on local streams are helping local farmers go for a second crop; wild animals too quench their thirst

Scores of farmers cultivating dry lands in Jainad mandal of Adilabad district are now able to go in for a second crop. Hundreds of wild animals in Kawal Tiger Reserve (KTR), Jannaram mandal in Mancherial district are not going thirsty in summer months thanks to availability of plenty of water in the local stream in the forest around the mandal headquarter town.

These two developments, their locations separated by a distance of about 140 km, and some other similar ones seen lately across former composite Adilabad district, have come about thanks to construction of many new high level bridges (HLB) across local streams, with check dams under them.

Better roads

“Thanks to the check dam of the HLB close to our village, enough water is standing in the stream on either side of it to irrigate at least 500 acres of dry land in rabi season, which is a second crop,” revealed farmer Deshetti Ashok from Jainad village who has sown bengal gram in his five acres as a second crop.

The check dam under the HLB at Jannaram arrests water upstream for a distance of over 500 metres. The wild animals in KTR are now accessing this water helping them tide over the drier and difficult summer months.

“This transformation is a result of betterment of bad roads and bridges in the erstwhile undivided Adilabad district,” observed Adilabad R&B Superintending Engineer (SE) Md. Nazeer Ahmed. “Adilabad district got much prominence when it came to allocations for different type of works during the first spell of this government,” he pointed out.

Abundant funds

“Under widening of roads connecting mandal headquarters to district headquarters, 21 works were undertaken at a cost of ₹ 514 crore, and under widening and reconstruction of bridges as many as 90 structures were taken up at a cost of ₹ 431 crore, in both cases the allocations being highest among all erstwhile districts. In addition, 22 roads were widened from single lane to double lane at a cost of about ₹ 285 crore,” the SE reeled out figures.

Some of the works which were part of the road development initiative of the government and which deserve a mention are the Adilabad-Bela Inter-State Road, the Gudem Inter-State bridge and the Utnoor-Asifabad Road which saw the R&B department even saving precious money by innovating. The Gudem Bridge has opened access to parts of Gadchiroli district in Maharashtra from Bejjur mandal in Kumram Bheem (KB) Asifabad district and the improvement of Utnoor-Asifabad Road has fuelled economic growth in the utterly poor tribal areas of Adilabad and KB Asifabad.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/383msu/article30802719.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY13BRIJJ,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/adilabad-farmers-reap-benefits-of-improved-water-management/article30802720.ece

Addressing a gathering after laying the foundation stone for a yoga centre and science museum, along with Collector M. Hanumantha Rao, in the district headquarters on Wednesday, Mr. Harish Rao said that food should be consumed in limited quantity and if not, medicines would become a part of our diet.

“Everything should be taken in limited quantities and only then, life will be beautiful. Pranayama is part of yoga that transforms oxygen into energy and reduces hunger. A person doing pranayama inhales and exhales 15 times per minute while a normal person will do it 25 times a minute. This increases the life span,” said Mr. Harish Rao, adding that the construction of the yoga centre and science museum would be completed shortly at an estimated cost of ₹1.8 crore.

“We are spending long hours on our cellphones, computers and televisions. Can’t we spare an hour a day for our health?” he asked.

“Let today’s youth get habituated to yoga. Pranayama will enhance the memory power of children. Do not pressurise the youth to get good marks. Instead, teach them how to deal with problems so that they can become better citizens tomorrow,” he said.

225,2020/02/12,Clamour grows louder for women police stations,"Proposals mooted 3 years ago remain unimplemented

The demand for setting up of women police stations in the district headquarters of Kothagudem and the famous temple town of Bhadrachalam is gaining ground with women’s organisations gearing up to renew their agitation for all-woman police stations.

Carved out of the erstwhile composite Khammam district in October 2016, the predominantly tribal populated district, is devoid of a women police station.

Though proposals were mooted by the police department to set up women police stations in Kothagudem and Bhadrachalam nearly three years ago, they remained unimplemented till date.

Despite construction of two new buildings, one in Kothagudem and another in Bhadrachalam for this, proposals to establish women police stations are held up for want of administrative sanction, sources said.

Having organised a slew of agitations for a women police station in the coal town of Kothagudem in the fag end of last year, the All-India Democratic Women’s Association (AIDWA) district committee is all set to renew its agitation.

AIDWA activists staged a two-day hunger stir in Kothagudem recently in protest against the delay.

“It is imperative to establish women police stations in the district headquarters of Kothagudem and also in the famous pilgrim centre of Bhadrachalam,” said AIDWA district secretary Jyothi.

She added that aggrieved women find women police personnel more approachable to lodge their complaints and seek help.

“We will soon launch an intensive agitation across the district if the government failed to set up women police stations in Kothagudem and Bhadrachalam,” she said.

227,2020/02/12,‘These boys really made us proud’,"Bangladesh’s under-19 team receives a hero’s welcome

Thousands of ecstatic fans celebrated on the streets and a stadium crowd screamed “we are the champions” as Bangladesh returned home to a hero’s welcome on Wednesday after winning the ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup.

It stunned four-time winner India in the final on Sunday in Potchefstroom.

A flight carrying the players landed at Dhaka's main airport at 4:55 p.m. local time where they were greeted by officials and thousands of jersey-wearing and flag-waving fans.

The country's sports minister, Zahid Ahsan, and the Bangladesh Cricket Board's (BCB) president Nazmul Hassan received the players and support staff with garlands at the airport as the fans roared “Bangladesh, Bangladesh. We are the World Champions.”

The players boarded a specially designed bus painted in national colours and had 'World Champions' written in front as they travelled to Dhaka's main cricket stadium.

Hundreds of people stood on both sides of the streets to cheer the victorious team. A procession of motor bikes with many waving national flags followed the team.

“We are champions. These boys really made us proud,” said an ecstatic fan Ariful Islam.

Islam was one of an estimated 5,000 fans, according to police, who welcomed the junior Tigers at the Mirpur Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium, also known as the home of Bangaldesh cricket.

Fans waiting outside quickly filled up parts of the stands as the BCB rolled out a red carpet for the players.

Unbelievable

Skipper Akbar Ali cut a huge cake before the festivities ended with 19 fireworks. He revealed that the players were surprised by the reception.

“We knew something would happen, but we did not expect it would be this big. It is unbelievable. I cannot express in words how I am feeling now,” Akbar told a crowded press conference at the stadium.

Akbar, who scored an unbeaten 43 in the tense final to become player of the match, hoped the win would help the sport in the country move forward.

“Everything needs a start. I hope our win will work as a stepping stone to take our cricket forward,” said the skipper.

BCB chief Hassan hailed the triumph as Bangladesh's biggest-ever sporting success.

“We have had many achievements in the past, but nothing can be comparable to what this team has achieved. A World Cup is a World Cup. They won it. It was our dream,” Hassan said.

“We will create an Under-21 unit (with this team) and give specialised training to upgrade their skill. During this period each player will receive Tk 100,000 ($1,175 approximately) every month. This is our reward for them,” she added.

Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina will also hold a public reception for the players in Dhaka's sprawling Suhrawardi Udyan park in next week, the BCB chief said.",sport,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/atm9ty/article30803856.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH13BANGLA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/these-boys-really-made-us-proud/article30803857.ece

229,2020/02/12,"MCC to play one ODI, three T20s in Pakistan","Custodian of cricket laws, the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), will play one 50-over game and three T20 matches during its upcoming tour of Pakistan, beginning on Thursday.

All the matches will take place in Lahore, the MCC said in a press release.

Lahore Qalandars will be the Club’s first opposition in a floodlit T20 match at the Gaddafi Stadium.

Lahore boast of Pakistan’s international stars such as Shaheen Afridi and Fakhar Zaman in its ranks for this edition of the Pakistan Super League (PSL).

Pakistan Shaheens - effectively the nation’s A- team — will play MCC in a 50-over match at Aitchison College two days later, and the hosts will be captained by Saud Shakeel.

The Club will then switch to the T20 format against Pakistan’s domestic champion Northern, and Multan Sultans of the PSL, which will have England’s Moeen Ali and James Vince in its squad for the tournament which begins shortly after the MCC tour.

The tour will take place from February 13 to 19.

MCC president Kumar Sangakkara will captain a 12-member squad for the tour, which includes the likes of Ravi Bopara, Roelof van der Merwe and Ross Whiteley.

MCC head coach Ajmal Shahzad said: “This tour of Pakistan will be a momentous occasion for everyone involved.

“We expect the standard of cricket to be high during this trip. The MCC squad possesses both international and extensive domestic experience which I am sure will prove strong opposition for some of Pakistan’s best emerging cricketers.”

“We hope that this tour helps contribute to the Pakistan Cricket Board’s wish of seeing international teams returning to tour the country on a regular basis.”

Test cricket returned to Pakistan after more than 10 years with the Sri Lankan team playing a two-match series last December.

Major Test-paying nations have avoided touring Pakistan since the 2009 terror attack on the Sri Lankan team bus in Lahore, which killed eight people and injured several players.",sport,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/mcc-to-play-one-odi-three-t20s-in-pakistan/article30803820.ece
230,2020/02/12,One ‘last’ Olympics for Chusovitina,"Uzbekistan’s 44-year-old gymnast heads for here eighth Games

Aged 44 and readying for her eighth Olympics in Tokyo, Uzbek gymnast Oksana Chusovitina makes light of her record-breaking survival in a sport dominated by teen prodigies.

“I love gymnastics. I tell myself: why not train and perform while you still can?” Chusovitina said during a recent interview in Tashkent.

“If I’d stopped, I think I would have strongly regretted it.”

But while the desire to compete still burns in Chusovitina, she said she has given her word to her family, whom she calls her “strongest motivation”, that the Tokyo Games this year will be her “last Olympics”.

Chusovitina started her career competing for the USSR but after it collapsed she got her first taste of the Olympics at Barcelona in 1992 in a team representing the ex-Soviet states.

Long wait

There, she scooped team gold but she had to wait another 16 years — and four Games — for an individual Olympic medal.

That came when she won silver on the vault in Beijing in 2008. At that point, Chusovitina was representing Germany, after moving there in 2002 to get her son Alisher treatment for leukaemia that proved successful.

But Tokyo will be her fifth Olympics representing her Central Asian homeland of Uzbekistan — a nation of 33 million where she is so revered that she has featured on postage stamps.

Her appearance at the Rio Games in 2016 made her the only gymnast ever to compete in seven consecutive Olympics.

A son’s appeal

Chusovitina told AFP during a break from practising vaults that it was Alisher, now 20, who persuaded her to call time on a her career in top-level sport.

“He worries about me a lot, that I might get a bad injury or fall ill.”

Her own favourite Olympic memory remains returning home from Beijing where her vault performance saw her share the podium with gymnasts from China and North Korea who were both a decade younger than her.

“When I got back the doctor gave me the news that my son was finally healthy,” she recalled.

“I think for a mother that is news that you cannot compare any medal to.”

Source of inspiration

Chusovitina’s longevity as a top-level athlete may be no big deal to the star, but it is a continued source of inspiration for the young gymnasts who train with her daily at the Republican Gymnastic Centre in Tashkent.

“She is already an athlete of such a high level,” said Lyudmila Li, Chusovitina’s trainer.

“She knows her body and what it can do. Our only job is to help her maintain those levels.”

Chusovitina’s husband Bakhodir Kurbanov is himself a former Olympic competitor, representing Uzbekistan in Greco-Roman wrestling at the 1996 and 2000 Games.

Sacrifice

He sacrificed his own career for his wife’s and focused on helping Alisher battle leukaemia, a decision that causes him no regrets.

“We didn’t plan for a fourth Olympics, let alone an eighth, but she has made us proud,” Kurbanov said during an interview in their modest apartment on the outskirts of Tashkent.

“My son and I just try to keep up with her.”

For the moment, Chusovitina is focused on Tokyo but she has plenty of plans for retirement.

One is to set up a gymnastics academy in Tashkent to bring through the next generation of Uzbek gymnasts.

Fitting farewell

Another is to take the beam and the vault to the stage in a “gymnastics theatre show” that she hopes will be both a fitting farewell to her career in professional sport and a way of popularising the sport locally.

“I want our people to love gymnastics, to see how beautiful it is,” she told AFP.

“When people see (the show) they will run to put their children in gym classes.”",sport,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/mas2fq/article30803719.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH13OKSANA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/one-last-olympics-for-chusovitina/article30803720.ece
231,2020/02/12,Robin Singh appointed UAE’s director of cricket,"Former India all-rounder Robin Singh was on Wednesday appointed director of cricket of the United Arab Emirates, local media reported.

The 56-year-old’s appointment comes following the sacking of Dougie Brown as head coach, reports stated.

The Indian takes over at a time when the UAE’s national team is trying to recover from the fixing scandal that rocked their cricket last year, leading to suspension of a few senior players, including captain Mohammed Naveed, and disbanding of the selection panel.

Without a selection committee, Brown was forced to pick the teams for the series against Scotland and the United States at home last December, and against Oman and Namibia in Muscat in January, for the World Cup League Two matches.

Singh, who had represented India in one Test and 136 ODIs between 1989 and 2001 has, over the years, made a name for himself in coaching.

He was associated with the Indian Premier League’s highly successful Mumbai Indians franchise, Caribbean Premier League’s Barbados Tridents since 2013 and T10 franchises in the T10 league here.",sport,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/los437/article30803709.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH13ROBIN,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/robin-singh-appointed-uaes-director-of-cricket/article30803710.ece
232,2020/02/12,Ahlawat joins Aman at the top,"Khalin comes up with day’s best card, lies third

Veer Ahlawat and Aman Raj returned two-round totals of 12-under 132 to emerge joint leaders at the halfway stage of the TATA Steel PGTI Players Championship. Raj, who had held the sole lead overnight, carded 67 at the Eagleton Golf Resort on Wednesday while Ahlawat struck a 65 as the pair opened up a one-stroke advantage.

Bengaluru’s Khalin Joshi produced the day’s best score of eight-under 64 to lie third at 11-under 133. Gaurav Pratap Singh and Himmat Rai (134) were one shot behind in tied fourth. Shubhankar Sharma, the pre-tournament favourite, followed up his first-round 73 with a steady 71 in round two to occupy the tied 35th place at par-144.

Ahlawat (67-65), who started on the 10th tee, fired five birdies on the back-nine, including four on the trot from the 14th to the 17th. He eventually finished seven-under for the day. “I hit a lot more fairways today as compared to round one,” the Gurgaon pro said later. “I played well for most of the day but had a bad stretch towards the end.”

Raj, meanwhile, made eight birdies and three bogeys. “It was a good day for me except I feel I made a few too many bogeys. My approaches and wedges were good and I was happy with my recovery on the last three holes as I birdied the seventh and ninth,” he said.

Top scores (after round two): 132: Veer Ahlawat (67, 65), Aman Raj (65, 67); 133: Khalin Joshi (69, 64); 134: Gaurav Pratap Singh (70, 64), Himmat Rai (68, 66); 135: Akshay Sharma (68, 67), Mari Muthu (68, 67), Udayan Mane (68, 67); 136: O.P.

233,2020/02/12,‘FIH award a huge motivation’,"Says he wants to bring more laurels for the country

India’s Vivek Sagar Prasad says winning the FIH Rising Star of the Year award will push him to work hard and achieve greater feats in the coming times.

Back in January 2018, when 17-year-old Prasad was given the opportunity to represent the Indian men’s hockey team in a four-nation tournament in New Zealand, he became the second youngest player ever to represent the senior team.

Two years on, the youngster — who got the award on Monday — has transformed into one of the best upcoming players in the world.

“I think there is no better feeling than representing your country at the highest level,” he said.

“When I was younger, I would be more interested in badminton and chess, but as things turned out, I slowly shifted to hockey, and I can’t thank my family, coaches and friends enough for what they have done for me.

“This award is a huge recognition, and I just want to make sure that I keep working hard, maintain my focus, and bring laurels for the country,” said Vivek during his team’s national camp here ahead of two Hockey Pro League matches against Australia.

Having scored India’s opening goal against world champion Belgium at the Kalinga Hockey Stadium during the second match on February 9, Vivek’s confidence was palpable during training.

“I think I was just focusing on doing my basics right. There was an opportunity to go forward as well, now and then, so I utilised that during the first goal. I think we had a few opportunities throughout the match, but we couldn’t convert.

“However, personally, I think I was able to perform well because I was playing my natural game according to my strengths,” he said.",sport,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/wqu54/article30803674.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th13vivek,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/fih-award-a-huge-motivation/article30803675.ece

On Wednesday, RCB took down its profile picture (the club badge) from social media platforms, a day after the club had signed a deal with a new shirt sponsor. There has been a demand from a section of supporters to change the Bangalore in the team’s name to Bengaluru.

236,2020/02/12,Vintage Paes delights the crowd,"He may be 46 and at the fag end of his career, but the Leander Paes show is still going strong. Paes, partnering Australian Matthew Ebden, unfurled his full bag of tricks to record a 7-6(2), 6-4 win over Zhang Zhizhen and Blaz Rola in the first round of the $1,62,000 Bengaluru Open ATP Tennis Challenger here on Wednesday.

With Ebden low on energy after a gruelling three-set loss in the singles event earlier in the day, it was left to Paes to do the heavy lifting. The Indian was up to the task, delighting the crowd with a magical display.

Paes prowled the net, using a deft touch to place his volleys in the far corners of the court. When required, he swiftly moved across the net to cover the angle. On one occasion, Paes was completely wrong-footed, but showed great reflexes to stretch his hands out to make sweet contact.

In the second set, down 1-3 and 0-40, Paes unleashed his famous fighting spirit. Riding on crowd support, Paes managed to hold serve, before Paes-Ebden broke back to make it 3-3. From here on, Zhizhen and Rola simply wilted under pressure.

Paes made one last electric play, showing great anticipation to cover a thunderous smash from Rola. Paes managed to get the ball back in play, and Rola — shocked that the point had not ended — made an unforced error. A short while later, Paes-Ebden sealed the win, and Paes blew celebratory kisses to the fans at the KSLTA Stadium.

For Ebden, the chance to be a part of Paes’ swansong was too good to miss. “I’ve been playing on the tour for many years, so I wanted to find some spark and excitement. As soon as I found out that Leander was set to retire at the end of the year, I texted him saying, ‘Lee, I heard you’re playing some tournaments in India. I’m coming over, let’s play together’. I’m honoured to be a part of this,” Ebden said.

In the singles section, Indian southpaw Prajnesh Gunneswaran opened his campaign with 6-2, 4-6, 6-4 win over World No. 609 Sebastian Fanselow of Germany. In another second round match, Ramkumar Ramanathan brushed aside qualifier Abhinav Shanmugam in straight sets.

The results: Singles: Second round: Prajnesh Gunneswaran bt Sebastian Fanselow (Ger) 6-2, 4-6, 6-4; Ramanathan Ramkumar bt Abhinav Shanmugam 6-1, 6-3; Mohamed Safwat (Egy) bt Matthew Ebden (Aus) 7-6(5), 6-7(1), 7-5; Sidharth Rawat bt Rishi Reddy 6-2, 6-2; Benjamin Bonzi (Fra) bt Nikola Milojevic (Srb) 6-4, 6-1; Frederico Ferreira Silva (Por) bt Kimmer Coppejans (Bel) 6-3, 3-6, 7-5.

240,2020/02/12,Casillas to run for RFEF presidency?,"Former Spain goalkeeper Iker Casillas plans to run for the presidency of the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF), Spanish media reported on Wednesday.

Casillas told the national sports council (CSD) of his intention to run in the upcoming RFEF elections, reported the Cadena Ser radio station early Wednesday.

According to this media, Casillas “has made the decision to run” for the elections and has informed Irene Lozano who, as secretary of state for sport, is president of the CSD.

Contacted by AFP, the CSD made no comment.

The date of the election has not been decided. The AS newspaper, citing CSD sources, said Casillas met Lozano and expressed an interest in running.

Casillas, 38, played 167 times for Spain, winning two Euros and one World Cup, and more than 700 games for Real Madrid, with which he won the Champions League three times. He joined Porto in 2015.

Last April he suffered a heart attack during training and has not played since. His name has been linked with the RFEF presidency for some months.

Current RFEF president Luis Rubiales is in perpetual conflict with Javier Tebas, the president of the Spanish league.

According to the rules, the elections should be held in the second half of the year after the Tokyo Olympics. However, Rubiales has asked the CSD to bring the date forward to the first half of the year before Euro 2020, which will run from 12 June to 12 July.",sport,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/8dnle1/article30803513.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH13CASILLAS,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/casillas-to-run-for-rfef-presidency/article30803514.ece

242,2020/02/12,Chinese Grand Prix postponed,"‘Continued spread’ of Coronavirus cited as the reason

The Chinese Grand Prix scheduled for April 19 has been postponed because of the “continued spread” of the deadly Coronavirus, now named COVID-19, motorsport’s governing body FIA announced Wednesday.

“As a result of continued health concerns and with the @WHO (World Health Organisation) declaring the Coronavirus as a global health emergency, the FIA and @F1 Formula 1 have taken these measures in order to ensure the health and safety of the travelling staff, championship participants and fans.”

The Shanghai race, the fourth of the new season, becomes the latest — but easily the most high-profile — sports event to fall victim to the virus outbreak which has killed more than 1,100 people in China, where it emerged at the end of last year.

Vietnam race in doubt

The postponement also throws into doubt the inaugural race in Vietnam, which takes place two weeks before but where there have also been cases of COVID-19.

“The FIA and @F1 continue to work closely with the teams, promoter, CAMF and local authorities to monitor the situation,” FIA said in relation to the Shanghai postponement.

“All parties will take the appropriate amount of time to study the viability of potential alternative dates later in the year should the situation improve.”

That could prove tricky with FIA organising a record-breaking 22 Grand Prix this season, including the Shanghai race.

Important part

FIA added: “The Chinese Grand Prix has long been an important part of the F1 calendar with many passionate fans. The FIA F1 community looks forward to racing in China as soon as possible and wishes everyone in the country the best during this difficult time.

“The global situation regarding this virus will continue to be monitored by the FIA with regard to other motor sport events.”

Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff, speaking in London on Monday, said not going to Shanghai would be a “shame“.

“We had full grand stands last year,” he said, adding that China was beginning to become a “really important market in terms of fan followership“.

“Not going there would not be great for the fans and ourselves, but health comes first.”

China has been forced to cancel or put off a host of sporting events due to the coronavirus epidemic, from suspending all football in the country to postponing the first badminton tournament of the 2020 world tour season.

The world’s most populous country has increasingly become a powerhouse in hosting international sport in recent years, but has had its sporting calendar thrown into chaos.

India opener Shafali Verma made it a point to watch her idol Sachin Tendulkar play in his last Ranji match at Lahli more than six years ago and the 16-year-old has now got the the appreciation from the cricket icon himself for being there at his farewell domestic match.

Replying to Shafali, Tendulkar wrote: “It was nice meeting you too, Shafali. Hearing from you on how you had travelled all the way to Lahli to see my last Ranji Game & now seeing you play for India is amazing.

“Keep chasing your dreams because dreams do come true. Enjoy the game and always give your best,” he said in the tweet.

Shafali, who was here as part of the Indian team for the women’s T20 tri-series, met Tendulkar here and posted a picture with him on her Twitter handle. Tendulkar was here for the Bushfire charity match on Sunday.

244,2020/02/12,Jonassen spins it Australia’s way,"Triggers a collapse to script a memorable triumph; Smriti’s knock goes in vain for India

India opener Smriti Mandhana’s 37-ball 66 went in vain as Australia claimed the tri-nation women’s T20 series with a gritty 11-run win following a sensational five-wicket haul by spinner Jess Jonassen here on Wednesday.

Set a target of 156, India was all out for 144 after being 115 for three in the 15th over.

Seasoned left-arm spinner Jonassen was the star of the show with brilliant figures of five for 12 in four overs, making her only the third Australian bowler to return a five-for in the women’s T20 format.

“It was a really good all-round performance. Getting Smriti was the game-changer, she was whacking us all over the park,” said Australian captain Meg Lanning.

Challenging total

Opting to bat, Australia managed to post 155 for six in its stipulated 20 overs. Chasing a challenging target, Smriti was up to the task at hand and smashed 12 boundaries in her knock at the Junction Oval.

However, the opener’s dismissal in the 15th over, caught brilliantly by Nicola Carey at deep mid-wicket, turned the match in Australia’s favour as it put the brakes on India’s scoring while at the same time taking wickets.

The final nail

It was the departure of skipper Harmanpreet Kaur, in the 16th over, which dashed India’s hopes of a victory.

“In the last three overs, we couldn’t take the pressure and ended up losing wickets,” said Harmanpreet, reflecting on the loss.

Earlier in the day, India’s Rajeshwari Gayakwad leaked 19 runs in the last over to let Australia off the hook and post a challenging total.

Opener Beth Mooney, who scored 208 runs in the tournament, was adjudged Player-of-the-Series, top-scored for the host with an aggressive 71 off 54 balls, hitting nine boundaries at the Junction Oval.

At the end of the 19th over, Australia was 136 for five.

However, Mooney and Rachael Haynes (18 off 7 balls) hit out in the last six balls to prop up Australia, ruining left-arm spinner Rajeshwari’s day.

Opting to bat, Australia was dealt an early blow when Alyssa Healy (4) was dismissed in the very first over by Deepti Sharma, extending the wicketkeeper’s woeful run with the bat.

Ally

Mooney found an ally in Ashleigh Gardner (26), with whom the opener added 52 for the second wicket, and then Lanning, who also made 26 during a 51-run third-wicket stand.

245,2020/02/12,Ferrari unveils car for 2020,"I’m impatient to drive it, says Vettel

Ferrari unveiled its new SF1000 car for the 2020 Formula One season, which they hope will deliver a first world drivers’ title since 2007, during a glitzy ceremony on Tuesday.

The single-seater’s name acknowledges the fact that the Italian team will start its 1,000th world championship race during the coming campaign, which begins with the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne on March 15.

Narrower than last season’s SF90, with a deeper red colouring the body, Ferrari is pinning its hopes on the SF1000 car earning them drivers and constructors titles that have eluded them for 12 and 11 years respectively.

“I like it very much,” said German driver Sebastian Vettel.

“It’s much narrower at the back than last year and it is also redder, it’s even better. I’m impatient to drive it, that will be even more fascinating than looking at it.”

The Scuderia broke with tradition and presented its new racing car outside of its stronghold of Maranello, unveiling it instead amid of sea of red on stage at the Teatro Romolo-Valli in the nearby city of Reggio Emilia.

“This is a very important place for our country,” chairman of the Ferrari group John Elkann explained.

“It was in this city that the tricolour flag, which became that of Italy, was created. And Ferrari is proud of Italy and of representing Italy.”

“This is a very special year,” continued Ferrari Team Manager Mattia Binotto.

“It’s 70 years of Formula One, we have been there from the start and we are going to reach the figure of 1,000 Grands Prix, which is something incredible.”

Barring a forced change in the calendar because of the deadly coronavirus in Asia, the milestone should be reached in June during the Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal.

“Maybe it looks a lot like the SF90, but I can assure you it is very different,” continued Binotto.

“We still have to make progress, especially on reliability,” he added, recalling that Ferrari, like the other teams, had to face “the double challenge” of preparing the next season in parallel with the following one, when new rules will come into force.

Binotto stressed that this season veteran Vettel and 22-year-old Charles Leclerc, who impressed on his debut last season, would be starting on an equal footing.

“We have seen that they can both fight for the best results. They are both on the same level. It is up to them to race,” he added.

Vettel, a four-time world champion with Red Bull and twice runner-up with Ferrari, insisted it was not a hard decision for him to accept.

“I don’t see it that way,” said the 32-year-old.

“I don’t see Charles going up and me going down. We have the same car and, for me, it doesn’t change anything. That was also the case last season.”

Last season, the association between the experienced Vettel and Leclerc often turned into a duel, coming to a head when the two drivers collided during the Brazilian GP.

But 22-year-old Leclerc, who won two races and finished fourth place in the world championship, said lessons had been learned.

“We have learned the lesson from Brazil. We are free to race, but we are teammates,” he said.

“A lot of people are working behind us, as a team, and things like Brazil should not happen.”

Both drivers said they were impatient to try out the new car, which will be on track next week for the pre-season testing in Barcelona.

“I felt emotional when I saw it,” said Monaco’s Leclerc.

“Now I can’t wait to be out on track and try it and to show all the work that has been done on this car.

“It’s going to be a great challenge. I’m ready to learn from my mistakes to become an even better driver.

“What all of us want at Ferrari is to be world champions.”",sport,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/2qzdkd/article30803312.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH13FERRARI,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/ferrari-unveils-car-for-2020/article30803313.ece
246,2020/02/12,Abhinav in good nick again,"Jagadeesan's grit to the fore; Unadkat, Chirag pull things back for Saurashtra

Abhinav Mukund (86, 112b, 10x4, 1x6) and N. Jagadeesan (61 batting, 149b,10x4) guided Tamil Nadu to a respectable 250 for seven against Saurashtra on the opening day of their Group B Ranji Trophy clash at the SCA grounds here on Wednesday.

The wicket was expected to be batsmen-friendly, but it had something in it for the bowlers too. That prompted the Tamil Nadu openers, Abhinav and L. Suryapprakash, to begin cautiously in the opening session. With the medium-pacers, including himself, unable to find a breakthrough, Saurashtra captain Jayadev Unadkat turned to Dharmedrasinh Jadeja.

Paying dividends

The move worked rightaway as the left-arm spinner had Suryapprakash snapped up at forward short-leg by Kishan Parmar. Abhinav, at the other end, went about things in business-like fashion. The southpaw, who had hammered a double hundred against Baroda in Vadodara recently, paced his innings well and reached his half-century before lunch.

Kaushik Gandhi provided solid support, taking the singles and rotating the strike, as the two added 53 for the second wicket before Kaushik flashed at a Prerak Mankad outswinger and edged to Harvik Desai at second slip.

Abhinav, however, continued to build the innings, this time in the company of Ganga Sridhar Raju. Though caution seemed to be the watchword, his clever shot-selection kept the scoreboard ticking.

The post-lunch session saw Saurashtra hit back strongly. Unadkat, who had worked hard with no reward, took two wickets in two overs, including the prized one of Abhinav. Though Ganga Sridhar and Abhinav were both adjudged leg-before, the latter was not too pleased with the decision.

The other pacer, Chirag Jani, accounted for skipper B. Aparajith before Unadkat prised out debutant Jaganath Sinivas cheaply soon after tea to leave the visitors staring down the barrel at 181 for six.

N. Jagadeesan, familiar to such situations, displayed a cool head and forged a crucial 62-run stand for the seventh wicket with Sai Kishore (27). Though the latter fell to Chirag, Jagadeesan carried on the good work to take Tamil Nadu to 250 for seven at stumps.

The scores:

Tamil Nadu — 1st innings: Abhinav Mukund lbw b Unadkat 86, L. Suryapprakash c Kishan b Dharmendrasinh 10, Kaushik Gandhi c Desai b Prerak 17, Ganga Sridhar Raju lbw b Unadkat 13, B.

247,2020/02/12,Gomel announces arrival with a patient ton,"Run-hungry Sarfaraz hits a big unbeaten ton as Mumbai calls the shots

Mumbai, whose hopes of qualifying are gone, unearthed a specialist opening batsman in Aakarshit Gomel in its last Ranji Trophy group game.

The 26-year-old, right-hander displayed patience and shot-selection to thwart Madhya Pradesh on the opening day at the Wankhede Stadium and a century (122, 240b, 11x4, 1x6) on First Class debut was a fitting reward for a mix of caution and carpet drives.

Sarfaraz Khan is going strong on 169 and the duo helped the host recover from 71 for three to 352 for four in 85 overs.

Compact at the crease and getting behind the line against medium-pacers in the early part of the innings, played under a cloud cover, he cashed in when the bowlers erred to reach a stylish half-century after 117 balls (six fours) and built on the confidence to reach 101 off 201 balls. Gomel, who came through the ranks, was a revelation with his risk-free batting that lasted 377 minutes.

MP pacer Kuldeep Sen, who impressed with swing and control, struck with the his very first ball, getting the ball to swing just enough to draw opener Hardik Tamore forward and beat his man with an away movement. He was unlucky to be caught over-stepping after a cut-back sent Sarfaraz’s off-stump flying off the fourth ball faced while Siddhesh Lad reacted late to an inswinging delivery.

Gomel chose the sensible way of occupying the crease as senior partner Suryakumar feasted on the bowling, reading the ball off the pitch early and driving with contempt, to slam nine boundaries before failing to keep down an attempted glide.

The new opener played the perfect foil to an aggressive Sarfaraz, the fourth wicket stand fetching 275 runs before the debutant walked back.

His partner returned unbeaten on 169 off 204 balls, smashing 22 fours and three sixes.

The scores:

Mumbai — 1st innings: Hardik Tamore c Rohera b Sen 12, Aakarshit Gomel c Shrivastava b Sharma 122, Suryakumar Yadav c Dubey b Sen 43, Siddhesh Lad b Sen 4, Sarfaraz Khan (batting) 169, Ankush Jaiswal (batting) 0; Extras (nb-1, w-1): 2; Total (four wkts. in 85 overs): 352.

Fall of wickets: 1-16, 2-68, 3-72, 4-347.

248,2020/02/12,Prateek and Mehdi keep bowlers at bay,"It was, however, another dismal performance from the Hyderabad top order against Vidarbha

Debutant Prateek Reddy showed the desired discipline in batting in the company of a defiant Mehdi Hasan to string together an unbroken 88-run partnership for the eighth wicket which helped Hyderabad score 239 for seven against Vidarbha at close of play on the first day of the four-day Ranji Trophy Elite Group match at Rajiv Gandhi Stadium here on Wednesday.

Put in to bat, it was another dismal performance at the top with seasoned openers P. Akshath Reddy and captain Tanmay Agarwal falling to the teasing off-stump line of pacemen Rajneesh Gurbani and Yash Thakur.

Gamble worth taking?

Surprisingly, when the two left-handers Buddhi Rahul, playing his second Ranji game, and all-rounder T. Ravi Teja, who was promoted up the order, were batting during their 80-run stand for the third wicket, there were serious doubts whether Vidarbha’s gamble was worth taking.

For, there was nothing in the pitch which suggested anything unplayable and it had become lot easier as the day progressed.

But, to the credit of Vidarbha bowlers, they came back strongly to break the third wicket partnership between Rahul (52, 82b, 9x4) and Ravi Teja (44, 62b, 5x4, 2x6).

Gurbani produced a beauty to clean up the in-form Kolla Sumanth as the ball swung late to beat the batsman completely and uproot the stumps. At the other end, Thakur left Chama Milind clueless as he stretched forward only to see his middle-stump knocked-out.

Sensible batting

It looked like it would be another familiar script in batting, before southpaw Prateek was joined by another left-hander, Mehdi, at 151 for seven. The two batted sensibly to keep the Vidarbha bowlers at bay for the rest of the day.

Though slow to start with, Prateek showed admirable temperament and stroke selection. He clearly reposed the faith the selectors had in him following his impressive run in the Col.C.K. Nayudu Trophy tournament with an innings of character and composure under pressure.

A knock which was even applauded by former India captain and HCA president Mohd Azharuddin among others.

Importantly for Hyderabad, Prateek and Mehdi stayed there till the end of day’s play, raising hopes of a much bigger total which looked doubtful at one stage.

For Vidarbha, Thakur and Gurbani were the main wicket-takers, bowling their heart out in not-so-helpful conditions once the early morning moisture had evaporated.

The scores: Hyderabad — 1st innings: Tanmay Agarwal c Fazal b Thakur 5, Akshath Reddy c Wadkar b Gurbani 6, Buddhi Rahul c Wadkar b Gurbani 52, T. Ravi Teja c Wadkar b Thakur 44, Prateek Reddy batting 76, K. Sumanth b Gurbani 1, Chama Milind b Thakur 4, G. Aniketh Reddy c Wadkar b Thakur 4, Mehdi Hasan batting 27; Extras (nb-3, w-2, b-3, lb-12): 20; Total (for seven wkts in 86 overs): 239.

Fall of wickets: 1-17, 2-17, 3-97, 4-130, 5-136, 6-141, 7-151.

Vidarbha bowling: Gurbani 22-7-48-3, Thakare 18-6-48-0, Thakur 21-6-44-4, Wakhare 13-1-43-0, Sarvate 8-1-32-0, Choudhari 4-0-9-0.",sport,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tfx0i1/article30802858.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH13PRATEEK,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/prateek-and-mehdi-keep-bowlers-at-bay/article30802859.ece
249,2020/02/12,Vaikom Satyagraha Memorial Gandhi Museum narrates the story of Kerala’s protest against untouchability,"604 days of struggle at Vaikom

The new boat jetty at Vaikom is adjacent to the old one. People mill around it awaiting their boats to nearby islands while the old one, with an overpowering smell of engine fuel, is more a work shed for boat crew and technicians. But this jetty is of historical significance. On March 9, 1925, Mahatma Gandhi disembarked here, when he came to participate in the Vaikom Satyagraha (1924-25). A few metres away, across the road, is the recently inaugurated (January 21) Vaikom Satyagraha Memorial Gandhi Museum, built to commemorate the event, and outside which is a bronze statue of Gandhi.

Vaikom Satyagraha started as a regional, localised protest against untouchability. It, however, grew in significance, and is considered a pivotal event in the history of Kerala by historians, even leading to the Temple Entry Proclamation of 1936. The heart of this protest was at the Vaikom Mahadeva Temple, where the upper caste was permitted to use a public road around it but the others were not.

Boards were placed cautioning against the use of the road by people deemed to be of a lower caste. The replica of one such board is placed inside the museum as a reminder of the oppressive socio-political climate of the time.

Unlike conventional museums, there are no historical artefacts or exhibits. “Those are considered the life of a museum. For this movement, exhibits are non-existent. If it was a war, there would have been weapons. This was a peaceful Gandhian protest. The absence [of exhibits] was a challenge on how to curate the museum,” says R Chandran Pillai of Keralam Museum, which executed the project. The documentation and archival material compensates for what the project lacks in terms of exhibits.

Museum of history The Interactive Museum of Cultural History of Kerala also known as ‘Keralam Museum’ was established in 2011, by the Kerala Government as an autonomous body under the Cultural Affairs Ministry; it will showcase various aspects of the culture and heritage of the State.

Keralam Museum has refurbished, using modern techniques, archaeological museums at Koyikkal Palace (Nedumangad), Hill Palace (Tripunithura), and Pazhassi Raja Museum (Kozhikode). It has played an important role in setting up district heritage museums — District Heritage Museum, Thiruvananthapuram at Sreepadam Palace, Ernakulam District Heritage Museum at Bastion Bungalow, Wayanad District Heritage Museum in Pazhassikudeeram, Pathanamthitta District Heritage Museum, Konni and Thrissur District Heritage Museum, Kollencode Palace.

The story of the protest, which lasted 604 days from March 30, 1924 to November 23, 1925, is told through illustrative narrations: pictures, documents and interactive audio visual content. “We have a huge collection of original records and documents pertaining to Vaikom Satyagraha which proved to be a valuable source of information for the museum. Since there are no artefacts, the story was developed based on the facts that we have in our records,” says J Rejikumar, Director, State Archives.

The visual narration, in text form and illustrations, is through the eyes of a boy who would have faced discrimination based on caste. The visitor is first introduced to untouchability; its practice and imposition is a rude awakening to those unaware of its full extent. A miniature replica of the Vaikom temple shows the temple and the roads around it.

The introductory gallery lists the prescribed distance each caste was to keep from the other. To reinforce how untouchability was imposed are life-size statutes of three men — the first to defy the rule — protesting outside a picket fence and a board that forbids them from using the road.

The museum is divided into five sections, and includes a gallery for Gandhi, other leaders of the Satyagraha and a theatre for an audio-visual show. “In order to narrate the story of the Satyagraha, we want the audience as partners in the narration. We have kept it interactive to arouse curiosity,” says Chandran Pillai.

The museum sheds light on lesser known aspects of how the ban came to be, especially since the Maharaja of Travancore, Ayilyam Thirunal, had, in 1865, issued a proclamation, stating that public roads in Travancore were accessible to all; on when the first board, prohibiting access, was put up in 1905, and of those who led the struggle irrespective of faith or caste.

The Vaikom Satyagraha In February 1924, the Anti-Untouchability Committee held a public meeting in Vaikom, where it was decided that the rule barring temple roads to low castes would be defied by a group of satyagrahis. On March 30 volunteers from different parts of Travancore arrived in Vaikom. A message from Mahatama Gandhi was read out after which three men from different castes marched towards the prohibited road. Stopped by the police, they refused to turn back and squatted on the road. Three more followed, breaking the law for which they were arrested. Leaders courted arrest, the roads barricaded by the police, the protestors sat on the road in front of the barricades at the temple’s four entrances.

It is during the satyagraha that Mahatma Gandhi met Sree Narayana Guru for the first time. The information is precise and detailed.

What makes the museum interesting is that it is focussed on one event and shows every important detail connected to it.

The Interactive Museum of Cultural History of Kerala, also known as the Keralam Museum, implemented the project for the Archives Department. A part of the funding for the projects came from the Gandhi Heritage and Sites Mission, which is under the Ministry of Culture and the rest from the State Government.

The museum is closed on Mondays.

250,2020/02/12,Sayam Bharath Yadav’s works are inspired by stories of the soil,"Sayam Bharath Yadav goes nostalgic while raising global concerns in his solo show

‘Where Are We Going With The World’ screams a banner at State Art Gallery in Kavuri Hills. If the title stirs you, wait till you see the works created by artist Sayam Bharath Yadav on display inside . His solo show of 50 works comprises paintings, installations and drawings; The artist gets nostalgic while discussing global concerns. It is been worth the effort as he has been planning it for more than two-and-half-years.

Bharath, who belongs to a cowherd community has always been known for painting bulls, buffaloes and cows on canvases. Though his family no longer carries on the traditional profession, Bharath still reminisces the good ol’ days through his works. One of the installations ‘rataalu’ — of aluminium cans takes viewers on a nostalgic path. Painted with a tinge of earthy brown, these cans in different sizes are accompanied with measuring cups potti (fodder) and a cash box. “I used to see people from my family driving scooters to deliver pau ser or ardha ser milk. Now, we have the plastic milk packets and I miss natural touch,” he says.

Remember the vintage wooden cart in villages that were for agriculture or to ferry material and even people? That finds a replica here. At 8x4 feet, a cart created by Bharath has a transparent box filled with fibre-made horns, a reminder of the animal world destruction caused by men.

A work at the gallery | Photo Credit: By arrangement

Bharath’s thoughts are beautifully captured in his expressions. There’s one with three friends, which artist calls a homage to a Hyderabadi way of life “We can see such friends’ groups — relaxed as they casually inquire, ‘Kya miyan, kaise ho?”

Bharath’s drawings showcase different moods and characters from everyday life. The artist blends human forms with an animal head/instinct. “That is me’ he says, pointing to a figure relaxing on a sofa with a Picasso painting in the background and an aluminium can. “I create an environment with my surroundings. I am also attached to the form and translate it on canvas. I keep painting till I get the composition. It is a constant struggle to create.”

From ropes used to restrain cows and buffaloes and bracelets to gajjalu (anklets) worn around their feet, it’s all on display. It’s Bharath’s prized collection. “My brother-in-law had these things but now since their lifestyle has changed, they are of no use. So whenever they discard them, I bring it away.” A a painting titled ‘Bursting Bride’, shows a buffalo all decked up and an installation with words ‘Mir, Gir and Gujar’ (breeds of buffaloes) created on an acrylic sheet are inspired by the Narsingi cattle market. He says, “Various buffalo breeds from Gujarat, Rajasthan and Punjab are considered healthy and are decorated for prospective buyers. They make the market looks so lively.”

Paintings also depict social concerns on themes like urbanisation, global warming and pollution. Two paintings focus on helmets to present a slice of modern life. Inspired by busy traffic junction, one shows riders wearing helmets jostling for space. Another work shows the irony — ‘we wear helmets to protect our heads but do not show the same enthusiasm to protect nature.’

251,2020/02/12,3 firemen killed in Jammu building collapse,"They were trying to put out a blaze when the structure suddenly caved in

Three firemen were killed and six persons injured when a three-storey building collapsed in Jammu city on Wednesday when fire department personnel were trying to put out a blaze, officials said.

Director General of Fire and Emergency Services, V.K. Singh said the building in Golepulli area of Tallab Tillo, housing a saw mill on the ground floor, collapsed during the fire fighting operation.

“We lost three personnel in the incident, while six persons — four civilians and two firemen — were rescued in an injured condition and were evacuated to a hospital,” Mr. Singh who supervised the rescue operation, told PTI.

Soon after the incident, the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) and police rushed to the scene and were later joined by a team of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) to rescue the trapped persons.

After hectic efforts, the bodies of the three trapped firefighters identified as Vimal Kumar Raina, Rattan Chand and Mohammad Aslam were retrieved from under the debris, Mr. Singh said.

He said the fire department rushed firefighters after receiving a distress call at 4.48 a.m. and were making efforts to put out the blaze when suddenly the building collapsed at 5.30 a.m.

“We have rescued four trapped civilians in the morning while two of our personnel suffered injuries. All the rescued persons were evacuated and taken to a hospital,” Mr. Singh said, adding that while one of the firemen is being treated for serious burn injuries, the other is undergoing treatment for head injuries.

Cylinder explosion

“There was a huge stock of timber in the saw mill and a gas cylinder also exploded during the fire as a result of which the building collapsed due to intense heat,” the D-G said.

He said the NDRF team was mobilized from Pathankot to assist in the rescue operation.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/sho5op/article30803947.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE13PG32-COLPTI2122020000031A,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/3-firemen-killed-in-jammu-building-collapse/article30803948.ece
252,2020/02/12,Rajasthan seeks higher Central assistance for water scheme,"State has only 1% of country’s surface water: Minister

The Congress government in Rajasthan has sought changes in the norms for Central assistance for the Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM), which envisages supply of 55 litres of water per person per day to every rural household by 2024, in order to reduce the financial burden on the States. The flagship Central scheme at present stipulates the share in 50:50 ratio.

New action plans

Rajasthan, where only 12% households are currently getting piped water supply, has formulated new action plans for implementing JJM by rejuvenating the sources of water to provide connections to about 98 lakh households. The JJM is being implemented under the State Water and Sanitation Mission, which is already functional, and different sources, including rainwater harvesting, have been tapped.

The Union Ministry of Jal Shakti is holding discussions with all the States in five phases for their action plans under the JJM. Officers from Rajasthan’s Public Health Engineering Department held deliberations at a workshop in Odisha’s Puri.

Public Health Engineering Minister B.D. Kalla said here that the State, which had only 1.01% of the country’s surface water, had been trying hard to supply drinking water to geographically difficult areas and expected more assistance from the Centre to achieve the targets of JJM. Unless the steps were taken to increase surface water, the dark zones would expand across the State, he said.

Mr. Kalla said in the State Assembly on Tuesday that the Opposition should also urge the Centre to consider increasing its share in the JJM by changing the norms. He affirmed that the linking of Brahmani river with the Bisalpur dam, built on Banas river in Tonk district, would ensure inflow of more water, facilitating the water supply to Tonk, Sawai Madhopur, Ajmer, Jaipur and Nagaur districts.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/q5i1ni/article30803937.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE12-KALLA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/rajasthan-seeks-higher-central-assistance-for-water-scheme/article30803938.ece
253,2020/02/12,Hooda hits out at BJP-JJP govt. in Haryana,"Former CM demands White Paper on ‘worsening’ economic crisis in the State

Former Haryana Chief Minister and Leader of the Opposition in the State Assembly Bhupinder Singh Hooda on Wednesday hit out at the ruling BJP-JJP alliance government, accusing it of bringing development work to a standstill in the State.

Demanding a White Paper on the ‘worsening’ economic situation in the State, Mr. Hooda said that Haryana’s debt had increased from ₹61,000 crore to ₹1.81 lakh crore under the BJP regime.

“The government has put the State under a mountain of debt. Matters have reached a point where every child born in the State is burdened with a debt of ₹72,000 and the situation is getting worse. We demand that the State government issue a White Paper on the issue,” he said, addressing a press conference here.

Mr. Hooda said the current government was refusing to come to the work mode, even after assuming office for over three months now. “This government is citing its speeches as its achievements, nothing is happening on the ground. It’s a non-functional government,” he said.

“Farmers are facing an existential crisis as their crops have been damaged by hailstorms a few days ago but the damage has not been assessed and they have not yet been given compensation for crop losses. Far from giving any relief, the government continues to raise input prices and continues to collect several lakhs from the farmers in the name of tubewell connections. Farmers had to pay ₹10,000 for a tubewell connection under the Congress rule, but now have to pay ₹2 lakh,” said Mr. Hooda.

The Punjab government on Wednesday issued instructions to cancel the leaves of all the key staff engaged in reporting and management of coronavirus.

Punjab Health Minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said the staff involved in surveillance of coronavirus — reporting, tracing and management — would only be granted leave after getting sanction from the Directorate of Health Services so that screening of suspected passengers would not be affected.

Mr. Sidhu said so far a total of 22,236 passengers have been screened at the international airports in Amritsar and Mohali. He also said that 16,549 passengers have been screened at the Attari-Wagah border in Amritsar and 5,687 passengers at the Dera Baba Nanak check post in Gurdaspur district.

The Minister said of the 1,517 passengers, who had travelled to China or had transit stay at airports, 35 samples were collected for testing and all these samples have been reported negative by the National Institute of Virology.

A total of 1,109 passengers have crossed the observation period of 14 days so far and the remaining passengers have been kept in home isolation and under observation of the health department.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/punjab-govt-cancels-leave-of-key-staff/article30803914.ece
255,2020/02/12,"Difficult to revive AAP fortunes in Punjab, says ex-party leader","Sukhpal Khaira praises AAP’s resounding win in Delhi but rules out rejoining party

Former Aam Aadmi Party leader Sukhpal Singh Khaira on Wednesday said the party deserved praise for the victory in the Delhi Assembly polls but claimed that it was difficult to revive its fortunes in Punjab.

He alleged that the party was never “sincere” towards Punjab, resulting in the loss of the golden opportunity in the 2017 State Assembly polls, when it bagged 20 seats.

Replying to a question, Mr. Khaira, who was elected on the AAP symbol from Bholath constituency in 2017, ruled out the possibility of rejoining the party with “conditions”.

AAP won 62 out of 70 seats in the Delhi Assembly.

“It is a huge victory and they deserve praise for it,” said Mr. Khaira.

“If one thinks that whatever has happened in Delhi could suddenly happen in Punjab, it does not appear so because their conduct towards the State had not been sincere,” he said.

The former AAP leader said the circumstances in Punjab were different from the national capital, which was “flush with funds and has got huge revenue”.

“If one says they could win the Punjab polls by improving conditions of hospitals and schools, Punjab has complicated and multifarious political issues,” he said.

‘Opportunity lost’

“They must have dealt with Delhi differently but they lost a golden opportunity in the 2017 Punjab Assembly elections. It was a rare opportunity which they lost it and won just 20 seats,” said Mr. Khaira, claiming that the party didn’t go for course correction.

“The party never bothered to review the poll results and fixed the responsibility,” he alleged.

Removed from post

Mr. Khaira, who had joined AAP in 2015, was removed from the post of the leader of the opposition in the State Assembly in July 2018. Six months later, he quit AAP and floated his Punjab Ekta Party.

Mr. Khaira had resigned as MLA in April last year and contested the 2019 Lok Sabha elections from Bathinda, which he failed to win.

AAP had won four Lok Sabha seats in Punjab in the 2014 polls and one in the 2019 elections.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/oflte1/article30803907.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE12-KHAIRA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/difficult-to-revive-aap-fortunes-in-punjab-says-ex-party-leader/article30803908.ece
256,2020/02/12,Tripura tribal council moves to codify customary laws of tribal clans,"Introduces separate bills to adopt the law of Mizo, Kaipeng and Malsom communities

The Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council (TTAADC) has moved resolutions to codify the customary laws of three tribal clans. The council introduced separate bills to adopt the law of the Mizo, the Kaipeng and the Malsom communities to redress their long-standing demands.

Several clans have been approaching the TTAADC, which was constituted under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution, to codify their respective customary law. Tripura has 19 tribal communities, but some are left with very small population.

TTAADC Chief Executive Member Radha Charan Debbarma recently said they were interested in codifying the law of all indigenous communities. He gave the assurance after meeting a delegation from the Chakma community.

Even after the codification, the customary law has limited jurisdiction and can only deal with elected civil law matters. Most of the customary laws of the numerous tribal groups in the northeast India are not in written structure.

The TTAADC introduced the bills to codify the customary law of the Mizo, the Kaipeng and the Malsom communities in its current session. It had earlier approved introduction of the law of the Bru (Reang) community in 2018, but it is yet to be implemented for not receiving clearance from the Law department of the State government.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/pxn5w2/article30804880.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Tripura-Tribal-Areas-Autonomous-District-Counciljpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/tripura-tribal-council-moves-to-codify-customary-laws-of-tribal-clans/article30803694.ece
257,2020/02/12,Group of ten anti-CAA protesters arrested in U.P.,"They were on the ninth day of a march by foot from Chauri-Chaura near Gorakhpur to Rajghat in Delhi

A group of ten students and activists, including a female journalist, have been arrested in Uttar Pradesh’s Ghazipur district while they were on a foot march against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), police said on Wednesday.

While the police have accused them of misleading people on the issue of CAA and the proposed nationwide National Register of Citizens (NRC), friends of those arrested said they were baffled after a local Sub-Divisional Magistrate (SDM) court issued them notices for bail bonds of ₹2.5 lakh each, and two Gazetted persons per individual as guarantors.

Foot march

The students, mostly associated with the Banaras Hindu University, along with the journalist and social activists, were leading a foot march from Chauri-Chaura near Gorakhpur to Rajghat in Delhi. On the ninth day of the march, after completing 250 km, the ten persons were arrested in Ghazipur under Sections 107/16/151 of the CrPC (Criminal Procedure Code) and sent to jail on Tuesday, said Team Nagrik Satyagraha, the organisers.

Those arrested were identified as Pradeepika Saraswat, who is a journalist, Manish Sharma, Sheshnarayan Ojha, Priyesh Kumar Pandey, Anant Shukla, Atul Yadav, Neeraj Rai, Raj Abhishek, Ravidnda Kumar Ravi and Murari Kumar. They are aged 25-30 years.

The SDM court of Ghazipur Sadar issued a notice to the ten accused persons asking them why they should not appear before it and submit the bonds to maintain peace and order.

‘Instigating locals’

The ten have been accused of holding the padhyatra without seeking permission and allegedly “instigating and misleading” locals against the CAA and NRC, the order notes. Their alleged acts could breach public peace and cause “disaffection”, the order added.

There are “enough grounds” to act against them under CrPC 107/116, the SDM said in the order shared by Team Nagrik Satyagraha with this paper.

The ten have been sent to 14 days judicial custody.

Team Nagrik Satyagraha described the SDM order as “bizarre”.

“Why will a government officer take someone’s bail when he works under the same government? This is an attempt to further suppress democratic rights of citizens,” said the group. “They even have problem with people who are spreading idea of Gandhi and telling to stay away from Hindu-Muslim fight (sic),” the statement added.

While the Station House Officer of the Virano Police Station confirmed the arrests of the ten persons, he did not comment on the notices issued by the SDM. The SDM did not respond to phone calls.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/vshvi2/article30805008.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Team-Nagrik-Satyagrahajpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/group-of-ten-anti-caa-protesters-arrested-in-up/article30803673.ece
258,2020/02/12,Woman BJD leader performs self-immolation outside SP office over son’s arrest,"She sustained around 50% burn injuries

A woman leader of ruling Biju Janata Dal (BJD) in Odisha was seriously injured after she performed self-immolation outside the Berhampur SP’s office in Ganjam district on Wednesday protesting the arrest of her son, police said.

Forty one-year-old Meenakhi Mishra, an executive body member of BJD’s women wing, was admitted to a State-run hospital in the town with 50% burn injuries and then referred to SCB Medical College and Hospital in Cuttack, a police officer said.

Ms. Mishra is stated to have taken the step alleging that police had arrested her son after implicating him in a “false case”, he said.

Her son was arrested on January 28 in an assault case, the officer said.

“The woman went to the office of SP (Berhampur) Pinak Mishra to lodge her grievance and seek her son’s release but could not meet the officer as he was away. Instead, she met the additional SP and expressed her resentment. The ASP assured her that the matter would be looked into,” he said.

However, after coming out of the office building and moving a little away from it, she poured kerosene on her and set her on fire, sustaining around 50% burn injuries, the officer said.

“Our staff rescued her and took her to MKCG Medical College and Hospital here. Since her condition was serious, she was referred to SCB Medical College and Hospital in Cuttack,” Berhampur SP Pinak Mishra said.

The woman was probably carrying a bottle of kerosene in her bag, he said.

Several BJD leaders, including former Berhampur MLA Ramesh Chandra Chyau Patnaik and ex-chairperson of Berhampur Development Authority Subash Moharana visited the hospital to meet the woman.

Ms. Mishra had unsuccessfully contested the previous Berhampur Municipal Corporation election from ward number 39.

The SP said at least five persons, including a teenager, had been arrested for allegedly attacking Mishra and her son with sharp weapons at Panda Colony in Baidynathpur police station area on January 28.

However, Ms. Mishra’s son was also arrested for allegedly attacking the group, he said.

The BJD leader, however, alleged that her son was implicated in a false case and demanded his release.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/woman-bjd-leader-performs-self-immolation-outside-sp-office-over-sons-arrest/article30802547.ece

260,2020/02/12,"BJP is bringing laws against the Constitution, says Priyanka Gandhi Vadra","In Azamgarh, Congress leader met women who alleged police brutality during an anti-CAA protest

The laws that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is trying to implement are “not just against one community but against the entire Constitution, and poor people”, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said on Wednesday in Azamgarh in the backdrop of protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the proposed nationwide National Register of Citizens (NRC).

Ms. Vadra visited the eastern Uttar Pradesh city to meet a group of women who faced alleged police brutality last week while trying to stage a sit-in protest against the CAA and NRC in Bilariyaganj.

At least 20 persons were arrested and 35 named in the First Information Report, including the general secretary of the Rashtriya Ulema Council Tahir Madni, on charges of sedition, rioting, attempt to murder, criminal conspiracy and 14 other points.

The protesters, comprising a large number of women, however, have accused the police of brutality without provocation, and of forcefully dispersing them with lathi-charge, leaving several persons injured.

Roadshow

After meeting the victims of alleged police action, Ms. Vadra took out a roadshow and slammed the U.P. Police for hitting protesters who were protesting peacefully.

Ms. Vadra assured the people that she would send a report to the National Human Rights Commission about the alleged police atrocities in Azamgarh, and name the police officers and personnel who had committed these atrocities.

“The Congress party stands by you today and will stand by you till you get justice,” she said through a hand-held loudspeaker stop her vehicle.

Azamgarh was the sixth U.P. district visited by Ms. Vadra to meet victims of alleged police action during the protests against the CAA-NRC. She earlier visited Meerut, Muzaffarnagar, Bijnor, Varanasi and Lucknow.

‘Protect people’

The job of the police is to protect people, not hit them, she told the crowd gathered in Azamgarh.

Ms. Vadra said both the State and Central governments were against the poor and were trying to “break the Constitution”, and appealed to people to “come forward to save it [the Constitution]”.

Ms. Vadra also tried to reach out to the Other Backward Classes (OBC) and Dalits. “Some days ago, the BJP issued this statement in Uttarakhand — that reservation is not a Constitutional right,” she said. “The BJP spoke of breaking the Constitution even while in the Supreme Court.”

On the night of February 4, several women assembled at the Maulana Ali Jauhar Park in Bilariyaganj to protest against the CAA and NRC. At around 3 a.m./4 a.m. on February 5, police teams allegedly dispersed them using force, with a lathi charge, and the firing of tear gas and rubber pellets at them. Protesters alleged that the police also pelted bricks at the women. One woman, Sarvari Bano, was struck in the head by a brick allegedly thrown by the police and has been in an Intensive Care Unit since then.

A woman protester said the police “first started chasing the boys and men from all sides and beat them up, and then started throwing bricks at the women”.

‘Unprovoked aggression’

The women were protesting peacefully by reciting duas (prayers) and offering namaz at the site, said the protester, blaming the police for unprovoked aggression.

The Azamgarh Police, however, in a statement alleged that the protesters not only attacked them with sticks and bricks, but also used foul language against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, and that they used anti-national and anti-government language.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/jb4q0n/article30802210.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PTI2122020000070B,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bjp-is-bringing-laws-against-the-constitution-says-priyanka-gandhi-vadra/article30802176.ece

In a major Cabinet reshuffle, Meghalaya Chief Minister Conrad K. Sangma has removed his brother James K. Sangma as the Home Minister of the State in view of the alleged discontentment expressed by other Ministers against him.

263,2020/02/12,Row over removal of Chhatrapati Shivaji’s bust in MP town,"The removal of the bust triggered protests on Tuesday with some residents of Sausar

A controversy has erupted over removal of a bust of Chhatrapati Shivaji by local administration using a JCB machine in Sausar town in Madhya Pradesh’s Chhindwara district, with the BJP accusing the ruling Congress of “insulting” the “pride of the nation” with the act.

The bust, which was placed on a platform at Mohgaon Square intersection without any permission, was removed on Monday night, a senior district official said on Wednesday. The bust was put by some local saffron organisations.

The removal of the bust triggered protests on Tuesday with some residents of Sausar, located around 56 kms from Chhindwara, trying to block portion of Chhindwara-Nagpur national highway demanding re-installation of the bust.

“The bust was removed as it was placed at the Mohgaon chauraha (square) without any permission,” said Sausar Sub-Divisional Magistrate (SDM) Omprakash Sanodia. Following the incident, the opposition BJP demanded apology from Chief Minister Kamal Nath, who hails from Chhindwara district.

The opposition party also demanded Shiv Sena’s reply on the issue. Senior BJP leader Shivraj Singh Chouhan tweeted the video of the bust being removed with a JCB machine.

“Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj is the pride of the nation, the source of inspiration for the country. His humiliation will not be tolerated at any cost. If there was any objection, his statue could have been removed in a respectful manner. But this government takes pride in insulting great men,” Mr. Chouhan tweeted.

He also demanded apology of the CM.

“The Shiv Sena-led government in Maharashtra which also includes the Congress considers Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj as an ideal. Will they (Shiv Sena) tolerate such insult to him (Shivaji)?” Mr. Chouhan questioned.

However, state Congress spokesman Pankaj Chaturvedi accused the BJP of raising an unwarranted hue and cry over the incident.

“Shivaji Maharaj is also reverred by the Congress. In Sausar, the JCB machine was used because the platform on which the bust was placed was very strong. The bust was put up haphazardly,” Mr. Chaturvedi said in Bhopal.

He said the bust would be put up “respectfully” in an “organised manner” so that its position doesn’t affect vehicular traffic. A local Shiv Sena leader said Sausar residents have been demanding installation of Chhatrapati Shivaji’s bust at Mohgaon square since the last several years.

“As per their demand, some saffron organisations installed the bust on Monday, but the administration removed it. This action of the administration has hurt the sentiments of people,” he said. Local Congress MLA Vijay Choure said that Sausar municipality on Tuesday approved a proposal to re-install the bust at the same intersection.

Amid a sharp surge in the number of crimes against women in Maharashtra, a disturbing incident in which a 16-year-old girl from a backward class community in Solapur district was allegedly raped by 10 persons over six months came to light on Wednesday.

After the victim narrated her ordeal of serial rape to the police on Tuesday, the authorities at the Vijapur Naka police station in Solapur immediately arrested five of the accused, while teams are searching for the other miscreants — a majority of whom are autorickshaw drivers.

ACP Tipre said the shocking incident came to light after some locals saw the girl crying outside a temple on Tuesday and alerted the police.

“While the victim, who was extremely disturbed, hesitated to divulge any information, she revealed her painful tale after the police took her into confidence. According to her, she had been molested by a group of rickshaw drivers since June last year,” said another police official.

Speaking at the National Water Right Convention to discuss the draft of the Right to Water Bill in Madhya Pradesh, he said, “Until now, activists been working alone. But with the government’s support, on the one hand waterbodies could be protected, and on the other water use could be made judicious.”

Mr. Singh, known as the ‘Waterman of India’, who is advising the government on the proposed law, said, “Ownership of water bodies among masses has led to the revival of several rivers in a parched State like Rajasthan. With such laws, the model could be replicated across the country.”

Under the law, he added, streams, rivers and other waterbodies would be identified, panchayats roped in, people would take the lead and an effort would be made to curb mining on riverbeds.

Pointing to the waning water resources in the State, Chief Minister Kamal Nath said, “Eleven of the Municipal Corporations and Councils get water once in four days, 50 get once in three days and 117 get once in two days. It’s a big challenge.”

Despite rain, he added, streams and rivers were drying up owing to negligence. “As many as 65 dams in the State have dried up due to unavailability of water and 164 reservoirs have met the same fate. Instead of moving ahead, we are going back.”

Mr. Nath said new technologies must be leveraged in devising strategies to conserve water. “Technologies such as producing water from air could be useful. But those valid 20 years ago, aren’t relevant any more. So there is an imminent need to figure out where new technologies could be used,” he said.

Stating that his political life was inextricably linked to water, Mr. Nath related an anecdote from 1979 in Chhindwara district. “I started my political career due to water problems. One night as I walked on the road, I met 15-20 women carrying earthen lamps and plates, waiting at a spot for three hours. They said one of their sons could find a prospective bride as the water source was 12 km away. This was a lesson for me, and I decided to join politics to make my contribution.”

Mr. Nath cautioned that the next generation would not forgive us for our negligence. “During the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, I had said the talk of environment and forests was incomplete without the issue of water being raised.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/dq1swp/article30796412.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE12WATER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/society-must-help-conserve-water-expert/article30796413.ece
271,2020/02/12,Teacher claims threat for visiting Shaheen Bagh,"A teacher in Saharanpur on Tuesday claimed threat to her life after nearly 200 residents entered the school campus and protested against her visiting Shaheen Bagh in Delhi where women are protesting against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

Nahid Zaidi, who teaches English at Asha Modern School, told reporters that she was suspended from the school for visiting Shaheen Bagh on January 19 and speaking to the media. “I said many things but only selective footage was shown by the media. Some people who don’t like me put it on social media and created a false opinion against me,” she said, adding the suspension was revoked only when the police intervened.

Ms. Zaidi said she had taught at many schools and never made a difference between Hindu and Muslim students. “I have taught almost half of the city but still I am being targetted.” She said she lived alone and there was a “threat” to her life. On Monday, she said, around 200 residents entered the campus and raised slogans against her.

Vineet Bhatnagar, Superintendent of Police (City), Saharanpur, told The Hindu, “We have spoken to both the school administration and the teacher. She was not suspended.

After Deoband, the protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and National Register of Citizens has spread to Gangoh town of Saharanpur. Addressing hundreds of protesters, Maulana Mahmood Madani, secretary, Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind, said the government had let the Constitution down by making a law that differentiated among religions.

“Instead of speaking the language of arrogance, the government should introspect,” he said.

Praising the women who are protesting against the “black Act”, he said they had shown “great courage”. He ensured full support of the Jamiat.

Reminding the protesters of the significance of the Idgah ground of Gangoh, Mr. Madani said, “I am standing at a place where Hazrat Rasheed Ahmad Gangohi had said that they would provide the British rulers with youth who would happily kiss the noose.”

In Deoband, social activist Uzma Naheed addressed the women protesting against the CAA on Monday night. “I am surprised and happy that Muslim women who remained quiet for centuries have spoken out to save the Constitution,” she said.

273,2020/02/12,Differently abled couples tie the knot at mass wedding,"Thirty couples were given vocational training by NGO Narayan Seva Sansthan

Forty-seven differently abled and underprivileged couples tied the knot at a mass wedding ceremony and took a pledge against the dowry system in Udaipur. Narayan Seva Sansthan, a philanthropic institution, organised the ceremony on Sunday for persons whom it has helped out through corrective surgery.

Thirty of the married couples were skilled through the Sansthan’s vocational training programmes. The institution has also recruited a few couples by offering them jobs which fit their capacities, making them financially independent and employable.

During the ceremony, the couples were given household items and saris.

Narayan Seva Sansthan president Prashant Agarwal said the institution had so far organised 34 mass weddings in which over 2,000 differently abled couples were married.

“Such people find it difficult to marry because of financial constraints and physical difficulties. This platform has enabled them to find their soul mates who would support them in their struggle,” he said.

Mr. Agarwal said the objectives of mass weddings were social inclusion, accessible atmosphere and accountability of every differently abled person in order to help the couples lead a normal life and become a part of mainstream society.

Ramu Kumari and Ganpat from Pratapgarh, both of whom suffered from polio and had lost their fathers, were hopeful that their marriage would initiate a new phase of their lives. Arvind and Sonam from Barabanki took a pledge not to take dowry and generate public opinion against the social evil.

The Narayan Seva Sansthan has taken up activities such as artificial limb distribution, corrective surgery, skill education, health care support, free food offering and talent nurturing along with mass wedding ceremonies for the differently abled to bring them to the mainstream. Mr. Agarwal said the Sansthan had launched the World of Humanity Foundation for nurturing their skills.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/9urhs8/article30796402.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE12WEDDING2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/differently-abled-couples-tie-the-knot-at-mass-wedding/article30796403.ece

275,2020/02/12,Rajasthan Assembly witnesses noisy scenes over Chhapaak,"BJP members boycott Question Hour as queries were not allowed

The Rajasthan Assembly witnessed noisy scenes during the budget session on Tuesday, when the Opposition BJP members first questioned the government about the revenue loss after Deepika Padukone-starrer movie Chhapaak was declared tax-free and later boycotted the Question Hour on their supplementary questions not being allowed.

BJP MLA from Beawar Shankar Singh Rawat asked a written question about the film, but he was not satisfied with the reply of Parliamentary Affairs Minister Shanti Dhariwal. When Mr. Dhariwal said that declaring Chhapaak tax-free was a “policy decision” in view of the movie’s message to the society in support of acid attack survivors, Mr. Rawat alleged that the decision was taken because of Ms. Padukone’s “political inclinations”.

Speaker C.P. Joshi expunged Mr. Rawat’s supplementary question and said he would not allow any query which had no connection with the original question and pertained to the Department of Culture. Any new question should be asked separately through the proper procedure, he ruled.

Mr. Dhariwal told the House that the tax calculation to find out the revenue loss could only be done after February 20. The BJP members entered the well and raised slogans, while Leader of the Opposition Gulab Chand Kataria tried to speak on the issue, but the Speaker did not allow him.

Ms. Padukone’s visit to Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi to express solidarity with the students attacked by some masked persons on the campus on January 5 had led to a controversy.

After the uproar, the BJP members demanded that their right to ask questions should be protected by the Speaker and staged a walkout, boycotting the Question Hour.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/rajasthan-assembly-witnesses-noisy-scenes-over-chhapaak/article30796398.ece
276,2020/02/12,Delhi Assembly Elections 2020 result may work in JD(U)’s favour,"Nitish Kumar could seek more seats in Bihar.

Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal (United) lost the two seats of Burari and Sangam Vihar that the party had contested in alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party in the Delhi Assembly election, but the overall result is likely to provide a reason for Mr. Kumar to smile.

The BJP-led NDA’s crushing defeat in Delhi would now embolden the JD(U) to drive a harder bargain for seats with its alliance partner, the BJP, in the upcoming Assembly polls in Bihar, political analysts say.

“With the recent poll debacles for BJP, first in Jharkhand and now in Delhi, Nitish Kumar would be in a stronger position to bargain for more seats in the upcoming State Assembly elections,” said political analyst Ajay Kumar. In last year’s Lok Sabha election, the BJP and JD(U) had contested an equal number of 17 seats each of Bihar’s 40 parliamentary constituencies, leaving six seats to the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP).

The Delhi election saw the JD(U) contest an Assembly poll in alliance with the BJP outside Bihar for the first time. Mr. Kumar had camped in Delhi and shared the dais with Union Home minister Amit Shah and BJP president J. P. Nadda while campaigning for his party candidates in Burari and Sangam Vihar. Along with Mr. Kumar, several Bihar ministers and party leaders as well as State BJP leaders and the BJP’s senior leader and Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi had also campaigned in Delhi in a bid to woo the voters from the Purvanchal area of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.

When the results emerged on Tuesday, Mr. Kumar reacted with just three words: “Janata malik hai (the public is supreme)”. Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi too was there, but the BJP leader chose not to make any comment on the Delhi poll result.

Nawal Kishore Chaudhury, another political observer, said, “In the present scenario, after the Jharkhand and Delhi poll results, Nitish Kumar could pitch for more seats than the BJP, and the BJP will have no option but to concede to his demands.” .

However, State BJP leader and party spokesperson Nikhil Anand said, “the election result of Delhi has reflected the local sentiments of the voters and it has nothing to do with Bihar politics. BJP, as well as our NDA allies JD(U) and LJP, are busy in strengthening the organisational structure at the grassroots level in Bihar. NDA will sweep the 2020 Assembly election in Bihar under the leadership of CM Nitish Kumar”.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/6y6zrc/article30795826.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12TH-NITISH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/delhi-assembly-elections-2020-result-may-work-in-jdus-favour/article30795827.ece
277,2020/02/12,Electrocution mishap: driver of bus arrested,"Ganjam RTO says bus didn’t have permit to ply on route

The driver of the bus that touched an 11-KV live wire at Mendarajpur in Odisha’s Ganjam district on February 9, causing the death of 10 persons, was arrested on Tuesday.

The accused, Gagan Bihari Nayak, had jumped out of the bus when he realised that the top of the vehicle had come in contact with a high-voltage power cable. He fled the spot leaving the passengers to their fate. Additional Superintendent of Police, Berhampur, Pravat Routray said personnel at Golanthara police station were able to track down the driver on Sunday.

The Ganjam Regional Transport Office (RTO) said the bus had no permit to ply on the route on which the incident occurred. The RTO directed the Golanthara police to register a case against the owner of the bus and cancelled the driving licence of the bus driver.

SOUTHCO letter

A letter dated July 4, 2018, sent by power distribution company SOUTHCO, addressed to the Executive Engineer of the Ganjam Rural Development Department, had suggested several measures to avert a possible tragedy by spending approximately ₹4 lakh.

In the letter, SOUTHCO personnel mentioned road widening work from Mendarajpur to Dankalpadu taken up by the RDD without intimating SOUTHCO. Due to this work, the existing 11-KV cables, along with poles, had come to the middle of the road, threatening lives. The discom had requested the RDD to take up shifting of the power cables, poles and a sub-station, from the middle of road to the side.

SOUTHCO estimated that the RDD had to spend about ₹4,22,000 for the cable and pole shifting.

The discom officials allege that despite several intimations, the department did not deposit the money for the shifting work to be taken up.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/electrocution-mishap-driver-of-bus-arrested/article30795506.ece
278,2020/02/12,Harbhajan backs Shubman over Prithvi,"Says the Punjab player has been part of the team for quite a while without playing a Test

Shubman Gill’s stellar show in the recently-concluded India-A series is an indicator that he is ready for Test debut, feels senior off-spinner Harbhajan Singh.

Shubman had scores of 83 and 204 not out batting in middle-order in the first ‘A’ Test and then scored a hundred opening in the second game, showing his versatility at different slots.

Prithvi Shaw, back in the Test squad after 16 months, is also a contender in the playing XI with his equally dazzling repertoire of strokes.

Chance

“Shubman should get his chance since he has been part of the team (as reserve opener) for quite a while without playing any Test match,” Harbhajan, who has been Gill’s State team skipper in white-ball cricket, told PTI.

Their journeys have been intertwined since the U-19 days but in next 10 days, Prithvi and Shubman will provide skipper Virat Kohli and coach Ravi Shastri with a lot to ponder while fighting to be Mayank Agarwal’s opening partner in first Test against New Zealand, starting on February 21.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ti1yqo/article30803632.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH13GILL2,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/harbhajan-backs-shubman-over-prithvi/article30803633.ece
279,2020/02/12,Bumrah loses top spot in ODI rankings,"India speedster Jasprit Bumrah lost the top spot but all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja climbed three rungs to grab the seventh position in the ICC ODI rankings released on Wednesday.

Bumrah, who went wicketless in India’s 3-0 loss to New Zealand, was placed in the second position with 719 points in the bowling chart.

Big jump

Leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal, who snapped six wickets in the series, jumped to 13th spot even as chinaman bowler Kuldeep Yadav slipped to the 16th.

Kiwi pacer Trent Boult, despite missing the limited over series against India due to a broken hand, moved to the top of the bowling chart after Bumrah slipped.

Jadeja, who took two wickets and scored 63 runs in the series against New Zealand, moved to the seventh spot with 246 points in the all-rounders’ list which saw Afghanistan’s Mohammad Nabi emerge as the new World No. 1.

280,2020/02/12,Punjab steals a march on Bengal,"Vinay and Baltej share nine wickets to leave the visitor stunned

Vinay Choudhary (6/54) and Baltej Singh (3/16) picked nine wickets between them as Bengal folded for 138 in the first innings to cede the advantage to Punjab on day one of the Ranji Trophy Elite A match here.

Rohan Marwaha and Mandeep Singh took the host to 93 when Akash Deep got rid of the former for 48, signalling stumps. Shahbaz had earlier prised out Abhijeet Garg and Sharad Lumba just after tea.

Disciplined attack

During the course of the morning, Bengal, having elected to bat, battled a disciplined Punjab attack. The tandem of pacers Siddarth Kaul and Baltej put the brakes on Bengal’s innings after captain Abhimanyu Easwaran was bowled through the gate by Baltej for a 11-ball duck. Baltej then got rid of Kaushik Ghosh who played around his front pad and was trapped in front.

Abhishek Raman and Arnab Nandi survived close calls early: off-spinner Krishan Alang, bowling the 10th over of the day, launched into one vociferous appeal after another for lbw but to no avail. But the pressure he created was about to tell.

Making use of a wicket — no signs of alarming turn and bounce though — that was taking spin, Alang kept the batsmen rooted to the crease with his dot balls. “Matha thanda korey (Play with a calm head)”, yelled Bengal coach Arun Lal at one point. But Raman, not heeding Lal’s sound advice, stepped out and hit one into the hands of debutant Ramandeep Singh.

Arduous

That brought Manoj Tiwary to the crease, who along with Shreevats Goswami, made arduous but necessary progress. The duel between Kaul and Tiwary added some spice to the contest, the duo exchanging stares and occasionally, words.

The two had added 47 for the fifth wicket when Goswami fell after lunch, trapped lbw by Vinay Choudhary for 19. Goswami’s wicket triggered a collapse as the visitor slipped from 104/5 to 138 all out; Choudhary snapping up three in one over. Tiwary, who remained unbeaten on 73, was the lone ranger with the bat.

The scores:

Bengal — 1st innings: Koushik Ghosh lbw b Baltej 7, Abhimanyu Easwaran b Baltej 0, Abhishek Raman c Ramandeep b Alang 14, Arnab Nandi b Choudhary 11, Manoj Tiwary (not out) 73, Shreevats Goswami lbw b Choudhary 19, Anustup Majumdar c Anmol b Choudhary 0, Shahbaz lbw b Choudhary 0, Writtick Chatterjee c Anmol b Baltej 2, Akash Deep c Lumba b Choudhary 0, Ramesh Prasad c Marwaha b Choudhary 0; Extras (nb-1, b-4, lb-7): 12; Total (in 49 overs): 138.

281,2020/02/12,Ex-India international Robin Singh appointed UAE’s director of cricket,"Singh has over the years made a name for himself in coaching.

Former India all-rounder Robin Singh was on Wednesday appointed director of cricket of the United Arab Emirates, local media reported.

The 56-year-old’s appointment comes following the sacking of Dougie Brown as head coach, reports stated.

The Indian takes over at a time when the UAE’s national team is trying to recover from the fixing scandal that rocked their cricket last year, leading to suspension of a few senior players, including captain Mohammed Naveed, and disbanding of the selection panel.

Without a selection committee, Brown was forced to pick the teams for the series against Scotland and the United States at home last December, and against Oman and Namibia in Muscat in January, for the World Cup League Two matches.

Singh, who had represented India in one Test and 136 ODIs between 1989 and 2001, has over the years made a name for himself in coaching.

He was associated with the Indian Premier League’s highly successful Mumbai Indians franchise, Caribbean Premier League’s Barbados Tridents since 2013 and T10 franchises in the T10 league here.

Singh, who was born in Princes Town, Trinidad, has also conducted coaching clinics in the UAE.

An agile fielder and a useful batting all-rounder with an ability to hit big shots, Singh scored 2236 runs in one-day internationals at an average of 25.95 and a best of 100.

He also picked up 69 wickets in the 50-over format with a best of 5/22.

282,2020/02/12,"Glenn Maxwell ruled out of South Africa tour with elbow injury, could miss beginning of IPL","Maxwell will undergo surgery on his left elbow and will be replaced by D’Arcy Short for the SA tour

Australia all-rounder Glenn Maxwell is set to miss the beginning of the IPL after an elbow injury on Tuesday ruled him out of the upcoming ODIs and T20 Internationals in South Africa.

The tour of South Africa starts on February 21.

Maxwell will undergo surgery on his left elbow and will be replaced by D’Arcy Short in both squads.

Cricket Australia said he might require at least six to eight weeks to attain full match fitness, which means he is likely to miss the beginning of the IPL too, which is starting on March 29. The 31-year-old is representing Kings XI Punjab in the franchise-based league.

A “shattered” Maxwell said the decision to withdraw from the South African tour was difficult.

“I was not confident that I could perform at international level with my elbow in its current state and have decided to undergo surgery straight away to fix the issue,” Maxwell said in a statement.

“I would like to thank Justin Langer, Ben Oliver, Trevor Hohns and the whole Australian squad for their understanding.”

The South Africa tour was the first time Maxwell had been picked for national duties since taking a break from cricket in October due to mental health issues.

Australia’s national selector Trevor Hohns said Maxwell’s increased pain could not have been overlooked.

“We are disappointed to lose Glenn this close to the tour as we were looking forward to welcoming him back to the national side in both the 20 and 50-over formats after his break during the summer,” Hohns was quoted as saying by Cricket Australia.

“Unfortunately, the pain he has experienced in the elbow in the latter stages of the BBL increased over the weekend and he will have surgery immediately to rectify the situation.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/wrbben/article29891026.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Maxwell,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/glenn-maxwell-ruled-out-of-south-africa-tour-with-elbow-injury-could-miss-beginning-of-ipl/article30799206.ece

285,2020/02/12,Women’s T20 tri-series final | Mandhana fifty in vain as Australia take title,"Opener Beth Mooney top-scored for the hosts with an aggressive 71 off 54 balls, hitting nine boundaries.

Opener Smriti Mandhana’s 37-ball 66 went in vain as Australia beat India by 11 runs to win the Tri-Nation Women’s T20 Series here on Wednesday.

Set a target of 156, India were all out for 144.

Left-arm spinner Jess Jonassen was the star of the show with brilliant figures of 5/12 in four overs.

Opting to bat, Australia managed to post 155 for six in their stipulated 20 overs. Chasing a challenging target, Mandhana was up to the task at hand and smashed 12 boundaries in her knock at the Junction Oval.

However, Mandhana’s dismissal in the 15th over, caught brilliantly by Nicola Carey in the deep mid-wicket, turned the match in Australia’s favour as they put the brakes on India’s scoring while at the same time taking wickets.

It was the departure of skipper Harmanpreet Kaur, in the 16th over, which dashed India’s hopes of a victory.

Earlier, India’s Rajeshwari Gayakwad leaked 19 runs in the last over to let Australia off the hook and post a challenging total on the board.

Opener Beth Mooney top-scored for the hosts with an aggressive 71 off 54 balls, hitting nine boundaries.

Brief scores:

Australia: 155 for six in 20 overs (Beth Mooney 71 not out).

India: 144 all out in 20 overs (Smriti Mandhana 66, Jess Jonassen 5/12).",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ja45wy/article30798313.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MOONEY,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/womens-t20-tri-series-final-india-vs-australia-at-melbourne/article30798314.ece

287,2020/02/12,Transfer of CEO will not affect inquiry: Collector,"District Collector K. Rajamani said on Wednesday that the transfer of Coimbatore Chief Educational Officer (CEO) will not affect the inquiry into the alleged sexual harassment of students by a headmaster at a panchayat union primary school near Kinathukadavu.

On Tuesday, the Department of School Education issued an order announcing the transfer of Coimbatore CEO P. Ayyanan to Namakkal. P. Usha, Namakkal CEO, will take charge as the Coimbatore CEO.

Mr. Rajamani told The Hindu that the CEO and District Child Protection Unit are conducting inquiries into these allegations. “It has been instructed to take further action following the inquiry,” he said. The “factual position” of the case must be ascertained. The State Human Rights Commission has not asked for any report in this issue yet, Mr. Rajamani said.

On Tuesday, Mr. Ayyanan ordered the transfer of the headmaster and said that departmental inquiry would be initiated against him. This was following the protests staged by a group of parents near Negamam on Monday demanding action against the headmaster, who they accused of sexually harassing multiple students in the primary school. Negamam police said that no complaint was filed in this regard.

District Child Protection Officer R. Sundar said that the inquiry would also involve officials from the Child Welfare Committee and Anti-Child Trafficking Unit. Regarding allegations that the police received a letter on a stamped paper from parents of one of the victims claiming that the headmaster was innocent, Mr. Sundar said the inquiry would check the veracity of this allegation.

An education official privy to the development said that the transfer of Mr. Ayyanan was not connected with this controversy and it was a “routine” procedure of promotions by the Department of School Education.

Dalit Intellectual Collective, a Dalit rights organisation, demanded that the headmaster must be booked under provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.

In a statement issued on Wednesday, the organisation said that the State government must launch an independent inquiry into this incident and prescribe an “appropriate punitive action.” In addition, the government must provide adequate protection, counselling and compensation to the allegedly affected children, the statement said.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/transfer-of-ceo-will-not-affect-inquiry-collector/article30804252.ece
288,2020/02/12,Namakkal poultry farmers protest against reduced egg price quoted by NECC,"Poultry farmers in Namakkal are protesting against the National Egg Coordination Committee (NECC) for reducing egg price in the last few days and have demanded the Committee to return to its old price determination practice.

The poultry farmers wanted the body to suggest rates thrice a week - Mondays, Thursdays and Saturdays - as done earlier, instead of fixing prices daily.

They also demanded the organisation to stop reducing rates while there was demand for the produce.

Executive committee member of NECC R. Nagararajan said, “There are over 1,000 poultry farmers in Namakkal and 30% of them conduct trade at their farms. Others take the produce to domestic markets and other States for sale. When prices were decided thrice a week, it worked well for traders and poultry farmers since goods loaded from Namakkal would take at least a day to reach the destination. When the committee started suggesting prices on a daily basis, the rates on the day of loading and delivery differed and this often resulted in loss for farmers. Also, the committee should meet and decide the price, which is not happening at present.”

Namakkal Parliamentarian and poultry farmer A.K.P. Chinraj said that NECC should not consider minus rates while suggesting prices and said that the Committee should call the protesting farmers for a discussion.

292,2020/02/12,Coimbatore sees a gradual shift in use of drugs,"Officials suspect use of synthetic drugs like LSD, MDMA and methamphetamine in rave parties

The recent seizure of Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) aka ‘ecstasy’ and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in Coimbatore city is viewed by agencies involved in anti-narcotic drives and the police as a sign of ‘gradual shift’ from cheap and easily available contraband like ganja and prescription drugs to synthetic psychoactive drugs.

Officials involved in anti-narcotic operations suspect the use of synthetic drugs like LSD, MDMA and methamphetamine in rave parties, mostly organised by the people in close circles.

According to Bruno A., zonal director, Chennai zonal unit of Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), use of ganja and abuse of certain prescription drugs like nitrazepam, a hypnotic drug prescribed for relief from anxiety and insomnia, are the entry stage drugs from which users migrate to hard and hardest drugs.

“Soft drugs such as ganja and prescription drugs are considered as the gateway to hard drugs such as LSD and MDMA. Resistance to intoxication generated by soft drugs can drive users to seek for hard drugs and then to hardest drugs such as heroine, methamphetamine and cocaine,” he says.

While NCB in largely involved in enforcing drug laws, intelligence gathering and prevention of entry-exit of banned substances in large scale from the country, State level agencies like the Narcotics Intelligence Bureau CID (NIB-CID) and the police play in regional and local levels.

R. Vincent, Deputy Superintendent of Police with NIB-CID, whose team arrested four men with LSD and MDMA in two recent cases, say that these seizures indicate circulation and use of hard drugs in the city.

While NIB-CID sleuths arrested two persons with five LSD stamps and 1.5 kg ganja near Saravanampatti on January 29, they held two others with 20 LSD stamps and 10g of MDMA near Peelamedu on February 6.

“We suspect that these drugs were meant to be used in rave parties or private parties. As per our understanding, small levels of drugs like LSD and MDMA are sold to partygoers who are charged with particular amount as entry fee. The entry fee will be inclusive of certain volume of liquor and food. Those who use these drugs will be in a state of trance and thus the volume of alcohol distributed free can be reduced to a considerable amount, a profit for organisers,” says Mr. Vincent.

Mr. Vincent’s team is currently on the lookout for a few more persons associated with the arrested. The team suspect the flow of drugs like LSD and MDMA from Goa and other States.

The local police have also proved mettle in cracking down on rave parties involving use of drugs, including the first ever seizure of MDMA in Coimbatore.

In a late night surprise raid conducted at a farm resort at Sethumadai near Pollachi on May 3, 2019, the Coimbatore rural police had seized 13.5g of MDMA, hashish oil, ganja and a drug in powder form. The party featured psychedelic music, a genre of music which is closely associated with the use of perception-altering hallucinogenic drugs.

Apart from regular crackdown on the sale of ganja, the police have also arrested persons involved in selling prescription drugs like nitrazepam and tapentadol, a pain reliever.

Recently, the police arrested a man, whose father runs a pharmacy at Vellakoil, from Udumalpet on charges of possessing and attempting to sell a particular brand of tapentadol.

The man possessed more than 20 strips of the pain killer and a few persons, who had bought the drug from him, were also booked.

“When questioned, the main accused confessed that he had sourced the tablets online. The pharmacy run by his father also had minimal stock of the drug. The users were reportedly powdering the tablet and mixing it with water to make a solution. We are unaware if they were adding any other substance to the solution, consumption of which is believed to give a sedative effect,” said a source in the know of the investigation.

S. Gurubharathi, Assistant Director of Drugs Control, Coimbatore zone, said that a case was registered against the pharmacy owner in connection with the incident.

He added that the Department was also cooperating with the NIB-CID and the police to prevent the sale of prescription drugs, enforcing the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 and the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/lv302h/article30795766.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB12LIQUORBOTTLES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/coimbatore-sees-a-gradual-shift-in-use-of-drugs/article30795767.ece
293,2020/02/12,Dusty service roads below Ondipudur flyover irk residents; MLA stages protest,"After the Ondipudur flyover was thrown open to the public sometime in 2007, the National Highways repaired the road in 2010, in the run up to the World Classical Tamil Conference.

A Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation bus moving on the service road north of the Ondipudur flyover towards the depot there kicks up a cloud of dust. A private bus that taking a ‘U’ turn beneath the flyover leaves behind a trail of dust.

The dust from the severely damaged service roads on both sides of the flyover blankets the area, causing problems to the people.

This has been an everyday affair for the past few years ever since the service roads were damaged and their condition went from bad to worse, rues R. Manoharan, a resident of the nearby Nagaiyan Thottam Street.

The Corporation buses that move in to and out of the depot and private buses that terminate trips in Ondipudur use the service roads. The two together take the total trips the buses take to at least 600 a day, says A. Subramaniam of Weavers’ Colony, adding, “imagine how much dust each of the 600 bus trip kicks up.”

The only time the residents get to breath fresh air is between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m. when the bus movement stops, they add.

After the Ondipudur flyover was thrown open to the public sometime in 2007, the National Highways repaired the road in 2010, in the run up to the World Classical Tamil Conference. Thereafter, the National Highways has done nothing much, Mr. Subramaniam complains.

DMK MLA representing the Singanallur Assembly constituency N. Karthik says every time the residents complained of poor roads, all that the authorities did was dump debris, which, in fact, worsened the situation as it adds to the dust.

During monsoons, the service roads turn slushy. The uneven road surface and potholes that hold water for long make life miserable for the residents of nearly a dozen residential colonies who use the service roads.

The residents and Mr. Karthik say that though they have petitioned the National Highways to repair the service roads, they are unable to get any relief.

His last petition was in November 2019.

As the Highways did nothing about the service roads in the last two months, he inspected the spot again on Tuesday and squatted in protest in front of the National Highways office in Gandhipuram to draw the officials’ attention.

After his protest, the officials have promised to repair the roads in the next 10 days and re-lay the roads in the next month or so.

The Highways officials say they have submitted a proposal to the Centre seeking ₹ 33 crore for widening the stretch of road from Karanampettai to Palladam and as part of the work, they will take up the service road work as well.

They say the services roads were damaged due to pipeline laying work. Sometime ago, when they took up the work to develop roads on the eastern side of the railway track, they wanted to develop the services roads that are on the western side of the track but could not.

Now, they hope to take up the work once the government approves of the project, perhaps in a month.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/vhbncj/article30795758.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB12ROAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/dusty-service-roads-below-ondipudur-flyover-irk-residents-mla-stages-protest/article30795759.ece

Of the 62 AAP MLAs, 38 or 61% have declared criminal cases against themselves in their election affidavits. Among the 43 newly-elected MLAs who have declared criminal cases, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had the highest number of cases — 13. Five of the eight BJP MLAs, or 63%, declared criminal cases against themselves, ADR said.

Eight of the nine women candidates fielded by the AAP in the Delhi Assembly polls won, helping the party register a thumping election victory on Tuesday.

The three prominent parties — the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress — had fielded a total of 24 women candidates, with the Congress accounting for a maximum of 10 of them.

The AAP had fielded nine women candidates, while the BJP had given tickets to five women.

AAP’s Atishi, who had unsuccessfully contested last year’s Lok Sabha polls from the East Delhi constituency, was fielded from Kalkaji in place of sitting MLA Avtar Singh Kalka. She won the seat by a margin of over 11,300 votes. After the first few rounds of counting of votes, Atishi was trailing BJP’s Dharambir Singh, but later emerged victorious.

Dhanwati Chandela, who quit the Congress to join the AAP ahead of the polls, won the Rajouri Garden seat, defeating BJP’s Ramesh Khanna by a margin of 22,972 votes. She was also one of the richest candidates in the fray. Chandela had unsuccessfully contested the Rajouri Garden bypolls in 2017 and lost to Manjinder Singh Sirsa. She is the wife of former Congress MLA Dayanand Chandela.

Rajkumari Dhillon, another former Congress leader who joined the AAP ahead of the polls, won the Hari Nagar seat, defeating BJP’s Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga by a margin of over 20,000 votes.

Preeti Tomar of the AAP defeated BJP’s Tilak Ram Gupta by a margin of over 10,700 votes to win the Tri Nagar seat. Her husband, Jitender Tomar, had won the seat in 2015 by a margin of 22,311 votes. In January, the Delhi High Court set aside the 2015 election of Jitender Tomar for allegedly giving a false declaration regarding his educational qualification in his nomination papers. Following this, the AAP decided to field Preeti Tomar from the constituency.

Bhavna Gaur of the AAP won the Palam seat by defeating BJP’s Vijay Pandit. In 2015, Gaur had won the seat by a margin of over 30,800 votes.

AAP’s Pramila Tokas won the RK Puram seat, defeating BJP’s Anil Kumar Sharma by a margin of over 10,000 votes. She had won the seat in 2015 by a margin of over 19,000 votes.

Rakhi Birla of the AAP retained the reserved Mangolpuri seat with a margin of over 30,000 votes by defeating BJP’s Karam Singh Karma. She bettered her 2015 poll performance, when she had won the seat by a margin of over 22,600 votes.

AAP’s Sarita Singh lost to BJP’s Jitender Mahajan by a margin of 13,241 votes from Rohtas Nagar.

Arvinder Singh Lovely from Gandhi Nagar, Devender Yadav from Badli and Abhishek Dutt from Kasturba Nagar were the only ones who managed to save their deposits.

Even sitting Chandini Chowk MLA Alka Lamba who switched from the Aam Aadmi Party to the Congress lost her deposit.

The party’s strategy of promising voters a throwback to a “Congress wali dilli” and highlighting achievements during the 15-year tenure of Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit failed to strike a chord with voters.

The Congress was the only party to take a stand on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and had promised to pass a resolution in the Assembly against the law if voted to power.

Rahul Gandhi’s four election rallies in which he pushed the party’s plans to generate employment for the youth failed to garner support from the voters.

Delhi Congress chief Subhash Chopra took responsibility for the defeat and said that the party would need to introspect on what went wrong. He blamed politics of polarisation for the party’s fall in vote share.

298,2020/02/12,‘BJP campaign failed on many fronts’,"Local issues got buried: party sources

Failing to project a Chief Ministerial face, failing to counter the Aam Aadmi Party’s power and water subsidies, using a local election as a “launch pad” for national issues, and star campaigners “overshadowing” local candidates were some of the problems in the BJP’s campaign in the Assembly polls, said party insiders.

The Delhi BJP had thought that 240-odd MPs canvassing in the Capital would further their chances but “unwarranted comments” made by these “outsiders” as well as some local MPs did a lot of “damage”, added sources.

“A significant issue with the campaign was the decision not to project a CM face; the other big issue was the kind of comments made by some star campaigners such as Anurag Thakur and Parvesh Sahib Singh,” said a party source.

“Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath helped secure the victory of BJP’s Karawal Nagar candidate Mohan Singh Bisht... comments by Anurag and Parvesh did more damage than good,” the source added.

“The events of senior leaders ended up becoming platforms to push the BJP’s national agenda... local issues found brief or no mention at all,” said another party source.

“BJP MPs from outside Delhi ended up overshadowing the candidates; we were also unable to counter AAP’s power and water subsidy schemes. It had been conveyed to the national leadership to allow the local unit to come out with a ‘Modi Card’ which could be utilised to get subsidies on power and water bills as well as on public transport but the idea was shot down,” another party source claimed.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/1h6uiq/article30796389.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12DEPOLL14,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/bjp-campaign-failed-on-many-fronts/article30796390.ece
299,2020/02/12,9 constituencies see close contest,"AAP, BJP candidates win by margins of less than 5,000 votes

Nine Assembly Constituency seats witnessed a close contest between the Aam Aadmi Party and the BJP with candidates winning by a margin of less than 5,000 votes.

AAP won seven out of these nine seats.

In at least six of them, the party saw a drop in the margin with which the candidates won as compared to the 2015 polls. In one seat, however, the margin of victory increased for the party.

The least margin recorded was on the Bijwasan seat where AAP’s Bhupinder Singh Joon defeated BJP’s Sat Prakash Rana by 753 votes.

The Laxmi Nagar seat also saw a close fight with BJP’s Abhay Verma defeating AAP’s Nitin Tyagi by 880 votes. In Adarsh Nagar constituency, AAP candidate Pawan Sharma won by a margin of 1,589 votes against BJP’s Raj Kumar Bhatia.

Senior AAP leader Manish Sisodia got re-elected from Patparganj by a margin of 3,207 votes by defeating BJP’s Ravinder Singh Negi.

Mr. Sisodia had won by a margin of 28,791 votes in the 2015 elections.

BJP’s Rekha Gupta from he Shalimar Bagh lost out to AAP’s Bandana Kumari by a margin of 3,440 votes.

The outlier

In Krishna Nagar, S.K. Bagga of AAP won by a margin of 3,995 votes by defeating BJP’s Anil Goyal — an improvement from his 2015 election result where he had won by a margin of 2,277 votes.

In eight constituencies, all of which were won by the Aam Aadmi Party, the margin of victory was above 40,000 votes. On the other hand, seven of the BJP’s eight winning candidates could secure only a margin of less than 17,000 votes.

The largest margin of victory was seen in Burari where AAPs Sanjeev Jha retained his seat with 88,158 votes. Mr. Jha improved upon his 2015 results when he won by a margin of 67,950 votes.

The second largest margin of victory was seen in Okhla, dominated by members of the Muslim community and has been a site of indefinite protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

Here, AAP’s Amanatullah Khan won by a margin of 71,827 votes compared to a margin of 64,532 in the previous elections.

In Matia Mahal, also a Muslim majority constituency, Shohaib Iqbal won by a margin of 50,241 votes, compared to the margin of 26,096 votes by AAP’s Asim Ahmed Khan in the previous elections.

301,2020/02/12,Comment | The victory of the Shaheen Bagh women,"The silent contribution of the peaceful protesters went missing in high-decibel commentaries on the election results

Buried in countless discussions on the failure of hate campaign against Shaheen Bagh and the victory of the Aam Aadmi Party’s politics of “kaam” has been the actual role of the women of Shaheen Bagh. The Union Home Minister’s exhortation to deliver “electric current” to Shaheen Bagh, the chanting of “goli maro” and the actual attacks by stray shooters, crafting sedition charges against individuals, have contrasted singularly with the pictures of rows of women sitting with children, waving the flag and copies of the Constitution and most of all, dedicated to peaceful protest. The importance of this cannot be underestimated.

Hate as strategy

Speaking at a panel on the results of the Delhi elections on a television channel, Seshadri Chari, a senior BJP spokesperson, described the communally vituperative campaign of his party as “not hate politics but strategy”. This is a chilling statement. The problem, however, is not only its questionable morality – an important if not scary issue – but the failure of the strategy.

Clearly, as strategy, it has had its uses. The BJP vote share in the 2020 Delhi elections has been reasonable enough. But it failed to produce a cutting edge precisely because the strategy did not extend beyond the rhetoric of incitement. It was the deliberate commitment to peaceful protest by the women satyagrahis – ordinary mothers, homemakers, youth – that staved off any violent counter-response. Counterfactually speaking, if there had been the slightest hint of violent response, the spiral of violence and communal polarisation would have been uncontrollable. The strategy of hate would then have been unstoppable. It would have upended the politics of “kaam”.

It may be recalled that the women have carried on despite no acts of solidarity from AAP; instead, they have continuously faced the fear of violent ejection by the police. It is the silent contribution of the Shaheen Bagh women that remains unremarked upon in the high-decibel commentaries on the election results.

It raises a difficult question for the BJP now. It deliberately nationalised the elections. Beginning with the Prime Minister, organised and co-ordinated by the Home Minister and deploying a phalanx of Chief Ministers and over 200 MPs, the BJP campaign has been one of the most communal vituperative ever in the history of India’s elections. It has raised questions of national integrity, portraying Shaheen Bagh as a centre of terrorist and anti-national activity – and then going on to associate this unpleasing fiction with AAP. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal himself has been accused of being a terrorist. The basic elements of this campaign are by no means new. Over time, any opposition to the BJP has been progressively labelled as anti-national. This has provided a momentum of aggression to BJP’s nationwide campaigns.

Testing ground

For BJP, Shaheeh Bagh was the testing ground of a new use of communal mobilisation. Within less than a year of its massive general election victory and the apparent success of its strategy of dismembering the State of Jammu and Kashmir, the BJP government has faced the strongest-ever protest that has spread across the entire country on the issue of the CAA-NRC. Most importantly these protests were carried out by the youth of different communities, becoming a platform for voicing dissatisfaction against a governance perceived to be high-handed, regulative of lifestyles and unable to provide jobs.

The Delhi elections provided an opportunity to begin a counter-initiative by the BJP. The BJP-ruled States had put down the protests with an iron hand.

Shaheen Bagh provided an opportunity to initiate an ideological counter-offensive against the protests. Indissociable from the protests against the CAA-NRC which it had given birth to, Shaheen Bagh could be deployed to isolate, marginalise and communalise the protests. The only problem – which finally defeated the BJP strategy - was that it was dominated by women who refused to be provoked.

The unresponsiveness of these women was complemented by the careful distancing of the AAP from the protesters. Both of these put BJP out on a limb. More importantly, it allowed the focus to be put on a positive element, that is, the work done by AAP. If Shaheen Bagh dominated the saffron air waves, it was kaam that was discussed among the ordinary voters on the ground. The laying out of water and sewage pipes, free bus rides to women, the rise of standards in government schools and so on, dominated the agenda. It became so effective that the ground campaigners of the BJP had to take recourse to questioning the wisdom of providing “freebies” to the electorate. In short, BJP workers were caught in the self-defeating position of saying that the electorate was unfit for the welfare measures that they have traditionally expected the state to provide.

Where does the BJP go from here? Can it afford to charge with all the vituperation and aggression at its command, like Don Quixote against windmills that refuse to move? For BJP aggressive polarisation has been important for both electoral victory while combining this with establishing the affective and ideological foundations of a future Hindu Rashtra. But if communal polarisation does not work as an issue, what else will the BJP have in its electoral kitty? Delhi has shown that a purely negative campaign of discrediting the agenda of its rivals will not do. Nor can it step back now, for the reputation of its Shah-Modi leadership has been built on its authoritarian stubbornness to defend its positions. There is too much now at stake for the BJP leadership and too little ammunition at its disposal.

Aam Aadmi Party senior leaders — Atishi, Raghav Chadha, and Dilip Pandey — who had lost the 2019 Delhi Lok Sabha election and have now won the Assembly polls, are expected to have important roles in the new Delhi government.

Three of them are considered to be very close to the top AAP leadership and Ms. Atishi is the only woman member of the party’s Political Affairs Committee (PAC) — the highest decision making body of AAP.

Until April 2018, Ms. Atishi was Education Minister Manish Sisodia’s advisor and has been playing a major role in improving education system in the government-run schools.

Ms. Atishi, who holds a master’s degree in Educational Research from Oxford University, in the run up to the election had said she will work to improve the education system in her Kalkaji Assembly constituency and improve basic facilities.

Mr. Chadha said the party will serve the people twice more than before and termed the win as a victory of “Kejriwal model of governance”.

303,2020/02/12,Celebrations inside AAP office began early morning,"Police block traffic outside party office

As early as 7 a.m. on Tuesday, even before the counting began, supporters of the Aam Aadmi Party started getting ready for celebrations at the party headquarters as the exit polls had shown a clear victory for them.

Space crunch

As the results started to trickle in, the crowd at the party office started increasing from a few dozen to hundreds of supporters to a point where there was no space inside the premises for any more people.

As the volunteers spilled over onto the roads, the police had to block vehicular movement outside the party office leading to ITO.

The party had set up a temporary stage on the office terrace and as trends started showing a clear win for the party, its leaders addressed the hundreds of volunteers, who had gathered at the office by 12 p.m. A 28-year-old AAP volunteer since 2012, Babita from Madanpur Kadar JJ Colony said the party won only on the basis of the work done. “My two daughters are studying in the ‘school of excellence’ run by the Delhi government in our slum,” Ms. Babita, an Anganwadi worker, said.

Many AAP supporters were dancing to the tune of “lage raho Kejriwal” — AAP’s election song — with party’s flags and brooms in their hands.

CM addresses volunteers

Amid loud cheers of AAP supporters, party convener Arvind Kejriwal addressed the volunteers at 3.30 p.m. from the terrace before leaving for Hanuman Temple in Connaught Place at 5 p.m.

At 6 p.m. on Monday, 34-year-old Meenakshi Tomar put her one-year-old son Avyaan Tomar to bed early only to wake him up in the small hours of Tuesday. Ms. Tomar drew Avyaan a moustache using kajal and made him wear a black muffler, a pair of spectacles without glasses and an AAP topi.

The Tomars left their Mayur Vihar house at 5 a.m. for Chief Minister’s residence in Civil Lines. From there, they headed towards the party office at ITO. People gathered inside the office premises started addressing the toddler as “chotta [young] Kejriwal” and he soon became the centre of attraction with many queuing up to click selfies with him as he played with balloons. “Our daughter had dressed up as little Kejriwal when the AAP national convener [Arvind Kejriwal] had won the election in 2015,” the toddler’s father Rahul told The Hindu. “We are using the same muffler for our son,” he added.

“It is up to them to decide what to become but if my children can do 10% of the social work that Kejriwal does, then it will be great. I will be happy,” Mr. Tomar said.

When asked about the idea behind dressing up his children as Kejriwal, he said: “When they understand that their parents have a role model, then they will also be interested in it.” By 4 p.m., Avyaan, was tired and started crying. His mother said: “The security guards had told us that ‘sir [CM] wants to meet him’ and we are waiting for it. My son is very tired and will now start crying.”

The Delhi High Court was on Tuesday informed by Twitter that the petition by senior advocate Sanjay Hegde in relation to the suspension of his Twitter account was not maintainable.

Senior advocate Sajan Poovayya, appearing for Twitter, sought time to submit its response on the issue.

Justice Navin Chawla allowed Twitter to submit its note within two weeks and listed the case for further hearing on March 27.

In an interim relief, senior advocate Jaideep Gupta, representing Mr. Hegde, urged that the Twitter account data of his client must not be deleted. The High Court did not pass any formal order, but said the data should not be deleted, if it hasn’t been done so already.

Earlier, the Centre had clarified that it had not directed the suspension of Mr. Hegde’s Twitter account. The Centre also said it was “neither a necessary nor a proper party to this proceedings”.

The response of the Ministry of Electronic and Information Technology came on a petition filed by Mr. Hegde to frame guidelines for censorship on social media strictly in accordance with the provision of the Constitution.

Twitter had, in October last year, suspended the senior advocate’s account over the use of an image of August Landmesser on his page referring it as “hateful imagery” and violation of the company’s rules.

311,2020/02/12,Gargi College students boycott classes for second day,"Fact-finding committee formed to investigate events that unfolded during festival

Students of Gargi College staged a strike and boycotted classes on Tuesday in protest against the February 6 incident when they were allegedly harassed and sexually assaulted on campus during a college festival.

Several students and teachers from different departments held a meeting on Tuesday to constitute a fact-finding committee. They also demanded that an Internal Complaints Committee be set up in the college.

Ashna, a final-year student, said, “A general body meeting [of students and teachers] was held to constitute a committee which would investigate the events prior to the fest, events which happened during the fest and specific complaints against the college administration.”

The committee will submit its final report by February 15, she added.

“One student and a faculty member from each of the 17 departments were elected to the committee. We want a fair investigation and the committee will look into all aspects before submitting the report,” said Ms. Ashna.

Festival budget

The students also asked the administration to provide a breakdown of the budget of the festival, with an emphasis on the funds allocated for security. They said the strike would continue on Wednesday as well.

Several students recounted events which unfolded after a group of men entered the campus and began molesting and harassing them.

Preeti, another student, said, “We want safer educational spaces. Look at what happened in Jawaharlal Nehru University and Jamia Millia Islamia and now on our campus. When the principal was approached, she said that if we don’t feel safe we should not attend the fest. How can one turn the tables on students?

312,2020/02/12,Country’s largest ice-cream unit to come up in Sangareddy,"Global companies keen to invest in State, says KTR

India’s largest ice-cream manufacturing facility will come up in Sangareddy district with Hatsun Agro Product Limited likely to commence its commercial operations from October 2020.

Hatsun will be setting up its unit with a capital investment of ₹207 crore and create more than 250 direct and 250 indirect employment opportunities.

The unit will also benefit more than 4,000 dairy farmers in the region, said IT Minister K.T. Rama Rao.

Mr. Rao, who held a review meeting with the HoDs of IT and Industries departments at the MCRHRD on Wednesday, said many global companies are keen on making major investments in Telangana.

In the meeting, Mr. Rao said that major companies from the food processing sector are keen to invest in Telangana and the announcements of the same will be made soon.

The government will provide complete assistance to the companies which are willing to invest, he said.

Mr. Rao instructed the officials to make plans towards decentralising the IT sector in Hyderabad to ensure its growth is spread across the city. He stated that the efforts of the government to boost Information Technology sector in the tier-II cities of the State are yielding good results.

Karimnagar IT Tower will be inaugurated on February 18 while the Telangana government’s prototyping facility T-Works and T-Hub Phase 2 are also getting ready for inaugural, he said.

Meanwhile, Mr. Rao in a tweet today said that Quadrant Resource is laying foundation for its IT development centre in Warangal on February 16.

313,2020/02/12,Privacy concerns raised over police’s announcement,"Public urged to upload documents of domestic helps on HawkEye app as safety measure

An announcement over a public address system at the Gachibowli crossroads requesting people to upload on HawkEye app the documents, including Aadhaar details, of domestic helps as a part of safety measures raised concerns over privacy and consent.

The issue was brought to light on Wednesday by independent researcher Srinivas Kodali who, on Twitter, said that a recorded message was being played at traffic signals. He pointed out that while privacy remains an issue, data being uploaded on the police-run app is akin to crowd-sourcing information.

Speaking to The Hindu, Mr Kodali said that a large number of domestic helps are unaware of the concept of digital consent and privacy. He said that not informing them that their data is being uploaded could bring these domestic help under the ambit of surveillance.

“The employers are collecting this data and are sharing with a third party. This essentially puts every working person in the city into default surveillance and the assumption of “poor people will steal” is problematic. This is against their fundamental right to privacy and the police cannot collect this data without a law dealing with it,” he said and claimed that there is no criminal code procedure which provides for this exercise.

On the other hand, police maintain that the move is only for the safety of employers from unscrupulous elements. They pointed out that the Kokapet incident reported last month in which a family was allegedly drugged by a domestic help and robbed of valuables is one of the reasons why employers were being encouraged to upload details on the app.

“It is not only Aadhaar details. We are suggesting that any ID document be uploaded. This is only for the safety of residents as you know what happened in Kokapet. We always encourage employers to check the details of domestic helps. This is only a part of sensitisation. The data uploaded on the HawkEye app is absolutely safe and secure,” Madhapur Deputy Commissiner of Police A Venkateshwar Rao said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/privacy-concerns-raised-over-polices-announcement/article30804119.ece
314,2020/02/12,2.5 kg gold seized,"In three cases, officials of the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence detained eight persons who were trying to smuggle large quantities of foreign-origin gold at Hyderabad and Mumbai airports. They seized 2.5 kg of gold, which was concealed in a juicer, hammer, and in the form of paste. In the first case, a passenger from Dubai who was carrying a suitcase and two others from Jaipur were intercepted at the exit gate of RGI Airport. The passenger who arrived from Dubai was handing over his suitcase to the domestic passengers when the officers intercepted them, DRI officials said.

“Examination of the suitcase revealed that it contained a tool kit, including a hammer. Concealed deeply inside the metal head of the hammer were two pieces of gold weighing 931 grams valued Rs. 39 lakh,” they said.

On specific intelligence that the same modus operandi was being used to smuggle gold into the country from Mumbai, the officers here passed on the information to Customs officers at Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport. “In a similar manner, a passenger who arrived from Dubai was handing over the suitcase to two persons who travelled from Jaipur. All three were detained and Customs officials found 931 grams of gold concealed inside the hammer,” the officer said.

In another case, they arrested two persons who arrived from Dubai. The accused were carrying 550 grams of gold paste and 160 grams of a gold rod, which was concealed in a juicer motor. “We have extracted 490 grams of gold from 550 grams of paste,” they said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/25-kg-gold-seized/article30804114.ece
315,2020/02/12,Infant dies under suspicious circumstances,"Parents and brother develop adverse health condition after having food

A one-year-eleven-month-old boy died under suspicious circumstances at Begumpet here on Tuesday morning. The infant, his brother and parents developed adverse health reactions after four to nine hours of having food at a star hotel they were staying in. Apart from this possibility, Begumpet Police said that they are investigating from all angles such as, if they had food at any other place, or some other reason that led to the infant’s death.

Viscera samples collected from the infant’s body were sent to Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL). Chemical analysis will help to know if there is any poisonous substance.

Visa processing

Ravi Narayana and Sri Vidya, who are natives of Khammam, work as software engineers in Bengaluru. Apart from the infant, the couple have a seven-year-old son. They came to Hyderabad on Monday morning to process work related to VISA stamping at US Consulate in Begumpet. The family members checked into a star hotel in the same locality.

Begumpet Police inspector P Srinivasa Rao said that the family had breakfast, lunch and dinner at the hotel on Monday. For dinner, they had Indian sorted bread and paneer curry. However, they went out in the evening. The Police are trying to find out if they had food or snacks outside the hotel.

“Mr Narayana started to vomit at around 1 a.m. on Tuesday. As he felt uneasy, he went for a check-up at KIMS Hospitals. Family members told police that all of them experienced same adverse reaction later. When he was at the hospital, Mr Narayana received a call that his younger son’s body turned cold,” Mr Rao said.

The infant was immediately rushed to the corporate hospital where he was declared brought dead. Police collected food samples from the star hotel, material from the vomiting, the couple’s blood samples. They spoke to people who had the same dinner and found that their condition was stable.

The infant boy’s post-mortem examination (PME) was performed at Gandhi Hospital’s mortuary on Wednesday. Police have registered a case under Section 174 (Suspicious death) of CrPC.

Dr Praveen Kumar Kulkarni, Consultant Internal Medicine at the corporate hospital who attended to the couple said that they were treated in medical stepdown unit as their condition did not require treatment in ICU or general ward. Condition of the remaining three family members was clinically stabilised. “The couple were discharged but need follow-up treatment,” he said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/infant-dies-under-suspicious-circumstances/article30804110.ece

317,2020/02/12,Jawahar Nagar dump locked for a brief while,"Local civic officials lock gates over property tax dues; issue resolved after talks

Default in payment of property tax for the last one year has led to shutdown of day-to-day operations for a brief while at the Solid Waste Management (SWM) facility in Jawahar Nagar landfill here on Wednesday.

Unbearable stench

Officials from the Jawahar Nagar Corporation locked down the entry gates into the facility for more than an hour during the day, which resulted in piling up of garbage trucks outside for close to a kilometre or two. This has affected timely garbage clearance in the city, and people from surrounding localities of the dump yard had to put up with stench emanating from the stranded trucks.

Though the SWM facility is being managed by Ramky Enviro Engineers Limited, property tax for the same was being paid by GHMC till a year ago, which, officials claimed, was as per the concessionaire agreement signed over a decade ago. The agreement signed by GHMC bestowed, among several other sops, waiver of property tax, on the concessionaire firm, though the site did not fall within the corporation’s jurisdiction.

Jawahar Nagar, a village panchayat when the agreement was signed, was later made a Nagar Panchayat, and since 2019, it has been a corporation. GHMC has stopped payment of property tax for the dump yard since it has been announced a corporation.The amount accruing towards the tax amounted to about ₹1.5 crore to ₹1.6 crore for a year, officials informed. Up till now for the current financial year, the amount due is over ₹1.36 crore.

“When Jawahar Nagar was a Nagar Panchayat, GHMC paid property tax regularly, as it was under a different department. Now that it has come into the purview of Municipal Administration and Urban Development, we have stopped payment of tax, and written to the government asking for waiver of the same. Jawahar Nagar corporation officials have locked down the gates for a brief while over the default in payment for the first quarter of the year, but we quickly resolved the issue through talks,” an official from GHMC clarified.

Jawahar Nagar landfill receives solid waste not only from the city, but also from several other corporations, and a letter will be addressed to the government seeking waiver of the tax on this ground too, officials informed.

Garbage from Jawahar Nagar too is sent to the dump yard, as also from the Secunderabad Cantonment Board, Bandlaguda, Nagaram, Badangpet, Nizampet, Dammaiguda, Thumkunta, Kompally, Dundigal, Medchal, Peeramcheruvu, Meerpet, Jillelaguda, and Manikonda.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/qw15xy/article30804097.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY13DUMPYARD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/jawahar-nagar-dump-locked-for-a-brief-while/article30804098.ece

319,2020/02/12,"Dr. Reddy’s acquiring Wockhardt’s domestic branded business for ₹ 1,850 crore","A portfolio of 62 brands in multiple therapy areas, Baddi plant figure in the deal

Pharma major Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories is acquiring select divisions of Wockhardt’s branded generics business in India and a few other international territories of Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and Maldives for a consideration of ₹ 1,850 crore ($260 million).

Besides a portfolio of 62 brands in multiple therapy areas such as respiratory, neurology, VMS, dermatology, gastroenterology, pain and vaccines, the transaction involved transfer of Wockhardt’s related sales and marketing teams, manufacturing plant in Baddi, Himachal Pradesh including all its employees to Dr.Reddy’s.

The business undertaking is being transferred on a slump sale basis. The transaction is expected to be closed in the first quarter of 2020-21, the Hyderabad-headquartered drugmaker said.

Acquisition aids scaling up

Co-Chairman and Managing Director of Dr. Reddy’s G.V.Prasad said India is an important market for the company and the acquisition would help in considerably scaling-up its domestic business. “The acquired portfolio shall enhance Dr. Reddy’s presence in the high growth therapy areas with market leading brands such as Practin, Zedex, Bro-zedex, Tryptomer and Biovac. We believe the portfolio holds a lot of potential and will get an impetus under Dr. Reddy’s,” he said.

Wockhardt, whose Board of Directors on Wednesday approved the sale, said the business being transferred report revenue from operation of around ₹ 377 crore or about 15 per cent of the consolidated revenue of nine months ended December 2019.

Strategic shift and liquidity

“The intended sale of business portfolio is in line with the company’s strategic plan to shift from acute therapeutic areas to more chronic business like anti-diabetes and central nervous system (CNS) and also to its niche antibiotic portfolio of NCEs (new chemical entities). The divestment will also ensure adequate liquidity to bring in robust growth in the chronic domestic branded business, international operations, investments in biosimilars for the U.S. market apart from the company's global clinical trials of Break-through Anti-lnfectives and R&D activities,” said Dr. Habil Khorakiwala, Founder Chairman, Wockhardt Group.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/dr-reddys-to-acquire-wockhardts-domestic-branded-business/article30800048.ece
320,2020/02/12,Heroic effort by police to foil doctor’s suicide,"Police Commissioner announces ₹10,000 reward for team

Gandhi Hospital, on Tuesday, witnessed a dramatic rescue effort by policemen who did their best to prevent a doctor from committing suicide. The rescue plan, charted on the spot by police, was executed with ‘surgical’ precision.

Before jumping into action, the policemen knew that just a spark near the petrol bottles, tucked under CAS G. Vasanth Kumar’s shirt, would severely burn all of them in seconds.

A few hours before the rescue, Chilkalguda inspector A.C. Balagangi Reddy pointed to the doctor’s shirt and said that he was reeking of petrol. Dr. Kumar reached the hospital with four bottles of petrol tucked under his shirt and a lighter in his right hand. Though Mr. Reddy tried to reason, the CAS asked him to stay away.

During these attempts to pacify him, a plan was conceived. Mr. Reddy asked some reporters to surround him and a few others to hold their mikes a little away from the doctor.

“On the pretext of shoving away the mikes close to him, I walked towards him,” he said. Prior to this, fire-fighters and an ambulance were on standby. “We kept four buckets of water ready. Besides, two personnel with foam guns stood on two ends,” the Chilkalguda inspector said.

As Dr. Kumar turned his head to his left, Mr. Reddy pounced on him from the right, pulled his hand and took the lighter.

By then, some sub-inspectors and constables also jumped on him and held the CAS tightly to remove the petrol bottles by removing his shirt. Simultaneously, foam was sprayed and water poured on him.

322,2020/02/12,Anoushka Shankar and art of healing,"The musician on finding catharsis in vulnerability, music and her latest EP Love Letters

Sitar virtuoso Anoushka Shankar’s latest EP Love Letters opens with ‘Bright Eyes’, the twang of her sitar hitting a clear and sharp note. It’s a prelude to powerful lyrics sung by German singer-songwriter and producer Alev Lenz: ‘Does she feel younger than me as you’re lying in your bed…’. It’s evident that the song is an attempt at catharsis. The album was written shortly after Shankar’s divorce from filmmaker Joe Wright in 2018, whom she married in 2010. Over six songs, the 38-year-old musician heals from her pain while dealing with desire, heartbreak and loss. In an interview with The Hindu, Shankar expounds on her relationship with vulnerability, music-making and the deliberate decision to collaborate with female artistes.

How did you come to terms with laying your heart on the line for the world?

There is great strength in vulnerability, as it takes courage to push through the fear and share one’s true self with others. In music, that vulnerability really speaks to listeners as it connects with their own hearts. I find it increasingly easier as the years go by, to trust that I can be vulnerable in my music.

How would you describe your musical evolution with the release of the new EP?

On Love Letters I focused exclusively on sung music, creating a collection of songs that directly address heartbreak and its ensuing emotions in a way that instrumental music can only hint at.

I feel Love Letters has been part of a longer journey towards a very simple, international sound in which the sitar is no longer exotic or classical, but simply a tool of expression when juxtaposed with the voice and cross-genre elements.

How did you put together the female force of the album?

Initially, it was a natural process, writing songs with female musician friends I was spending time with, talking about experiences and a woman’s perspective on relationships, motherhood and music. After it started, I began to seek this out more proactively, wanting the collection of songs to feel strongly feminine. Of course there are some wonderful men involved in the project as well, namely my regular percussionist Pirashanna Thevarajah and a couple of brilliant engineers and mixing engineers. I wanted to include women on the technical side as well, and worked with female engineers and mastering engineer, and only had myself and my friend Alev Lenz as producers.

Why did you focus on lyrical music after the shift to record label Mercury KX?

On Love Letters, I focused exclusively on songs with lyrics, creating a collection of songs that directly address heartbreak and its ensuing emotions in a way that instrumental music can only hint at. Love Letters has been part of a longer journey towards a very simple, international sound in which the sitar is no longer exotic or classical, however simply a tool of expression when juxtaposed with the voice and cross-genre elements.

Can you tell us about Love Letters and the journey that it traverses through lyrics?

It’s a collection of love songs and meditations on heartbreak, loss, and rising through pain. ‘Lovable’ featuring Ibeyi was the first single I released from. It was followed by ‘Those Words’ and also ‘Bright Eyes’ and ‘In This Mouth,’ both featuring Alev Lenz. The EP also contains two further songs featuring Alev, called ‘Wallet’ and ‘Space.’ A lot of the songs on Love Letters were written whilst my marriage ended. It is not all entirely biographical. It’s more that the process of a relationship ending, inspired me to write some sad, introverted or contemplative songs, as is so common for musicians!

It’s a different layer of personal for me to be sharing music that's been influenced so directly from my own romantic experiences. I have written from a personal place before. A lot of songs to do with my father's passing on – ‘Traces Of You’, for example – or the experience of being pregnant, becoming a mother, on ‘Traveller’ and so on. So it’s not that I haven’t been personal before. But I’ve kept romance sort of slightly separate. And yet, this time, it just felt like, ‘No, these are huge, big, bright experiences,’ and I needed to dive into them musically as well. And it’s not to say that the songs are directly influenced at all times by my own experiences. But it was because of my experiences that I [needed] to look at this entire topic.

You took your time releasing the songs on Love Letters. Is this marketing strategy something you involve yourself with?

I’m very involved in the process of how I share my music with listeners. I wanted to drop a song at a time because of the personal nature of the songs, as it felt like more of a gentle process. It was less of a marketing strategy and more of a natural fit for this collection of songs.

323,2020/02/12,Telugu RJs keep up the momentum,"World Radio Day 2020 is on February 13, and we place a spotlight on young Telugu RJs

For many of us, tuning into the radio for that specific morning segment or afternoon prank call show offers a bit of charm to our routine. In this digital age of disconnect, radio has timelessly connected us all, largely because of the RJs whose upkeep in energy is worth a double take. But it is Hyderabad radio and its relationship with Telugu language which stays tried and true, and there are a few Telugu RJs who are known for their punchy attitude and personable rapport with listeners.

Take Priyanka Boska. While she was pursuing her Masters degree, she simply fell into radio. She had been doing a couple of part-time gigs in Hindi for All India Radio FM Rainbow but one day, when a regular did not turn up, she was asked to fill in. She told her colleagues that she only spoke in Telangana dialect but that was no deterrent; she was pushed into the studio.

The three-hour show turned out to be a hit; the Telangana Telugu she had been hesitant about became the very thing she is now known for. nine years on.

Priyanka, now 31 and a popular RJ at Red FM, is considered a rarity in the RJ industry for being trilingual. “Indian people are multi-lingual and we have so many cultures in Hyderabad, which makes it a mini-India. I have to include my Hindi-speaking and Telugu-speaking audiences and I do pop in some English. I speak to people as I would want them to speak to me. That’s why trilingual works for me, and I’m proud to say that I’m a rarity.” She respects the work of All India Radio for catering to the diversity of India and for offering her the springboard that catapulted her into RJ fame.

But the best part of her job? Connecting with her listeners in the city. “Being Hyderabadi, talking to Hyderabadis is amazing. There are people who come from different places like Vijayawada, but, being born and brought up here, you cannot take that connection away from me. So I don’t have to act or settle in or anything; it’s just in me.”

Great misconceptions

The same goes for DJ Grace Naomi Paul, whose chirpy voice you may recall from BIG FM. She explains the industry is not what a lot of people assume, adding, “Working in fast-paced live media means a lot of work ethic is required; it is what drives the industry. Plus being on Instagram opens up that visual aid to radio... but only sometimes.”

RJ Grace

Additionally Priyanka points out, “I think RJs don’t get enough credit for the innovation we have to pump into our content and our delivery. People often think that RJs sit around the studio and ramble, but we actually do a lot of preparation. We cannot afford to sound like fools on air. I cannot miss anything that is happening in the city — from the traffic jams to the President visiting.”

As digital platforms multiply tenfold, one can only ask about he future of regional radio. Priyanka, loyal to her language and her medium, concludes, “Telugu radio should never be shrinking; there are many radio shows in the US or the UK (who’ve offered me air time, too) who have loyal listeners. So the industry is alive around the world.”",music,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/w37uwg/article30800645.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy13-priyanka,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/world-radio-day-2020-is-on-february-13-and-we-place-a-spotlight-on-young-telugu-rjs/article30800646.ece
324,2020/02/12,‘We are stoked’: Californian rock band Chon comes to India,"While Chon have had decent success in the decade that they’ve been active, it takes serious funds to make an international tour happen for any band

From dogs skateboarding to breathtaking footage of nature in bloom, Californian rock band Chon’s sonic and visual aesthetic is mostly about being laidback. Borrowing from progressive rock, math-rock and even a bit of jazz and funk, the band’s guitarist Mario Camarena says that their live shows, however, are likely to have mosh pits and crowdsurfing.

Ahead of their India debut tour – which includes a stop in Bengaluru on February 11 at Fandom at Gilly’s Redefined – Camarena says over the phone, “Live, it is a little different. We play really loud. I think that is something that you notice more live. Like, when you can really feel the bass and the kick drum, and you hear how hard we are playing. I think you just get a feel for the energy we give out a little better live. And I think that translates to the crowd and that is why they want to go crazy too.”

Although there is barely any singing in Chon’s hypermelodic discography, Mario does like to have a mic in front of him just to get the crowd going. “We always call out the crowd. I love asking the crowd to mosh, crowdsurf and all that stuff. We started doing that as soon as we started playing shows. I think it just kind of caught on and our fans just started to know, oh, you go to a Chon show, you can go crazy.”

Mario was on the phone from Kyoto, where Chon – completed by bassist Esiah Camarena, drummer Nathan Camarena and guitarist Erick Hansel – have just kicked off their Asia/Australia tour. Mario says about Japan, “We kind of feel at home here by now. Every time we come, we have friends with us who have either lived here or just know their way around, which is pretty nice. So it is nothing too crazy.” In addition to India, they are also making their début in Thailand and New Zealand this month, bringing their trippy, intricate and groovy rock sound to new audiences.

While Chon have had decent success in the decade that they’ve been active, it takes serious funds to make an international tour happen for any band with a niche following. Mario says the band realised early on how things like merchandise sales would be a big help and it is something they focus on.

The guitarist recalls, “When we started out making merchandise in the U.S., we honestly didn't know what to expect from our first tour. We had guarantees from the shows, but we had no idea what merch sales would be like on our first tour. We sold out really fast. And we are like, ‘Okay, this is actually a huge deal’. This is how bands make money.”

From “crystal peach” T-shirts to tie-dye designs and bright striped tops and a lot of solid colours which go beyond the usual spectrum of black, Chon certainly put a lot of effort and time into their design and collaborations with other artists.

The merch also evokes an easygoing aesthetic, much like their music. While it might be understandably tricky to nail all the melodies and lock in to time signatures, Mario says the band loves to throw in little intricacies – a melody that gets stretched or a harmony going into overdrive – to keep things fun for themselves as instrumentalists. He uses the example of a song like ‘Bubble Dream’ saying, “The best possible thing you can do is to try to make yourself laugh or try to make your friend laugh, who is next to you. Something like that takes a lot of pressure off, plus you end up making just as cool stuff.”

The setlist will likely include ‘Bubble Dream’, songs off their albums Grow and Homey, plus their 2019 self-titled record. Mario adds about their India trip, “I am stoked to play.

325,2020/02/12,‘Bengaluru has an educated audience for indie music’: Folk Masti founder Vipul Panchal,"Mumbai folk rock band Folk Masti visited Bengaluru for the second time, performing a couple of intimate shows via community organizers Motojojo.

At their recently hosted set of shows in the city, Mumbai folk rock band Folk Masti made the most of a small room, like they have always done. Formed in 2014, the trio have performed across India and visited Bengaluru for the second time, performing a couple of intimate shows via community organizers Motojojo.

Founder, vocalist and guitarist Vipul Panchal says, “Both were amazing gigs. We love the audience here, because people listen to your words and the music parts, they enjoy each beat. Overall, I can say there is an educated audience here for indie music.” It was in April last year that Folk Masti were last in the city, performing at the erstwhile club venue Bflat. Panchal recalls there were around 45 people, which was heartening to see for their first time. He adds, “Unfortunately due to licensing issues, lots of venue are shut. The government should think on it so that our art can survive, as Bangalore has amazing independent artists and bands.”

Whilst in Bengaluru, Folk Masti also visited the region’s favourite troubadour Raghu Dixit and gave him a copy of their debut album Jadoo Ki Chhadi, which was released last month. Panchal recounts how Dixit joked about the band’s efforts to crowdfund the album, while he was toiling away and investing his own money. “He is so down to earth as an artist, he is one of our favourites. Appreciation coming from him is cannot be expressed in words,” Panchal says.

The album brings together playful country, pop, acoustic folk and rock across languages including Hindi, Gujarati and a bit of English. Live staples such as ‘Rundunana Re’ and ‘Life Is Crazy’ are likely to bring smiles to any listener’s face, heaping up feel-good melodies and simple, sing-along lyrics about life, modernity, devotion and the importance of music. The instrumentation ranges from Puneri dhol beats to ukulele and banjo, plus the regular rock offering of guitars along with a few electronic flourishes. Panchal says, “You can hear the vibe of Latin, folk, country, rock, fusion and pop in the album.”

Jadoo Ki Chhadi was in fact partly funded via Crowdera, on which they raised over ₹1.7 lakh of their intended goal of ₹ 4.5 lakh. It wasn’t entirely fulfilled. Panchal says it was a difficult prospect and that meant the band “had to suffer a lot” but he is still happy that crowdfunding gave them fans who are now invested in the band monetarily.

“Some people asked why we aren’t taking a loan from the bank and meeting our costs for the project. We could get the loan but we wouldn’t get those 104 people’s support. They have contributed to us so now they are part of our band’s family. They would be interested in what the band is doing and new music coming up,” Panchal explains.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/7nxios/article30795740.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12bgm-FolkMasti2jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/bengaluru-has-an-educated-audience-for-indie-music-folk-masti-founder-vipul-panchal/article30795741.ece
326,2020/02/12,An art entrepreneur,"Manjula, founder of Arunodaya Kala Tanda, spoke about her journey as a theatre artiste, who challenged casteism and patriarchy

Theatre personality Manjula’s performance left the audience spellbound as she sang about the power of women’s unity at the Network of Women in Media, India’s 15th National meeting at Indian Social Institute, Benson Town.

Manjula was one of the panellists at the discussion on Culture and the Arts in Times of Trouble. She spoke in Kannada, translated into English by Vasanthi Hariprakash, traced her journey in performance arts and the founding of her group, Arunodaya Kala Tanda.

“I was born into a poor family and I was married into a poor family too. I am now a mother of two.When I got into beedi nataka (street theatre), I constructed plays around issues of casteism and alcoholism.” The year 1998 was a defining one for her. “I launched into performing many of different kinds of plays. I did wonder about my talent for theatre. But I kept getting invitations to perform these plays.”

She continued to pursue theatre despite many struggles including the death of some of her loved ones.

In 2004, Manjula made a re-entry into street performances. “My father influenced me. He would take me from village to village on his cycle to watch street plays.”

Manjula has performed in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Maharashtra, which gave her a lot of confidence as a performer. “I was then asked why are you performing under so many banners, why not start something of your own? So I started Arunodaya. From a janapada, pouranika, beedi nataka performer I became an art entrepreneur.”

She spoke about the opposition she received from male artistes. “They would ask why is a woman doing this?’ But it only strengthened my resolve. In my own place in Mandya, casteism is prevalent. So I got 18 to 20 women together under a banner, they performed in Mandya. Along the way, I have been helped by many people, including women and the dalit community.”

She is happy that more women are performing. Manjula said when they perform in auditoriums, they are accorded respect. “However, it is not the same case when women perform on the streets. They sometimes face difficult challenges.” However, Manjula contends that the government has realised how powerful street theatre is.",theatre,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/eal7lv/article30799887.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12bgmmanjularondaya2JPG,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/an-art-entrepreneur/article30799888.ece

329,2020/02/12,"Follow the truth, MT’s advice to budding journalists","‘Those who join the profession should be committed to their times and society’

There may not be many similarities between ex-scientist Nambi Narayanan and actor-filmmaker Madhu. But both were victims of falsehood masquerading as news.

Highlighting their experiences, writer M.T. Vasudevan Nair said here on Wednesday that journalists should not compromise on their commitment to and search for truth. He was delivering a lecture after giving away certificates and awards to students of the Institute of Communication and Journalism attached to the Calicut Press Club.

“It is easy to create a non-existent news that could erupt a storm and lead to even a riot. We have had many such experiences…,” M.T. said.

“At the peak of the spy scandal, many mainstream newspapers carried news stories claiming that atomic energy was being loaded in barrels and illegally smuggled through sea into another country. Mr. Narayanan was portrayed as its mastermind,” the writer said.

Quoting from Mr. Narayanan’s autobiography, M.T. said that the scientist had even thought of committing suicide unable to withstand the slander. “...It was his daughter who prompted him to fight back and prove his innocence,” M.T. said.

Mr. Madhu too had somewhat similar an experience when a labourer at his home was found missing.

“A small newspaper in the State capital had carried a story insinuating some foul play. Big newspapers picked it up and Mr. Madhu had to flee with his family to Madras. Later, it was revealed that the boy had gone to Kallai near Kozhikode, his village,” M.T. pointed out. The writer pointed out that no media organisation bothered to carry follow-ups on controversial stories even if the stories turned out to be wrong. He also cited instances where even small fights involving children were blown out of proportions and snowballed into caste and communal riots.

“Journalism is not an ordinary job. It is a search for truth. Those who join the profession should be committed to their times and society. They should have a ‘third eye’ to see beyond the normal and convey it to the readers and viewers. Then only their work will be fruitful,” M.T. said.

Journalists should also use good language as they were also responsible for the nourishment of languages, he added.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/ptur18/article30803788.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13CTDINA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/follow-the-truth-mts-advice-to-budding-journalists/article30803789.ece
330,2020/02/12,Kudumbashree Fresh Bags a hit,"Demand on the rise following ban on single-use plastic in State

With the demand for cloth bags increasing following the ban on single-use plastic in the State, the Kozhikode Corporation Kudumbashree’s Fresh Bags have become a hit.

The Fresh Bags’ brand was launched just weeks ago with 150 stitching units, two per ward, joining hands under the Kudumbashree. At present, 700 tailors across the city are involved in making quality cloth bags made of pure cotton, in various sizes to suit the requirements of business outlets.

Cloths are supplied to tailors who then stitch the bags and give them to the collection centre set up at the basement of Mahila Mall, from where they are distributed as per demand.

The bags come in three different sizes and the price ranges from ₹10 to ₹18 per bag. “We have demand for bigger bags, which can be met eventually,” Kudumbashree Project Officer of the Corporation T.K. Prakashan said. A tailor gets ₹3 per bag as stitching charge.

However, the future of Fresh Bags largely depends on the availability of the cloth used for stitching the bags. “We are sourcing the material from a Thrissur-based firm and currently there is a severe shortage because of the huge demand across the State. We now need to source it from elsewhere,” Mr. Prakashan said. The official also sought government subsidy for the venture.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/bxfiev/article30803774.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11KI-BAGS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/kudumbashree-fresh-bags-a-hit/article30803775.ece
331,2020/02/12,Activists demand for withdrawal of UAPA cases,"MADURAI

A group of activists have demanded repeal of “the draconian” Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) which, they said, is being misused by the government to silence voices of social activists throughout the country. They also pressed for withdrawal of “false cases foisted against social activists under the UAPA”.

Addressing mediapersons here on Wednesday, R. Murali, national secretary of People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL), elaborated on how five persons were falsely booked under the UAPA for raising slogans during the funeral of Manivasagam, one of the four Maoists killed by Thunderbolt, a special force of Kerala police, in October last year.

“The body of Manivasagam was transported from Kerala to Salem for the last rites to be performed by his sister Lakshmi. Manivasagam’s wife Kala and his other sister Chandra, who were already booked under the UAPA, performed the last rites after the Madurai Bench of Madras High Court granted them parole,” he said.

However, 64 days after the funeral, Lakshmi, along with her husband and son, was booked under the UAPA. Also, a fresh case under the Act was booked against Kala and Chandra. “This time, a Village Administrative Officer booked the case against these people under the UAPA for raising slogans during the funeral. A VAO is not even authorised to book a case,” he said.

Activists from other social organisations, including People’s Rights Protection Centre, demanded the immediate withdrawal of cases slapped against them.

They also said that more than 4,000 people had been booked under the UAPA throughout the country in the last two years under the BJP government.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/activists-demand-for-withdrawal-of-uapa-cases-madurai/article30804219.ece

Taking cognisance of the submissions made in the case, Justice Pushpa Sathyanarayana reserved the orders. Only after the court’s intervention the death certificate of the woman was issued. The court was hearing the petition filed by S. Manimuthu, husband of the deceased woman, M. Sakthikali, who sought a compensation of ₹10 lakh for the medical negligence.

In his petition, Mr. Manimuthu said his wife was admitted to K. Pudur UPHC for her first delivery. The duty doctor had assured a normal delivery following a check-up and left the clinic.

Within minutes, his wife experienced labour pain, he said. However, there was no one to attend to her for hours together, except a nurse. A commotion ensued at the UPHC as the staff were unable to deal with the situation, and there was a delay in referring his wife to Government Rajaji Hospital.

Earlier, the court had directed the Dean to constitute a committee of medical experts to examine the woman and see if the pregnancy could be terminated. The woman was currently undergoing treatment at the hospital.

The mother of the woman with special needs had moved the High Court Bench seeking a direction to terminate the pregnancy of her daughter, who was sexually assaulted by their neighbour.

334,2020/02/12,"‘Healthy diet, right mental attitude will beat exam stress’","Experts advise proper planning, preparation, intake of more water, fruits, vegetables, good sleep and regular breaks from studies

MADURAI

It is the time of the year when adequate sleep, food and recreation take a back seat for students. With less than a month left for board examinations, anxiety and fear become more pronounced for them. But, following a healthy diet and adopting the right mental approach towards examinations can make the period less stressful, say doctors and mental health counsellors.

Preparation is the key, says Suresh Kumar Murugesan, Professor, Department of Psychology, The American College. “Proper planning and preparation can help in reducing stress levels. Prepare a timetable suitable for each student and ensure that the last 15 days are utilised for revising subjects,” he says.

During this period, students must follow a balanced diet and drink plenty of water, says D. Mouna, Assistant Professor, Research Centre of Home Science, Fatima College. “Students must take more vegetables and fruits in the form of juices or salads. It is advisable to have home-cooked food. Students must also avoid fast food and carbonated drinks,” she says.

Students must never skip breakfast, she says, adding: “Having scrambled or boiled eggs, fruits or porridge will also be good options for a healthy breakfast.”

While six to eight hours of sleep is medically recommended for students, the pattern varies from student to student according to their biological set-up, says J. Sangumani, Dean, Government Rajaji Hospital. “It is also essential to take regular breaks from studies. Listen to music, perform yoga, exercise or play games. Even watching television for some time is not a bad option,” he says.

“A certain amount of stress is good. But, excessive stress will diminish their capacity, cognition and lead to poor performance,” he adds.

The most important aspect is to have a positive mental attitude towards examinations, says G. Gurubharathy, Principal, M.S. Chellamuthu Institute of Mental Health and Rehabilitation. “Examination must be seen as a way to assess a student’s understanding of a particular subject. It must not be seen as a measure to define the capabilities of any student,” he says.

Parents must encourage students to focus on preparation, rather than on results, he says. “Parents must understand that marks don’t guarantee success of their children in their lives. So, they must motivate their children to give their best and not to worry about the outcome. This will help in reducing the anxiety and stress levels of students,” he says.

Lakshmi Vijayakumar, psychiatrist and founder of SNEHA, says students must not compare them with others as it only leads to anxiety. “Students must understand that examination is just one aspect in life. Also, a person who can handle stress and failure in an effective manner can be successful in life,” she says.

Assistance for overcoming stress is available on the State’s health helpline 104 and Sneha’s helpline 044-24640050.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/healthy-diet-right-mental-attitude-will-beat-exam-stress-madurai/article30802735.ece
335,2020/02/12,Woman seeks compensation for medical negligence,"She also demands action against those responsible

MADURAI

A 22-year-old woman from Uchipuli in Ramanathapuram district, who had a broken part of a surgical needle left inside her body during her delivery, moved the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Wednesday, seeking appropriate compensation from the State for medical negligence.

In her petition, the woman, K. Ramya, said the broken part of the needle was left inside her body after an episiotomy (surgical incision made at the opening of the vagina during childbirth to prevent rupture of tissues) was done on her at the time of delivery.

She said that after her pregnancy was confirmed she periodically visited Uchipuli Primary Healthcare Centre and on November 19 last year she delivered a baby girl. The delivery was normal after the staff nurses at the PHC conducted the episiotomy procedure, she said.

Ms. Ramya said soon she experienced continuous pain and bleeding. It was only after a couple of hours that doctors attended to her and even at that time the staff did not disclose that a needle was left inside her body, she said.

It was only the next day that the doctors at the PHC referred her to Ramanathapuram Government Headquarters Hospital. An X-ray report revealed that a broken needle was left inside her body and she was in turn referred to Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) in Madurai.

The needle was removed through a surgery at the GRH on November 21. She said she was put to much hardship due to the medical negligence. Beside appropriate compensation, she sought appropriate action against those responsible for the medical negligence.

Hearing the plea, Justice Pushpa Sathyanarayana sought a counter from the State and adjourned the hearing by two weeks. The State submitted that departmental action was ordered against the staff attached to the PHC who were involved in the incident.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/woman-seeks-compensation-for-medical-negligence-madurai-high-court-ramanathapuram/article30802402.ece

The Mahila Court here on Wednesday awarded death sentence to two persons who robbed, sexually assaulted and murdered a primary health centre nurse in Kallidaikurichi in 2008.

According to prosecution, Thamizh Selvi, 38, a widow from Gatevasal Street in Kallidaikurichi, was living alone since her son was studying at a college in Coimbatore. She was found murdered in her house on September 30, 2008. The murderers had strangulated her with a nylon rope after stuffing a towel in her mouth.

The assailants also stole gold ornaments worth ₹1.40 lakh from her house.

Kallidaikurichi police registered a case and a special team was formed to nab the culprits. The post-mortem revealed that the nurse had been sexually assaulted before being murdered.

A police team, led by the then Inspector of Police Ponnusamy, nabbed C. Vasanthakumar alias Ganesh, 32, his friends Rajesh alias Rajesh Kanna, 32, M. Karthik and Mahendran alias Rajendran, all from Kallidaikurichi, in connection with the case.

As the DNA samples collected from the dress of the victim matched with those of Vasanthakumar and Rajesh, the charges levelled against the duo were proved beyond reasonable doubt. However, Karthik and Mahendran were acquitted.

Mahila Court Judge Indrani, who termed the murder a heinous crime as the accused had robbed, raped and murdered the nurse, awarded death sentence to Vasanthakumar and Rajesh besides slapping a fine of ₹10,000 on them each.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/death-sentence-for-two-for-robbery-rape-and-murder-of-nurse-kallidaikurichi-tirunelveli/article30802255.ece

339,2020/02/12,Pandya-era stone block inscription clarifies doubts about rulers,"The stone found in Kariapatti taluk of Virudhunagar district has indicated that Pandya king Jatavarman Kulasekara Pandya co-ruled with his younger brother Maravarman Sundarapandya I up to 1217 CE

An inscription discovered on a stone block in Kanakkanendhal, Kariapatti taluk of Virudhunagar district has indicated that Pandya king Jatavarman Kulasekara Pandya co-ruled with his younger brother Maravarman Sundarapandya I up to 1217 CE. Experts said that this is an important discovery, as according to previous records, Kulasekara Pandya was succeeded by his younger brother Maravarman Sundarapandya I in 1216 CE.

Addressing the media on Wednesday, Madurai Government Museum curator M. Maruthu Pandiyan said that the inscription was recently discovered by a group of scholars headed by D. Thirumalraja, assistant professor from the Department of Sociology, Tamil Nadu Open University. Later, the inscription was copied and deciphered by the curator, B. Asaithambi, archaeological officer, State Archaeological Department. Archaeologist C. Santhalingam also helped in deciphering the inscription.

Reading out the estampage of the inscription, Mr. Pandiyan said that during the 28th regnal year of Kulasekara Pandya, a wetland which raised paddy was donated to a Siva temple in Kalkurichi village of Virudhunagar district. “According to previous records, Kulasekara Pandya ruled between 1190 CE and 1216 CE. But this inscription shows that his ruling period has been increased by one year and shows that he has ruled up to 1217 CE,” he said.

Also, according to earlier records, Maravarma Sundarapandya I succeeded his brother in 1216 CE and ruled till 1238 CE. “But this inscription now proves that Kulasekara Pandya co-ruled with his brother up to 1217 CE. So one can assume that Kulasekara Pandya ruled the Pandya country up to 1217 as a co-ruler with his younger brother Maravarman Sundarapandya I, who was coronated in 1216 CE,” said Mr. Santhalingam.

Refusing to restrain O. Raja, brother of Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam, from continuing as the chairman of the Theni District Cooperative Milk Producers’ Union, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Tuesday dismissed a review application filed in this regard.

A Division Bench of Justices M. Duraiswamy and T. Ravindran dismissed the review application.

Earlier, the High Court Bench had set aside the constitution of an interim Board for the Milk Producers’ Union with Mr. Raja as the chairman. The court directed the Milk Production and Dairy Development Department to pass necessary and appropriate orders for the formation of an interim or regular Board.

The court had said that the Board should be formed in accordance with the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Co-Operative Societies Act, 1983, other related rules and by-laws.

Interim Board formed

A week after the verdict, Mr. Raja took charge as the chairman of the Milk Producers’ Union after an interim Board was constituted.

341,2020/02/12,Scrapping of new pension scheme demanded,"Protesters also condemned freezing of Dearness Allowance (DA) to transport pensioners and delaying of disbursal of their terminal benefits.

Members of Central, State Government and Public Sector Pensioners’ Confederation, Madurai Zone, staged a protest here on Tuesday, demanding scrapping of the New Pension Scheme introduced in 2003 by the Centre.

S. Sampath, State joint secretary, Retired Transport Employees Federation and coordinator of the Pensioners’ Confederation, said the need for scrapping the scheme was apparent as there was lack of clarity from both the Central and the State governments about what the scheme would entail.

He said uniformity of pension across cadre must be implemented at the earliest. “Due to the implementation of different pay commissions over the years, there is a large anomaly between pensioners of the same cadres. It has been successfully corrected in the army after years of struggle, and the same must be done in our case,” he said.

Mr. Sampath said the minimum pension across the board must be fixed at ₹21,000 per month and uniform medical insurance must be provided for pensioners across all sectors. The protesters also condemned freezing of Dearness Allowance (DA) to transport pensioners and delaying of disbursal of their terminal benefits.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/56ziug/article30797935.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA12MDUPENSIONERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/scrapping-of-new-pension-scheme-demanded-madurai/article30795676.ece

345,2020/02/12,"Wenlock surgeons stage protest, later call it off","House surgeons at the Government Wenlock Hospital staged a protest here on Wednesday seeking stipend and later called it off following an assurance by the officials of the Department of Health and Family Welfare.

As many as 54 house surgeons from Kasturba Medical College, Mangaluru, who are serving at the Government Wenlock and Lady Goschen hospitals and the primary health centres, have not received their monthly stipend for about a year. Each of the house surgeons should get ₹20,000 a month for their one-year long internship.

Raising slogans , the surgeons sat outside the casualty block of the Wenlock Hosptial on Wednesday. “There have been lot of the assurances. We need a written assurance for resolving the issue,” said surgeon Nihal Rai.

As the protest was on, the Wenlock Hospital Superintendent H.S. Rajeshwaridevi called officials in Bengaluru and to the new Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar. She promised action and asked the surgeons to resume work, but they did not relent and sought a written assurance.

Surgeon Kuldeep told Dr. Rajeshwaridevi that Deputy Chief Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan, who held the portfolio of Medical Education, has so far not acted on his assurance of directing the Kasturba Medical College to pay the stipend.

Another house surgeon said that despite the Department of Health and Family Welfare writing to the Wenlock Hospital to make the payment through hosptial’s Arogya Raksha Samiti funds, the surgeons have not received their stipend.

Around noon, surgeon Chirantan Suhird, who is the president of Interns’ Council, called Commissioner, Health and Family Welfare, Pankaj Kumar Pandey, who reportedly promised announcing a timeline in the payment of stipend by evening. Following this, the surgeons called off their protest around 1 p.m. and said they will resort to the protest again if the stalemate continued.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/oe2i50/article30804269.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13MNHOUSESURGEONSPROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/wenlock-surgeons-stage-protest-later-call-it-off/article30804270.ece

347,2020/02/12,"Cultivation of Udupi Mallige, Jaji Mallige now under MGNREGA scheme","The cultivation of the famed Udupi Mallige and another variety of jasmine, Jaji Mallige, have now come under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) scheme in Udupi district.

According to the Department of Horticulture, there are about 8,000 jasmine cultivators in the district. Udupi Mallige is cultivated on 116 hectares in the district. Of this, 68 hectares are in Udupi taluk, 45 in Karkala taluk, and three hectares in Kundapur taluk.

The yield per hectare is 7.44 tonnes and the return is ₹10 lakh.

Jaji Mallige is sparsely cultivated in the district. While Udupi Mallige is predominantly being cultivated in the Shirva-Shankarpura belt, some farmers also cultivate Jaji Mallige along with it.

“Jasmine is the only perennial floriculture crop in the district,” said Guruprasad, officer, Department of Horticulture.

But the farmers have to be job card-holders under MGNREGA to get the benefit. If any farmer wants to cultivate jasmine saplings, they will get money for the labour component and material component under the MGNREGA.

If a farmer with job card wants to cultivate jasmine saplings on five cents of land, he would get ₹5,925 under MGNREGA for it, including ₹2,345 as labour component, and ₹3,581 as material component.

The benefits of this scheme are also available for 10, 25, 50, and 100 cents of land.

Presently the cultivation of jasmine is concentrated in some pockets in the district. “With the MGNREGA scheme, the cultivation of jasmine could get extended to other parts,” Mr. Guruprasad said.

Ramakrishna Sharma, president of the Udupi Mallige Belegarara Sangha, said that the MGNREGA scheme will help new farmers taking to jasmine cultivation.

“As I see it, the problem is in getting job cards from Panchayat Development Officers (PDOs). The government should also simplify procedures so that farmers are not inconvenienced,” he added.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/growing-udupi-mallige-jaji-mallige-now-under-mgnrega-scheme/article30802277.ece

351,2020/02/12,Direct train to link Bengaluru and Karwar,"Journey time to be reduced by 4 hours

The demand for a superfast dedicated train between Bengaluru and Karwar will become a reality 13 years after resumption of passenger train services between the mainland and the coast via Sakleshpur-Subrahmanya Road Ghat section.

Bowing to demand and pressure from multiple corners, the South Western Railway on Monday announced the introduction of a new train — Yeshwantpur-Vasco da Gama-Yeshwantpur daily special train on special fare via Subrahmanya Road, Padil, Surathkal and Karwar bypassing Mangaluru.

A few days ago, SWR had proposed to bifurcate the existing combined train Bengaluru-Kannur/Karwar overnight express. This met with stiff resistance from coastal people. Just as the residents of Mangaluru were not prepared to part with its services, those in the rest of the coast too did not want bifurcation as it did not reduce journey time. A meeting at the Railway Board at New Delhi last week failed to break the ice, while the one at SWR headquarters in Hubballi on Monday, attended by representatives of coastal passengers’ associations, found a solution.

A notification by SWR dated 10.02.2020 said the date of introduction of the service would be intimated soon. The train will make commercial halts at Chikka Banavara, Channarayapatna, Hassan, Sakleshpur, Subrahmanya Road, Kabaka Puttur, Surathkal, Udupi, Barkur, Kundapura, Byndoor, Bhatkal, Murdeshwara, Kumta, Gokarna Road, Ankola, Karwar and Madgaon. It will have three general class, one 2-Tier and 3-Tier AC each, seven general second class sleeper and two luggage-cum-brake van coaches. The new service takes 13.45 hours to reach Karwar from Yeshwantpur while the existing services (via Kunigal as well as via Mysuru) take over 17 hours, thus bringing much relief to travellers in Uttara Kannada district. It leaves Yeshwantpur at 6.45 p.m. to reach Karwar at 8.25 a.m. and Vasco at 10.30 a.m. the next day bypassing Mangaluru via Padil bypass off Mangaluru Junction. It leaves Vasco at 4.40 p.m. and Karwar at 8.32 p.m. to reach Yeshwantpur at 9 am the next day.

Passenger associations, MP Shobha Karandlaje, Kumta MLA Dinakar K. Shetty and others thanked Railway Ministry, Minister of State for Railways Suresh C. Angadi, SWR and Konkan Railway for the service and drastically reducing the travel time. They also said one more direct connectivity was established between Bengaluru and Goa with the new train.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/y8tnhn/article30797863.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12BGFEBtrainbw,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/direct-train-to-link-bengaluru-and-karwar/article30797867.ece

It has been over 11 months that the 54 house surgeons, who have studied MBBS under the government quota, have not received their stipend. They have to get a monthly stipend of ₹20,000 during their one year internship at the government hospital.

Third year

This has been the third year in succession that payment of stipend has been delayed. The Medical Education Department paid the stipend till March 2019 and asked the Health and Family Welfare Department, under which the two government hospitals fall, to pay for the forthcoming months.

The Health and Family Welfare Department asked Wenlock Hospital to pay the amount from the Arogya Raksha Samiti funds of the hospital. Wenlock Hospital Superintendent H.S. Rajeshwaridevi said the funds in the ARS account were not enough to pay the stipend.

House surgeon Chirantan Suhird, who is president of the Council, said they submitted memoranda, including to the then Medical Education Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan, Health and Family Minister B. Sriramulu and Dean of Kastuba Medical College M. Venkataraya Prabhu, and waited for a long time for resolution. “As we have not seen action, we are forced to protest.

He was chairing the monthly Karnataka Development Programme (KDP) meeting at the ZP Hall, here. Mr. Babu said that while most GPs had a SLRM unit, those in Udupi taluk were lagging in this regard.

Srinivas Rao, ZP Chief Planning Officer, said officers should check if public toilets were being used in GPs.

There were health problems associated with single pit toilets. Hence, officers should insist on construction of double pit toilets in new houses. They should check if the double pit toilets had been constructed while giving door numbers to newly constructed houses. A public awareness campaign on this issue should be created, he said.

K. Sheshashayana, Deputy Director of Public Instruction (DDPI), said the department had begun holding motivational camps for students behind in studies in all taluks of the district. More such camps would be held, he said.

An officer of the Health Department said that six cases of malaria and five cases of chikungunya had been reported in the district since January and the department had taken up health awareness programmes in these places.

Shobha G. Puthran, chairperson, ZP Standing Committee on Agriculture, said many farmers were growing chrysanthemums in Hemmady and surrounding villages in Kundapur taluk. This year, they were affected by a drop in the yield. Hence, they should be compensated, she said.

The meeting was informed that the GPs in the district had kept electricity bills running into lakhs of rupees pending in the district.

355,2020/02/12,Belthangady villages show the way in water conservation,"College students and villagers led by a zilla panchayat member have conserved water in a big way by building about 50 Kattas (small bunds) on the Phalguni and its tributaries in about a 25-km radius of Venoor town during the last two months.

The Kattas meant to hold water for summer have come up in the jurisdiction of eight gram panchayats on the foot of the Western Ghats in Belthangady taluk.

The community with the leadership of P. Dharanendra Kumar, a member from Naravi constituency in Dakshina Kannada Zilla Panchayat, used sand bags and soil to build them without using any grant from the government. The cost of construction, including the supply of material, food and transportation, has been borne by donors, including Mr. Kumar. The shramdan saved labour charges.

Such sand-cum-soil-based Kattas in large numbers in a typical geographical area have come up for the first time in Dakshina Kannada, thanks to the students of Alva’s College, Dhavala College and S.N. Polytechnic in Moodbidri; St. Aloysius College in Mangaluru; Government First Grade Colleges in Vamadapadav, Punjalkatte and Belthangady and the people of the villages under the panchayats.

Initially, students of Alva’s College and others built six Kattas in Naravi and its adjacent Kutluru villages in five days, from December 9 to 13, 2019. It prompted people from nearby gram panchayats to place the demand for Kattas and join hands in constructing them with students, Mr. Kumar told The Hindu.

It resulted in the construction of 14 bunds under Marodi Gram Panchayat, seven in Naravi panchayat, eight under Kashipatna panchayat, five in Andinje panchayat, two each under Sulkeri and Arambodi gram panchayats, five in Hosangady panchayat and six under Venoor Gram Panchayat, he said.

“We will build two more Kattas one each in Hosangady and Venoor within a week. Probably, they will be the last ones of this season,” Mr. Kumar, who was also a former vice-president of the zilla panchayat, said and added that water stored will also feed animals and birds in summer. “Building a Katta will be more effective and meaningful,” he said. The government declared the entire Dakshina Kannada as “partially drought-hit” in January 2019. “There is no dearth of water in the district. But there is lack of effective water management which needs to be taken up seriously,” said Mr. Kumar.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/5aa0w4/article30796319.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11MNKATTA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/belthangady-villages-show-the-way-in-water-conservation/article30796320.ece

Ms. Kunder on Tuesday visited 35-year-old Swapna, a resident Kodimbala village in Puttur, who suffered burns after her brother-in-law threw acid on her on January 23.

A mother of three, Ms. Swapna is undergoing treatment at the Government Wenlock Hospital here. Her three-year-old daughter Sameeksha, who also suffered minor burns, was discharged from the hospital a few days ago. After interacting with the victim, Ms. Kundar told reporters that it was sad to hear that the police officer, who received the victim’s call to report the attack, made her come all the way from her house to the police station located 3 km away. “The officer overlooked her pain and made her write the complaint. The police failed to show humanity,” she said.

Expressing happiness over the victim’s recovery, Ms. Kunder asked doctors and officials of the Women and Child Development Department to arrange counselling for the victim. “Having suffered harassment by her brother-in-law in the past, she fears that the situation may continue. Her confidence, which is low now, should be boosted,” she said.

Senior Specialist of the Hospital Shivaprakash D.S. said that the victim has completely recovered now.

Later, Ms. Kunder met Superintendent of Police B.M. Laxmi Prasad who told her that the Assistant Sub-Inspector of Police, Kadaba Police Station, who failed to respond to victim’s call, has been suspended.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/anguish-over-police-handling-of-acid-attack-case/article30796269.ece
359,2020/02/12,Bulk waste generators have another solution,"Mangaluru Ramakrishna Mutt has shown that bulk waste generators can handle the generated waste within their premises if they have some space available there. There is no need to add any microbes or additives to get wet waste converted into fine manure as the worms that get generated inside the waste would convert it into manure, said Swamy Ekagamyananda, convener of Mangaluru Ramakrishna Mission’s Swatch Mangaluru Abhiyan.

The Ramakrishna Mutt has built a bulk waste handling unit on about 120 sq ft space inside its premises, that resemble partitioned ground-level water tanks. Iron mesh is provided at the bottom to drain out waste water; this drain water too acts as manure, the Swami said. About 20 kg of wet waste is filled in these chambers every day while Black Soldier worms get generated in about four days. The worms then start consuming the waste thereby turning it into manure and at the end of about a month, fine manure would be available. These are the same worms that convert wet waste in pot-composting units of individual households. For 600 kg of wet waste, about 60 kg of manure would be available every month at the mutt, the Swami said.

The unit would not emit any foul smell nor would it require any microbes to convert the waste into manure, the Swami said. Bulk waste generators having space and funds could opt for such units for effective wet waste disposal, he said.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/28cgtc/article30796250.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12MNRAMAKRISHNA4,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/bulk-waste-generators-have-another-solution/article30796252.ece
360,2020/02/12,Ramakrishna Mission incubates start-up to handle city’s wet waste,"It is meant to collect and handle wet waste generated in apartments through pot-composting method

Appalled by the havoc caused to residents and environments at Pachchanady dumping yard where lakhs of tonnes of garbage caved in on houses and agriculture land, Mangaluru Ramakrishna Mission has taken an initiative to reduce wet waste going out of the city.

The Mission has incubated a start-up — Mangala Resource Management Pvt. Ltd. — to handle wet waste generated from households in the city through the already established pot-composting method.

“We were going a little slow in expanding pot-composting initiative so as to get prepared well. However, the recent announcement by Mangaluru City Corporation to levy fine on bulk waste generators has helped hasten the process,” said Swami Ekagamyananda, convener of Mission’s Swatch Mangaluru Abhiyan.

Zero-cost system

He told reporters here on Tuesday that the corporation’s move would compel bulk waste generators, including apartment complexes, to come together for waste disposal mechanism that might cost about ₹ 1 lakh. The Mission intends to introduce the almost zero-cost wet waste disposal system in these apartments and also handle it, he said.

Pot-composting unit

The start-up proposes to provide each household in an apartment complex a pot-composting unit (a set of three pots with metal frame for protection) to be kept at a corner of the respective car parking lot and two waste bins through the owners associations.

Residents have to keep wet waste in the waste bin by morning, while the start-up’s personnel would pour the same into the pot and spread coco-peat.

While the unit is given free, each resident has to enter into an agreement with the start-up for three years, pay a refundable deposit of ₹ 1,000 and monthly handling fee of ₹ 150 (at ₹ 5 a day), the swami said. It would also collect the manure generated thereof.

Pot-composting has become a success with about 2,500 households giving positive feedback out of the 2,700 households that got the units in the last few months from the Mission. In all, 4,700 people have registered for the units.

Village industry

With at least 10,000 pot-composting units estimated to be required for the mega initiative, the move provides jobs to hundreds of potters in the region. The Mission is already procuring units from Anantpur in Andhra Pradesh, Ballari, Kunigal and Perdur in Udupi district. There is also a possibility of establishing a mega pottery unit near Mangaluru, the Swami said.

With the Mission getting around 2,000 pot-composting units every month, the Swami expressed the confidence that the start-up can cover all apartments in the city, about 40 of which have already evinced interest. It is also seeking sponsorship for pots to spread the initiative across the city.

363,2020/02/12,"Inflation climbs, industrial output contracts yet again","Retail inflation climbed to an almost six-year high of 7.59%

A day after Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman listed a recovery in industrial output as one of the “green shoots” in the economy, government data showed industrial production contracted again in December 2019, even as retail inflation surged to an almost six-year high of 7.59%.

This is the highest inflation rate since the NDA government came to power at the Centre in May 2014.

The Index of Industrial Production (IIP) recorded a negative growth of 0.3% in December in comparison to the same month the previous year, according to the National Statistical Office (NSO). The IIP had shown a positive growth of 1.8% in November, after three consecutive months of contraction. IIP contraction came largely on the back of a 1.2% slump in the manufacturing sector. In fact, 16 out of 23 industry groups in manufacturing saw negative growth. The production of capital goods fell by 18.2% in comparison to the previous year.

The electricity sector also contracted marginally. The mining sector, on the other hand, saw growth of 5.4%.

NSO’sConsumer Price Index (CPI) data showed retail inflation had surged from 7.35% in December 2019 to 7.59% in January 2020, mostly due to costlier food items.

The last time the inflation rate were higher than this was in May 2014, when retail inflation stood at 8.33%.

Food inflation lower

Food inflation for January 2020 was 13.63%, slightly lower than the previous month’s rate of 14.19%.

Vegetables remained costly, showing a 50% inflation rate, despite the recovery in onion prices. The high prices of proteins — pulses, meat, fish and eggs — also contributed to the high rate of food inflation. This is the fourth straight month that retail inflation has crossed the Reserve Bank of India’s medium term target of 4%.",economy,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/nogszk/article30803463.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Ups-and-downsbw,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/inflation-climbs-industrial-output-contracts-yet-again/article30803469.ece
364,2020/02/12,Industrial production shrinks 0.3% in December,"The Index of Industrial Production (IIP) had grown by 2.5% in December 2018.

India’s industrial production growth turned negative in December, contracting by 0.3%, mainly on account of a decline in manufacturing sector output, official data showed on Wednesday.

Factory output, as measured in terms of the Index of Industrial Production (IIP), had recorded a growth of 2.5% in December 2018.

Industrial production growth had turned positive at 1.8% in November last year after contracting for three consecutive months of August (-1.4%), September (-4.6%) and October (-4%).

According to the National Statistical Office (NSO) data, the manufacturing sector output contracted by 1.2% in December 2019 as against a growth 2.9% in the same month last year.

Electricity generation also fell by 0.1% as against a growth of 4.5% in December 2018.

Mining sector output grew by 5.4% in the month under review, compared to a contraction of 1% in the year ago month.

IIP growth during April-December period of the current fiscal came in at 0.5%, down from 4.7% in the same period of 2018-19.

Data for the December month further revealed that production of capital goods, a barometer of investment, slumped by 18.2% compared to a growth of 4.2% in the corresponding month of the previous year.

As per use-based classification, the growth rates in December 2019 over December 2018 were 2.2% for primary goods, 12.5% for intermediate goods and (-) 2.6% for infrastructure/construction goods.

Consumer durables and non-durables recorded growth of (-) 6.7% and (-) 3.7% respectively.

In terms of industries, 16 out of the 23 industry groups in the manufacturing sector have shown negative growth during December 2019 as compared to the corresponding month of the previous year.

Commenting on the IIP data, Rumki Majumdar, Economist, Deloitte India, said, “The contraction in the IIP in December raises concerns about the sustainability of the green shoots in industrial activities that were visible till last month. This does not bode well for the overall economy as global headwinds already pose significant challenges to overall industries.”

“The large outbreak of the coronavirus in China can adversely impact India as China is one of the largest trading partners. With several factories being closed down in China temporarily, the electronics and auto industry in India will likely be hit because of their dependence on Chinese imports of components and raw materials,” Majumdar added.",economy,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/joxyz8/article30801817.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Manufacturing,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/industrial-production-shrinks-03-in-december/article30801748.ece
365,2020/02/12,Retail inflation jumps to nearly six-year high of 7.59% in January on high food prices,"The earlier high was in May 2014 when the CPI-based inflation was 8.33%

Retail inflation jumped to over five-and-a-half-year high of 7.59% in January on persistently high prices of vegetables, pulses and protein-rich meat and fish, government data showed on Wednesday.

The Consumer Price Index (CPI)-based inflation was 7.35% in December 2019. It had stood at 1.97% in January 2019.

The earlier high was in May 2014 when the CPI-based inflation was 8.33%.

The overall food inflation during January this year stood at 13.63%, slightly lower than 14.19% in the previous month, showed the data released by the National Statistical Office under the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation.

Food inflation, however, had contracted in January 2019 with a print of (-)2.24%.

Inflation in vegetables spurt to 50.19% in January this year, while that for pulses and products, it rose to 16.71%.

Among protein-rich items, prices of meat and fish went up by 10.50% during the month, while egg prices were higher by 10.41% against the year-ago period.

Also Read Industrial production shrinks 0.3% in December

The food and beverages category showed an inflation print of 11.79%, according to the data.

Housing turned costlier by 4.20% in January 2020, while for fuel and light, the inflation print was 3.66%.

“The internals of the food inflation are worrying, given a broad-based uptick across categories that tend to be sticky, such as proteins, and a narrower-than-expected reduction in inflation for vegetables.

“Moreover, the fairly broad-based rise in the core inflation to 4.1% in January 2020, driven by various services, is a cause for concern,” said Aditi Nayar, principal economist, ICRA.

Mr. Nayar added that regardless of the level of retail inflation, the stance of the RBI for the monetary policy is likely to be retained as accommodative, for as long as the MPC considers the output gap to be negative. “The timing and magnitude of the next rate cut will depend on how quickly inflation appears to be reverting back towards 4%.”

Rahul Gupta, head of research (currency), Emkay Global Financial Services, said, “It is the consecutive second month that the CPI has breached upper band of the RBI’s inflation target... if inflation continues to hover above 6%, we don’t expect the RBI (Reserve Bank of India) to cut interest rate or change its accommodative policy stance,” said.",economy,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/k3l8t8/article30801747.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/onion,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/retail-inflation-inches-up-to-759-in-january/article30801685.ece
366,2020/02/12,OPEC chops global oil demand growth forecast over coronavirus,"OPEC said it now expects growth in global oil demand of 0.99 million barrels per day this year

The OPEC oil cartel on Wednesday lowered its forecast for growth in global oil demand this year by nearly a fifth due to the impact of the coronavirus outbreak in China.

In its monthly report on the world’s oil market, OPEC said it now expects growth in global oil demand of 0.99 million barrels per day (mbd) this year, down from the 1.22 mbd forecast last month.

“The outbreak of the coronavirus in China during the first half of 2020 is the major factor behind this downward revision,” OPEC said.

China remains in crisis mode weeks after the epidemic exploded, with much of the country shut down.

Entire cities have been quarantined and the Lunar New Year holidays were extended in a bid to contain the outbreak of what is now known as the COVID-19 virus. International airlines have also halted flights to China.

Those disruptions are expected to hit economic output and China has been a major source of growth in demand for oil in recent years.

“The recent outbreak of the coronavirus in China necessitated a further downward revision to the country’s oil demand growth forecast compared to last month, as transportation fuels, notably aviation fuels, are expected to be impacted” in the first half of this year.

The impact on demand for transportation fuels was exacerbated by the outbreak coinciding with the Lunar New Year holidays, when many Chinese return home to celebrate with family.

OPEC said it had also revised lower its forecast for China’s economic growth this year by 0.5% points to 5.4%.

“The impact of the coronavirus outbreak on China’s economy has added to the uncertainties surrounding global economic growth in 2020, and by extension global oil demand growth in 2020,” it said.",economy,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/gy37rt/article30801673.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/OPEC-OILREVENUES,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/opec-chops-global-oil-demand-growth-forecast-over-coronavirus/article30801674.ece

369,2020/02/12,Phone industry in India hit as coronovirus outbreak disrupts supply chain in China: ICEA,"The coronavirus outbreak and its perceived risk has also cast a shadow on the upcoming Mobile World Congress, the industry’s flagship annual congregation

The phone industry in India is facing an unprecedented and tough situation as its supply chain, which is heavily dependent on China, is getting “badly impacted,” India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA) said on Wednesday.

The mobile and electronics industry body’s comments come at a time when the death toll in China’s novel coronavirus outbreak has gone up to 1,113 with 97 new fatalities reported mostly in the worst-affected Hubei province while the confirmed cases of infection jumped to 44,653. A significant majority of cases are in mainland China.

“This is an absolutely unprecedented situation...the industry is helpless,” ICEA Chairman Pankaj Mohindroo said at an event.

Mohindroo further said supply chain management is getting “badly impacted” but noted that a handful of plants in China have now received permission to open.

Reports suggested on Tuesday that one of the large contract manufacturers and component suppliers has resumed operations in one of its plants in China, although it was operating with only a small fraction of its workforce.

The coronavirus outbreak and its perceived risk has cast a shadow on the upcoming Mobile World Congress (MWC), the largest mobile event and the industry’s flagship annual congregation.

370,2020/02/12,Coronavirus spread to shrink India’s auto production by 8.3% in 2020: Fitch,"China is one of India’s largest supplier of automotive components, a slowdown in the supply of China-made components will lead to shortages in India

Vehicle production in India is expected to shrink by 8.3% in 2020, as the auto industry faces increasing risk of supply shortage due to the coronavirus outbreak in China, possibly hitting domestic output if the virus spreads, said rating agency Fitch Solutions on Wednesday.

In China, where the virus originated, automotive manufacturers have halted production in order to limit the congregation of people and reduce the exposure of its population to possible infection and “we see India adopting similar policies if the virus spreads throughout the country,” it said.

Given that India’s health care system is ill-equipped to deal with a large scale epidemic, the rating agency said “the impact on Indian autos will be much larger because the virus will likely spread much faster in the country when compared to China.”

Furthermore, because China is one of India’s largest supplier of automotive components, a slowdown in the supply of China-made components will lead to shortages in India and could force auto makers to slow or stop production.

As a result, we forecast vehicle production in India will contract by 8.3% for 2020, following an estimated contraction of 13.2% in 2019.

The agency said that it believes that the weak domestic demand for new vehicles will see India’s vehicle production continue to contract in 2020.

“China supplies India with between 10-30% of its automotive components, and this could be two to three times higher when looking at India’s EV segment, which highlights just how exposed India’s automotive manufacturing industry is to the slowdown of vehicle Chinese component manufacturing,” it said.

Fitch also believes that the protectionist policies presented in the country’s 2020 Budget with regards to electric vehicles will offer some upside potential for local EV production, but it will be accompanied by increased trade risk.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/gg3aup/article30798667.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AUTOINDUSTRY,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/coronavirus-spread-may-hit-supply-chain-and-shrink-indias-auto-production-by-83-in-2020-fitch/article30798668.ece
371,2020/02/12,"Six years on, Lokpal is a non-starter","The necessary rules, regulations and machinery are still not in place

The massive public campaign in 2011 demanding an independent anti-corruption ombudsman resulted in the passage of the Lokpal law. The political dividend of the agitation was reaped at the national level by the BJP, which vociferously supported the demand for an effective Lokpal and rode to power in 2014 on the plank of anti-corruption.

More than six years after the Lokpal law received the President’s assent, the institution of the Lokpal is yet to play any significant role in tackling corruption in the country. The manner in which the Lokpal has been emasculated by the current regime closely mirrors the undermining of other institutions of oversight and accountability.

The preambular statement of The Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013 notes that the law has been enacted to ensure prompt and fair investigation and prosecution in cases of corruption against public servants. The Lokpal was envisioned to be independent. It was accorded a high stature and given extensive powers including the power to inquire, investigate and prosecute acts of corruption.

Delay in appointments

For more than five years, the chairperson and members of the Lokpal were not appointed. The government claimed that since no one could be recognised as the Leader of the Opposition (LoP) after the 2014 general election, the committee responsible for selecting members of the Lokpal could not be constituted. This malady could have been easily remedied by either recognising the leader of the single largest party in Opposition in the Lok Sabha as the LoP, or by amending the Lokpal law to allow the leader of the largest Opposition party to be a member of the committee in the absence of a recognised LoP (this was done for the selection committee of the CBI Director). However, neither recourse was taken.

The chairperson and members of the Lokpal were appointed only in March 2019 after a contempt petition was filed in the Supreme Court following the failure of the government to comply with the 2017 ruling of the court to initiate the process of making appointments.

A truncated selection committee, without the LoP, was set up. The Prime Minister, Speaker, and the then Chief Justice of India appointed Mukul Rohatgi, who had earlier served as Attorney General of India during the BJP regime, as the eminent jurist on the selection panel. The leader of the largest Opposition party in the Lok Sabha was invited for meetings of the selection committee as a ‘special invitee’, which he declined on grounds that it was mere tokenism.

The four-member selection committee, having a preponderance of representatives of the ruling party with an inherent bias towards recommending candidates favoured by the government, selected the Chair and members of the Lokpal. The manner in which the appointments were made raised doubts about the independence of the Lokpal even before it became operational.

Despite the fracas over appointments, many had hoped that once constituted, the Lokpal would nevertheless be a significant oversight body to check corruption and the arbitrary use of power by the government. More than 10 months later, however, evidence suggests that the Lokpal is a non-starter. Till date, the government has not made rules prescribing the form for filing complaints to the Lokpal. The Central government has also failed to formulate rules regarding asset disclosure by public servants.

In order to ensure independent and credible action on allegations of corruption, the Lokpal was empowered under the law to set up its own inquiry wing headed by a Director of Inquiry and its own prosecution wing headed by a Director of Prosecution. However, information accessed under the Right to Information Act has confirmed that the inquiry and prosecution wings of the anti-corruption ombudsman are yet to be set up. The Lokpal has also not appointed the Director of Inquiry or Prosecution. Further, regulations which the Lokpal was obligated to make under the law are yet to be made, including those specifying the manner and procedure of conducting preliminary inquiry and investigation.

The website of the Lokpal states that it scrutinised 1,065 complaints received till September 30, 2019 and disposed of 1,000. Since necessary procedures to operationalise the law are yet to be put in place, the legal veracity of the decisions of the Lokpal could potentially be challenged in a court of law.

Failure to meet expectations

Without the requisite rules, regulations and machinery in place, it is not surprising that the Lokpal has failed to meet expectations. In recent times, the only reason for the Lokpal being in the news has been the resignation of its judicial member, Justice Dilip B. Bhosale, for undisclosed reasons.

The failure to operationalise the Lokpal in an effective manner lays bare the lack of political will of the BJP government. It took nearly half a century for the Lokpal law to be enacted from the time the need for the oversight institution was first articulated. It is anybody’s guess how much longer it will take before India has an effective, independent and empowered Lokpal.

372,2020/02/12,A new approach on investment,"For India and the U.S., this will be critical to sustain momentum coming out of a first trade deal

When Prime Minister Narendra Modi welcomes U.S. President Donald Trump to India this month, the most memorable images may well extend beyond bear-hugging and a ‘Howdy Trump’ rally. The two leaders are expected to sign a first-ever trade agreement. On substance, the agreement will not be a big one but that is beside the point. A U.S.-India trade deal will have historic significance, especially if it ushers in a period of strong collaboration to advance a shared bilateral trade agenda and effectively resolves troubles as they arise.

The restoration of India’s Generalised System of Preferences benefits, pricing of medical devices, and agriculture trade are all important, but they are just the tip of the iceberg. If the two sides continue efforts to achieve incremental outcomes, the start of negotiations on a comprehensive free trade agreement (FTA) could even be a credible scenario. Presently, this is not the case.

Incremental outcomes

What might initial incremental outcomes be? The most obvious candidates are intellectual property rights (IPR), digital trade, and investment. Ideally there should be room to seriously consider better ways to encourage skilled professionals to work in the other’s economy.

None of these areas will be easy. That said, there are already some shared interests. For example, India invests in the U.S. and continues to seek U.S. investment in India. Both are grappling with the appropriate scope and approach for regulating electronic commerce issues in this digital age. IPR has historically been an area of contention between the two, but discussions on IPR have progressed well in recent years.

With respect to investment issues, specifically foreign direct investment (FDI), this is an important moment to do more to encourage it than simply welcoming it. Ideally, the two sides should move ahead to negotiate an agreement on investment matters that can provide greater transparency, predictability, and regulatory certainty to investors from the other country. But it appears that the traditional approach through which countries pursue commitments on FDI, bilateral investment treaties, or ‘BITs’ (bilateral investment treaties) is off the table. The Trump administration has put a hold on negotiating additional BITs and appears to be suspicious of how well they balance U.S. interests. The Indian government is similarly sceptical of BITs, having cancelled all existing ones soon after it came into office.

A new approach

In fact, the two sides might find common ground in devising a new approach to investment issues, at least until they resume their work on BITs. A starting point should be to review what they have done in their recent FTAs. The recently concluded U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement contains a novel approach on investment, notably its abandonment of investor-state dispute settlement with respect to the U.S. and Canada. Similarly, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, which India had been negotiating with ASEAN, Australia, China, Japan, Korea, and New Zealand, does not include investor-state dispute settlement. While India chose not to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership when it was concluded at the end of last year, it appears to have been on board with the FTA’s investment provisions.

A U.S.-India investment agreement could focus on fair treatment for investors from the other country, regulatory transparency and predictability, and approaches for resolving concerns short of investor-state dispute settlements. At a later stage, most likely when the two are prepared to negotiate a more comprehensive bilateral FTA, they can go further on investment matters.

For now, however, they should focus on what is doable. A new, hybrid approach on investment would be a substantial step in the right direction. It will be critical to sustain momentum coming out of a first trade deal when the two leaders meet in Delhi. If India and the U.S. fail this test, the trade relationship is more likely to languish than blossom.

373,2020/02/12,The Delhi model of education,"The AAP government believes that quality education is a necessity, not a luxury

Mahatma Gandhi secured the participation of thousands of households in the freedom struggle when he launched the civil disobedience movement. For every household today, rich or poor, education has the same relevance as salt did in 1930. This is seen in the resounding verdict given by the Delhi electorate in the Assembly election to the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which built its governance model around education.

In the last five years, the Delhi model of education has caught the attention of people in Delhi and beyond. For too long, there have been two kinds of education models in the country: one for the classes and another for the masses. The AAP government in Delhi sought to bridge this gap. Its approach stems from the belief that quality education is a necessity, not a luxury. Hence, it built a model which essentially has five major components and is supported by nearly 25% of the State Budget. The validation of this model now creates a pathway for the next set of reforms.

Key components of the model

The first component of the education model is the transformation of school infrastructure. Dilapidated school buildings that lack basic facilities not only indicate the apathy of the government, but also significantly lower the motivation of teachers and the enthusiasm of students. The AAP government sought to change this by building new, aesthetically designed classrooms equipped with furniture, smart boards, staff rooms, auditoriums, laboratories, libraries, sports facilities and so on.

The second component is the training of teachers and principals. Apart from the fact that a forum was created to encourage peer learning among them, several opportunities were given to teachers for their professional growth. They visited Cambridge University; the National Institute of Education, Singapore; IIM Ahmedabad; and other models of excellence in India. The exposure to new pedagogy and leadership training enabled Delhi to gradually move away from a uniform training model for all to learning from the best practices in India and abroad.

The third component involved engaging with the community by reconstituting school management committees (SMC). The annual budget of each SMC is ₹5-7 lakh. The SMCs can spend this money on any material or activity, such as even hiring teachers on a short-term basis. Regular dialogue between teachers and parents was initiated through mega parent-teacher meetings. Guidelines are provided on how to engage with parents. Invitations for meetings are sent through FM radio, newspaper advertisements, etc.

Four, there have been major curricular reforms in teaching learning. In 2016, the AAP government noted that there was a nearly 50% failure rate in Class 9 and admitted that the poor foundational skills of children could be the reason for it. Special initiatives to ensure that all children learn to read, write and do basic mathematics was launched and made part of regular teaching learning activities in schools. Similarly, a ‘happiness curriculum’ was introduced for all children between nursery and Class 8 for their emotional well-being. Further, an ‘entrepreneurship mindset curriculum’ was introduced to develop the problem-solving and critical thinking abilities of children in Classes 9 to 12. Apart from these new curricular initiatives, the focus on existing subjects too ensured better performance in Board examinations by Classes 10 and 12.

Fifth, there was no fee increase in private schools. While the first four components impacted nearly 34% of children in Delhi’s government schools, arbitrary fee hikes earlier impacted about 40% children who go to private schools. In the past, almost all the schools increased their fee 8-15% annually. The AAP government not only ensured the refund of about ₹32 crore to parents which was excessively charged by private schools, it also ensured that any fee hike proposal was examined by authorised chartered accountants. Thus, for two years no school was allowed to raise its fee.

Agenda 2.0

In the words of Manish Sisodia, the leader of the Delhi education model, “having built the foundation of education”, the focus now will shift to “education as foundation”. Going forward, there will be three key areas of reform apart from consolidating the gains of the past. First, the syllabus of Classes 1 to 8 will be reviewed to emphasise foundational learning skills, the ‘happiness curriculum’ and the ‘deshbhakti’ curriculum. Thus, apart from ensuring that all children can fluently read, write and do mathematics, the focus will be to build emotional resilience in children and ensure that they internalise our core constitutional values by the time they complete eight years of schooling. Apart from that, early childhood care and education will be deepened further through Anganwadis. There will also be nurseries in all government schools.

Second, a Delhi Education Board will be set up to promote learning that encourages critical thinking, problem solving and application of knowledge among children. This will prepare them to tackle the challenges of the 21st century with an entrepreneurial mindset. Additionally, for those who have graduated from Delhi schools in the recent past, programmes like spoken English, soft skills and so on will be initiated to raise their employability opportunities.

Third, specialised schools will be created in each of the 29 zones of Delhi to nurture the aptitude and talent of children in the areas of science and technology, literature and language, visual and performing arts, and sports.

Now that Delhi has decisively acknowledged education as a top agenda of governance, the natural expectation from the government would be to ensure that all children get education that passes the test of quality, opportunity and equity.

374,2020/02/12,Celebration of a pivotal achievement,"In trying to set the Delhi poll discourse to be based on its record, AAP provided the Delhi voter a clear choice

One of the more difficult things to do in any election since 2014 is to foreground electoral issues related to what they are supposed to be actually about — the ability of the contending party to govern effectively. It has been relatively less cumbersome for opposing parties to make a mark in States where the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has to stand on its record, but far more difficult for parties that are already in power to retain them. Only the Biju Janata Dal in Odisha, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) in West Bengal and the Telangana Rashtra Samiti and All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (in States where the BJP is weak) have managed to retain power and even these parties, barring the TMC, had shied away from taking a strong oppositional position to the BJP.

Poll strategies

The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which has been a bugbear of the BJP, not only retained power winning 62 of the 70 seats in the Delhi Assembly election, but also managed to nearly emulate its strong performance in 2015 when it won 67 seats. This is a credit not only to its governance record but also its ability to turn the election into a referendum on its tenure. The BJP’s strongest point in recent elections has been to set the terrain of political discourse in the run-up to the polls and force its opponent to contest on those grounds. Aiding this strategy has been the BJP’s machine that provides it an organisational superiority which is buttressed by financial power unmatched by other parties.

The run-up to the Delhi election featured a no-holds barred campaign by the BJP that sought to foreground the cultural jingoist narrative of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), the dilution of Article 370, and the demonisation of the protests against the CAA and the National Register of Citizens embodied in the Shaheen Bagh sit-in. The campaign strategy was based on a calculus that had worked before. The BJP had, only in May 2019, managed to win 56.6% of the votes in Delhi, harping on the government’s decisive action following the Pulwama terror attacks. In recent Assembly elections, the deft use of Backward Class politics had been combined with the virulent use of the “Hindutva” card and this had more often than not, worked in the BJP’s favour. AAP, on the other hand, had tried to position itself as a party that was evasive or malleable with respect to ideology. Delhi Chief Minister and AAP founder Arvind Kejriwal has indeed articulated the importance of taking on the politics of hatred and communal differentiation, but his party’s emphasis has largely been on his government’s record on delivering basic services to an urban electorate without recourse to identitarian biases. While doing so, AAP did not seek to actively engage with the BJP’s focal issues such as the CAA/NRC and the nature of the protests against this amendment. Meanwhile the desperate and reactive attempt by the BJP to resort to calumny against AAP’s leadership only backfired.

In trying to set the discourse during the elections to be based on its governance record, AAP provided the Delhi voter a clear choice — would they endorse the steps taken by the regime or would they judge it in terms set by the BJP and its communal discourse? This was a pivotal achievement by the AAP and sets the party’s victory as one achieved in much more difficult circumstances compared to its triumph in 2015 or its strong foray into electoral politics in 2013, graduating from a civil society led movement against corruption.

Party trump cards

In 2015, AAP had managed to sway the Delhi electorate and build a multi-class coalitional support base — of the urban poor and the middle class with its promises of delivering on a corruption and patronage free governance that would reduce costs of basic services such as water supply and electricity.

In 2020, it managed to retain the support of this coalition through actual delivery, by devoting a significant portion of its budget allocations to education, health, water supply and sanitation. The government’s emphasis in bringing particular greater equity in primary education through the ramping up of infrastructure and better learning outcomes in government schools, bringing basic primary health care to colonies where the urban poor lived in the form of “mohalla clinics” and measures for affordable and safe public transport paid great dividends. This can indeed be a model for other urban centres in the country, provided the administration in these cities are empowered to allocate resources that would address glaring needs for the cities.

Yet, the lack of an ideological core or even an attempt to take positions on various national and international issues has disabled the party’s ambition to grow beyond the metropolitan borders of India’s National Capital Territory region and which has resulted in its decline in the only State where it made a mark beyond Delhi — in Punjab. The party started as a coalition of technocrats/managers who promised good governance and social movement-oriented ideologues who sought to resuscitate a flailing social democratic space in the Indian polity. But the split in 2015, that led to activists like Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan leaving the party, reduced it only to the former who had to make the best of the limited space in government in the Union Territory in order to survive. To the credit of Mr. Kejriwal and his colleagues, their governance has helped them retain public support within Delhi, but there is still time for the party to evolve if it needs to expand beyond the capital region and capture the imagination of other progressive and liberal minded people in the rest of the country.

375,2020/02/12,First call: on India-Sri Lanka ties,"India and Sri Lanka share close ties, but distrust and differences remain

By making New Delhi their first stop abroad, Sri Lanka’s new President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who visited in November, and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, after a five-day tour, have signalled hope of beginning a new India-Sri Lanka chapter. Contrary to their last stint which ended in 2015, when Mahinda Rajapaksa was President, and his younger brother Gotabaya was Defence Secretary, and ties underwent a strain for several reasons, New Delhi too has indicated that it would like to make a fresh start, working on development projects, including a joint India-Japan proposal for the East Container Terminal at Colombo. Mahinda Rajapaksa has also discussed extending the $400-million Line of Credit and India’s further assistance for nationwide housing. Air connectivity to Sri Lanka’s north and east is already being improved — there is a flight from India to Jaffna, and another one being proposed for Batticaloa. On security, Mr. Rajapaksa and Prime Minister Narendra Modi discussed intelligence sharing, training and the utilisation of a special $50-million Line of Credit extended by India after last year’s Easter Sunday bombings. India, Sri Lanka and the Maldives are expected to revive their trilateral on security, including joint maritime security talks and anti-terror cooperation. Finally, Mr. Rajapaksa reaffirmed his belief that among Sri Lanka’s friendships, India is seen as a “relative”, given their history and culture.

The bonhomie is palpable, but the faultlines were also visible. Prime Minister Modi said India hopes that the “expectations of the Tamil people for equality, justice, peace, and respect” would be realised and that devolution of powers according to the 13th amendment would be taken forward. Mr. Rajapaksa has given no commitment on this and said, in an interview to The Hindu, that he favoured the 13A but not solutions that were “unacceptable to the majority [Sinhala] community”. India’s case for the special status for the North and East also comes across as contrary to the Modi government’s strong stand about removal of the special status for Jammu and Kashmir. Mr. Rajapaksa has ruled out taking forward the MoU signed by his predecessor Ranil Wickremesinghe allowing Indian participation in energy and infrastructure projects in Trincomalee; an Indian stake in “Mattala airport” is not on the cards either. However, of note is his appeal for India to help Sri Lanka deal with its debt crisis — nearly $60-billion outstanding in foreign and domestic, and about $5-billion a year in repayments. New Delhi must consider his request for a three-year moratorium and be upfront about its response, in contrast to the past when New Delhi did not take up an offer to develop Hambantota port, and ceded space to China. Ignoring or rebuffing the new request could damage bilateral ties far more.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/first-call/article30795271.ece
376,2020/02/12,Winning formula: on AAP's victory,"AAP won on its governance record, but its tactics do not undermine the BJP’s politics

The spectacular victory of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in the Delhi Assembly election is matched in its intensity by the resounding defeat of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Having been in power for the last five years, AAP’s second consecutive victory is not an electoral enchantment of a start-up, but an endorsement of its track record. Along the way, its founder and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has perfected a political cocktail that turned out to be the most potent counter to the toxic religious polarisation that the BJP has come to champion. His governance brought succour to Delhi’s poorest and the most vulnerable in the form of better and accessible education, health care and water in particular. It is clear that they voted with their feet, and reinvested their faith in the maverick politician. On a strong footing on the administrative front, Mr. Kejriwal deployed his characteristic dexterity to sidestep the BJP’s landmines with their aim of communal polarisation. In the process, he narrowed politics to an efficient delivery of public services and either skirted around all contemporary issues of wider import, or tacitly sided with the majoritarian sentiments on them. Devoid of a governance story, the BJP dragged electioneering to a new low to marginally improve from its 2015 tally. To that extent, the Delhi outcome exposes the limits of divisive politics and incentivises sensitive governance.

To read the Delhi result as a setback to Hindutva politics and a celebration of good governance emptied of all politics, however, will be a misleading exaggeration. True, Delhi is the latest in a series of blows against the BJP since its 2019 parliamentary victory, but it must be flattered by the manner in which its strongest opponent did not directly take it on. AAP did not contest the BJP on questions it framed. AAP’s success has not been in defeating the politics of the BJP, but in skirting it altogether. Nevertheless, the lesson that the BJP is likely to learn from Delhi is that hyperventilating on nationalist causes is not a sufficient condition for victory, particularly in State elections, and governance does count. Repeated electoral upsets might spur some voices of dissent in the BJP, hitherto muffled. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah may have to rework their political idiom in order to hold sway. They might even borrow from the AAP playbook, but it will be the non-BJP parties including the Congress that drew a blank for the second time in Delhi, that will be dissecting the results for clues to a winnable non-BJP plank. But it would be a mistake to conclude that taking on majoritarianism by the horns is a poor strategy. The lesson is that any effective opposition to the BJP will have to develop an alternative politics that centrestages people’s everyday concerns, and their hopes and expectations about life and livelihood.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/winning-formula/article30795268.ece

378,2020/02/12,Survey of land encroached by Mantri Developers,"Regional Commissioner has ruled that the land belongs to the BBMP, and directed the civic body to take possession of the land

The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) will soon undertake a survey of the land on which Mantri Square and Mantri Greens apartment stand in Malleswaram, said civic chief B.H. Anil Kumar on the sidelines of Municipalika, an exhibition and conference on Safe and Sustainable Cities, on Wednesday.

The Regional Commissioner on Friday ruled that the land on which Mantri Square and Mantri Greens apartment stand belongs to the BBMP, and directed the civic body to take possession of the land.

Both the mall and apartment complex have come up on land that earlier housed Raja Mill, marked for industrial purposes at Hanumanthapura village. Mr. Anil Kumar said that drawings prepared by the Additional Director (Land Records) show encroachment of 37 guntas of Jakkarayanakere in Hanumanthapura coming under survey number 56, and 3.31 acres of village road in Jakkasandra village. A survey is essential to re-ascertain the extent of encroachment and which portion of the encroached land has been built on, he said.

He added that to ensure that Mantri Developers don’t approach the High Court seeking a stay, he had instructed the Legal Cell in the BBMP to file a caveat.

Though The Hindu tried to reach out to Mantri Developers, they did not respond.

Mr. Anil Kumar said the Koramangala-Ejipura flyover will be completed in the next 11 months. The project was taken up in 2014 at a cost of ₹250crore but has been facing delays.

Haris, who appeared before the Sadashiv Nagar traffic police on Wednesday for questioning, has denied the police’s charge that he was involved in the accident in which his Bentley knocked down an autorickshaw and a motorcycle, injuring four people. He claimed that he was not even in the car that rammed into the vehicles near Mekhri Circle on Sunday and denied the allegation that his aide Balakrishna, 27, had taken the fall for him.

He was granted station bail after receipt of bail bond. Nalapad, who is currently out on bail after he was charged with beating up a patron at a restaurant last year, said, “I am being framed so that my bail is cancelled. If the police have proof, let them show it. I will fight this case as much as I can. I am not the same Nalapad of the last incident.” He went on to add that he had been in a Lamborghini that was behind the Bentley. “The Bentley was being driven by Balu, who for long has been with me,” he said.

B.R. Ravikanthe Gowda, Joint Commissioner of Police (Traffic), however, reiterated the fact that the police had “strong proof to confirm that it was Nalapad driving the car”. “The car has a defective number plate and the colour was changed from red to black before the accident. All these issues will be investigated,” he said.

FIR against Balakrishna

The Sadashiv Nagar traffic police have filed an FIR against Balakrishna, and officials said he had lied to protect Nalapad. He surrendered on Tuesday, claiming that he had been the one driving the car.

“During interrogation, it was found that he was giving false statements to save the accused, thereby trying to change the direction of the investigation. Hence, we produced him before Sadashiv Nagar police station for further action,” a police officer said.

The incident occurred around 2.30 p.m. on Sunday, when the speeding luxury car, going towards P.G. Halli from Hebbal, rammed into a motorcycle and then hit the rear of an autorickshaw under the Mekhri Circle underpass.

380,2020/02/12,Rejuvenation of lakes: Volunteer groups suggest reuse of silt as stabilised blocks,"Citizen volunteer groups from Whitefield, Varthur and Bellandur have suggested reusing silt from Bellandur and Varthur lakes as stabilised blocks.

In a release on Wednesday, the groups requested corporates, builders, road contractors, residents’ welfare associations, government agencies and citizens to help with reusing the silt.

The residents, who were reacting to a letter written by Bangalore Environment Trust (BET) to various government agencies on Tuesday, said that Bellandur and Varthur rejuvenation was being done “as per the recommendations of the expert committee report, backed up by scientific data from over 22 years”, including a bathymetric study of the lakes by the Indian Institute of Science, helped by defence personnel.

BET had raised questions about certain processes, such as disposal of silt and diversion of waste water. “These lakes have accumulated silt over 50 years or so. Removing silt is a dire need as water-borne diseases continue to wreak havoc in the lives of the poor around the lake, socially and economically. We believe government agencies will dispose of the silt as per the applicable environmental laws and Central Pollution Control Board/Karnataka State Pollution Control Board norms,” the release said.

“We request the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, CPCB, KSPCB and other State pollution control boards to bring in stringent norms to limit the use of phosphates in detergents and triclosan in cleaning agents, along the lines of what the U.S. and Canadian environmental authorities did in late 1970s, to help rejuvenate the great lakes,” the release added.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/rejuvenation-of-lakes-volunteer-groups-suggest-reuse-of-silt-as-stabilised-blocks/article30802570.ece

384,2020/02/12,Bandh unlikely to hit life in Bengaluru,"Bus and metro services to run as per schedule

The Karnataka bandh called by several Kannada organisations on Thursday is unlikely to impact daily life in Bengaluru.

Bus and metro services will run as per schedule, though certain taxi unions have extended their support. The organisations that have called for the bandh are demanding the implementation of Sarojini Mahishi report by providing more jobs for Kannadigas in the State.

Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) and Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) officials said that operations would not be affected. “No employee unions of the Corporation are taking part in the strike. Our services will run as usual on Thursday,” said a KSRTC official.

On the other hand, a few taxi drivers’ associations have announced that they are supporting the bandh. Somashekar of Namma Chalakara Trade Union said that drivers attached to various taxi aggregators will take part in the bandh. However, tourist taxi operators have extended only moral support.

Radhakrishna Holla, president of the Karnataka State Tourist Operators Union, said “Our business is already under loss due to various factors so we are not participating in the strike. However, we will give moral support.”

Auto unions in the city are also divided over supporting the bandh call.

387,2020/02/12,Programme for expecting mothers on hearing tips organised at AIISH in Mysuru,"Programme to mark World Hearing Day

The All India Institute of Speech and Hearing (AIISH), Mysuru, a premier institute under the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, has organised a programme for expecting mothers here on February 16 on precautions they are supposed to take for the normal development of ear and hearing in the child.

As part of the ‘World Hearing Day’ celebrations, the orientation programme in Mysuru and surrounding places has been arranged from 10.30 a.m. to noon on the institute premises here.

The programme aims to provide few simple tips to be followed by expecting mothers. Lunch will be provided to the participants and one accompanying person after the programme.

The institute has been striving to minimise the occurrence of hearing loss among the people.

“It is every parent’s dream to have a healthy baby and they are ready to do anything for it. The baby in the womb feels and experiences the activities and the environment of the mother which includes the air she breathes, people she talks to, music she listens to, food she eats and the emotions she feels. These experiences influence the overall physical development of the baby in the womb. Hearing is a crucial sense in such interactions. The development of the ear and hearing functions take place throughout the 9 months and it is important that the expecting mothers learn about a few simple yet important tips to ensure normal development of ear and hearing,” a press release issued here on Tuesday said.

Normal hearing is important for the child’s speech-language, academic and emotional development. In India, 5-6 out of every 1,000 children born are with congenital hearing loss, making it a high prevalent condition. Though the conditions are unavoidable, precautions during the pregnancy period and appropriate parental education could reduce the occurrence of hearing loss and if not so, at least reduce the consequences of it by providing timely treatment at the earliest, the release added.

The State government’s decision appointing the former Rajya Sabha member Basavaraj Patil Sedam as chairman of the Kalyana Karnataka Human Resources, Agriculture and Cultural Association has been opposed by Hyderabad Karnataka Horata Samiti.

The samiti has demanded that the government withdraw the decision immediately.

Addressing a press conference here on Tuesday, Razak Ustad, convener of the samiti, criticised the government for appointing a party loyalist to the newly formed association citing it will encourage human resources, skill development and organic agriculture.

The government could have appointed the chairman of KKRDB to take up overall development in the grant reserved and achieve progress in the region instead.

Dr. Razak pointed out that encouraging only organic agriculture will not meet the need for the development of the region in all sectors. He also said that the government has given the position to a party loyalist. “We oppose the decision and urge the government to take its decision back immediately.

389,2020/02/12,ITI’s once-famous gardens to be back in bloom soon,"The PSU, which has managed to wriggle out of debt, is busy sprucing up its 460-acre campus

Bengaluru used to be the true-blue public sector undertaking (PSU) town of the country until mid-1990s. In the bunch of Navaratna PSUs were Hindustan Aeronautics, Bharat Electronics Ltd., Bharat Earth Movers Ltd., Hindustan Machine Tools and Indian Telephones Industries, which later became ITI.

Interestingly, ITI was independent India’s first public sector undertaking, incorporated in 1948. It played an unmatchable role in ushering in telephony revolution in the country that connected cities to towns and towns to villages through voice, but its fortunes started diminishing with the advent of globalisation/liberalisation and the drastic changes the new policies brought in the marketplace.

After being in the red for almost 15 years, ITI has over the last couple of years managed to wriggle out of debt and losses it piled up. ITI had reported a net profit of ₹168.25 crore for the third quarter ended December 2019 against ₹7.19 crore in the same quarter a year ago. The company’s revenues almost doubled to ₹827.95 crore against ₹419.5 crore, overall posting an outstanding performance.

The changing fortunes has spurred the PSU to also spruce up its sprawling premises and do up some of the old facilities. “We are now in the process of developing our campus gardens. We are also rebuilding our courts and grounds for various sports and games. We used host the city’s most exciting sport or game event on our campus. Our gardens used to win prizes every year. We want to regain our lost glory, by all means, and after a break of 20 years we have now won first prizes for best ornamental gardens and horticulture gardens,” said Shashi Prakash Gupta, director, HR, ITI.

Old Bengalureans might recall that ITI was a front runner in badminton, cricket, basketball, football, volleyball, hockey, kabbadi, ball badminton, weightlifting and athletics.

390,2020/02/12,"Trust raises questions about waste water diversion, desilting","‘Revival of one waterbody should not sound death knell to others’

The city’s Bellandur and Varthur lakes, which started spewing froth and fire owing to prolonged periods of unabated pollution, have finally got a shot at rejuvenation, though after multiple interventions from the National Green Tribunal. But is the process free of errors?

The Bangalore Environment Trust (BET), under the chairmanship of environmentalist A.N. Yellappa Reddy, has written to the government agencies involved in the rejuvenation of both lakes, raising questions over some of the rejuvenation processes. They have also submitted some recommendations.

The list includes a course correction in the diversion of toxic waste water, which is now being pushed downstream subsequently into Dakshina Pinakini river.

Recommendations

In the letter, the trust said that the rejuvenation of one waterbody should not sound the death knell to others. “The rejuvenation approach of diverting approximately 500 million litres of toxic waste water entering Bellandur lake to Varthur lake and subsequently to Dakshina Pinakini river, seems to us that the polluting matter is being pushed downstream, thus translocating pollution. If the objective is pollution abatement, then diversion work is in contradiction to that objective as it allows the toxic waste water to travel long distances and thus increase the pollution load of the waterbodies downstream. This activity is in contravention to Section 24 of Water Act,” the letter says.

‘Toxic cocktail’

The trust has said that the government should pause, validate the approach via an Environmental Impact Assessment and make the necessary course correction.

It has also raised issues of where the “toxic cocktail” from the desilting exercise of the two lakes will be dumped. “One can deduce that 19.4 million tonnes of silt+slush cocktail on Bellandur lakebed and 7.8 million tonnes on Varthur lakebed are hazardous. Desilting this humongous quantity is a daunting task. To practically desilt such huge quantities will take a long time. What measurable benefits are obtained from this expensive activity? Where will the toxic cocktail go?” they asked.

They have also urged the government agencies to stop pollution at source as the lake is a receiving waterbody and any intervention to overcome pollution must be targeted upstream where the waste water is generated, as well as develop a Lake Ecosystem Management Programme to ensure that the exercise is not a “one-time capital-intensive engineering and infrastructure activity.”",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/5zrx3z/article30795650.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11BGBELLANDURLK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/trust-raises-questions-about-waste-water-diversion-desilting/article30795651.ece

392,2020/02/12,Celebrating students’ sustainability efforts,"The third edition of Janaagraha’s annual ‘Bengaluru Civic Fest’ on Tuesday showcased 25 teams from schools across India, who came up with unique solutions to tackle civic issues.

The event was held as a culmination of ‘IChangeMyCity Challenge’ organised between August to December 2019, where students were asked to identify and come up with innovative, practical solutions to address civic issues such as garbage disposal, the use awareness campaigns, innovative alternatives to resolve common problems, and sustainability among others.

Among the finalists were students from Assisi School, Bengaluru, who presented their ideas on preventing mishaps on pothole-ridden roads, which they say they had to navigate while going to school. They also focussed on manholes. “We dedicated our stall to Siddappa, the 17-year-old youth, who died inside a manhole when he went to clean it,” they said.

Students from Delhi Public School, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, presented their idea of adopting a neighbourhood and planting trees. Another team from the school had a stall on the trauma of being bullied, with the tagline, ‘No means No’.

Students from Srinidhi Public School, Bengaluru, had a stall on promotion of a zero waste campus where they showcased dustbins made from waste paper. They also showed how they converted wet waste into compost, which they use in the school garden.

Over 14,000 students studying in classes 6 to 12 across India participated in the competition, from which the 25 teams were selected.

Srikanth Viswanathan, CEO Janaagraha, said that civic education or active citizenship education was the only way to solve complex challenges of the 21st century in a sustainable way. “Active citizenship education seeks to deeply embed skills and competencies of systems thinking, collaborative problem solving and civic leadership,” he said in a press release.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/weq7nb/article30795620.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11BGCIVIC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/celebrating-students-sustainability-efforts/article30795621.ece
393,2020/02/12,Engineering college associations urged to conduct one entrance test,"Currently, besides CET, there are three other entrance tests

Students applying for engineering seats have to write multiple entrance tests to get into different engineering colleges. To put an end to this practice, the admission overseeing committee has recommended that associations of different engineering colleges conduct a common test for entrance into private engineering colleges across the State.

B. Manohar, chairman of the Admission Overseeing Committee, made the recommendation earlier this week after discussions with students and parents who had complained that they had to prepare for multiple entrance tests. Currently, besides the Common Entrance Test which is the gateway for admissions into government and government quota seats in engineering colleges, there are three other entrance tests for seats in private engineering colleges: Consortium of Medical, Engineering and Dental Colleges of Karnataka (COMEDK) test as well tests conducted by the Karnataka Religious and Linguistic Minority Professional Colleges Association and the Association of Minority Professional Colleges in Karnataka.

The chairman, in his letter to the government, stated that the Supreme Court has said that all institutions imparting the same or similar professional education should hold a common entrance test by providing a “centralised and single window procedure”. He recommended that all the three associations conduct a common entrance test and counselling for selection of students. The committee has stated that if the associations fail to implement the recommendation, it would urge the government to take over the admission process and substitute its own procedure for selection of students. Even the All India Council for Technical Education for several years has been considering conducting one entrance test for admissions into all engineering colleges across the country - on the lines of the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test for admissions into medical and dental colleges across the country.

S. Kumar, Executive Secretary, COMEDK, said that there was a need for the associations to sit together and take a decision. He added that COMEDK could conduct the examination for all associations if needed.

Students are in favour of the move. Rakesh S., an engineering seat aspirant, said that this would reduce a lot of pressure and time for students and be a boon for the student fraternity.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/engineering-college-associations-urged-to-conduct-one-entrance-test/article30795619.ece

400,2020/02/12,Chennai airport’s restrooms to undergo revamp,"Sixteen sets of toilets will be refurbished in a phased manner, over the coming weeks, officials said

Chennai airport’s toilets in both domestic and international terminals will now get some much-needed renovation in a phased manner.

Officials of the Airports Authority of India (AAI) said about 16 sets of toilets will be refurbished, one after the other, in the coming weeks in both terminals. “The faucets, other equipments and toiletries will all be changed. We are also planning to bring a new feedback system soon and that will help us better in the maintenance of the washrooms. The work will be carried out in a phased way,” an official said. Early last year too, many of the toilets were renovated.

This is one of the constant complaints that many passengers raise when they travel out of Chennai airport. They say the toilets are poorly maintained and the upkeep has to improve drastically. This is especially so in the old arrival hall of the international terminal. But officials said they have been working to improve the upkeep continuously. “The maintenance is definitely far better now. We have been continuously monitoring the upkeep; as soon as there is a complaint, we immediately take action,” another official said.

Chennai airport has been witnessing the second phase of modernisation at an estimated cost of nearly ₹2,500 crore. The whole airport will function as one integrated terminal once this project is completed. It may take another year and half to finish the whole project in two phases, officials said. “In the new integrated terminals, we are trying to ensure that the existing issues don’t emerge and of course, a good feedback system is available for passengers to immediately raise their concerns, if any,” another official said.

The construction of terminals is currently underway now and it is likely that one major part of this second phase of modernisation will be over by the end of this year.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/9514rw/article30800508.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12FEBTH--AIRPORT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/chennai-airports-restrooms-to-undergo-revamp/article30800509.ece
401,2020/02/12,"Chennaiites, see how many bird you can spot this weekend","The Great Backyard Bird Count is being held from February 14 to 17 and will be coordinated by the Bird Count India collective

For four days in February every year, birdwatchers from across the world participate in The Great Backyard Bird Count. This year, the Great Backyard Bird Count(GBBC) will be held from February 14 to 17 in India, and will be coordinated by the Bird Count India collective.

India has been participating in this global bird count since 2013 and this annual exercise helps study how birds are distributed across the country, how they are affected by changes in habitat and weather and if there have been changes in populations and distributions.

Birdwatchers as well as the general public who wish to participate are encouraged to go birding for 15 minutes and count all the species they spot. Whatever they are able to identify, they can log onto www.ebird.org/india and submit the species list.

The Campus Bird Count (CBC) 2020 which is a coordinated effort to document birds in campuses across the country including educational institutions, training and government institutions as well as research and corporate institutions will also take place during the same time. The participants similarly, have been asked to log onto the same website to record the species list as has been specified for the backyard bird count.

“There should be an awareness of what birds there are around us and the GBBC as well as the Campus bird count aims to do this. Several campuses even within the city limits have many birds which are yet to be documented and participating in this exercise would be a good starting point for students who wish to explore birding,” said A.M. Aravind, an avid birder from the city. He said that while most institutions have eco-clubs which have been carrying out bird walks, the newer campuses which don’t have clubs yet or haven’t carried out a bird count can approach birders from the city to guide them.

402,2020/02/12,Feasibility study for Light Rail between Tambaram and Velachery begins,"Chennai Metro Rail Ltd has chosen Light Rail along this stretch as the localities it will traverse are densely populated with not much road space

Chennai Metro Rail has recently begun the feasibility study for Light Rail project that will provide a link between Tambaram and Velachery.

According to Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL) officials, the study, carried out by the firm Systra, is likely to be finished in five months.

“The study will analyse and recommend the possible routes that can be taken to connect Tambaram with Velachery. It will give an estimate of how much the project is likely to cost, the period of construction and how far it may benefit people,” an official said.

The CMRL has chosen Light Rail along this stretch as the localities it will traverse are densely populated with not much road space. Light Rail can take sharp curves and the period of construction will be less than what it takes to build Metro Rail, the officials pointed out.

At a high-level meeting held recently, the CMRL was asked to complete the feasibility by July so that the project can be taken up at the earliest.

The top-brass in the government was briefed about the various options and how much it will cost if the stretch is built at-grade level, elevated and underground. “It is most likely to be built at-grade (on ground) and will cost about ₹100 crore per kilometre,” an official said.

Once the State government clears the feasibility report, the CMRL will take up detailed project report. “The DPR will be voluminous and elaborate, covering all aspects of the project, the estimated traffic and other details. If it gets approved by the State government, then the construction will begin,” an official said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/feasibility-study-for-light-rail-between-tambaram-and-velachery-begins/article30800192.ece
403,2020/02/12,Steep hike in cooking gas price for non-subsidised domestic consumers,"Consumers who buy non-subsidised domestic cylinders will now have pay ₹881 per refill, an increase of ₹147 over the previous rate

The price of cooking gas has shot up by ₹147 for the 14.2 kg non-subsidised domestic cylinder in the city. This is a quantum jump, considering the previous monthly revision on January 1 was only ₹20 per refill and the previous month, the price had been increased by ₹18.

Every month the price of domestic and commercial liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) is revised on the first day. This time, the government waited for results of the Delhi Assembly elections before announcing the new price, sources said.

Consumers who have already booked cylinders but are yet to get them will have to pay the new rate of ₹881 per refill, which is the price for non-subsidised domestic cylinders. The subsidised rate per cylinder will be ₹555.24 and the subsidy component of ₹325 will be transferred to the consumer’s account after the payment is made. In effect, customers who get subsidised cylinders will have pay an additional ₹7 from last month’s prices with the government including the hike in the subsidy component.

If customers have made payments online, they will have to pay the difference in price to the gas delivery personnel. This is because the distributors will be paying the revised rates for cylinders to the company. Fresh bills will be generated for these bookings, said a distributor.

“Such a steep hike should not have been passed on to non-subsidised consumers. Also, those who have paid online should be given the option of paying the difference too online instead of giving it to the delivery person,” said consumer activist T. Sadagopan.

There are around 60 lakh domestic LPG consumers in Chennai region who get gas refills from the State-run Indian Oil Corporation Ltd, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/j1kads/article30799924.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12FEBTH--LPG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/steep-hike-in-cooking-gas-price-for-non-subsidised-domestic-consumers/article30799925.ece
404,2020/02/12,"Chennai customs has arrears of ₹3,089 crore, says CAG","The Comptroller and Auditor General of India report for the financial year 2017-18, found Chennai customs had the second-highest quantum of arrears after Ahmedabad

The Chief Commissioner of Chennai Customs Zone has the second-highest quantum of arrears of custom duty totalling ₹3,089 crore in the financial year 2017-18 after Ahmedabad, according to a report by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG).

Out of the total, ₹2,470 crore is a sum under dispute, and ₹619 crore is the amount not under dispute, according to the CAG report for the year ending March 2018. The report contains significant results of the compliance audit of the Department of Revenue – Customs, under the Ministry of Finance and the Director General of Foreign Trade, under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.

The report was recently tabled in Parliament.

The time-wise analysis of arrears of amount not under dispute revealed that ₹269 crore has been pending for less than five years, ₹181 crore has been pending for over five years and ₹169 crore has been due for more than 10 years, under the Chennai Customs Zone.

Of the amount under dispute, ₹1,793 crore has been pending for less than five years, ₹368 crore for over five years and ₹309 crore for more than 10 years.

The CAG report also pointed to lapses in the levying of anti-dumping duty on certain goods. For instance, it said nylon filament yarn originating in, or exported from China, Taiwan, Malaysia, Thailand, Korea and Indonesia and imported into India is subject to anti-dumping duty at the rate varying between USD 0.20 to 1.51 per kg depending upon combinations of the producer and exporter. A total of 23 consignments of nylon filament yarn imported (July 2015 to January 2018) from China, Korea and Indonesia through Chennai Sea Commissionerate and ICD, Patparganj although correctly classified, were cleared without levy of applicable anti-dumping duty of ₹1.33 crore, the report said.

Meanwhile, it said imports of motor spirit were cleared without levying additional duty of customs. ‘Alkylate’, also known as ‘green petrol’ is 99% cleaner than regular petrol and is used to run boat engines, motorbikes, go-karts, mopeds etc. An additional duty of customs at the rate of ₹6 per litre is applicable as per a notification dated March 1, 2015, it said. In January 2017, an importer imported two consignments of Alkylate valued at ₹1,11.86 crore through Sea Customs, Chennai. The additional duty of customs at ₹6 per litre, applicable to petrol was not levied. The non-levy of additional duty of customs resulted in short levy of duty of ₹17.60 crore.

On this being pointed out, the department stated that demand notices have been issued to the importer and adjudication proceedings were in progress.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/bixg0m/article30798594.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12FEBTH-CAG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/chennai-customs-has-arrears-of-3089-crore-says-cag/article30798595.ece

409,2020/02/12,EAC returns port’s proposal on Coastal Employment Unit,"‘Panel will visit site and examine developments there’

The Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) of the Ministry of Environment has returned a proposal of Kamarajar Port Ltd (KPL) to set up a Coastal Employment Unit (CEU) for not selecting the proposed industrial estate site as per guidelines, violations at KPL, proposals to allow polluting sectors like pharma and chemical units and also for lying that there is no case pending against it in the courts.

Noting that there were violations at the Port, the EAC directed that its Committee will make a site visit and examine the developments at Kamarajar Port “considering several proposals are coming for EAC/TOR (Terms of Reference) in piecemeal manner by various project proponents thereby making it difficult to enumerate environmental impacts individually. There is a need to assess the cumulative impact of all the development activities in the Kamarajar Port region”.

₹217-crore project

KPL submitted before the EAC that the CEU aims at developing ‘port-proximate industrial manufacturing units’ that will lead to reduction in logistic cost and better utilisation of EXIM (export-import) and domestic cargo. The project was proposed to come up at Puzhuthivakkam and Athipattu, in Ennore, at a cost of ₹217 crore. KPL has proposed to house metallurgical, chemical fertilizers, petrochemical-based processing and synthetic organic chemical industries over 326.73 acres.

The EAC, after detailed deliberations, observed that the site selection for the proposed industrial estate was not planned in accordance to the guidelines of the CPCB’s programme on Zoning atlas. “The proponent (KPL) has mentioned that there is no court case pending against them. However, a legal case regarding alleged illegal dumping of dredged material is ongoing before the Hon’ble NGT,” the EAC noted adding that there was also violation reported at Kamarajar Port.

“Polluting sectors like Pharma and Chemical units are planned to be established in the proposed Industrial Estate/Cluster. EAC is of view that proponent shall establish only those industrial units, which are beneficial to local fishermen communities and other non-polluting units and not to establish any highly polluting chemical (pharma, petro etc) units,” the EAC said.

The Committee further directed KPL to redesign the proposal and also disclose the violations and ongoing or pending court cases before the EAC.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/eac-returns-ports-proposal-on-coastal-employment-unit/article30796263.ece

413,2020/02/12,Gang cheats several loan seekers,"Seven people, including three women, arrested; ₹11.75 lakh recovered from them

‘Five Star’ and ‘Seven Star’ are popular schemes for money doubling in Pudukottai and Thanjavur districts. Under the scheme, fraudsters, in a moving car, exchange five notes or seven notes for genuine currency in the guise of doubling money. Invariably, the notes handed over will be fake.

A gang that was part of such frauds moved to the city and indulged in online loan frauds by running call centres in Chennai and Bengaluru, revealed an investigation of Anti-Bank Fraud Wing. Seven people, including three women, were arrested last week. The police recovered ₹11.75 lakh from them. Offices in Chennai and Bengaluru have been sealed.

They ran a call centre in Pazhavanthangal. The accused engaged 40 tele-callers, most of them women, to lure applicants who wanted quick online loans.

A senior police officer said, “The tele-callers contacted mobile phone users in other districts and claimed to be representatives of a leading finance firm or nationalised banks. They offered personal and business loans at 8.5% through online method. They attracted gullible people stating they were not required to visit any bank for processing the loan.”

The tele-callers collected copies of the PAN card, Aadhaar card, salary statements through email. They offered ₹3 lakh to ₹15 lakh loan and said they would deduct ₹4,000 to ₹8,000 as processing fee. They then collected credit/ debit card details and OTP numbers and swindled huge amounts. “The gang is suspected to have cheated more than 1,000 persons.

414,2020/02/12,Arguments conclude in 2016 Udumalpet Shankar murder case appeals,"V. Shankar, a final year mechanical engineering student belonging to a Scheduled Caste, was hacked to death on March 13, 2016 for having married his collegemate C. Kowsalya belonging to Thevar (OBC) community.

The Madras High Court on Tuesday completed hearing arguments on appeals by six death convicts, one life convict and another imprisoned for five years, in the sensational 2016 Udumalpet Shankar murder case.

Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and M. Nirmal Kumar also wrapped up hearing an appeal by the State against the acquittal of three more accused by the trial court from what is perceived to be one of the most horrific caste killings in the State.

According to the prosecution, V. Shankar, a final year mechanical engineering student belonging to a Scheduled Caste, was hacked to death by an armed gang on March 13, 2016 for having married his collegemate C. Kowsalya belonging to Thevar (Other Backward Class) community. The crime was committed reportedly at the behest of the woman’s father B. Chinnasamy, mother C. Annalakshmi and maternal uncle P. Pandidurai, who had hired contract killers.

The Principal District and Sessions Court in Tiruppur had acquitted the woman’s mother, maternal uncle and one of the alleged hitmen, V. Prasanna alias Prasannakumar, from all charges on December 12, 2017. It, however, awarded death sentence was awarded to as many as six convicts including the woman’s father, his friend P. Jagatheesan and other assailants M. Manikandan, P. Selvakumar, P. Kalaithamilvaanan alias Tamil alias Kalai and M. Mathan alias Michael.

Two members of the gang K. Dhanraj alias Tamil alias Stephen Dhanraj and M. Manikandan were ordered to undergo imprisonment for life and five years respectively.

After pronouncing the verdict, the Sessions Court referred the matter to the High Court, as required under the CrPC, for confirming the death sentence imposed by it. After the reference, The convicts too filed individual appeals assailing their conviction and sentences.

Further, the State also appealed the acquittal of the three accused. Hence, all the appeals as well as the referred trial cases were clubbed together.

Effective hearing on the batch of cases began in February 2019 and the judges continued to list the cases at regular intervals almost every month. The hearing was conducted even through video conferencing since one of them had to go to the Madurai Bench of the High Court in the meantime.

The marathon arguments ended on Tuesday with senior counsel A.R.L. Sundaresan attempting to make a dent in the prosecution case by canvassing many supposed loopholes in the theory put forth by the police.

The judges directed the counsel to submit their written arguments on February 27 so that the judgment could be reserved.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/g49y8c/article30796071.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MADRASHIGHCOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/arguments-conclude-in-2016-udumalpet-shankar-murder-case-appeals/article30796072.ece
415,2020/02/12,The other Delhi is distant yet,"The Delhi elections have only underlined the vast gulf between the national power centre and the regional State

Being both the symbolic space that holds the reins of power over the nation-state and a geographical place that hosts millions of everyday lives, Delhi is politically split. Local elections in Delhi are neither simply provincial nor straightforwardly national. The Sufi saint Nizamuddin Auliya’s famous words, “Hunooz Dilli door ast” (Delhi is distant yet), apply to the city itself. Though they co-exist in the same city, the different avatars of Delhi can be quite far from each other. The elections to the Delhi State Assembly have underlined as never before the vast gulf between the national power centre and the regional State.

Study in contrasts

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) contested the Delhi election as though it was an extension of the 2019 Lok Sabha campaign. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) fought the election as though it was about municipal matters such as water and electricity and nothing else. The Indian National Congress (INC) pretended that it was not pretending to fight the election. These contrasting styles of campaigning point to the larger challenges facing not just our polity but the very idea of India today. But before looking at the reasons why this is so, a quick look at the result.

AAP won 62 of 70 Assembly seats, with the BJP bagging 8, while the INC experienced an even more emphatic whitewash than in 2015. But do these results support the swift and sure conclusions that are already being drawn by the pundits? Has achieving a second landslide win truly vindicated the AAP strategy of presenting itself as a non-ideological management consultancy that refuses to engage with the burning political issues of the day?

Does a second successive defeat in its Lok Sabha stronghold — where it won all seven seats in the past two general elections — mean that the BJP’s politics of hate has finally failed? And does a repeat rout in a State that it ruled for 15 years imply that the INC must now be issued a political death certificate? Though the details will become clear only later, it does look like the immediate answer to each of these questions must be a qualified no.

Even before the results were declared, it was clear that this was an election where the manner in which BJP conducted its campaign was more important — almost — than the outcome. It is hard to come up with another State election where electioneering has been so full of shrill, hate-filled aggression designed to incite violence.

In fact, the BJP tried its hardest to make this election into an anti-minority vendetta centred on the protests at Shaheen Bagh. Its formidable media resources were deployed to paint all opposition to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, or CAA, 2019, and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) as anti-national, terrorist-inspired, and based on paid protesters. The public language of politics was made to plumb new depths as senior leaders repeatedly said and did things that violated every norm of basic decency. The eventual outcome of this contest seemed to pale into insignificance in the face of the new norms of political engagement that were being enforced.

But the defeat of the BJP in Delhi does not necessarily mean that these tactics have backfired, or even that they have failed. It only means that they did not succeed in this place at this time. The big bonus for the BJP is that its strongest opponent did not oppose these tactics. In fact, AAP often seemed as if it was playing a different kind of dog whistle politics that was saying, in effect, “Don’t worry, we have no problem with communal politics, but please don’t ask us to say it openly.”

Now that it has won big, this policy of non-engagement is being presented as an astute strategy. But its short-term electoral gains need to be compared to its medium-term political costs. The BJP has been so successful in redrawing the terms of political discourse that not only AAP but most other political parties have been forced to take a few steps in the same direction to polish their majoritarian credentials.

Regional versus national

The consequences of this play-it-electorally-safe strategy are visible in the impasses of a polity split between the regional and national levels. A party with local roots strong enough to sweep two Assembly elections could not even get to second place in the parliamentary elections — AAP placed third in the Lok Sabha polls, behind the INC. On the other hand, despite having lost several State elections, the BJP continues to have an iron grip on the national polity and enjoys an unchallenged monopoly over agenda-setting at this level. In the past, our psephologist pundits nodded wisely at this emerging split in our electoral system and told us that it showed the shrewdness of the Indian voter who was pursuing different priorities at the two levels. Today, when all our institutions are being undermined and a pervasive climate of impunity for bigotry is being established, this interpretation seems not just unhelpful but dangerous in its complacency.

The irony is that the last two months have witnessed the emergence of a remarkable political effervescence that defies all the usual frameworks of definition. It cannot be called a movement for that word suggests something coordinated and planned. Nor are its objectives classifiable in the usual terms. Having crystallised around opposition to the CAA and NRC, this new energy and socially-rooted resolve is visible not only in named places such as Shaheen Bagh but also in numerous un-famous locations in campuses, neighbourhoods, towns and cities across India. This amazing political effervescence is raising questions about politics with a capital P, reminding us that the bedrock of citizenship is a shared sovereignty that we all inherit from the founding moment of our republic. Because it has successfully mobilised this hitherto untouched yet priceless political capital, this moment demands engagement in terms far more serious than those allowed by pragmatic self-preserving electoralism.

Congress’s options

This remarkable moment is also one which ought to encourage the INC to take more risks, since it is now a party with little left to lose. Its tale is perhaps without precedent in modern world history — a party which could effortlessly command a 25% voteshare in the world’s largest electorate, is now on the verge of political irrelevance. If it is able to draw energy from this moment to remake itself, it may reclaim its rightful place in our polity.

If they want to remain relevant in the India of tomorrow, all the non-BJP parties have to remind themselves that politics has to be about more than winning the next election, however important that may be as an immediate goal. Formulas that win elections may not ensure long-term relevance. After all, fascists can also make trains run on time and provide regular supplies of water and power. So, as we celebrate the well-deserved victory of the AAP, we must remind ourselves that the other Delhi is still far away.

417,2020/02/12,Asia and the Oscars,"It is heartwarming that South Korea’s Parasite, became the first foreign film to win the best picture and international feature category in the Oscars (‘Life’ page, February 11). It is a recognition to Asian films also, which lay more emphasis on familial bonds. The changing trend of Hollywood to include more actors from other countries and then award an Oscar is proof that the world is truly becoming a village. Indian filmmakers should understand that though cinema is a mass entertainer, quality is important. Our audience too has matured. We also have a rich culture and fine actors.

I recently had a court experience for the first time. The moment the judge took his seat, advocates swarmed the desk even before the clerk began calling out case numbers. This is the normal practice, I was told. Where is the need for advocates to swarm the desk? Then there was some jostling, shoving and pushing. All this could easily be avoided with just one minor change: why not have the plaintiff’s advocate approach the judge from one side and defendant’s advocate from the other side, from the left and right of the judge’s side I mean when their numbers are called? Their clients may be seated away on the benches on their respective sides and may be expected to only stand or raise their hand to mark their presence. Will this not convenience the representation and make it more dignified than have advocates and their clients crowding the judge’s desk as though the judge is conducting a discount sale?

418,2020/02/12,The Delhi result,"Has the Indian voter attained maturity? I am confident that this is happening if one is to go by recent trends in State elections. It was only recently that the ruling party at the Centre consolidated its position with a massive majority. But the opposite seems to be happening with the State polls: the voter appears to be closing the door on the ruling party. Is there a realisation that the top leadership of the ruling party is only full of rhetoric and there is no co-ordination between what they say and what happens? The peace and tranquillity of the country have been disturbed by whimsical policies. It would not be an exaggeration to say that there is confusion and an air of uncertainty. There does not seem to be any visible effects of developmental programmes. Following the Delhi result, the Central government should stop its strategy of igniting passions. The Indian National Congress should pull up its socks and work with zeal and enthusiasm to inform the electorate that it is the only alternative that can take the BJP head on.

What a decisive and resounding hat-trick for the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) led by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal. It is a reflection of governance and honest work taking precedence over propaganda and polarisation. The AAP victory shows that Delhi cares for good governance. This is a big relief for many in not only Delhi but across the country because the campaigning saw the BJP carry out one of the most incendiary and divisive campaigns ever in the history of Indian elections. The AAP’s refreshing approach to campaigning — purely based on civics, completely bereft of anything to do with identity, religion or caste — is unheard of in modern India, even in Kerala, a State considered progressive. Indeed, the AAP’s biggest unsaid contribution could just be restoring faith in politics, a profession often associated with gangsters and sycophancy.

Another most fascinating aspect of the victory shown is simmering anger and a palpable distancing of the younger generation from the BJP’s medieval outlook. The party’s greed for power is now so unbridled and its ambition so audacious that it deliberately invoked the most dangerous mantras to befuddle people and create hatred where none existed, at least not in any significant form. Delhi is not just another State or city. It is the heart of the country. Let us hope that the men who matter in this country will hear the heartbeats.

Democracy is still alive. Delhi is a miniature India with diverse cultural and cosmopolitan groups drawn from all States of India. The rejection of the BJP’s electioneering gives those who are genuinely interested in the nation’s welfare hope. Social and religious tolerance has become a practical necessity. The Delhi election results have also established emphatically the long cherished ideas of cultural pluralism in which a wide variety of cultural forms and religions coexist.

G. Stanley Jeyasingh,

Nagercoil, Tamil Nadu

The people of Delhi have given a befitting reply to the divisive politics employed by the ruling party at the Centre. Will the leadership now understand that the politics of hate and religion does not cut ice especially in an environment of unemployment and economic doom? Delhi shows that elections can still be fought and won on the agenda of development despite many provocations. This should also serve as a benchmark for future election campaigns and show the mirror to parties that indulge in hate mongering. The next test is Bihar.

Maqsood Haider,

Noida

Those who care for democratic and secular values owe a debt of gratitude to the AAP and Mr. Kejriwal for trumping the divisive and polarising campaign of the BJP and proving that concern for the common man and his livelihood can still win an election in India. The message for the Opposition parties, especially the Congress, appears to be that they should shed their belief that soft Hindutva is a sine qua non to contain the BJP .

Manohar Alembath,

Kannur, Kerala

The repeated and consistent performance of Mr. Kejriwal and his team in the Assembly elections speak volumes of the confidence reposed in them by the Delhi electorate. The victory proves that the measures and reforms adopted by the AAP are in the right direction and that the party has performed to the expectations of the people of Delhi. It also proves that the BJP will have to toil and moil if it has to hold the reins of administration of the most important region of the nation.

Jiji Panicker K.,

Vyramon, Chengannur, Kerala

Mr. Kejriwal has proved that he is in fact the David who took on the evil Goliaths. The blow to the BJP by Delhiites demonstrates a few things: people are carried away only by performance and not by empty vitriols; people are fed up with arrogance, autocracy and, more importantly, the divide and rule policy of the ruling dispensation. The hate campaign carried on by the motormouths within the BJP went against the party

Tharcius S. Fernando,

Chennai

The AAP could coast to a spectacular victory riding on the crest of the development plank, and relegating any threat of an anti-incumbency factor to the back burner. Throughout the campaign, the AAP was careful enough to concentrate on highlighting its governance rather than taking the Prime Minister head on, and avoiding hate politics. It is credible that the party could transcend the barriers of caste and communal equations, carrying all sections of society along with it. The BJP’s attempt to exploit the Shaheen Bagh protest to its advantage misfired. Considering that BJP wrested all the Lok Sabha seats in Delhi recently, its marginally improved tally in the Assembly could hardly be of any consolation. With the lack of a viable Opposition party or an able leader of national stature, it is time for the AAP to spread its wings far and wide, instead of confining itself to only Delhi. With age on his side, Mr Kejriwal could surely make a difference by taking a plunge in the national politics, targetting the younger generation. For the BJP and the Congress, it is time for introspection to decide on who should lead the party — is it just a charismatic leader for the sake of getting votes or a leader with a clear vision who can deliver the goods for the party as well as the common man, with an all inclusive approach?

V. Subramanian,

The Kejriwal-led AAP government is all set for a third term in the national capital. It shows a clear win for “work and development” as against the “divisive” politics of the BJP. The people of Delhi have reposed their faith in the work done by Mr. Kejriwal and his government’s policies. Delhi has chosen a government which works for its people and shown the red flag to the politics of hate.

Simran Agarwal,

Jaipur, Rajasthan

The Aam Aadmi Party’s victory in the Delhi Assembly Elections strongly indicates that a majority of the capital’s electorate has outrightly rejected the BJP’s divisive agenda which piggybacked on communal polarisation. Development-focused politics has trumped over incendiary rhetoric. For those in power at the Centre, this should be a remider that the politics of hatred is passé.

Adrian David,

Chennai

The AAP’s resounding victory comes as a great relief and is a befitting reply to the politics of hate, rancour and divisiveness aggressively pursued by the BJP. The perceived invincibility of the BJP has been proved a myth by good, corruption-free governance that sincerely sought to address the basic bread and butter issues of the people braving the hostilities of the Central government. The result is a strong rejoinder to the BJP to halt the ruthless imposition of its majoritarian agenda on an unwilling country using its numerical dominance in Parliament and throwing to the wind the great principles of equality and secularism guaranteed by the Constitution. The melting pot of Delhi, a microcosm of India, has sent out the clear message that the country is against communally polarising policies that undermine the nation’s cherished tenets. The result holds out a lesson or two for the Congress too — that it has to shed its overdependence on a single family and search for an able and credible leader.

S. Rajasekharan Nair,

Thiruvananthapuram

The AAP’s emphatic victory is significant on many counts. It had shown in unequivocal terms of not only voter preference for development politics but also his outright rejection of politics aimed at polarising voters on religious lines in order to reap electoral dividends. While the AAP faced the Assembly polls on the plank of its discernible performance when it came to delivering good governance and fulfilling people’s needs, the BJP whipped up communal frenzy with its leaders resorting to vitriolic and vituperative rhetoric with a clear objective to polarise voters. That the Hindutuva gameplan, and muscular nationalism did not fetch it the expected electoral victory in the national capital holds an important lesson to the BJP’s leadership. For the Congress which ruled the roost for several years under the dynamic leadership of Sheila Dikshit in Delhi, its washout should serve as a wake up call for its leadership to work hard towards regaining the trust of Delhi.

M. Jeyaram,

Sholavandan, Tamil Nadu

The AAP’s resounding win is to be seen as a pointer to the shape of emerging welfare politics and governance in the country. Essentially, the people of Delhi across the spectrum of demography have reposed faith in a performing government. Mr. Kejriwal’s focus on health and education has helped him regain power. His government has also ensured last mile delivery of welfare governance, impacting the lives of women and the poor. The verdict has significantly opened up another chapter in the politics of governance. It has been proved that better performing governments will be always brought back to power even in the midst of highly polarised and vitriolic electoral campaigns.

G. Ramasubramanyam,

Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh

The resounding victory of Mr. Kejriwal’s AAP amply demonstrates the voters’ political maturity in refusing to be swayed by the vitriolic ranting of hatred against members of minority community indulged in by the BJP. It is also a triumph of good governance over any kind of vilification or demonisation of a particular community vitiating social cohesiveness. It speaks of Mr. Kejriwal and his team’s amazing maturity in refusing to be provoked to the extreme. The Prime Minister’s silence over such diatribe is indeed worrisome. The ruling party needs to learn that boasting about national policies does not necessarily ensure electoral success. The AAP has shown a refreshingly new paradigm shift in electioneering.

S.K. Choudhury,

Bengaluru

The voters of Delhi deserve all praise for showing maturity and wisdom by teaching the ruling party at the Centre a befitting lesson; it indulged in a highly toxic electoral campaign to polarise voters with obsolete rhetoric, replete with ultra nationalism and an aggressive Hindutva agenda. The BJP’s devious plans to drag Mr. Kejriwal into debates over issues pertaining to citizenship and religion were effectively countered by Mr. Kejriwal who focussed his campaign on welfare and good governance.

Opposition leaders need to emulate Mr. Kejriwal’s strategy so as to be in a position to stop the Modi juggernaut. Delhi has shown that the BJP is not invincible provided the Opposition is helmed by a sincere and honest leader who wins the trust and confidence of the people with hard work and with vision and an action plan that covers public transport, power and water supply, education and health care.

N. Raveendra Babu,

Hyderabad

All the efforts of the BJP to upset the apple cart of Arvind Kejriwal and the Aam Aadmi Party have come to nought; most Delhi voters have overwhelmingly exercised their franchise in favour of the AAP. For the BJP which waged a relentless battle unleashing its entire electoral machinery and engaging a battery of topnotch campaigners, the lessons could be tough. The highly intemperate and vituperative campaign only ended up vitiating the atmosphere with no dividends whatsoever. Mr. Kejriwal wisely decided to turn his attention to governance. As for the Congress it is evident that it will have no further role to play in Delhi politics as the voters have rejected it lock, stock and barrel. The party is in no position to challenge either the AAP or the BJP.

C.V. Aravind,

Bengaluru

The AAP may have much to be happy about but what cannot be lost sight of is that it has lost seats; the BJP has improved its tally which shows that its national policies have still been welcomed by the electorate. The Congress has come a cropper and has been almost written off as a political party. The absence of a promising leader, the absence of constructive and positive work and the inability to reconstruct the party as there are no grass-root level workers are all evident. It is sad that the party that once ruled India has become a non-entity in the hands of its present leadership.

V. Lakshmanan,

Tirupur, Tamil Nadu

Considering that strong winds of pro-incumbency were blowing across Delhi, the AAP’s victory was a foregone conclusion. The only area where any surprise was possible was the number of seats that the party would cede to the BJP. Delhi’s voters, like their counterparts in other States, have cultivated the keen insight to view Assembly elections solely as a referendum on the ruling party’s performance. They saw no reason to unseat the AAP from power as the party had eased the livelihood pains that confronted the common people perceptibly. Facing a deficit of governance issues to attack the AAP government, the BJP had no choice but to divert attention to national issues despite realising the futility of such a strategy.

Contrary to the Opposition’s expectations, the AAP’s victory will have no ripple effect on national politics. The poll outcome offers no new template to defeat the BJP on the national stage. The AAP cannot develop complacency and forget that it is a Delhi-centred regional party, a fact that Mr. Kejriwal knows too well. He would not like to fritter away people’s trust and risk losing his grip on Delhi for the sake of pursuing an illusory Opposition unity. For his political future, the chieftainship of a glorified municipality is more respectable than the unsavoury prospect of ending up as an also-ran in national politics.

419,2020/02/12,Hanging out with Sundari akka,"Her stall is on Google Maps, she swaps recipes with international cooks and is currently running a Marina beach food festival at the Westin hotel kitchen. We spend an inspiring day with Sundari

Her day begins at 2 am, and she works till midnight. Her infectious smile and sense of humour have fetched her fans who throng her food stall at the Marina beach.

Business means business to Sundari Shekar or Sundari akka, as she is fondly called. It is nearly impossible to get her to talk when she is at her stall; she is busy multi tasking and micro managing all aspects of the eatery that she set up in 1999. “I am a stickler for quality, and will never compromise. I train my 20-odd staff to clean fish thoroughly such that when they drop a piece in water, it should be crystal clear. Rice is cooked at the stall as I want it to be piping hot. The other items, such as marinated fish, are prepared at home,” she says.

“My motto is serving nalla sappadu (good food) at a pocket-friendly price,” says Sundari. Her business was initially a huge hit among auto-drivers in the locality. “It was much later, with the advent of social media, that I became popular not only in Chennai, but across the globe. I feel elated when a customer tells me that he or she flew down just to taste my food. Many chefs from overseas also come to eat at my stall,” she says.

Her menu is limited: she serves rice, meen kuzhambu, varieties of fried fish, prawns and squid. For vegetarians there is sambar, rasam and buttermilk, served with omelettes.

Until two years ago, this 53-year-old rode on her bicycle to Kasimedu at 4 am to procure fresh fish for the day. “I personally choose good quality fish. What I get on a particular day will determine the day’s menu. Even if the cost of fish fluctuates, I try and keep my prices constant,” she says.

Sundari was recently invited by The Westin Chennai Velachery to present her signature dishes for guests, as part of its food festival, Flavours From The Grand Marina Beach (on till February 17). “When we approached her, she refused outright as she said her customers were her priority, but finally her son Nagamurthi, who has a degree in Hotel Management, convinced her,” says Executive Chef Ganesh Teli. Sous Chef N Murugesh, who curated the dishes, accompanied Sundari during her Kasimedu expeditions.

“She uses her own hand-pound spices, the secret ingredients of which she refuses to reveal,” says Murugesh, who has visited her stall several times just to observe her working style. Murugesh has learnt some of Sundari’s recipes, such as kadama (squid) and era (prawn) thokku, as well as her famous meen kuzhambu. “But, there is no fun in eating in this air-conditioned restaurant,” smiles Sundari. “My food tastes best when had piping hot amid sea breeze.”

How was the experience of cooking in the huge kitchen of a five-star hotel? “I can cook anywhere in any condition, but my issue was something else. Having cooked huge dabaras of food, I found it tough to scale down. It was like asking a college goer to sit for LKG classes,” she laughs.

While people swear by her fish fry, she says her favourite meal is simple: pazhaya sadam with karuvadu thokku.

Paul Pradeep, a loyal customer at her stall says, “Although called Kaanavur Unavagam, we know her stall only by her name.”

When chefs from overseas invite her to their country, Sundari politely refuses by saying that her meen kuzhambu will not be tasty if not made with Chennai water. “This Sundari prefers to run one film in one theatre for many years, rather than running one film in multiple theatres for just one week or month. Ennoda philosophy puriyudha ungalukku?” she asks.

And how does one find her stall at the Marina? She says, “If you have a smart phone, just tell Google Maps to take you to Sundari Akka Marina Beach, and you will get there.”

Akka’s menu

Kadama (squid)thokku

Yera (Prawn) thokku

Varutha meen (shallow fried fish)

Meen Kulambu (fish gravy)

Avicha mutta (boiled egg)

Mutta (egg) omelette

A meal consisting of one portion of rice, with a slice of fish with gravy and one boiled egg costs Rs 120.

420,2020/02/12,‘TV has played an important role in making people aware of cuisines’: Chef Abhijit Saha,"The chef-entrepreneur talks about his new book, Caperberry The Cookbook, Bengaluru’s food scene and more

Founding director and chef, Avant Garde Hospitality Pvt Ltd, Abhijit Saha, is behind some of the city's well-known restaurants such as Fava, Rock Salt and the modernist European restaurant with a focus on Spain, Caperberry, which completed 10 years in 2019. The celebrity chef who has 29 years of experience, including 12 years as a chef-entrepreneur, in the industry recently released his book, Caperberry The Cookbook. Abhijit sat down for a chat with MetroPlus to talk about his book, Bengaluru's food scene and more. Excerpts:

What inspired you to write this book? Can you elaborate on the process of putting it together?

I had been thinking about writing a book for a long time. Finally, when we realised that Caperberry was going to complete 10 years, I told myself I must think about starting it early. I started four years ago and saw what I had with me that could go into the book. I wanted to create a story that would be useful.

This is one of the projects which is dear to me. It took a lot of time and effort and energy to put this together. I always knew it was difficult to write a book. This is not a recipe book. It tells you a story of over 10 years. So you have to make sure everything is in the right sequence.

We are a modern European restaurant with a focus on Spain, located in Bangalore. That is why the book starts with the story of Bangalore then it talks about my journey in Spain, about the inspiration. And it also talks about the things we have done, how we opened the restaurant how we did training programmes, events and festivals and so on. We also have a good wine list and Karnataka being a wine producing state, even those wines are highlighted.

The idea was that it should be a book which people in Bangalore and India would be proud of. My aim was always to write a book, which would be of the highest quality.

It took us two years to do the photoshoot for the book. We shot approximately 600 recipes, and then chose 100 to go into the book.

Who is the book targeted at?

It is not just for home cooks or people who buy books, but also for young chefs, student chefs and anybody who wants to learn about setting up a restaurant. The aim of writing the book was to give a thorough understanding of how to set up a restaurant.

A lot of restaurants open and close quickly. What are some of the factors that ensure a successful business? The idea of opening a restaurant is exciting. To run it well, however, maintain the quality and keep going in difficult times (because there will be ups and downs) and managing and inspiring the team is important. One must have good knowledge of the subject, an idea and whether the market needs such a concept. Apart from real estate costs, there are a lot of hidden expenses which one may not realise.

How has the food scene in Bengaluru changed from 2009?

It has exploded. Then, there are breweries, QSR (quick service restaurants) and cloud kitchens, and the aggregators such as Swiggy and Zomato.

The excitement of dining in a restaurant or going to a nice bar, cannot be replaced by a cloud kitchen. Going out and eating at a restaurant is a social experience. There has been an explosion of restaurants in Bangalore. The oversupply has led to a situation where there is a lot of predatory marketing. At any point in time, many of the restaurants, are in distress. They want to run somehow and they make offers that are neither feasible or nor sustainable. Social media is creating a lot of awareness, but at the same time a lot of clutter in the minds of people. It is difficult sometimes to distinguish the quality of a restaurant because it could be that the person who is making the loudest noise on social media is the one that is becoming popular. Government rules and regulations don't help sometimes.

So many restaurants are being forced to close, which is not at all healthy for the business. Ultimately, then it will lead to a situation where people would not be excited, and any city that does not have a vibrant restaurant and night life is not worth visiting anymore.

You have been a judge on MasterChef. Have people’s knowledge and perceptions of different cuisines increased?

Yes, television has played an important role in making people aware. With people seeing the back-of-the-house situation, they understand how much work goes into creating some dishes and the kind of pressure people can be under to deliver good quality food.",food,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/we9uvn/article30795713.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12BGM-CHEFABHIJIT1,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/tv-has-played-an-important-role-in-making-people-aware-of-cuisines-chef-abhijit-saha/article30795714.ece

Mumbai Police Commissioner Sanjay Barve on Wednesday acknowledged that a firm owned by his son and wife was given a project to digitise the city police’s records but said the services were offered free of cost and there was “no question” of any financial gain.

The project, awarded by the previous BJP government in Maharashtra before the assembly elections in October last year, did not take off due to some technical issues, an official added.

The firm, CrispQ Information Technologies Pvt Ltd, offered its services “free of cost and there was no question of any financial gains to it”, said Mr. Barve.

“The company had offered its service pro bono and it was for the benefit of the Mumbai Police,” he said.

The project to digitise the records was awarded to CrispQ Information Technologies for five years by the Devendra Fadnavis-led government.

The company is owned by Mr. Barve’s son Sumukh Barve and wife Sharmila Barve.

On September 30, 2019, the firm sent a proposal to the state government, offering “pro bono” (work undertaken voluntarily and without payment) services to provide a paperless office system to the Mumbai Police through a software called Notesheet Plus, an official said.

A copy of the proposal was marked to the Chief Minister’s Office (CMO), he said.

Records, complaints and service documents of Mumbai Police personnel were to be digitised with the help of the software, the official explained.

The proposal was approved by the government as the company was going to do the work for free, and the Mumbai Police Commissioner’s office was also directed to finalise the number of units and files for the digitisation work, he said.

However, the project did not start due to some technical issues, he added.

In a bid to counter the ruling Shiv Sena’s politics of subsidised food, the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Maharashtra on Tuesday launched its own cheap lunch plate to mark the death anniversary of Jana Sangh leader Deendayal Upadhyaya.

Priced at ₹30, the Deendayal thali will have more items than the ₹10 Shiv bhojan launched by the Sena-led State government on January 26 to cater to the poor.

The Deendayal lunch plate includes three chapatis, a bowl of rice, two vegetables, peanut chutney and mango pickle, while the Shiv bhojan thali comes with two chapatis, a 100 gm serving of vegetables, 150 gm of rice, and a bowl of dal.

The BJP has enlisted the help of women self-help groups affiliated to the party for the thali scheme.

The lunch plate was launched in the temple town of Pandharpur in Solapur district on Tuesday. It will be made available across the State later, a BJP leader said. The Deendayal thali centre in Pandharpur is set up near the famous temple of Lord Vitthal. It was inaugurated by former minister Subhash Deshmukh.

State Transport Minister Anil Parab has sought ₹600 crore in the State budget 2020-21 to procure 2,000 new buses for the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC).

The corporation, chaired by Mr. Parab, has already approved the proposal in its board meeting, a release stated. The MSRTC is one of the biggest public transport undertakings in the country with a fleet of at least 18,500 buses that ferry over 65 lakh passengers every day.

According to the release, the MSRTC had sought ₹186 crore for new buses in the last financial year. However, the State had alloted ₹110 crore, with which the corporation managed to purchase 700 buses, 500 ordinary ones and 200 ‘vithai’ pilgrimage buses to Pandharpur. Highlighting the rise in demand, Mr. Parab claimed that the highest number of passengers use MSRTC buses to travel within the 60-km radius between villages, talukas and districts.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/msrtc-seeks-600-cr-for-2000-new-buses/article30797667.ece
425,2020/02/12,High profile flesh trade racket busted in Mumbai,"An online sex racket, targeting rich people and foreign nationals, was busted after the Crime Branch raided a hotel in Saki Naka. One person, believed to be the kingpin, was arrested and two victims rescued, an official said on Tuesday.

The gang had posted mobile phone numbers on ‘massage republican.com’ to take calls from customers, with the focus being to trap rich people and foreign nationals, the official said.

“We have arrested one Jatun Mahadeo Yadav (37), a resident of Mahakali Caves in Andheri East. Two victims forced into the flesh trade were rescued during the raid conducted by Unit X of Crime Branch,” he said.

A decoy customer, he said, contacted the number displayed on the website. He was asked to come to an upmarket hotel in Saki Naka, after which the Unit X team, led by police inspector Sunil Mane, raided the place on Monday.

“Two SIM cards and cash were seized from Yadav. A case was registered at Saki Naka police station under Prevention of Immoral Trafficking Act and efforts are on to nab others involved,” he added. Investigating officers said the racket has been operating for at least five years and during this time, the accused are believed to have forced scores of girls from low income backgrounds into the flesh trade.

“The two girls rescued by us are from West Bengal and our decoy was charged ₹15,000 each for them. The racket was being run across India. The accused have also sent several girls to work in dance bars in Dubai. We are obtaining details so that their information can be shared with the authorities in Dubai,” a senior Crime Branch officer said.

426,2020/02/12,"With promise of U.S. dollars, man cheats people; held","The Crime Branch has arrested a 47-year-old man for allegedly cheating at least six men from Navi Mumbai, promising American dollars. The accused, identified as Mohammed Jehangir Mujahiddin Sheikh, who originally hails from Delhi, was nabbed from Shilphata on Saturday. The police suspect involvement of two more men in the crimes.

There was a rise in cases of people falling prey to such fraudsters. While the respective police stations were investigating, Unit III of the Crime Branch started parallel inquiries.

“With the help of CCTV footage in one of the incidents, we could identify the accused. With the help of informers we found that the person seen in the footage resided at Shilphata,” senior police inspector Vijay Kadbane from Unit III said.

A team of officers, including assistant police inspector Sagar Pawar and sub-inspector Sunil Sawant, laid a trap for four days at Shilphata. “It took us four days to locate the house of the accused. Once he was traced, we nabbed him. At the time of arrest, he was alone, but we are looking for his accomplices,” Mr. Pawar said.

Mr. Sheikh was wanted in six cases, of which two were registered with the Kharghar police, three with the Rabale police, and one with the APMC police. The total money the victims were cheated of is estimated at ₹11.5 lakh.

The modus operandi of Mr. Sheikh and his aides was to befriend anyone at a tea stall, waiters in hotels and autorickshaw drivers, and start a conversation. “The accused would then say that they were caretakers of a rich senior citizen who recently passed away. And the son of the deceased gave away a lot of belongings to them in which they found American dollars. They would then say that they didn’t know what should be done with those and were ready to exchange them for half the price,” Mr. Kadbane said.

When the complainants would meet the accused after arranging the money, they would give them a bundle wrapped in a cloth. “The first two notes would be real dollars while the rest would be plain papers,” he said.

Mr. Sheikh is currently in custody of the Kharghar police and further investigations are on.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/with-promise-of-us-dollars-man-cheats-people-held/article30796061.ece

428,2020/02/12,‘India should take a leaf out of Sweden’,"Brazilian writer Claudia Wallin says citizens should access politicians’ expenses

Brazilian author and journalist Claudia Wallin on Tuesday spoke about how countries like India and her motherland could take inspiration from Sweden’s transparency laws to help citizens access the income and expenses of politicians to see where the taxpayers’ money was going.

Ms. Wallin was in Mumbai to speak about her book ‘Sweden — The Untold Story’, which released last year in English. The author stressed on how it is an important subject because if one is paying taxes, they are entitled to some accountability.

“I think everyone should be able to see through the records of how the ones in authority are spending their hard-earned money, because that ensures a country progresses without corruption,” she said. Ms. Wallin researched the transparency law for her book.

“I called the supreme commander of the armed forces of Sweden and demanded to see his expenses, which were sent to me. I did the same thing with the prime minister, [and the expenses were] also sent to me,” she said.

Ms. Wallin’s book talks about a very different method of politics. In Sweden, politicians are not demi-gods, they use public transport and live in state apartments, some as small 16 sq.m. “The only privilege they have is that they receive cards to use public transport. Sweden was relatively poor and corrupt 150 years ago, but the history of the country shows the process of education in a series of political and administrative reforms can help make a society more egalitarian,” she said.

The author also cited massive movements and protests by workers and women in Sweden in the past, which led to major socio-economic consciousness among citizens and politicians. Ms. Wallin said social movements show no change is ever given from the top, but is built from the bottom of society, when citizens become conscious of their rights.

“A democracy should be such that even a minor case of corruption is treated as a scandal and highlighted just like it is in Sweden. My book also critiques Sweden, because I believe no country is all rosy,” she said.

Ms. Wallin spoke about how one can go to parliament and government offices in Sweden to look at laws or new reforms that a member of parliament or official is planning to introduce. “This can help a journalist raise awareness. If this is implemented in India, it can lead to a positive impact.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/hhugal/article30796012.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12bm-photo,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/india-should-take-a-leaf-out-of-sweden/article30796013.ece
429,2020/02/12,65-year-old woman murdered in Powai; hunt on for husband,"Police find no weapon in house; neighbours do not know much about Lad family

A 65-year-old woman was found to have been murdered in her Powai residence on Monday. Her husband, who has been missing since Sunday, is being treated as a suspect in the crime.

According to the Powai police, Sheela Lad, a homemaker, used to live with her husband Ajit at Shiv Shakti Nagar. The murder came to light on Monday night after the Lads’ neighbours, who had not seen them all day, suspected that something was wrong and called the police.

“We suspect that the victim was attacked with a sharp weapon, but have not found a murder weapon in the house. She had sustained several injuries to her head,” police sub-inspector Ramesh Bhosale, who is the investigating officer, said.

The Lads had been staying on rent for the last eight months. However, neighbours do not seem to know much about them, except for a vague impression of Mr. Lad being a government servant.

“Ever since they moved here, they would step out of their house every Sunday. Sheela used to spend most of her time reading newspapers or playing with children in the area. We were surprised to notice that neither of them came out of the house for nearly two days, and hence decided to inform the police,” Sharanjeet Kaur, whose father owns the Lad residence, said.

Ms. Kaur said the Lads were known to be a quiet and friendly family, with only a few instances of delay in paying the rent. “We did not hear any untoward noises from their house on Sunday. There was nothing that could have led us to suspect that something so unpleasant could have happened,” she said.

Sheela’s body was taken to Rajawadi Hospital for post-mortem. The police have registered a case of murder against unknown persons under the Indian Penal Code. “Efforts are on to apprehend Mr. Lad,” Mr. Bhosale said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/aoedy2/article22888459.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-stock-rape-delhi-20180301,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/65-year-old-woman-murdered-in-powai-hunt-on-for-husband/article30795980.ece
430,2020/02/12,Scribes urge State to protect Aarey from further destruction,"Minister to seek guidance on sites to shift Metro car shed

The Forum of Environmental Journalists in India (FEJI), a countrywide network of journalists, has urged the State government to take immediate steps to protect the Aarey forest from further environmental degradation.

In a memorandum submitted to State Environment and Tourism Minister Aaditya Thackeray, FEJI called for paying special attention to adding more buses and introducing bus lanes while ceasing massive projects on private vehicular transport, as well as taking action to address the current crisis in water, air and environmental degradation in the State.

Mr. Thackeray in return sought guidance from experts in identifying sites for shifting the controversial, planned Metro car shed from Aarey. “I want to increase, within one year, buses running on electricity not only within Mumbai city but also in the State,” he said. He also intends to plant four lakh trees in Mumbai.

In a statement, FEJI said the minister was receptive to the journalists’ request to address environmental pollution in the State, being well aware about reducing Maharashtra’s carbon and water footprint. He also spoke of increasing the number of cities in Maharashtra that carried out recycling and reuse of water, it said.

Speaking of his intentions on integrating climate change concerns for all departments, Mr. Thackeray said, “I will a hold a conference on climate change issues involving all departments. Every department should be concerned about climate change and arrange their agenda accordingly.”

FEJI had recently held a seminar in collaboration with the Mumbai Press Club on environmental and climate change issues for Mumbai, with Aarey in focus.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/scribes-urge-state-to-protect-aarey-from-further-destruction/article30795978.ece
431,2020/02/12,HC seeks Esplanade Mansion repair estimate from landlord,"State, MHADA tell court they are unable to bear the expense

The Bombay High Court on Tuesday directed the landlord of Esplanade Mansion, which houses 146 tenants, to submit an estimate of the cost to conserve and restore the 153-year-old building, by February 20.

A Division Bench of Justices S.J. Kathawalla and B.P. Colabawalla issued the direction after experts submitted differing estimates for the work. While one expert said the restoration would cost ₹23 crore, another said it would cost ₹98 crore.

Meanwhile, the State government and the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (MHADA) informed the court that they were not in a position to bear the expense for the work.

Conservation architect Abha Narain Lambah said the work would require ₹98 crore when one takes into account the structural and architectural stability, and that the premises have to be habitable, which means restoring the interior of the structure and providing basic amenities like electricity.

Chetan Raikar, a structural engineer from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur, submitted an estimate of ₹23 crore, but said the amount was only for restoring the structure. He said if internal expenses were to be considered, the estimate would come to ₹45-50 crore.

MHADA, meanwhile, submitted that it did not have funds to foot the restoration of the privately owned structure. The State government, despite having assured UNESCO that it will take efforts to restore the heritage structure, said it was not willing to bear the additional burden on the exchequer as this was a private building.

The Bench had earlier appointed an independent committee comprising Mr. Raikar, Ms. Lambah and conservation architect Vikas Dilawari after divergent views about the structure had come up.

The landlord and tenants had said the building was not as dilapidated as claimed by an IIT Bombay report, which had recommended the structure’s demolition. The Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) had backed the landlords and tenants’ claim that the IIT Bombay report had several flaws and the building could be repaired and restored.

Another Division Bench of the HC had previously raised the query that as the structure did not belong to the State, MHADA or the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, was it possible for the government to authorise either MHADA or a planning authority to undertake repairs to a private building. “Importantly and pertinently, who will bear the cost of these repairs, assuming that it is technically possible. The difficulty being that right to property may not be a fundamental right any longer, but it is a constitutional right, nonetheless and the Article 300A (no person shall be deprived of his property save by the authority of law) of the Constitution of India comes into play,” it had said.

The Bench had said that if the owner wished to repair, restore and preserve the structure, his right was paramount in character, and “if he has to be deprived of it by the process known to law, then, this court would have to be enlightened as to whether the State government is prepared to take these steps”.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/vx3g5/article30795959.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12BMESPLANADEMANSION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/hc-seeks-esplanade-mansion-repair-estimate-from-landlord/article30795960.ece
432,2020/02/12,"Protest march in Delhi against CAA, NRC","Activists, politicians speak in support of Mumbai Bagh protesters

Government servant-turned-activist Kannan Gopinathan on Tuesday said a massive protest march was being planned in Delhi against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the National Population Register (NPR).

Addressing a press conference at the Mumbai Press Club along with civil rights activist Teesta Setalvad and former IAS officer Sasikanth Senthil, Mr. Gopinathan said, “Citizens from all over the country are planning a Chalo Delhi march to show [the government] the number of people that are against these laws and exercises.” He said the dates have not been decided, but the march will be held before April, when the government plans to implement the NPR.

Ms. Setalvad said the government has betrayed the people by combining the NPR with the census. “The citizens are offended to such an extent that they might not provide data even for the national census, polio scheme and other data registers. The government should scrap NPR so that other data registers are not affected,” she said.

Mr. Senthil said the government is carrying out the NPR exercise only to implement the NRC. “If they say they don’t want to do anything with the collected data, then why are they even collecting it? If the people do not help the government in carrying out the NPR, it becomes a failure,” he said.

Mr Gopinathan also made an appearance at the Mumbai Bagh protest at Mumbai Central, which entered its 16th day on Tuesday. Activist Medha Patkar and Mumbai Congress president Eknath Gaikwad were also at the venue.

Ms. Patkar said, “Demonetisation couldn’t expose black money, and CAA will not affect intruders. Even Hindus have been labelled Bangladeshis in West Bengal. Of the 19 lakh people dismissed from Assam, about 13 lakh are Hindus.”

Mr. Gaikwad said the BJP is coming up with unconstitutional laws because it cannot fulfil its promises. “BJP ministers of Bihar and Assam are now opposing this unconstitutional law, and we welcome the development. The Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party and Congress are in full support of the people. Even if the police issue notices, the government will withdraw them,” he said, referring to the notices issued by the Nagpada police to the protesters.

Policeman suspended

Meanwhile, Home Minister Anil Deshmukh on Tuesday announced the suspension of assistant police inspector Ghanshyam Borse, one of the two police officers accused of assaulting photojournalist Ashish Raje at Mumbai Bagh last week. The probation period of the other officer, police sub-inspector Azim Shiakh, has also been extended.

A delegation of journalists and photographers met the Home Minister on Tuesday. During the meeting, Joint Commissioner of Police, law and order, Vinoy Choubey opposed Mr. Borse’s suspension, saying it would affect the morale of the force.

The Mumbai Press Club termed the action as a “victory of journalists’ unity”.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/cnuruy/article30795916.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12BMMEDHAPATKAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/protest-march-in-delhi-against-caa-nrc/article30795918.ece
433,2020/02/12,TISS student gets anticipatory bail,"HC questions applicability of sedition charges, says must follow guidelines while registering such a case

The Bombay High Court questioned the applicability of sedition charges against 22-year-old Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) student Urvashi Chudawala and granted her anticipatory bail on Tuesday.

Sedition charges were invoked against Ms. Chudawala for allegedly shouting slogans in support of Sharjeel Imam, a student of the Jawaharlal Nehru University arrested for sedition, at an LGBTQ rally. She was charged under Sections 124A (sedition — whoever by words, either spoken or written, or by signs, or by visible representation, or otherwise, brings or attempts to bring into hatred or contempt, or excites or attempts to excite disaffection towards the Government established by law in India), 153 B (imputations, assertions prejudicial to national integration), 505 (statements conducing public mischief) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code.

A single Bench of Justice S.K. Shinde, questioning the applicability of sedition charges, asked if the sloganeering satisfied the twin requirement of intention and tendency to create disorder or disturb the peace by resorting to violence as mentioned in Section 124 A. It said “a citizen had the right comment on the government as long as he does not incite violence or creates disorder”.

Senior counsel Mihir Desai, appearing for Ms. Chudawala, said the slogans referred to by the prosecution were only read out by her from her phone and had nothing to do with Mr. Imam. Her plea said, “She was exercising her fundamental right to speech and the slogans raised by her were neither intended to, nor resulted in any violence or incitement to violence at Azad Maidan.”

Mr. Desai said the Azad Maidan police had not followed the guidelines laid down by the Bombay High Court in the case of Aseem Trivedi, as per which police officials have to undertake a written opinion from the law officer. Mr. Desai also pointed out a Supreme Court ruling which held that mere sloganeering does not attract charges of sedition.

The court asked the State’s counsel, Deepak Thakare, if the police had followed the HC guidelines to get a written legal opinion as a pre-condition while invoking a case of sedition. Mr. Thakare said, “They haven’t, but they will.”

This irked the court, which said it was necessary to follow the guidelines.

Mr. Desai said Ms. Chudawala had examinations from Friday, and would cooperate with the investigation.

The court then granted anticipatory bail to the student on a cash bond of ₹20,000 and directed her to appear before the Azad Maidan police from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Wednesday and Thursday. She cannot leave Mumbai and Thane without the court’s permission, it said. The court noted that the sloganeering may not reflect the applicant’s ideology, and posted the matter to be heard on March 24.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/tiss-student-gets-anticipatory-bail/article30795862.ece
434,2020/02/12,"Now, use app to book parking slots in city’s housing societies","Mumbai Parking Authority’s move is being facilitated by IIT-based startup Otopark

More than a year after the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) envisaged setting up parking slots in residential spaces, two housing societies have embraced the plan. The move will ensure that commercial areas in the neighbourhood will be decongested as cars will now be parked in the vacant parking slots of housing societies. Motorists can check the availability of parking slots and book them using a mobile application.

Starting next week

Bakul Highway Co-operative Society in Bandra (East) and Manish Market Society in Dadar have agreed to make available five and 20 parking slots respectively on their premises for two-wheelers and four-wheelers. The societies will charge ₹50 for parking per hour and ₹4,000 for a monthly pass. The slots in Bandra will be operational from next week. The move is being facilitated by a IIT-based startup, Otopark, which connects guests looking for parking slots with hosts willing to share their parking spaces.

Housing societies that are willing to rent parking spaces can use the app to add details of the available slots and geotag them. They can also add descriptions, pictures, parking rules, schedule, pricing, and bank account details. Once the listing is published, the Otopark team will visit the housing society to verify the details and brief the management about the system. The housing society will also have to sign a cooperation certificate.

Users, on the other hand, can log in to the app, create a profile and add details of their vehicle. Users will also have to update their Aadhaar details for security and authenticity purposes. The global positioning system will allow users to view available parking slots in their area. By clicking on each slot, the users can obtain all relevant details. After selecting a slot, the fee can be paid using payment gateways.

Additional municipal commissioner Vijay Singhal said, “Considering Mumbai’s rising demand for parking spaces, we wanted to map the potential of off-street parking such as in housing societies and malls and tap into their potential. We are happy that societies have come forward, we are in talks with more of them.”

‘No objection’

Praful Pangaokar, secretary of Bakul Highway Co-operative Society, said, “We are doing it because it is a social cause. Nobody from our society objected to it. In the past, there had been a fire in the area and a fire engine could not enter the lane because of double parking. The same is the case with ambulances. We will prefer giving out monthly passes so that over the course of time we know the people parking here daily.”

Freeing roads

There are more than 30 lakh cars in Mumbai and there is a demand for 2,84,000 parking lots. However, only 70,000 slots are available in public spaces as of 2018. According to data, if every housing society shares five parking spaces, the city’s current parking demand will be met. Many old housing societies and even commercial buildings do not have enough dedicated parking lots. This leads to parking on the roadside, leaving less space for pedestrians and vehicular traffic.

The Mumbai Parking Authority (MPA), which was formed to decongest the city’s roads and address its parking problems, had conceptualised the idea of a parking pool where slots are made available across the city for parking. The MPA has now appealed to more housing societies to come forward and join the parking pool initiative.

435,2020/02/12,PAPs threaten to strike if demands go unmet,"Plan to protest at CIDCO Bhavan on Feb. 17

The Project Affected Persons (PAPs) of the Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA) have threatened to hold another protest outside CIDCO Bhavan in Vashi on February 17 if the authorities continue to ignore their list of demands.

Last week, the PAPs called off their 38-day protest at the site after a delegation met Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, who assured the villagers that a joint meeting with CIDCO would be convened to resolve their problems. Umesh Khandekar, a resident of Waghivali village, said, “We had called off the protest believing that our demands would be fulfilled. But we can no longer sit idle. We have decided to resume our protest if our demands are not met by the authorities by February 17.”

Last week, about 70 villagers were detained after they stalled CIDCO’s electric line work for NMIA at Waghivali village. “At the time of our release, we had informed both the police and CIDCO that we would protest again on February 17 if our demands go unmet,” said Kiran Keni, another resident of Waghivali village.

Among the demands of the PAPs are compensation to fishermen for loss of livelihood, jobs for the youth, increase in construction aid to ₹2,500 from ₹1,500 per square feet and a re-look into the villagers’ ‘zero eligibility’ status.

However, the Sangharsh Samiti, comprising representatives from the 10 affected villages, has distanced itself from these demands. “The samiti was formed by the villagers, but it is nowhere in this protest. We have already told the protesters that the fish market and jetty will be constructed,” a CIDCO officer said.

According to CIDCO, Waghivali village does not come under the core project area, but electric lines will be laid there. Villagers were asked not to leave Waghivali, but a few of them have vacated their homes. “We have offered the same rehabilitation package to those who have left their homes n Waghivali,” the officer said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/7s95yq/article30795807.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12BMNAVIMUMBAIAIRPORT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/paps-threaten-to-strike-if-demands-go-unmet/article30795808.ece
436,2020/02/12,Metro to make travel easy for students,"Those appearing for exams can avoid queues and buy tickets

To make commuting hassle-free for students travelling to their exam centres, Mumbai Metro One Private Limited (MMOPL) has planned to put up dedicated travel help desks for all students appearing for board exams. The students can approach the help desk with their admit cards and buy a ticket without standing in queue.

The facility will be rolled out on February 18 and be in operation till March 30 to benefit students who will be appearing for exams of the the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education, Central Board of Secondary Education and Indian Certificate of Secondary Education.

While Andheri and Ghatkopar stations will have dedicated help desks, at other stations, Customer Care will function as a help desk for students and their parents or guardians who accompany them. The students travelling by Metro for exams can approach the help desk, which will verify the admit card, facilitate ticketing, security clearance and entry to the station without any queue. The move has been taken keeping in mind several centres that lie along the corridor or near stations such as Versova, Azad Nagar, Andheri, Chakala, Marol Naka and Ghatkopar.

“We encourage students to use the Metro for time-guaranteed travel to reach exam centres fast and with convenience. We are delighted to offer queue-free access at our stations and are confident that students will take advantage of this,” an MMOPL spokesperson said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/metro-to-make-travel-easy-for-students/article30795583.ece
437,2020/02/12,RPF to install CCTV at accident-prone spot,"Commuters often fall off trains between Mumbra and Kalwa

The Railway Protection Force (RPF) is planning to install a CCTV camera between Mumbra and Kalwa stations, which has been identified as an accident-prone spot. People often fall off local trains at the spot known as Km 36/4.

Within a span of one kilometre of the spot, which lies on the slow line towards Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus, 10 people fell off trains in 2019. Of the 10 cases, nine caused injury and one resulted in death.

“We have been noticing that this spot has seen several cases of people falling off trains especially in the morning peak hours. We want to know how and why these are happening and if there are any measures we can take to reduce them,” K.K. Ashraf, senior divisional security commissioner, Mumbai Division, Central Railway (CR), said.

Senior railway officials said the spot is close to a tunnel that lies between the two stations. “We feel that with the tunnel approaching, people standing near the entrance might try to squeeze into the train further, leading to people losing their grip,” a senior CR official said. Earlier this month, one person died and two sustained injuries after falling off a train in the section.

Senior railway officials said they are considering imposing a speed restriction in the section to reduce fatalities. “The CCTV will be installed at Km 36/4 and it will have a wide-range lens. It will be able to capture incidents that occur at a distance of 500 meters,” a senior CR official said.

On CR, in 2018, as many as 482 people died in 1,375 incidents of people falling off trains, while in 2019 the fatalities stood at 426 out of the 1,239 cases.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/rpf-to-install-cctv-at-accident-prone-spot/article30795570.ece

440,2020/02/12,"A peek at some concepts, production cars and bikes from Auto Expo 2020","Stars at the show: We take a look at some of the concepts, production cars and bikes from the expo in Greater Noida

Tata HBX concept

Tata had two concepts that grabbed the attention at its Expo stall — the reborn Sierra, and the HBX concept. Based on Tata’s ALFA platform, the HBX is near-production evolution of the H2X concept that made its début at the 2019 Geneva motor show. Styling remains quite close to the H2X concept, but with a number of design details toned down for a more production car look. The HBX previews a production petrol-only micro-SUV to sit below the Nexon.

Hyundai Creta

One of the biggest reveals at the Expo was the all-new Creta. The second-gen model features a radical new design, replete with squared-out wheel arches, a split headlight set-up flanking Hyundai’s trademark ‘cascading’ grille, a split tail-lamp design, and flashy alloy wheels. While the interior is yet to be officially revealed, expect the car to be well-equipped with a panoramic sunroof and BlueLink connectivity tech. Engine options are expected to be shared with the Seltos.

Kia Sonet concept

Kia will be looking to emulate the success of the Seltos with the Sonet compact SUV that’ll launch later this year. While it is based on the same underpinnings as the Hyundai Venue, the Sonet gets a unique design, with a lot of what you see expected to make it to the production car. Kia didn’t reveal the interior, but we can tell you a 10.25-inch touchscreen (segment-largest) will be part of the package.

MG Gloster

MG’s full-size, three-row SUV, the Gloster is big, looks brawny, and, as previewed by the SUV on display, will be loaded to the gills with equipment. Quality levels inside are even better than the Hector too. MG will position the Gloster as a more upmarket alternative to the Fortuner and Endeavour. Prices will be up on the Toyota and Ford too. The MG Gloster goes on sale in 2020.

Maruti Futuro-e concept

Maruti’s futuristic concept previews a Creta-rivalling SUV. A deviation from the carmaker’s design language, the Futuro-e’s design mixes upright traditional SUV-like design elements with sportier touches like full-width light clusters at the front and back, and a sharply-raked coupé roof-line.

Haval Concept H

Chinese company Great Wall Motors showcased a line-up of SUVs from its sub-brand Haval at the Expo, including the Concept H plug-in hybrid SUV. The precursor to a mid-size SUV, the Concept H has the look of an almost production-ready model. The digital-heavy cabin gets a number of displays, with touchpads controls for various in-car functions, including selecting the gear.

Skoda Vision IN, VW Taigun concepts

Skoda and sister brand VW both showcased their upcoming mid-size SUVs, underpinned by the shared, India-specific MQB A0 IN platform. The Vision IN concept from Skoda had the look of a proper concept, replete with an illuminated grille and badge, a glass roof, 4-seat cabin and more. The Taigun, on the other hand, looked more close to production. Both models will arrive in production form next year and will be powered by the brand’s TSI turbo-petrol engines.

Mahindra Funster concept, eXUV300

Flashy, plenty of illuminated surfaces, an open-top, large wheels, and SUV-like upright proportions, the Funster concept was Mahindra’s outlandish concept for Auto Expo 2020. The concept also has the go to match the show, with twin electric motors giving it a claimed 313hp and a 0-100kph time of under 5sec. Mahindra also claimed a range of 520km on a single charge.

The more production-minded EV at the stall was the eXUV300. The eXUV300 features EV-specific design changes, like closed-off grille and air dam, and unique alloy wheels. The production model is expected to arrive next year, but is expected to get more conventional headlamps and wheel design.

Renault K-ZE

Meet the all-electric derivative of the Renault Kwid. The all-electric K-ZE is built on the CMF-A platform, styled a lot like the Kwid, and is powered by an electric motor good for 33 kW (44hp) and 125Nm of torque, paired with a 26.8kWh battery giving it a 271km range. And this too is an EV you’ll be able to buy, with Renault confirming an India launch within the next two years.

Mercedes A-Class sedan

Mercedes débuted its all-new A-Class sedan in India at the Expo. Earmarked to replace the first-gen CLA in India in June 2020, the car was on display in its AMG A35 guise, replete with sportier looks and a 302hp, 2.0-litre turbo-petrol engine. The cabin is new-age Mercedes, with dual displays for the instrumentation and infotainment, and sees the use of leather and metal-finish trims. Expect the A-Class sedan to arrive in standard petrol and diesel form, with the A35 sitting higher up in the line-up.

Aprilia SXR

An important two-wheeler that made its début at the Expo was the Aprilia SXR maxi-scooter. Set to launch this September, the maxi-scooter gets a larger footboard and bigger seat than conventional scooters, which should appeal to comfort-oriented buyers. The SR will be available in two variants — the SXR125 and the SXR160 — and is expected to be positioned between the Vespa and the Aprilia SR range.

Suzuki Katana

Suzuki displayed its iconic 999cc Katana superbike in India for the first time. The superbike’s liquid-cooled, inline-four cylinder engine it uses makes 150hp and 108Nm of peak torque. The Japanese manufacturer says they’re evaluating customer feedback and hinted that the bike may arrive in India as a CKD sometime in the future. It might be quite a long wait though, because the Katana is not Euro 5/BS-VI-compliant at the moment.

Hero Electric AE-47 e-bike

The electric two-wheeler that garnered most interest at the show was Hero Electric’s AE-47 e-bike. The AE-47 is powered by a 6kW motor, with the company claiming a top speed of 100kph, and a 0-60kph time of 9sec. It also has an impressive claimed range of 85km in Power mode, and 160km in Eco mode. Full charge to 100 percent is said to take just four hours. Expect a launch later this year, with prices upwards of ₹1.2 lakh.",motoring,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/lbe7ad/article30799528.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12bgMahindra-Funster-concept,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/a-peek-at-some-concepts-production-cars-and-bikes-from-auto-expo-2020/article30799541.ece
441,2020/02/12,Answering your vehicle-related queries,"Compass versus Octavia

Amit Agarwal, Bengaluru: I want an automatic car with a good engine, at about ₹30 lakh. Which one should I pick between the Jeep Compass and the Skoda Octavia? Do you suggest any other model?

Both cars are completely different. One is a hard-as-nails SUV and the other is a premium sedan. So it really boils down to your needs. For long distances, especially on rough roads and a bit off-road too, the Compass will tackle difficult terrain far better than the Octavia. If your usage is mainly in the city, with occasional highway running, the Skoda is better. Overall, it is a more refined, smoother and a more comfortable car to drive.

BS-VI model available

Aryan Abrol, Faridabad: Should I buy the Toyota Innova Crysta available now, or wait for the facelift? I find the current one a little old.

You missed the opportunity to buy the cheaper BS-IV Innova Crysta, which has just been replaced with the BS-VI model that gets only the 2.4 diesel and not the more powerful 2.8 of the former. There is no other change with the BS-VI model. The facelift will come around October, so wait for it if you find the current one a little dated.

Volkswagen Polo sold out

Ranveer, Sangli: I’m looking to buy the two-door Volkswagen Polo GTI. But since it has been discontinued, can I get one by order? I’m a big fan of the car and would really love to own one.

Unfortunately, the last lot of Polo GTIs sold out over a year ago and there are no plans to import more. Your best bet is to try and find a used one. This will be difficult though, as owners don’t want to part with their GTIs. However, keep a constant lookout, you may get lucky.",motoring,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/unuvcq/article30799376.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/LAUNCHEDVOLKSWAGENPOLOCAR,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/answering-your-vehicle-related-queries/article30799377.ece
442,2020/02/12,Road trips you can take with the love of your life this month,"On the road to love

Dimming the lights in your apartment, opening a bottle of bubbly, and watching a Wong Kar-wai flick just doesn’t make the grade for quality time with the better half any more. What you need is an immersive experience, ideally in an exotic locale — a tailor-made scenario for a road trip. Here are some ideas for a drive that you could take for your date with Cupid this month.

Ranthambore, Rajasthan

Perfect winter driving destination if you fancy a bit of tiger spotting, Ranthambore isn’t your usual couples’ retreat. But the drive, that is almost entirely on smaller State highways, is quite lovely, and makes it worth the effort. You’ll never get into a traffic snarl, or find yourself trailing big trucks. You have to be lucky to spot a big cat at this national park, although your chances of a close encounter go up dramatically if you can talk a forest ranger into showing you about. At least you have each other.

Kaziranga, Assam

The best part about driving to Kaziranga is that you don’t have to spend days seeking out its primary occupant — the rhinoceros. The gigantic animal can be easily spotted ambling about nonchalantly from the peripheral roads, as can herds of elephants. For the nights, lay your hat at one of the colonial-era estate-turned-guesthouses in the vicinity of the park.

Nashik, Maharashtra

India’s very own Napa Valley is an ideal dating spot not far from Mumbai. Take the gorgeous route to Trimbakeshwar, which has one of the best blacktops in the country. Sparse traffic, sweeping curves and a horizon dominated by low hills make it excellent driving country. Top it off with a wine-and-cheese tasting at Sula Vineyards, where you can check into a luxury tent for the night. Spend a weekend replete with lazy lunches, bicycling, and copious consumption of wine.

Vagamon, Kerala

Give the legions of honeymooners in the backwaters a slip and drive to the hills of Wayanad instead. Lush as only Kerala can be, the country roads around these parts wind through coffee estates and little hamlets, where you’ll find the most succulent food in the State. For your romantic interludes, head to Vythiri and check into a treehouse resort.

Goa

Done to death you say? Take the longer route from Mumbai that meanders along the coast, passing through unspoilt villages where you’ll find some of the yummiest Malvani cuisine. Stop at Sindhudurg for the night, before heading to your favourite haunts in India’s most popular honeymoon destination. Or, if you’ve had enough of that — give North Goa a miss and go for long walks on the quiet untrammelled beaches of South Goa.

Udaipur

In spite of the clichés, Udaipur, with its lovely lakes, erstwhile royal residences-turned-hotels, and romantic vibe, never disappoints. Add to that some of the best roads in the country — leading up to the City of Lakes, and to places of interest near and around, including the atmospheric Kumbhalgarh Fort. From the Capital, there’s no better road trip to Rajasthan. Plan a night’s halt at Jaipur, and, if you haven’t had your fill at Udaipur, then carry on to Bikaner for a taste of old Rajasthan.

443,2020/02/12,Hyundai Aura Review: Creating the right Aura,"The compact sedan from Hyundai feels like a well-rounded product that ticks all the right boxes

To say that the compact sedan segment is highly competitive is an understatement. With over nine competitors and the Maruti Dzire accounting for more than half the sales in this segment, Hyundai’s latest Aura sure has its work cut out for it. What will work in its favour, though, is that buyers have three BS-VI-compliant engines to choose from, as well as get a lengthy list of features to spec their car. So how good is Hyundai’s new compact sedan?

On the design front, the Aura has a face similar to the Nios, but there are a few design elements that differentiate it from its sibling. The oversized cascading grille is smaller, with a satin grey surround, and it has double-boomerang LED DRLs on the outer edge of the grille. In profile, you notice how Hyundai has smartly integrated the boot without making it look like just a slap-on modification. The roofline flows into the boot nicely and ends in a neat little ducktail spoiler. The design of the rear, however, might polarise opinions. While the LED tail-lights look good, they feel oversized and don’t go well with the design language.

Inside, you get a black and light-grey dual-tone dashboard with the big 8.0-inch touchscreen taking centre stage. The touchscreen has a very user-friendly layout and is quite responsive too. While there’s no eSIM for connected car features, you do get the iBlue system, which allows you to control the stereo via your smartphone. What differentiates the Aura’s interior from the Nios is the satin-bronze trimming above the glovebox. The turbo-petrol variant gets an all-black interior theme with red inserts. The use of high-quality materials makes the cabin feel premium, and fit-finish levels are impressive too.

The wide front seats miss out on adjustable head restraints. And while they are comfy thanks to the cushioning, lumbar support is a little excessive, making it uncomfortable on long drives. Shoulder support is also poor. Those seated in the rear will find there is decent legroom; it is not as spacious as the Dzire though. Headroom is adequate, but passengers over 6ft might be left wanting more room. The backrest is set at a nice and comfortable angle, and you do get adjustable headrests. Even under-thigh support is good, thanks to the long seat squab.

Talking about features, you have an 8.0-inch touchscreen with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, a 5.3-inch MID screen, wireless phone charger, cruise control (top-end petrol-manual only), rear AC vents and a 12V charging socket for rear passengers. In terms of safety features, the Aura comes with dual airbags, ABS with EBD, Isofix child-seat anchors, an emergency stop signal and rear parking sensors with a camera.

As mentioned previously, there are three engines to choose from — first, you have the 83hp, 1.2-litre petrol engine and a 69hp CNG variant of the same, a 75hp, 1.2-litre diesel, and a 100hp, 1.0-litre turbo-petrol mill. The three-cylinder turbo-petrol is quiet at idle, but you can feel the vibrations at the steering wheel and pedals. One of the first things you notice is that this motor is quite rev-friendly. The turbo kicks in early, just above 1,800rpm, and provides a strong surge of power. The engine’s responsive nature makes it easy to keep up with traffic. Rev it hard, and it does get noisy beyond 5,000rpm, but you won’t mind driving at higher revs. Accompanied by a light clutch and gearbox combination, the turbo-petrol is easy to drive in a sedate manner as well as an enthusiastic way.

In its BS-VI guise, the 1.2-litre, three-cylinder diesel is quite refined, as far as diesels go. At idle, you can hear the diesel clatter, which slowly smoothens out once you start driving. Driving at low speeds isn’t much of a problem, as the engine is quite responsive and a strong bottom-end masks the turbo lag. The mid-range also has good power on tap until 4,000rpm, beyond which it starts losing steam. On the highway, while cruising, the diesel runs silently; you won’t have to downshift to overtake in most cases. The clutch and gearbox remain effortless and smooth in the diesel variant.

We also drove the AMT unit, which has a smooth creep function, and while the typical head nod is present, it isn’t as bad as some of the other AMT units out there. The gear shifts aren’t quick, but are intentionally slow to keep the jerk between shifts to a minimum.

Ride quality is quite absorbent at low speeds. There is an underlying layer of stiffness to the suspension, which is why some sharp potholes and bumps are felt in the cabin. On the highway, the Aura feels stable, and vertical movement is kept in check. The diesel’s heavier front end and slightly stiffer set-up make it feel more planted than the petrol variant. Similarly, in corners, it is nicer to drive compared to the turbo-petrol, thanks to its heavier steering. The brakes work well too and the pedal feel is also progressive; there’s a nice and strong bite point as soon as you step on the pedal.

Designed and specified to stand out from the crowd — and especially from the Maruti Suzuki Dzire — the Aura comes with polarising and radical looks, a powerful and fun turbo-petrol motor, and a BS-VI-compliant diesel engine. It feels premium on the inside, and has a lot of features to keep passengers entertained and comfortable too.

Hyundai has priced the Aura competitively against cars like the Dzire, with prices starting at ₹ 5.80 lakh (ex-showroom). Even the BS-VI-compliant diesel costs only ₹ 20,000 more than the Xcent diesel.

Yes, the cabin is more compact than its competition. At ₹ 8.55 lakh, the turbo-petrol is a bit expensive, and there’s no automatic option offered to buyers. Still, the Aura offers so much more in comparison to its competition in certain areas, it feels like a well-rounded product that ticks all the right boxes.",motoring,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/kudduz/article30799282.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12bgmhyundaiaura5jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/creating-the-right-aura/article30799283.ece
444,2020/02/12,Memories of Munnar: A childhood in a tea garden,"The writer looks back on a way of life that has passed into the sepia-tinted pages of a history book

They say you can never go home again. Nonetheless, I try.

Climbing the steep, tea-draped hill that I recklessly careened down 20 years ago on a bicycle, I notice little has changed, in this part of Munnar at least. Our old bungalow still cascades solidly down the slope, in a series of rose gardens and strawberry patches. In my childhood bedroom, the fireplace crackles with wood, still delivered by truck once a month. And, the lawn is still periodically dug up by herds of wild boar and trampled by elephants, loudly blundering through the vegetable garden at midnight.

As the sun sinks, a chilly darkness descends, and the only sounds are rustling trees and the piercing call of nightjars, in this bungalow with no neighbours. It has been about 140 years since the pioneer European planters hacked their way through the lush shola forests, planting tea and building these remote sprawling homes to conquer the hills. They created a distinct style of plantation life, a blend of English and Scottish traditions, blurry at the edges after years in India. Like our butler’s meatloaf: wholly British, with a pleasing kick of local spices.

Yes, there were butlers. There still are. Uniformed butlers serving canapés, pies and aspic pudding at cocktail parties hosted every week in the bungalows on each estate. Hurricane lanterns and roaring wood fires on stormy nights. Hand-cranked rotary phones, with their own exchange, offering fascinating opportunities to eavesdrop on cross connections. Trout fishing and picnic baskets. Reassuringly, while touristy Munnar is now an angry tangle of tour buses, choked roads and souvenir stalls, much of the tea estates and surrounding forests have remained unchanged for more than a century.

I’m on a mission to find the Munnar of the pioneer planters.

My father, who worked with Tata Tea in Munnar, points me towards A Centenary of Planting in the Kanan Devan Hills by Amita Baig and William Henderson, published in 1978 by Tata-Finlay. The tea company, Kanan Devan Hills and Munnar are inextricably intertwined in a complicated, colourful history.

In 1888, the Kanan Devan Planters Association was created to unite the planters, living in rugged isolation. In 1964, the Tata-Finlay collaboration was formed and Tata Tea launched in 1983. Then, in 2005, Kanan Devan Hills Plantations Company succeeded Tata Tea, becoming the first employee-owned plantation company in India.

K Mathew Abraham, Managing Director and CEO of KDHP, explains how Tata’s 24 estates were combined into seven to optimise productivity. This still means that the company owns 24,000 acres of tea and protects about 20,000 acres of forests, swamps and wetlands. Hence, though Munnar town and touristy sites like Madupatty Dam, Top Station and the entrance to Eravikulam National Park are jammed with long lines of tourists, a sludge of plastic bottles and those inevitable souvenir stalls crammed with cheap pink teddy bears, dream catchers and back scratchers, the estates still look the way they did a century ago.

Stating that one of KDHP’s objectives was to protect Munnar’s eco system, Abraham says that within the estates, “there is no change in land use from early 1900. We have a land management plan, and maintain the jungles, rivers, animal corridors and shola forests between the tea fields”.

This is evident as we drive on lonely, semi-paved roads, punctuated with ‘elephant crossing’ boards, in search of Kundale Club, a members-only golf course tucked between the forests. Started in 1917, it boasts a little club house, 100 members and no affiliations. In keeping with tradition, we arrive with a picnic basket in the car boot, packed by Krishnan, the butler at the stunning 1917-built colonial bungalow we are staying at. Krishnan is famous for his elegant meals, founded on recipes from British planters’ wives, that have been adapted into a practical, comforting cuisine over two centuries, using local ingredients grown in kitchen gardens. Like the other butlers, who double up as cooks here, he has stuck to tradition for the 30 years that he has worked at the bungalow: every meal begins with fragrant soups made from freshly plucked, seasonal vegetables, followed by pies, or casseroles and a roast. And there is always dessert: he says he knows how to make 1,500 puddings, which include a deliciously grainy walnut crumble, old-fashioned pineapple upside-down cake, and pleasingly pink, buttery rhubarb pudding served with a jug of cool, rich cream.

At Kundale, Stephen, the local caretaker, sets out lunch in the club’s cosy single room dominated by a graceful wooden bar. Animal trophies, including the heads of the now-protected Nilgiri tahr and a fierce leopard, stare across glassily. Later, the wild gaur arrive, their glossy coats rippling over powerful muscles.

Quarters for estate workers

As Stephen ceremonially puts down a tray heavy with a steamy teapot on the verandah, he chats about how he watches them gather every evening on the golf course. His father, Karuppaswami, worked here for 45 years, till he passed away five years ago. This is a common story in Munnar, where families work in the same town, and for the same company, for generations.

High Range Club, Munnar

Back in town, at the High Range Club, the watchman has a similar story: his grandfather worked here too. This iconic planter’s club, completed in 1910, is still central to the town’s social life.

It was always sporty: planters arrived by horseback, to use the golf course, play cricket and tennis. Sporting meets included clay pigeon shooting, tent pegging and sack races. The pleasingly shadowy men-only bar, dark with wood panelling, still smells like leather and whisky, though it’s now dry.

Here too, walls are crowded with animal trophies from hunts long forgotten, yet the most striking feature is 52 hats arranged across a wall. From 1928, the club began a tradition of hanging the hats of planters who served for 30 years in the High Range, at boisterous farewell parties. Today, when old planters return — this is an active, well-connected community, which even has a rapidly-expanding WhatsApp group — they still gather in the same bar, under these same hats.

Next to the club, secretive Lodge Heather is eerily silent, except for when a herd of cows noisily trudges past. A Scottish Masonic Lodge, set up in 1902, it became infamous with locals who called it ‘Thalavetti Kovil’, meaning a church where people were beheaded, because they saw the dorais (British managers) meeting there in secret.

It is locked and there isn’t a soul around, so I give up and head to Munnar’s most poignant British monument, the century-old Christ Church. Hewn out of rough granite, its intricate stained glass windows let in a kaleidoscope of coloured sunshine. In the hushed silence I read brass plaques, in loving memory of the pioneer planters, who battled homesickness, cholera and the jungle. Then, I scramble up the steep hill beside the church, to search for the grave of Eleanor Knight, the site’s oldest grave. As legend goes, when she and her husband Henry Mansfield Knight climbed this hill, she playfully said she would like to be buried here, because it was so beautiful. Shortly after that, she fell ill and died of cholera, aged 24.

Driving out of Munnar, I pause at MSA (Munnar Supply Association), built in 1900, reportedly the oldest department store in South India.

When we lived here, this is where we bought our weekly provisions. VN Thampachan still maintains shelves of old handwritten registers, and meticulously fills columns in new ones: all planters are members, and have accounts at MSA.

He chats about how he has lived in Munnar his entire life, working with the Tatas for years, and finally retiring at 58, only to take this job. “When I was young, in the ’70s, we used to come here to see the Europeans, who would arrive on horses, with their dogs,” he smiles. “I entered for the first time in 1978, to buy my first watch. I was so excited.”

With its red oxide floors, wooden shelves filled with local jams and deep freezers packed with bacon, this space too seems unchanged. As I wander through, I see an elderly man smiling at me. He grins, “I remember you: I used to drive you to school.” Thampachan nods in agreement, and they ask about my family. Thanks to the local High Range School, where children of tea pickers, estate workers and managers share classrooms, there is a strong sense of community.

And amid the bustle of tourism and wave of commerce, this essentially is why the core of Munnar has remained unchanged. It’s defined by the people who have lived here for generations, sharing a rich collective memory and an unshakeable loyalty to this small, fiercely independent, town: a Munnar you will never see as a tourist.",travel,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/travel/d3erd0/article30800683.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13mptea1,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/travel/memories-of-munnar-a-childhood-in-a-tea-garden/article30800685.ece
445,2020/02/12,Meet the Brokpas,"The tranquil Ladakhi village of Dah offers much more for the inquisitive traveller than just its picturesque surroundings

A small stone house nestled among trees on a huge rock, a silent stream running at the foot of the house, and a green field nearby with mighty mountains as its backdrop amid clear blue skies. This idyllic setting is what life in Dah village, Ladakh, is all about. A visit to this place isan experience in time travel.

The inhabitants of Dah are believed to be descendants of Alexander the Great, the conqueror who came to India for trade. The legend is that three soldiers left behind by Alexander came here, and their descendants currently live in these four villages of Ladakh — Dah, Hanu, Garkhon and Darchik. Having read these fascinating stories, we got our permits and set out on a journey that would offer us the most wondrous sights. Driving along the Indus river, we take in as much of the fresh air as we could all the while marvelling at the incredible sight of blue-green waters meandering through the magnificent mountains. The 163-kilometre drive from Leh leads us to an unassuming signpost indicating Dah, and a narrow, uphill road on the right takes us to a small hamlet where we spot a few homes made of mud and stone, with uneven corners and edges, scattered among rocks in the valley.

Lesson in history

We findthat there are only two options to stay, but only one offers WiFi. Sonam Makspon, the owner of Makspon Guest house, tells us that he ensures guests have WiFi even though power supply is inconsistent. Sonam claims that it was his great great grandfather who founded the village. “The villages were higher up in the hills. My ancestor said that he will shoot an arrow and wherever it lands, he will build a village there. Water sprang from the place the arrow hit, and they then dug through the hill to form a proper stream. Settlements happened over time and that’s how this village came to be,” he says. It is worth mentioning that Dah in the local language means arrow.

The inhabitants of these villages are called Brokpas or Drokpas. Also called Dards, they are believed to have come from Gilgit, now in Pakistan occupied Kashmir. The Brokpas speak a language called Brokskat. What sets them apart in appearance is their long plaited hair, which is tied in multiple folds, and the beautiful floral headgear called tepi that adorns their head. The bright orange monthu tho (an exotic flower) forms the important part of the tepi, and lends it its distinctive colour. “This was how we always dressed but now the kids prefer to dress in modern clothes,” says Sonam’s mother, pointing out to her 12-year-old granddaughter dressed in a shirt and trousers. “Now people dress in the traditional attire only during festivals and weddings,” she adds.

It has only been five years since the village has been electrified but the unreliable power supply is forcing village youth to move out. “Youngsters are now going to Leh to study, and many often settle in Leh, Kashmir or some other part of India,” says Sonam, adding, “People will always come back, and tourism has increased as well over the years.”

There are only two places worth exploring in Dah: a monastery (since Dah is a Buddhist village) and a museum. There is, however, the Bono-na festival, which takes place in the month of October, to look forward to. A cultural extravaganza, people dress in the traditional attire — long coats and tepi, and sing local songs while dancing and chanting hymns during the Bono-na. What we hear about the festival from Sonam, makes us want to come back to witness it. For now, though, we sip on hot chai as the sun sets and cold winds start to blow. We watch the valley, the bleating goats, the green fields and the stone homes knowing that we are always going to yearn for this calm.",travel,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/travel/244cop/article30800273.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/The-Makspon-family-outside-their-home,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/travel/the-ladakhi-village-of-dah-offers-a-lot-for-the-inquisitive-traveller/article30800281.ece
446,2020/02/12,Puducherry Assembly adopts resolution urging Centre to repeal Citizenship Amendment Act,"House adopts another resolution condemning BJP’s ‘attempts’ to destroy India’s secular fabric.

Following the footsteps of Kerala, Punjab, Rajasthan and West Bengal, the Puducherry Assembly, on Wednesday, adopted a resolution urging the Centre to repeal the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). The ruling Congress went a step ahead by adopting another resolution condemning the attempts by the BJP-led Union government to destroy the secular fabric of the country.

Moving the resolutions at a special session of the Assembly, Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy said the CAA, along with the proposed plan to implement the National Register of Citizens and National Population Register, would destroy the unity and secular character of the country.

Terming the CAA “discriminatory and unconstitutional”, the Chief Minister said by excluding Muslims from the purview of CAA, the Union Government was paving the ground for a ‘Hindu Rashtra’ as envisaged by the RSS. The aim was to whip up communal passions and divide people on religious lines so as to reap political dividends, the Chief Minister said.

Re-emphasising his government’s intention to carry out census without seeking any additional information from people such as religious identity, date of birth of respondents and details of their parents, the Chief Minister said the Congress would not allow the decisive agenda of Centre to be implemented in the Union Territory.

Referring to the letter written by Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi on February 10 cautioning the government against passing a resolution on CAA, the Chief Minister said he would not get be cowed down by threats.

“I have made it clear when Parliament brought the amendment to Citizenship Act that it will not be implemented even at the cost of the government. I challenge the Prime Minister and Home Minister to dismiss my government for adopting the resolution,” he said.

While three nominated legislators belonging to BJP staged a walk out after protesting against tabling the resolution, principal Opposition party AINRC and AIADMK boycotted the special session.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/3p485h/article30801018.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ASSEMBLYSPECIALSESSIONjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/puducherry-assembly-adopts-resolution-urging-centre-to-repeal-citizenship-amendment-act/article30800921.ece
447,2020/02/12,One-day special Assembly session likely to be stormy,"Resolutions urging the Centre to repeal CAA and abandon move to start hydrocarbon project in Puducherry and Karaikal regions to be adopted

The one-day special session of the Assembly convened on Wednesday is set to adopt two resolutions — one urging the Centre to repeal the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and and the other asking it to abandon the move to start hydrocarbon exploration project in Puducherry and Karaikal regions.

Ignoring Lt. Governor Kiran Bedi’s advisory to the government to desist from its move to adopt a resolution against a law enacted by Parliament, the government had despatched the copy of the resolution on CAA to the Assembly Secretariat on Tuesday for tabling it in the House.

The Lt. Governor, on Monday, wrote to Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy cautioning him against debating a subject (CAA) passed by Parliament. In her letter, Ms. Bedi said the legislative power of the Assembly did not extend to the subject matter of citizenship as it fell within the domain of the Parliament and Centre.

According to a ruling party member, the government has taken a well thoughtout decision to adopt the resolution against the CAA. “First of all, we are not enacting any law and it is not the first time we are passing a resolution on a Central subject. We have passed several resolutions seeking Statehood, which is a Central subject. We are only passing a resolution on the CAA. The Centre can accept or reject the resolution. There is no illegality in it,” the member said.

The government will also move a resolution opposing the hydrocarbon exploration project considering the recent amendment brought out by the Union Ministry of Environment, Forests, Climate Change to the Environment Impact Assessment notification relaxing the rules for companies engaged in offshore exploration.

In the last budget session, the House had passed a resolution on the hydrocarbon project but the government again felt the necessity to adopt another one considering the amendment made to the EIA notification, a Secretariat source told The Hindu.

The government could also make a statement on the demand to declare Karaikal region a protected agriculture zone.

The government may also adopt a resolution commemorating the recent celebrations of 70th Constitution Day. Other agenda for the session including passing of bills, the source said.

The special session could be short but will certainly be stormy with the principal Opposition party All India N. R Congress, All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and Bharatiya Janata Party set to target the government on several issues.

Though AINRC and AIADMK have not taken a stand on CAA resolution, the three nominated legislators belonging to the BJP will oppose the government’s move.

According to an AINRC member, the party will put the government on the mat for its “non-performance,” and “failure” to implement any of the electoral promises. The party legislators will also seek clarifications from the Chief Minister and Ministers on the allegations raised by rebel Congress legislator N. Danavelou. AIADMK leader A. Anbalagan at a press conference flayed the government for convening a special session instead of a budget session.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/zbywe2/article30795984.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH12PONDYHOUSE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/one-day-special-assembly-session-likely-to-be-stormy/article30795986.ece

450,2020/02/12,First convocation of IIIT-Tiruchi on Feb. 15,"Indian Institute of Information Technology, Tiruchi, will hold its first convocation on February 15.

The first batch of B.Tech students - 44 graduands of Computer Science Engineering and 25 of Electronics and Communication Engineering - who had passed out in 2019 will be conferred degrees by Ashok Jhunjhunwala, Professor, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, and Principal Advisor, Ministry of Power, MNRE and Railways.

Fifty three % of graduands have been placed well with packages ranging from ₹ 3.5 to 20 lakh a year, N.S.V.N. Sarmsa, Director, IIIT-Tiruchi, told mediapersons on Wednesday.

Chief Secretary, Government of Tamil Nadu, K. Shanmugam, will preside over the ceremony in the EEE Auditorium in NIT-T campus, Institute Director Mini Shaji Thomas who was the Mentor Director of IIIT-Tiruchi for initial years, said.

The IIIT-Tiruchi was conferred with the status of Institute of National Importance during 2017.

Decks have been cleared for construction of a permanent campus at Sethurapatti by the Central Public Works Department on 56-acres. Power lines have been aligned suitably to start construction of boundary walls. Buildings to house a three-storeyed administrative block and hostels for boys and girls will be constructed in the first phase. The buildings are expected to be ready in a year.

Out of the estimate of ₹ 128 crore, the State government has released ₹ 22.4 crore - half the amount out of 35 % of the project cost. The six industry stake-holders: TCS, CTS, Infosys, Ramco, ELCOT and Take Solutions contribute 15 % of the project cost.

451,2020/02/12,Rockfort tourism development project yet to take off,"Archaeological Survey of India has given its nod; encroachments need to be cleared

Almost six months have passed since the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) gave its nod for implementing the Tiruchi Corporation’s Rockfort Tourism Development Project under the Smart City mission. But there is still no sign of implementing the project.

It was among the first projects cleared by the Commissioner of Municipal Administration with an allocation of ₹ 39.10 crore.

Introduction of pleasure boating service, restructuring roads around Teppakulam tank, sound and light show, highlighting historical background of the city forms part of the beautification plan around Rockfort and Teppakulam. The civic body planned to illuminate Mainguard Gate, develop the War Memorial and establish a Heritage Park.

The corporation said in July 2018 that the project would be implemented within a few months. But, it did not take off. Inordinate delay in getting mandatory clearance from the ASI to carry out development work at its protected sites was being cited as a reason.

Considering the importance of the project, the ASI after carrying out a spot visit cleared the hurdles to carry out development work at Rockfort Temple and Mainguard Gate, which are protected by ASI, about 8 months ago. It was then expected that the Corporation would start the project within two to three months but it is yet to take off.

Though it is stated that the Detailed Project Report has to be redrawn by taking into consideration current rates, enquiries revealed that the indecision of the civic body over clearing encroachments on Teppakulam, N.S.B Road and Mainguard Gate has been blocking the project.

Without clearing encroachments, mainly roadside vendors on four streets of Teppakulam, it is argued that tourism development project cannot be implemented as restructuring the temple tank and sound and light show badly require space encroached by vendors.

H. Ghouse Baig, a consumer activist in Tiruchi, said the project aimed at promoting tourism should have been given top priority. If it was implemented, it would attract more tourists to Tiruchi. The fund allotted to the project should not go unused.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/tkiwnh/article30807402.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY13ROCKFORT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/rockfort-tourism-development-project-yet-to-take-off/article30803471.ece

454,2020/02/12,Tiruchi railway junction on track to speed up passenger movement,"Plans afoot to install additional escalators connecting all platforms

Six more escalators have been planned at Tiruchi railway junction to facilitate heavy passenger movement every day.

The facility is to be created as part of improving passenger amenities at the important station in Southern Railway zone.

Tiruchi railway divisional authorities have already begun work on installation of two escalators: at the additional entry side of the station and Kallukuzhi second entrance.

Civil works have at begun at the first location with iron poles erected after laying of foundation adjoining the foot overbridge near parcel office. The escalators have already reached the site at the station.

Funds to the tune of around ₹2.48 crore have been sanctioned for the provision of the two escalators at the station, which also has a subway connecting all seven platforms.

A senior railway official says the plan is to operate the escalators in the upward direction from the base on both sides of the station where redevelopment works are on. It is expected to be completed by March.

Escalators are also proposed at platforms 2,3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 at a total cost of over ₹5.15 crore.

The works will begin once the funds are allocated for the project. It will take at least six months to provide the facility covering all platforms, the official says.

Plans are also afoot to provide three lifts, including one at the additional entry and the other at the Kallukuzhi second entrance, at a cost of around ₹1.40 crore.

The railway junction witnesses movement of more than 100 trains — mail, express and passenger — every day with the daily traveller footfalls at nearly 50,000.

The first escalator at the junction connecting platforms 2 and 3 was inaugurated in February 2016.

455,2020/02/12,Neglecting mofussil terminus hardly a smart move,"Non-provision for improvement under Smart City Mission is difficult to understand, say residents

Redevelopment of Chathram Bus Stand taken up under Smart City Mission has surprisingly no provision for improvement to the mofussil bus terminus located close by.

Though it has been in existence for more than a couple of decades, the terminus outside Chathram Bus Stand in the city has been functioning around the overhead tank complex-Kamaraj Statue junction and along the road side towards Anna Statue junction in the absence of proper bus bays or shelters.

A large number of buses operating on Perambalur, Ariyalur and other destinations operate from the terminus. Located in a bustling place surrounded by educational institutions and business establishments, the terminus is being used by thousands of commuters, especially school and college students, everyday. Be it sun or rain, the commuters stand exposed as they do not have proper shelters.

With a slew of hotels, commercial establishments and a theatre complex in the vicinity, commuters have to jostle for space with vendors, visitors to the establishments and vehicles parked on the roadsides. There is no clear marking of the bus halts either. While some of the buses halt on the roadside in front of a cinema, many others operate from the open space around the Kamarajar statue roundabout.

The terminus lacks proper amenities such as toilets and drinking water supply and commuters have to depend on the facilities available at the town bus terminus. “It is a pathetic situation. How can the authorities turn a blind eye to the ordeal experienced by thousands of commuters every day?” wondered Vignesh, a college student who commutes to the city from Perambalur.

Tiruchi Corporation, which is investing over ₹17 crore to redevelop Chathram Bus Stand under the Smart City Mission, has surprisingly not included any component to improve amenities at the adjacent mofussil terminus.

“The mofussil bus stand is just an extension of the Chathram Bus Stand and has been crying for attention. Yet, the corporation does not seem to have any plans to improve amenities here,” fumed another student, who did not want to be identified.

“There are some basic parameters for a mofussil terminus. Here, there are no amenities. Buses are now parked around the OHT and Kamaraj statue in up to four rows, causing severe traffic congestion. Bus bays can be created along the entire stretch of road from Karur Highway to the Anna Statue Junction with proper shelters,” said N. Ramakrishnan, a civic activist.

Some years ago, the Corporation erected a high roof and executed development works at the town bus terminus. And it has chosen to make a big investment to redevelop the bus stand. The bus stand, situated on an area of less than three acres, will have 30 bus bays in two terminals.

The redeveloped bus stand will also have a parking lot for two-wheelers on the basement with a capacity to accommodate 350 vehicles, and 33 shops on the ground and first floors. Many also question the need for building shops at the bus stand.

“What is the need for building shops inside the bus stand, when you do not have adequate space even for buses and passengers? They could have considered the feasibility of having a multi-level bus stand” observed Gopalakrishnan, a resident.

Asked about the lack of amenities at the terminus during his recent inspection of redevelopment works at Chathram Bus Stand, Collector S. Sivarasu assures steps to remove encroachments and provide passenger shelters. He feels that the issue will be sorted out once the proposed integrated bus stand is established.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/6teure/article30798209.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY12-BUSBUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/neglecting-mofussil-terminus-hardly-a-smart-move/article30798211.ece

460,2020/02/12,"Get Kapu quota file clearedby Centre, Jagan urged","Mudragada Padmanabham writes to Chief Minister

Former Minister and Kapu leader Mudragada Padmanabham has urged Chief Minster Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy to write a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi with regard to Kapu quota. “Use your good offices and see that the file relating to BC-F was cleared by the Centre,” he said.

In a letter to Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy on Tuesday, the Kapu leader said: “The file has been pending with the Home Department for sometime now. It may not be justified to seek your help as you have not promised quota for Kapus. But keeping in view of despair prevailing among the Kapu youth, I request you to do the needful.”

Mr. Padmanabham said that he took part in the Odarpu Yatra going against the Congress party’s decision. Recalling that he was suspended from the Congress, Mr. Padmanabhan said: “Going against the Congress, I participated 22 days in Odarpu Yatra not expecting a single paise or vehicle. The admirers and followers came on their own expense and took part in the yatra. I strived to make the padayatra a big success from Rajahmundry bridge to Kovvur. Kindly do not think that I am expecting a political life out of this request. I have a right to urge you to provide BC reservation status to my community.”

“I don’t know whether I can pass on properties to my children going by my financial position. But, my children suffered lathi blows during the Kapu agitation and due to Chandrababu garu...but, I could not achieve BC reservation,” he added.

Plea to PM

It may be recalled that Mr. Padmanabham, in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in August 2019, requested reintroduction of 5% reservation to Kapus under the EWS quota. On December 2, 2017, the Andhra Pradesh Assembly passed a Bill, giving 5% EWS quota to the Kapu community. Stating that the Bill is pending with the Home Ministry, he said and requested the Prime Minister to consider the issue and ratify the same so that the poor among the Kapu community could see the light of hope.

In an open letter to the Kapus in 2018, Mr. Padmanabham said he had come to know through the media that a leader (Mr. Jagan) touring the district was reluctant to give any concrete assurance on the Kapu reservation issue when the youth from the community tried to take up the cause with him. “Kapu reservation is not a charity,” he said and added that former Chief Minister Damodaram Sanjeevaiah had issued a GO providing reservation to the Kapus, which the successive governments ignored.",vijayawada,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/sixjx9/article30797871.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12ONGMUDRAGADA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/get-kapu-quota-file-clearedby-centre-jagan-urged/article30797872.ece

After several attempts in years to draw crowds to the major parks in the city, the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation has now taken up public private partnership (PPP) model to bring in proper adventure and amusement zones within the Rajiv Gandhi Park, Ambedkar and Raghavaiah Park and K.L. Rao Park.

The civic body has a few days ago called tenders looking for agencies that could develop adventure zones and allied facilities at the Raghavaiah Park, water-based adventure zone, play zone at K.L. Rao Park and amusement zone at the Rajiv Gandhi Park to give a fillip to the commercial parks.

The civic body wants private partners to establish all the adventure paraphernalia and other facilities operate and maintain the same for five years under in design, build, finance, operate and transfer (DBFOT) mode, according to officials.

In the city’s largest Rajiv Gandhi Park, the civic body wants to offer thrill rides like hydro pendulum, Columbus, dashing cars, human gyro, bull rides and others and train ride, fun zone, art and crafts stalls, splash pad and paintball.

Similarly at the Raghavaiah Park on M.G. Road, adventure rides for children and adults including 100-metre long zip liner, zip bikes, 10D theatre, edutainment museum and others are planned.

At the K.L. Rao Park which is the only park to have a water channel, pedal boats, water rollers, zorb ball, inflatable play zone and event zone are planned.

Meanwhile, the VMC is also planning to transform the lorry stand site in Bhavanipuram area, a near three-acre plot, into an adventure zone with Go-Karting as the main attraction. Food court and event arena are other facilities planned.

The go-karting track would be close to half-a-kilometre and the play zone will consist of cricket court, sand volleyball court and others, as per the plans.",vijayawada,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/three-major-parks-to-get-facelift-with-adventure-and-amusement-zones/article30795673.ece

464,2020/02/12,Data | How has BJP fared in recent Assembly elections compared to the Lok Sabha poll?,"The BJP’s performance in 13 recent Assembly elections shows that the party has been underperforming compared to the support it garnered during the 2019 national election

Even as the BJP’s tally in the 2020 Delhi Assembly election increased compared to the 2015 polls, the party’s vote share fell well short of the support it received in Delhi in the 2019 Lok Sabha election. A look at the BJP’s performance in 13 recent Assembly elections shows that the party has been underperforming compared to the support it garnered during the 2019 national election.

Before Lok Sabha polls 2019

In comparison to its performance in States that went to polls in November-December 2018, the BJP’s vote share in the 2019 Lok Sabha election was much higher.

465,2020/02/12,"Prasannan Anickad’s latest book, 'Akruthi Vikruthi', is a collection of his cartoons","A way with lines and curves

Cartoonists today have to constantly tread the thin line between freedom of expression and causing offence, says Prasannan Anickad. A cartoonist for over four decades, he has seen how the art has evolved, flourishing and struggling to survive through trying times. Prasannan recently launched his book on cartoons, Akruthi Vikruthi, at the Krithi International Literature and Knowledge Festival.

A compilation of his own selected cartoons that were published in contemporary newspapers and publications, the book carries a note on each cartoon. “I thought that would provide context, especially to a young reader.”

One of his popular cartoons, which is a map of India drawn using the faces of its prime ministers starting with Jawaharlal Nehru to Narendra Modi, sets the tone for the book. The political cartoons are evocative of the times they were published. National and State issues robed in wit brings back memories of past governments and policies, along with a smile.

“Cartoonists constantly pushed boundaries through humour and satire. Cartoons were a powerful tool. Now, however, I don’t know if they wield the same power. The social climate has changed drastically and I feel we have become more intolerant as a people,” he says.

Prasannan conducted his cartooning life alongside his daily routine as an employee at the Kottayam District Co-operative Bank. While he juggled numbers at work, he let his imagination have a free reign at night. “I used to work late into the night. Cartoons have been an enduring passion and I didn’t see it as work.” He retired in May, 2019, and devotes most of his time now to cartoons.

Cartooning is not treated with the same seriousness it was a few decades ago. Technology, Prasannan suspects, has to play a role in it. “When we didn’t have technology to rely on, there was great synchronisation between the brain and the hand. Computers may have made it a lot easier for cartoonists, but in a small way at least, it has made the process mechanical.B ack in the day, if the publication needed a colour cartoon, the artists had to manually colour it, using water colour or some such thing. Today, the process has been completely eliminated thanks to the computer.”

He, however, prefers putting black pen to paper. “It comes naturally to me.”

The self-taught artist says every cartoonist starts off by imitating someone. “My idol was Shankar, who famously and fearlessly took on figures of authority.” It is only over time that a cartoonist evolves his own style and identity. His works were also hugely influenced by cartoonists Toms and Yesudasan.

This is Prasannan’s third published book — the first Cartoon Kalari, is a cartoon tutorial for children and the second, Anavara, is a collection of his elephant drawings.

Having won several awards and recognition for his cartoons, Prasannan has also dabbled in scripts for television shows. He scripted and presented a 28-episode docu-fiction on elephants for Kairali channel. Prasannan was the Kerala Cartoon Academy Chairman from 2009-2013.

466,2020/02/12,A Rio-style carnival comes to Chennai,"The One Plus Rio Carnival hopes to recreate the fanfare synonymous with the iconic Brazilian event

The annual Rio Carnival starts in Rio de Janeiro on February 21. Return economy flight fares to Brazil cost approximately — hold your breath — upwards of ₹ 1 lakh. But you don’t have to bury all hopes of participating in the jamboree. The One Plus Rio Carnival taking place at Sheraton Grand Chennai Resort and Spa (ECR), on Sunday, aims to recreate some of the fanfare synonymous with the iconic Brazilian event.

The highlight of the evening will be a parade featuring samba dancers. In addition, there will be stilt walkers, acrobats, a Chinese lion dance...

Sound knowledge There has always been a concern about the impact of the music on the denizens of the The Madras Crocodile Bank Trust and Centre for Herpetology next door. “Three months back, The Crocodile Bank entered an MOU with the Sheraton Grand Chennai Resort and Spa and IIT,” says Ganesh Muthiah, conservation officer, MCBT.

A three-member team from IIT, headed by Professor P Chandramouli is measuring the sound decibel and vibrations. For it to be fair game, they wanted a third party to record data. On February 16, the team from IIT will stay over at the venue to monitor the situation. “As this is a residential area, the sound should be 55 decibel during the day (6 am to 10 pm) and 45 decibels during the night (10 pm to 6 am),” explains Ganesh.

And when the sound does exceed, they inform the resort. “We have six critically endangered species breeding here,” he says, and adds, “In six months, IIT will come out with a report and that will help educate a lot of resorts and people.”

“In keeping with the rules, we will stop playing music by 10 pm,” says Pooja Reddy.

“People often complain about not enough fun stuff happening in Chennai. So I thought of coming up with something different,” says Pooja Reddy who has been planning it for the last three months. The performers are all from Chennai and have been trained by choreographer Kavya Giridharan. “I wanted to showcase the best of Chennai in terms of talent as well as food,” says Pooja.

That explains the 25 food stalls, which include live dosa counters, ice lollies, pizzas, baos, pork ribs, BBQ... and a cocktail counter. “Plus, we will also have a sundowner at Sea Salt, Sheraton’s new restaurant that is set to open later this month,” says Pooja.

In keeping with the theme, there is a treasure hunt and escape room titled Copacabana Robbery. Shop at the flea market, challenge your friends to a game of flamingo croquet or participate in the Wild Warrior Race. Shake a leg to the tunes of the DJ, or, if you are feeling mellow, plonk yourselves at the picnic style seating, and listen to the Speak Easy Poets perform.

The event is at Sheraton Grand Chennai Resort and Spa, ECR, on February 16, from 1 pm. The entry fee is ₹500. Proceeds go to The Clarke School for the Deaf.

467,2020/02/12,Spurthi Vision Care Society’s Fair Play cricket: Game with an insight,"Spurthi Vision Care Society’s Fair Play cricket offered a new hope for visually impaired players

It was a cloudy Sunday when Hyderabad Public School opened its gates at 6 45 am. A sprightly 82-year-old Pushpa Venugopal of Spurthi Vision Care Society walks in enthusiastically. Chirping birds invade the early morning surroundings as volunteers prepare for Fair Play cricket to begin in an hour’s time. A frail-looking Pushpa will not sit back to watch the hustle and bustle of preparations but quietly joins the team. “She is our strength and inspiration; If she can do so much in her age, we can do much more,” says Arut Ramalingam of the Society for 15 years now.

Two teams — players from Telangana Under-19 and Devnar Foundation for the Blind arrive, each sporting a vibrant blue and yellow jersey. A small crowd of 75 consisting of friends, volunteers and relatives get ready to turn into cheerleaders for the players. A breakfast followed by a quick warm-up run, the players are ready to play the game. Unlike a competitive match, Fair Play gives every member a chance to bowl and bat in a 11-over game. The match begins at 9 am and members of Devnar take the ball. A slight rain sets off alarm as volunteers rush to put shamiana for cheerleaders. Players from Telangana Under-19 score 102 and Devnar players score it in 8 overs but continue to play so that their other batsmen also get an over to bat. Amid a huge round of applause, the short match is over by 10:45 am and both teams are declared winners.

One of the players, Ayya Kumar walks in with a swag like his idol Shikar Dhawan. He hit the first four and enjoys all the attention. “My inspiration is Shikar Dhawan. He is a free-spirited player like Virender Sehwag. Even when he is at 99, he doesn’t play cautiously but hits hard,” he observes. M Rahul of Devnar Foundation, an all-rounder keeps calm on ground like his idol MS Dhoni. In fact, bowler Narsing Rao’s idol too is Dhoni and he proudly shows off his jersey number 7 (Dhoni’s jersey number.) It has been more than a decade since Praveen has been playing cricket and loves to be like Yuvraj Singh. Commenting on the ongoing series against New Zealand, he says, Virat Kohli’s captaincy is good. His friend Naini Sandeep Kumer is a medium pacer and has began watching cricket because of Ishant Sharma. “I like his style and long hair and want to grow hair like him.” A IX std student, Sai Vamsi loves watching kabaddi and playing cricket.

After friendly banter and a photo session with Pushpa, the members disperse only to cheer for a fair play chess game organised at the venue. Pushpa, fondly called ‘granny’ by volunteers is relieved at the proceedings. “The clouds looked dark and I was worried it might lead to a heavy downpour. My prayers were answered and I am happy it went on well,” she says and feels energised seeing the younger team of volunteers from a multi-national IT firm. “I am 82 and I don’t know if I will be able to continue to hold this event next year. So many people have been helping me in this cause but I cannot always make others do things for me.”

The Society has been organising events to encourage and create a day of joy for the visually-impaired every year. Arut mentions three categories in visually-impaired playing cricket. “There is total blindness, partially blind and partially-sighted.” In 2007 and 2008, the Society’s cricket tournament had Sridhar, Mahender Vaishnav and S Pushparaj, the three visually-challenged cricketers who also had represented India in series played against Pakistan and South Africa. “Our event was a two-day one with professionals and eight participating teams including the ones from Tirupati and Visakhapatnam. Ours was a platform for visually-challenged who love and play good cricket but get less opportunities.” For the last few years, the Society has been holding multiple events and a mini marathon for visually-challenged, hearing and speech impaired and teenagers with motor disabilities. It was heart-warming to watch even volunteers run along with the participants not to hand-hold and and run but just to make sure they are running in the safe zone.",life & style,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/4fodg/article30799471.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYM11VISUALLYCHALLENGED,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/spurthi-vision-care-society-organised-fair-play-cricket-for-visually-impaired-players/article30799475.ece
