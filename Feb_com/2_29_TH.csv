0,2020/02/29,"On current form, Star Superior has the edge","Adjudicate has the credentials to do an encore

Had Fats Domino, the legendary Rock and Roll musician of the 1950s, been around, he would probably have altered the lyrics of Blueberry Hill to sound like “The Moon stood Still on Chamundi Hill.”

It was almost as if life in this city had come to a standstill on Saturday because every road led to the Mysore Race Club, which was bursting at the seams as it struggled to cope with the sea of humanity that had descended to witness the first day of the Invitation Cup Weekend.

For those who say “It doesn’t get better than this,” eat your words, because Sunday will probably see crowds spill over as the youngest of India’s Turf Authorities showcases the Indian Turf Invitation Cup (Grade 1), the ‘mother of all races’, which will crown the new Champion of the Indian Turf.

The roar that greets the newly-crowned king or queen will reverberate around the historic racetrack and will echo for years to come and they will all say that this was indeed their finest hour. Billed as the sixth race in a fabulously competitive race card, the Invitation Cup will have the Grade 1 Major P.K. Mehra Super Mile backing it up.

Two more graded races

As the very name suggests, this is a race for specialist milers. The mile has been eulogised from the time Sir Roger Bannister broke the four-minute mark in May 1954 and since then, there has always been something of a romance about the Mile in athletics and on the Turf.

The Suresh Mahindra Multi Million (Grade 2) will be the third graded race on the card to give the icing to yet another action-packed afternoon at the picturesque MRC.

Ever since the Invitation Cup was run in its new avatar back in 2013, it has been won by a 4-year-old. On every occasion the horse had to work for the victory, but the record books will show that from 2013 to 2019 it has been a horse of Classic vintage that has come out on top, beating the 5 & 6-year-olds. The start of a new decade may well see this run come to an end.

War Hammer, the unbeaten four-year-old, will be missing from the line-up of 14 because of an injury has forced him out and although there are nine 4-year-olds, form and handicap seem to suggest that it could be a 5-year-old who is going to be crowned champion.

Quasar came agonisingly close to becoming the first horse to win the Invitation twice in succession, but he was denied in 2016 by Desert God. A 5-year-old bay mare Adjudicate (Multidimensional-Alvarita), who hails from Kolkata, will be aiming for that glory. Trained by James Mckeown, she won the Invitation in Hyderabad last year, pegging back Desert God and Star Superior (Excellent Art-Ramjet). The same pair will be there to take her on again and it promises to be a real battle of the sexes.

Desert God there, but...

Desert God (Burden of Proof-Running Flame) is now eight years old. Last year, he gave Adjudicate and Star Superior a weight advantage of 3.5 and 2kg respectively not to mention three years in age.

This year he meets them on virtually level terms (bar the sex allowance) but he’s one year older and although he’s still looking magnificent, he’s the oldest horse in the race. His run in the Indian Champion Cup in Kolkata in January this year has not added to his chances. That now seems to suggest that the mare Adjudicate and the bay rig Star Superior are going to renew their rivalry. It’s billed as a ‘battle of the sexes’. Billie Jean King against Bobby Rigs. But is it going to pan out the same way as that epic clash ?

On current form, Star Superior has the edge. Bar that one defeat last year in Hyderabad, he is undefeated in five starts. He met Adjudicate on three separate occasions, ranging from 2200 metres to the metric mile, and proved better each time. Of course they have been close and the verdict in the last two meetings have been just half a length. What’s it going to be this time?

Whatever it is, it is going to be a race travelling miles to see and the Major P.K. Mehra Super Mile and the Suresh Mahindra Multi-Million will make it an afternoon to remember forever in the archives of the Mysore Race Club.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/on-current-form-star-superior-has-the-edge/article30952870.ece
1,2020/02/29,Corfe Castle sprints to glory in record time,"Ambrosio showcases his prowess in the Stayers’ Cup

Corfe Castle, trained by Leo D’ Silva and ridden by Sandesh, proved that there can never be any certainties in the Sport of Kings.

The world, its neighbour and yours truly for that matter went on record to say the Bangalore Turf Club Sprinters’ Cup was a two-way contest between the Bengaluru challenger Multifaceted and the Mumbai champion Iron Age.

The rest of the field it was felt were there for the minor placings.

At the end of a record-breaking run, it was Corfe Castle which had the better of Mauritania with Intense Stylist and Coorg Regiment ending up third and fourth.

The fancied duo missed the board.

Bred at the Poonawalla Group Of Farms, Corfe Castle, who is by Excellent Art out of Miss Danehill, is a full brother to Sprint Queen Ruffina who had won this very race two years in a row and now Miss Danehill has become the first broodmare to produce three Sprinters’ Cup winners in successive years.

The M.A.M. Ramaswamy Stayers’ Cup was won in emphatic fashion by the Usha Bred Ambrosio(Multidimensional-Ambrosia).

The 5-year-old bay gelding, trained by S.A. Attollahi, was given a great ride by jockey Suraj Narredu.

As the curtain came down on the first day of the showpiece of Indian Racing, the Mysore Race Club proved, that given the opportunity, they are second to none.

2,2020/02/29,Dutee storms to gold,"Sets new 100m inter-University record

Dutee Chand’s quest for an Olympic berth began in fine fashion as she stormed to a dominating win in the 100m event at the Khelo India University Games on Saturday.

Running in lane 3, she clocked 11.49 seconds to bag the gold, setting a new inter-University record in the process.

Talking post the race, Dutee said she was glad to get the year off to a winning start and assured she had a lot more left in the tank.

“I am very happy because this is the first time I have begun the year so well. And I hope to shave off at least 0.10 seconds in my upcoming races,” she said, surrounded by an army of cameras, all eager to snap a byte with the local star.

Silver for Dhanalakshmi

Dutee was the first to get off the blocks and ran a comfortable race, powering her way past second-placed S. Dhanalakshmi of Mangalore University, who clocked 11.99s.

Representing host KIIT University, Dutee ran 11.61s in the semifinals earlier in the day.

The Odiya sprinter has run faster. She set the track ablaze at the National Open in October last year, where she clocked 11.22s for a new National record. She is currently 0.07s away from making the Olympics cut, with the qualification mark set at 11.15s.

While the audience hoped she would breach the Olympics mark here, Dutee said she needed a higher level of competition to push herself further.

“As you saw, there wasn’t a lot of competition here. To achieve the Olympic cut-off I need to compete against faster athletes who will help me push me further,” she said.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/rlp1wm/article30952410.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH01DUTEE,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/dutee-storms-to-gold/article30952411.ece
3,2020/02/29,Para National athletics from March 26,"The event will serve as a qualification event for the 2020 Tokyo Paralympics

Around 1,600 athletes from 28 States will compete in the 19th Para National athletics championship, which commences at the Chamundi Vihar Stadium at Mysuru on March 26.

The event, approved by the International Paralympic Committee, will serve as a qualification event for the 2020 Tokyo Paralympic Games, Deepa Malik, Paralympic Committee of India (PCI) President said at a press conference here on Saturday.

The PCI, meanwhile, is confident that the Sports Ministry will soon revoke the suspension imposed on the body last year.

Regardless of the status of the PCI, it will not stop Indian athletes from competing in the Paralympics, PCI Secretary-General Gursharan Singh stated.

“The PCI is recognised by the IPC, which is the only criteria for Paralympics qualification. So an Indian para-athlete who qualifies for the Paralympics will compete under the Indian flag. The only disadvantage of being suspended by the Sports Ministry is that the PCI is not entitled to funds from the Ministry,” Gursharan explained.

The PCI is also arranging for para-athletes to compete in various international competitions to achieve the Paralympics qualification mark, Gursharan said.

The Mysuru championship, consisting of track and field events, will witness top prospects in action like T. Mariyappan (2016 Paralympics high jump gold medallist), Varun Singh Bhati (2016 Paralympics high jump bronze) and Sundar Singh Gurjar (2019 World Para Championship javelin gold).",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/para-national-athletics-from-march-26/article30951654.ece

6,2020/02/29,Speed merchants ready to set the track alight,"The Dr. M. A. M. Ramaswamy Stayers Cup will be a gruelling test of stamina

The magnificent Mysuru Palace in the centre of the city of Mysuru is said to represent a blend of Hindu, Islamic, Gothic and Rajput architectural styles.

This is one of the biggest tourist attractions going, but on this last Saturday of February and that too in the Leap Year, it will be the Mysore Race Club that will hold centre stage, as they gear up to host the first day of Indian Racing’s showpiece of the year, the Invitation Cup Weekend.

The two star attractions of Saturday will be the running of the Bangalore Turf Club Sprinters Cup — a test for speed run over 1200 metres and the Dr. M. A. M. Ramaswamy Stayers Cup, a gruelling test of stamina run over 3000 metres.

Both these Races are Grade 1 affairs and they have attracted the best Sprinters and Stayers in the country.

It will be the speed merchants who will be first to set the track alight.

Scheduled as the 6th Race of a fantastic card of eight events, the Bangalore Turf Club Sprinters Cup has attracted a field of ten of the best and there’s every likelihood that the 2016 Track Record, set by Phoenix Fire of 1min. 08.94 sec, is going to be broken.

In the course of the last twelve years, five horses have won the Sprinters Cup back-to-back.

In fact it has been an almost continuous cycle broken just twice in that period of time. Two were fillies — Oasis Star in 2008 and 2009 and Ruffina in 2018 and 2019 — and both were a class apart and will go down in the annals of history as wonder fillies of the turf.

Atilla, Nefyn and Adam were the three geldings who are credited with the Sprinters Double, but none of them shared the hype and the reputation that Oasis Star and Ruffina had built up.

Absolute face-off

The race this year has all the qualities of a match race between the Bangalore-based Multifaceted (by Multidimensional-Dhaawiah) on the one side against the Bombay-based 5-year-old Iron Age (Strong Suit-Intrigue).

The former is bred at the Usha Stud, trained by Darius Byramji and will be ridden by Suraj Narredu.

The latter hails from the Manjri Stud, is trained by veteran champion trainer Imtiaz Sait and will be ridden by retained jockey P. Trevor. It’s an absolute face off.

The other eight to all intents and purposes are supposedly running for the minor placings. A quick look at the form will explain why.

Iron Age has 10 wins from 14 starts and he’s unbeaten in his last six. Multifaceted is a winner of five races from eight starts and his last three victories have each been more impressive than the other.

This could turn out to be an absolute pot-boiler which would probably be in the same mould as a Federer and Nadal final. Multifaceted, like Federer glides. He’s never in a hurry. Iron Age is a mix of Nadal and Djokovic as he powers to the front. It promises to be one hell of a match but I’m backing Multifaceted.

A first for Mysuru

The Dr. M. A. M. Ramaswamy Stayers Cup named in memory of the Baron of Indian Racing and scheduled to be run as the 7th race of the day has also attracted a field of ten. This will be the first time that the racetrack in Mysuru will witness a race run over 3000 metres. So whoever wins will be the holder of a new record and that will probably stand for the next six years.

Own Opinion won the inaugural running back in 1981. However, since then only three horses have won this gruelling test of endurance back-to-back.

Aztec did it in 1984 and 1985. Ardiles followed suit in 1987 and 1988 and then after a gap of over 25 years Astapi joined that elite club winning in 2014 and 2015. Interestingly all three horses had their names starting with the letter A.

This year Sacred Roman (Holy Roman Emperor-Clicquot) from the stable of Pesi Shroff will be going for that magical double.

He won it well in Hyderabad last year and this year Shroff has targeted him to repeat and his impressive win in the Byculla Cup over 2800 metres has definitely boosted his reputation. He will be ridden by jockey Y.S. Srinath and is sure to have a vast following. The fact that he is also the highest rated horse in the field adds to his chances.

Of course the other nine runners in the field are certainly not there to have a look at the scenery and they are definitely going to be right there when things start hotting up.

In fact four of them are by the Champion Sire Multidimensional, so on sheer weight of numbers an Usha Stud bred just might do the trick.

Of this quartet, the one that seems to appeal most to me is the Bangalore-based challenger Cosmos (Multidimensional-Hills and Stars). He’s won four of his last five starts and that last victory of his in Chennai showed that he has it in him to upset them all.",races,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/races/speed-merchants-ready-to-set-the-track-alight/article30945496.ece
7,2020/02/29,Djokovic breezes past Tsitsipas to claim fifth Dubai title,"Both players looked solid on serve early in the opening set before Djokovic turned the screw to break in the eighth game with a searing crosscourt backhand winner

World number one Novak Djokovic eased past Greek Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-3 6-4 to lift his fifth Dubai Tennis Championships title on Saturday, extending his unbeaten start to the 2020 season.

Both players looked solid on serve early in the opening set before Djokovic turned the screw to break in the eighth game with a searing crosscourt backhand winner.

The Serb closed out the set and continued to press home his advantage with another break of serve early in the second.

Tsitsipas fought back to draw level at 3-3 but went on to commit a string of unforced errors and concede two break points in the ninth game.

Djokovic surprised his opponent with a wonderfully disguised drop shot to take the lead before sealing victory on the first of his three championship points with a backhand winner down the line.

“It was very close even though it was a straight-set win,” said Djokovic, who also won the Dubai titles in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2013.

“I was fortunate to hold my serve at the start of the match.”

Djokovic has now won 21 straight matches, including 18 this season, having already lifted the inaugural ATP Cup with Serbia and a record-extending eighth Australian Open title last month.

The 32-year-old dropped just one set in Dubai this week as he fought off three match points to overcome Frenchman Gael Monfils in the semi-finals.

“Yesterday I was one shot away from losing the match when three match points down, and it could have easily happened I was not here. That is sport - things can turnaround quickly,” said Djokovic.

“I have played really well in most of the matches. This is a big win for me.”",tennis,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/dvkwpd/article30953134.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TENNIS-DUBAI,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/djokovic-breezes-past-tsitsipas-to-claim-fifth-dubai-title/article30953127.ece
8,2020/02/29,Dubai Open tennis | Djokovic saves three match points to set up final clash with Tsitsipas,"In the other semifinal, Tsitsipas beat Briton Dan Evans 6-2 6-3 to advance to his second final in a week.

World number one Novak Djokovic saved three match points to beat France's Gael Monfils 2-6 7-6(8) 6-1 on Friday as he set up a final showdown at the Dubai Open with Greek second seed Stefanos Tsitsipas.

Djokovic is yet to lose this year and the Australian Open champion extended his unbeaten run in 2020 to 17 matches with what was also his 17th win over Monfils.

“It was truly an escape, he was clearly the better player for two sets,” Djokovic said in the post-match interview.

“I was fortunate to work my way back in the second set. Gael is playing as well as he has played ever, I've played him many times. I know I have a good defence but what he did today for two sets was unbelievable.”

A double break in the opening set gave Monfils an early advantage as Djokovic dropped his first set of the tournament, failing to find answers when faced with Monfils' long reach and well-angled returns.

Djokovic's drop shots that had held him in good stead in the tournament also proved to be ineffective against the athletic Monfils, who was up to the task of lengthening rallies to prevent the Serb from controlling points.

Djokovic finished with 17 unforced errors in the first set and his frustrations only mounted when he was broken at 1-1 in the second, with the 32-year-old screaming in the direction of his team while the crowd roared its approval for Monfils.

But Djokovic had his share of fans in the crowd too and they egged him on to restore parity as he converted his first break point to make it 3-3. However, a visibly tiring Monfils still held on to save five set points to take it to a tiebreak.

Monfils was doubled over between every point at this stage but the Frenchman then got a second wind in the tiebreak to go 6-3 up, before squandering three match points. Djokovic then benefited from a double fault to convert his eighth set point.

Fatigue set in for Monfils in the third as Djokovic won 12 points in a row to take a 4-1 lead and a medical timeout did little to alleviate his suffering as the top seed converted his first match point to clinch the contest.

In the other semifinal, Tsitsipas beat Briton Dan Evans 6-2 6-3 to advance to his second final in a week.

13,2020/02/29,Joe Biden counting on win in South Carolina to revive hopes,"The former vice president is the firm favorite in the first state with a substantial African-American Democratic electorate to weigh in

Voters headed to the polls in South Carolina on Saturday for the fourth contest in the Democratic presidential nomination race, with Joe Biden looking to salvage his flagging White House hopes with a big win.

Also read | Bernie Sanders wins Nevada caucuses, takes national Democratic lead

The former vice president is the firm favorite in the first state with a substantial African-American Democratic electorate to weigh in — but trails far behind frontrunner Bernie Sanders in nationwide polls.

Both candidates will have a better picture of their overall prospects next week, when 14 states cast ballots on “Super Tuesday” — and a third of the delegates who formally choose the Democratic candidate to face President Donald Trump in November are up for grabs.

Mr. Biden — the onetime race leader who failed to notch a win in Iowa, New Hampshire or Nevada — said he hopes South Carolina will propel him into national contention.

Voters have until 7:00 pm (2300 GMT) to make their choice.

“I've worked hard to earn these votes, and I think I'll do well,” the 77-year-old told CNN on Friday.

“It's been the launching pad for Barack and I believe for me,” Mr. Biden added, referring to the nation's first black president and his boss for eight years, Barack Obama.

Mr. Biden leads in state polling, a dozen points ahead of Mr. Sanders and 20 points up on billionaire activist Tom Steyer, who is gunning for a third-place finish.

Steyer has spent an extraordinary $23.6 million on ads in South Carolina, nearly 10 times the number two spender, former Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg, according to Advertising Analytics.

At one polling place in a suburb of the state capital Columbia, about 20 people were lined up at 7:00 am when the doors opened. In the first hour of voting, a steady stream of voters waited.

For 67-year-old retiree Samantha Rogers, who is black, Mr. Biden is the right candidate to take on Mr. Trump.

“He's more experienced. He's for all people, not just African Americans. He's for everyone,” she told AFP.

But for 21-year-old student Andrea Green, “Bernie is telling the truth. He's authentic.”

- 'Exemplary heart' -

Mr. Biden and fellow moderates including Buttigieg and Senator Amy Klobuchar may well face a Mr. Sanders buzz saw come Super Tuesday, with the 78-year-old self-declared democratic socialist leading in the two biggest prizes including crown jewel California.

Mr. Sanders is dominating there with 32.5 percent support, according to the RealClearPolitics polling average, with fellow progressive Senator Elizabeth Warren second.

Mr. Biden is a distant third with just 12.5 percent, in danger of missing the 15 percent threshold for earning delegates from the state.

Mr. Sanders has eclipsed Mr. Biden in Texas, the other big Super Tuesday delegate gold mine, and expanded his lead there after a CNN poll showed him ahead of Mr. Biden by six points.

The senator also tops polls in Super Tuesday states Colorado, Maine, North Carolina, Utah, Virginia, his home state of Vermont and Warren's Massachusetts. Some of the races are tight.

With several Democratic establishment leaders fretting that Mr. Sanders could hold an insurmountable delegate lead after Tuesday, some have begun openly sounding the alarm.

Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, the 2016 vice presidential nominee, endorsed Mr. Biden on Friday, tweeting that “Joe has exemplary heart, character, and experience” to be commander-in-chief.

South Carolina congressman James Clyburn, an influential black lawmaker who has endorsed Mr. Biden, warned of “down-ballot carnage” if the Democratic nominee is seen as too radical.

With party grandees desperate for a moderate to halt Mr. Sanders, the frontrunner punched back to say his campaign is best positioned to win.

“One of the things the establishment is doing is, they're saying, 'Bernie can't beat Trump,'” Mr. Sanders told a crowd in St. George, South Carolina.

He pointed out that over the country's last 60 head-to-head polls with the incumbent, “we're ahead of Trump in 56 of them.”

Mr. Sanders said his campaign will triumph “because we have an agenda that speaks to the needs of working-class people.”

- Sanders too 'radical'? -

Rivals have mounted a fusillade of attacks against Mr. Sanders.

Among them were ads slamming his gun rights voting record, aired by former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, who skipped the first four states in favor of making a splash on Super Tuesday.

The centrist Bloomberg, a billionaire media tycoon, has pumped a record $500 million into advertising, leading rivals to accuse him of seeking to “buy” his way into the race.

Mr. Buttigieg has warned that Mr. Sanders would be too “radical” a nominee, while Biden suggested the frontrunner would get trounced by Mr. Trump in southern states.

“Do you think running as a socialist would help you in Georgia, in North Carolina?” Mr. Biden said on CNN. “In South Carolina? In Texas?”

Mr. Trump put his own thumb on the scales Friday, at a rally in South Carolina.

“While we're building a great future, the radical Democrats are trying to burn it down,” he told the crowd.

Mr. Trump concluded that the race was “down to two candidates: crazy Bernie and sleepy Joe,” adding that it was time for Bloomberg to throw in the towel and “go home.”

15,2020/02/29,Some respite in the Indo-Lankan fisheries conflict,"The number of Indian trawlers entering Lankan waters has fallen after new laws were passed

Depending on the spot along the coast of Jaffna peninsula, resident fishermen share different versions of the familiar story of “poaching Indian trawlers”.

“The situation is much better now,” said K. Rajachandran, a fisher leader in Karainagar, about 20 km northwest of Jaffna town. “I would say the Indian trawlers coming to our waters has reduced by more than 50% after the new laws were introduced,” he said.

He was referring to the time after Sri Lanka legally banned trawling in 2017 and imposed stiffer fines on foreign vessels found fishing in its territorial waters in 2018. The move came after Sri Lanka’s northern fishermen struggled for years, constantly highlighting their falling catch and disappearing livelihoods.

The Indian trawlers, usually from Tamil Nadu, not only crossed the International Maritime Boundary Line to fish in Sri Lanka’s resource-rich seas, but also used a destructive fishing method that virtually scooped out the sea-bed, adversely impacting fish production and marine biodiversity. The Palk Bay fisheries conflict, which intensified after the war ended in 2009, posed a serious challenge to the livelihoods of Tamil fishermen in Sri Lanka, who were trying to rebuild their lives.

In fact, trawlers from Tamil Nadu had caused considerable damage to the catch in its own seas, as it did to the livelihoods of fishermen using smaller boats along coastal Tamil Nadu, particularly in Rameswaram and Nagapattinam. But on the Sri Lankan side, they amplified fisher folk’s post-war distress.

Many rounds of talks between the Indian and Sri Lankan governments, and among fisher leaders didn’t bring a solution any closer. Sri Lanka went for tougher laws.

Ever since, both officials and Sri Lankan fishermen have observed a drop in the number of instances of Indian trawlers poaching. Official statistics show that while as many as 453 Indian fishermen were arrested in 2017 — they have all been released and repatriated — only 156 were arrested on charges of poaching in 2018. Last year, 210 were arrested and this year, 34 have been held until mid-February. “We have been spotting some species of fish again after many years and the catch is also going up steadily,” Mr. Rajachandran said.

Trail of destruction

When things were looking up for the community, Sri Lanka’s own trawler fleet — smaller than the Indian ones but destructive nonetheless — began expanding. The Indian trawlers’ trail of destruction was not only evident in sea, but also in the smaller vessels they had bred in Sri Lanka. A few hundred fishermen in Jaffna saw quick money in these powerful vessels and invested in them.

According to many northern fishermen, the trawlers originated from Gurunagar, located on the southern coast of the peninsula. The village is a 10-minute drive from Jaffna town, but starkly different. The five-storied residential complex is crowded, with each of its tiny apartments, packed to the brim with people and their belongings. Fishing is the main livelihood for men, while women are mostly engaged in daily-waged labour. “It’s not us, it’s the Indian trawlers,” said a young fisherman, who did not reveal his name fearing “repercussions”. “Even now, they come thrice a week to our coast. I don’t know about other parts,” he said, adding the people of the village felt “helpless and hopeless”. He claimed that fishermen like him didn’t operate smaller trawlers and instead squarely blamed the Indian trawlers for his plight.

While Sri Lanka’s northern fishermen continue braving conflicts, local and international, the two governments are trying to sort out pending cases. As many as 130 of the Indian trawlers seized by the Sri Lankan Navy over the past few years will have to be discarded, as they have corroded and are no more fit to be used. During his visit to New Delhi in November, soon after his election victory, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa announced the release of 57 boats in Sri Lankan custody.

In a potentially long-term initiative, Sri LankanPrime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Douglas Devananda, who were in New Delhi in early February, have proposed that the two countries set up a joint marine resources management authority, with experts, officials and fisher leaders from either side of the Palk Strait.

However, the Indo-Lanka fisheries conflict — at least a decade old now — cannot be simply “managed”, as past efforts have proved. They need to be solved. And that might need greater political will from both sides.

16,2020/02/29,A festival of ideas in Lahore,"The 8th edition of the LLF saw a host of delegates discussing issues from poetry to multilateralism

The eighth edition of the Lahore Literary Festival (LLF) that took place from February 21 to February 23 in the city had a plethora of writers and speakers. They included Nobel laureate Orhan Pamuk, historian William Dalrymple, Nigerian-British novelist Oyinkan Braithwaite and strategic analyst Vali Nasr.

One of the most important cultural events in South Asia, the LLF “is a labour of love”, said Razi Ahmed, the fest’s founder and CEO. Every edition is planned a year in advance and it requires a lot of persuasion to get the best delegates to travel to Pakistan. “We work closely with our delegates to show them a multi-faceted sense of the city — Lahore — where it’s surely pivoted around the LLF but also encompasses an experience of the city’s streets, architecture, food, museums and private homes.” Mr. Ahmed said.

Why Lahore, one may ask. “Lahore has historically been a gateway of ideas and cultural encounters,” Mr. Ahmed told The Hindu. “After [former Prime Minister] Benazir Bhutto’s assassination, fear had started enveloping our collective psyche, festivals like Basant were being banned, and Lahore’s rich and varied creative expressions were not being celebrated at home. This made for an urgent case for Lahore to have a platform, a public space, for the triumph of ideas over fear and curtailing freedoms,” he said.

Inspired by that idea, the LLF decided to take that spirit of Lahore to two of the most dynamic global cities — London and New York — to introduce the rich social and literary thought that this city has produced to the Pakistani community abroad and also to showcase Pakistan in a different light.

This year’s edition saw discussions on a host of topics, ranging from Faiz Ahmed Faiz’s poetry and Pakistan’s role in the Muslim world to the situation in Kashmir and the “global retreat of multilateralism”.

Shared South Asian connection

Who’s Mr. Ahmed’s favourite delegate in the eight years of the fest? “While all our delegates are special and we roll out the red carpet for them, I personally enjoyed hosting Romila Thapar [in 2015] the most as I see a shared South Asian connection to understand the historical truths which were manipulated by the colonial powers. Her memory and knowledge of Lahore, while we drove together to sites such as Bradlaugh Hall and Maryam Zamani Masjid have contributed to my growth as a person.”

Nitasha Kaul, a London-based academic, author and poet of Kashmiri origin, was in Lahore for the LLF. Ms. Kaul said her visit to Lahore was brief and memorable. “I loved glimpses of the city... It is a city with striking parallels to Delhi, unsurprisingly so, given the common historical roots.” She says she found the LLF to be neither too large or too small — “just Goldilocks right!”

Asked if literature festivals should be political, Ms. Kaul said everything is always already political. “In a sense, silence upon political matters at the present global moment is in itself the proclamation of a kind of politics. In my view, literature is an important way of reflecting, reimagining, and dialoguing with social and political realities. And so, yes, litfests should be political with a view to making the world less oppressive and more liveable for all, especially those who are marginalised anywhere.” Ms. Braithwaite, the Nigerian-U.K. novelist whose debut book My Sister the Serial Killer was longlisted for the Booker Prize, said: “The food was fantastic, the weather was just right and the people were warm and welcoming.”

Ms. Braithwaite said she saw more young people at the LLF than she is generally used to seeing at festivals. “I understand a lot of effort was made to ensure students took part. The participation from the audience was always very encouraging.” She enjoyed shopping at Liberty Market. “I was particularly drawn to the wooden crafts. I had to consider my luggage allowance or I would certainly have acquired more things.”

Marium Chaudhry, a broadcast journalist and founder of the media platform The Current, said LLF 2020 had a very diverse set of speakers and it was inspiring to see that the events were not just attended by adults but by avid teens who were attending book launches.

Audrey Truschke, author of Aurangzeb: The Life and Legacy of India's Most Controversial King, told The Hindu that the LLF brings outside voices into Pakistan and highlights important voices within the country. “I think the festival is a space in which ideas are shared, discussed, and debated in ways edifying to both the panelists and the audience,” she added.

18,2020/02/29,Japan’s Diamond Princess fiasco,"The Abe government’s handling of coronavirus infections on a cruise ship is drawing criticism

For Shinzo Abe’s government, 2020 was meant to be the year the global spotlight on the Olympic Games revealed a resilient, even resurgent Japan. Instead, as the archipelago has emerged as one of the largest coronavirus-affected clusters outside China, its handling of the crisis is drawing criticism, highlighting the systemic challenges. The country is a finely tuned piece of machinery that functions preternaturally well when things are going according to plan. But an unexpected googly, in this case the COVID-19 virus, can derail its usual efficiency.

The main case in point has been the Diamond Princess cruise ship, whose 3,700 passengers and crew had to endure a two-week quarantine while docked at Yokohama port, after it was discovered that a passenger who had disembarked earlier had tested positive for the virus. As new cases on the ship came to light every day, it was dubbed the world’s biggest floating petri dish. At least 700 confirmed COVID-19 cases have been linked to the ship.

The failures regarding the ship were manifold. To begin with, it took the Japanese authorities more than 72 hours to impose a lockdown after they were first notified of the initial case connected to the ship, with the result that for a day after the quarantine began, hundreds of passengers continued gathering for cruise activities and eating together. Moreover, throughout the two weeks, the 1,000-plus crew members were confined in tight quarters below deck. Eighty-five of these were eventually found to be infected, including a dozen Indians. Sick crewmembers slept in cabins with room-mates who continued their duties across the ship, undercutting the quarantine.

Eight public workers, who boarded the ship to support the quarantine, have also tested positive for COVID-19, and more may follow, which indicates that precautions to prevent the spread of infections on board were lacking. Several of the officials involved with testing and other tasks related to curtailing the outbreak were bureaucrats with little experience in managing infectious disease.

According to some reports, there were instances of officials failing to wear full protective gear. Most of the roughly 90 Health Ministry employees who visited the ship during the quarantine initially returned to their normal duties, although they have since been asked to quarantine themselves at home for 14 days.

Medical resources

Despite its technological advances, Japan’s authorities were unable to provide sufficient medical resources for testing. Many quarantined passengers complained of problems getting medical attention even after showing symptoms. While in neighbouring China, a purpose-built hospital for virus patients was constructed in a week, Japan was unable to find any alternative facility to house the cruise ship passengers despite fears that the infection was spreading on board.

Some countries, like the U.S., took citizens off the ship and repatriated them before the two-week quarantine period in Japan was up, as long as they underwent another, properly-supervised quarantine period after their return. But in Japan, close to 1,000 passengers who tested negative walked free on February 19, even though experts fear some of them could have been exposed and develop symptoms only later.

The Health Minister eventually revealed that 23 passengers had been released from the ship without taking a valid recent test and had travelled by public transport after disembarking. In fact, just two days after leaving the ship with a negative test result, a woman in her 60s tested positive for COVID-19.

The crisis has also highlighted the absence in Japan of an autonomous decision-making agency specialising in disease control, equivalent to the U.S.’s or China’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Japan has a National Institute of Infectious Diseases, but it lacks independence from the Health Ministry and has been subject to hefty budget cuts in recent years.

What was meant to be a year of celebration is now imperilled. COVID-19 is on a collision course with the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, scheduled for July-August. The possibility of the Games being cancelled cannot be ruled out, despite the government having spent nearly $30 billion on the preparations. The Olympics aside, the trajectory of the virus in Japan is emblematic of Tokyo’s inability to deal flexibly with a chaotic, changing environment, in part because of an over-reliance on algorithm-following bureaucracy and the accompanying tendency to be less than transparent in a crisis.

19,2020/02/29,"This month, it will rain protests in Brazil","Bolsonaro has called on people to take to streets to ‘defend him’ as his critics plan multiple rallies

“It’s the wind blowing free, it’s the end of the slope/It’s a beam, it’s a void, it’s a hunch, it’s a hope/And the river bank talks of the waters of March,” sang Tom Jobim, the Bossa Nova genius, in a song he wrote and composed in 1972 as an ode to the summer rain that lashes Rio de Janeiro in March. Like the rain, coming down in sheets and columns with gusts of wind, the song Waters of March captures Brazil at this time of the year when the Carnival revelry is dying down, the skies are grey and the mood on the street a little sombre.

This year has been a bit different. February was one of the wettest months in a long time, receiving a huge portion of annual rain. The Carnival parade in Rio and other cities became a one big protest song against the government. The skies may be bluer than usual for March; and it’s going to rain protests — a continuation of public outrage shown during the country’s biggest festival.

Strangely, leading the protest efforts is President Jair Bolsonaro, who himself provoked strong reactions from Samba schools during the Carnival for his far-right policies. Then, just as the Carnival was getting over this week, Mr. Bolsonaro sent out a message in a WhatsApp group, backing a protest planned by extreme right-wing groups against the Congress and in defence of the Army and the government. The demonstration, scheduled for March 15, has been in planning since January, but it got a boost this week after a top General dubbed the members of Congress as “racketeers” and Mr. Bolsonaro himself sent out a video calling on the people to “take to the streets to defend” him.

Criticism and panic

With several organisers of the March 15 “protest” openly calling for “military intervention” and “closing down” of Congress and the Supreme Court, there has been widespread criticism — and some panic — across the political spectrum.

Former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who was barred from running against Mr. Bolsonaro in 2018, has called on Brazilians to stand up against the “authoritarian act”. “Bolsonaro has never gotten on with democracy. He’s a false patriot who is surrendering our sovereignty to the U.S. and condemning the people to poverty,” Mr. Lula tweeted. Even right-wing leaders like former President Fernando Cardoso and Sao Paulo’s Governor Joao Doria have denounced Mr. Bolsonaro’s move. “Brazil fought so hard to rescue its democracy. We must vehemently reject any act that disrespects this country’s democratic institutions and pillars,” said Mr. Doria.

Between 1964 and 1985, Brazil was ruled by Generals who had closed Congress and established a brutal regime. Mr. Bolsonaro has often expressed his admiration for these 21 years. With the majority of Brazilians born after these tragic years and civil society organisations taking deep roots in the country since the return of democracy, a series of rallies and protests have been planned in “defence of democracy”.

On March 8, the International Women’s Day, there will be rallies in all major cities to condemn the federal government’s “pension reforms” and to “highlight black women”. On March 14, a day before the far-right groups take to the streets, demonstrations will mark two years since the murder of Marielle Franco, the black and gay city Councillor in Rio, who was gunned down by the militia which has alleged links to the Bolsonaro family.

Since coming to power last year, the Bolsonaro government has spent quite a lot of energy on cutting down public services, including healthcare and education. On March 18, three days after demonstrations by supporters of the President, massive protests have been planned with the theme of “Dictatorship, Never Again”. “The government’s policies are hurting our future as it cuts down money for education and fails to create jobs. At the same time, they keep eulogising the Army rule. The last thing Brazil needs is any military intervention in politics,” says Raul Perreira, 23, a university student.

The country’s history still haunts it. On March 31, the day on which the military began its dictatorship in 1964, thousands will be out on the streets, remembering those who got swallowed by those dark days. At some places, they would be recalling the “greatest Brazilian song” of all time, sung by Jobim in his velvet voice. “The rest of a stump, a lonesome road/A sliver of glass, a life, the sun/A knife, a death, the end of the run/And the river bank talks of the waters of March…” sang Jobim 48 years ago. This March, thousands would be humming these lines across Brazil.

20,2020/02/29,"U.S., Taliban sign peace deal; American troops to leave Afghanistan in 14 months","U.S. Defence Secretary Mark Esper said if Taliban renege on their guarantees, Washington “will not hesitate to nullify” the agreement.

The United States signed a historic deal with Taliban insurgents on Saturday that could pave the way toward a full withdrawal of foreign soldiers from Afghanistan over the next 14 months and represent a step toward ending the 18-year-war there.

While the agreement paves the way for the United States to gradually pull out of its longest war, many expect that talks to come between the multiple Afghan sides will be far more complicated.

The deal was signed in the Qatari capital Doha by U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and Taliban political chief Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was on hand to witness the ceremony.

U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper meanwhile travelled to Kabul on a visit that officials and experts said was aimed at reassuring the Afghan government about the United States' commitment to the country.

For U.S President Donald Trump, the deal represents a chance to make good on his promise to bring U.S. troops home. But security experts have also called it a foreign policy gamble that would give the Taliban international legitimacy.

“Today is a monumental day for Afghanistan,” the U.S. Embassy in Kabul said on Twitter. “It is about making peace and crafting a common brighter future. We stand with Afghanistan.”

Hours before the deal, the Taliban ordered all its fighters in Afghanistan “to refrain from any kind of attack ... for the happiness of the nation.”

“The biggest thing is that we hope the U.S. remain committed to their promises during the negotiation and peace deal,” said Zabiullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the hardline Islamist group.

Mujahid said it was “irritating and provocative” that foreign military aircraft continued to fly over Taliban territory, but militia fighters were following the order to stand-down.

For millions of Afghans, the deal represents some hope for an end to years of bloodshed.

“Peace is extremely simple and my country deserves it. Today is the day when maybe we will see a positive change,” said Javed Hassan, 38, a school teacher living on the outskirts of Afghan capital, Kabul.

Hassan's children were killed in a bomb blast carried out by the Taliban in 2018. Since then, he has been writing letters to world leaders urging them to end the Afghan war.

Uncertain prospects

But prospects for peace remain uncertain given the next step is reaching agreement with the Afghan government.

Senior members of the Afghan government and countries surrounding Afghanistan have been concerned that the United States could abandon Kabul much like it was perceived to have left the region after the Soviet Union exited Afghanistan decades ago.

The accord also comes amid a fragile political situation in Afghanistan. The Independent Election Commission said on Feb. 18 that Ghani won a Sept. 28 vote beset by allegations of rigging, technical problems and other irregularities.

Afghanistan Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah rejected the results, claimed to be the victor and vowed to name a parallel government.

Michael Kugelman, deputy director Asia Program at the Wilson Center, said of Esper's trip to Kabul that “Washington is essentially trying to show that its full strength is behind this deal and it wants to also indicate to Kabul that it's fully behind Afghanistan as the peace and reconciliation process moves toward a formal beginning.”

“(Esper's trip is) perhaps an indication that the U.S. is ready to essentially accept the new government in Afghanistan,” he added.

The war, which has killed tens of thousands of people, began when the United States launched attacks on Afghanistan just weeks after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington by the Afghanistan-based al Qaeda militant group.

Washington accused the Taliban of harbouring al Qaeda and its leader Osama bin Laden, and with its allies ousted the group from power. But the Taliban has remained a potent force and currently controls about 40% of Afghan territory.

Troop withdrawal

Trump said in a statement on Friday said the deal will pave way for U.S. troop numbers to drop to 8,600 from about 13,000 in the weeks following the deal.

Further reductions of Western forces will hinge on the Taliban adhering to a “reduction in violence” pledge, a condition that will be assessed by the United States.

Under the deal, the Taliban wants 5,000 fighters to be released from Afghan-run jails, but it is not clear whether the Afghan government will agree.

There are also questions about whether Taliban fighters loyal to hardline Islamist splinter groups will be willing to adhere to the reduction in violence agreement.

Some senior commanders of the Taliban in Doha for the signing said they will ensure that the U.S. and Afghan governments accept all the conditions laid down by the group, according to Afghan defence officials.

Sources in the Taliban earlier this month said they were prepared to launch a spring offensive and had recruited more than 6,000 fighters and suicide bombers if the agreement collapses.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/dk5h1f/article30951484.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/US-TALIBAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-taliban-sign-peace-deal-american-troops-to-leave-afghanistan-in-14-months/article30951283.ece

The United States and its allies will withdraw all their forces from Afghanistan within 14 months if the Taliban abide by an agreement due to be signed in Doha on Saturday, Washington and Kabul said in a joint statement.

Both the U.S. and the Taliban delegation have arrived at Doha ceremony to sign deal with Taliban

After an initial reduction of troops to 8,600 within 135 days of Saturday’s signing, the U.S. and its partners “will complete the withdrawal of their remaining forces from Afghanistan within 14 months... and will withdraw all their forces from remaining bases”, the declaration stated.

22,2020/02/29,Qatar confirms first coronavirus case,"The health ministry said the infected patient had been admitted to hospital

Qatar has confirmed its first case of COVID-19, state media reported Saturday, after a 36-year-old Qatari woman who was evacuated to Doha from Iran tested positive.

Qatar on Thursday repatriated a number of its citizens from Iran — which is battling the worst outbreak outside China — and confined them to a 14-day period of quarantine, the government said.

The health ministry said the infected patient had been admitted to hospital.

“This had been expected because of the virus’s spread across the region and other countries, alongside the exponential increase in the number of cases,” the health ministry said according to the Qatar News Agency.

Iran on Saturday reported nine new deaths from COVID-19 and 205 fresh cases in the past 24 hours, bringing its overall toll to 43 dead and 593 infected.

Gulf countries have announced a raft of measures to cut links with Iran to prevent COVID-19 from spreading, after infections emerged among people returning from pilgrimages to the Islamic republic.

Saudi Arabia on Friday barred citizens from the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council, which includes Qatar, from entering two of Islam’s holiest cities amid fears over COVID-19.

The Gulf tally stands at 45 cases of coronavirus in Kuwait, 38 in Bahrain, six in Oman and two more in the United Arab Emirates for a total of 21.

On Saturday the U.A.E. also announced it was suspending nursery school classes, and limiting activities at other schools.

Authorities said that two planes will also be sent to Iran to collect Emiratis and other Gulf citizens trapped there after air routes were closed.

Cyclists taking part in the U.A.E. Tour are awaiting the results of COVID-19 tests from their hotel lockdown, after the event was abandoned Thursday when two staff from an Italian team tested positive.

Iran Saturday dismissed as “rumours” a report that COVID-19 has killed more than 200 people in the country, one of the hardest hit by the disease, with senior officials among those infected.

Since it announced its first COVID-19 deaths, Iran has scrambled to bring the outbreak under control, shutting schools, suspending cultural and sporting events and halting meetings of the cabinet and parliament.

The health ministry on Saturday reported nine new deaths and a 53 percent jump in infections over the previous 24 hours taking the overall totals to 43 deaths and 593 cases.

It was the highest number of new cases for a single day since Iran announced its first two deaths in Qom, a centre for Islamic studies and pilgrims from abroad, on February 19.

Citing unnamed sources in Iran’s health system, the BBC’s Persian-language service said on Friday that at least 210 people had died in the COVID-19 outbreak.

Most of the dead were in Qom or in the capital Tehran, the London-based broadcaster said.

Health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour accused foreign media of spreading misinformation about the outbreak as he announced the new figures on Saturday.

“Given the rumours and false and contradictory content that may be published from satellite networks or media which are not well-intentioned towards Iranian people, I must say that what we publish as definitive statistics is based on the latest definitive findings of laboratory tests,” he told a televised news conference.

On Friday, he accused BBC Persian of joining Iran’s regional enemies in a “race to spread lies“.

“Iran’s exemplary transparency in publishing information on the COVID-19 has stunned many people,” Mr. Jahanpour tweeted.

The fear over the rapid spread of the virus is palpable on the streets of Tehran, which were less crowded than usual with people apparently staying at home.

Traffic was flowing more freely than normal in the capital on Saturday morning, when it usually chokes the streets at the start of the working week.

The office of Tehran’s governor announced a reduction in working hours in a bid to reduce the chances of the virus spreading, state television reported.

Shops and pharmacies have been struggling to meet demand as people have been stocking up on bleach, disinfectant wipes, face masks and other sanitary products, as well as non-perishable food.

Large posters have gone up on advertising billboards in the capital urging people to follow hygiene guidelines such as washing hands and not touching handrails and other objects in public places.

In Bandar Abbas, on Iran’s Gulf coast, residents reportedly set alight a clinic rumoured to be treating people infected with COVID-19 on Friday night.

“The unsubstantiated rumour that several coronavirus patients were being held at the clinic... provoked some residents to set fire to it,” Fars news agency said, adding the facility denied it had any such patients.

Police and firefighters arrived and calm was restored before the blaze was extinguished, Fars reported.

Iran’s death toll is the highest for any country other than China — where COVID-19 first emerged.

One of Iran’s seven vice presidents, Massoumeh Ebtekar, and Deputy Health Minister Iraj Harirchi are among several senior officials who have been infected.

Mr. Jahanpour said on Saturday that 205 cases had been detected in the previous 24 hours, increasing the total of confirmed infections to 593.

Among the latest infections, 22 were in Golestan, a new outbreak in the northeastern province on the Caspian Sea coast.

Many of Iran’s neighbours have reported SARS-CoV-2 infection in people linked to Iran, and most have imposed restrictions on travel to and from the Islamic republic.

On Wednesday, Iranian authorities announced domestic travel restrictions for people with confirmed or suspected infections.

The United States and Paris-based media watchdog Reporters Without Borders have accused Iran of concealing information about the outbreak, which has claimed an unusually high proportion of the lives of those infected in the Islamic republic.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/slb3mj/article30950937.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IranVirusOutbreak,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/iran-dismisses-rumours-as-virus-deaths-jump-to-43/article30950938.ece

A Turkish official said Saturday that Turkey destroyed a chemical warfare facility after dozens of its soldiers were killed by Syrian regime fire in the last-rebel enclave of Idlib province.

The Turkish army destroyed overnight “a chemical warfare facility, located some 13 kilometres south of Aleppo, along with a large number of other regime targets,” the senior official told reporters on condition of anonymity.

However, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which relies on sources inside the war-torn country, said that Turkey instead hit a military airport in eastern Aleppo, where the monitoring group says there are no chemical weapons.

Thirty-three Turkish soldiers were killed in an air strike by Russian-backed Syrian regime forces in the Idlib region on Thursday, the biggest Turkish military loss on the battlefield in recent years.

The latest incident has raised further tensions between Ankara and Moscow, whose relationship has been tested by violations of a 2018 deal to prevent a regime offensive on Idlib.

As part of the agreement, Ankara set up 12 observation posts in the province but Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s forces — backed by Russian air power — have pressed on with a relentless campaign to take back the region.

On Friday, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke by phone with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, in a bid to scale down the tensions.

Erdogan may travel next week to Moscow for talks, according to the Kremlin.

27,2020/02/29,Mexico confirms three COVID-19 cases in three men returned from Italy,"The first case is a 35-year-old man who showed positive in an initial test in Mexico City also test positive in a second test early on Friday, Deputy Health Minister Hugo Lopez-Gatell Ramirez told a news conference.

Mexico's government said on Friday it had detected three cases of coronavirus infection in three men who had all recently traveled to Italy, making the country the second in Latin America to register the fast-spreading virus.

The first case is a 35-year-old man who showed positive in an initial test in Mexico City also test positive in a second test early on Friday, Deputy Health Minister Hugo Lopez-Gatell Ramirez told a news conference.

That man was linked to the second case, a 41-year-old in the northern state of Sinaloa, Mr. Lopez-Gatell told reporters, speaking alongside President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.

Health officials confirmed the third case, a man who had traveled with the other two, at another news conference late on Friday but said all three cases were imported and that there was so far no evidence of human-to-human transmission in the country.

President Lopez Obrador urged the population to remain calm.

“We have the capacity to handle this situation,” he said. ”Because according to the information available, this is not something terrible, really bad.”

Mexico's main stock index suffered one of its biggest falls in months, tumbling more than 4% in morning trading, while the peso fell by more than 1% against the dollar.

The three men confirmed with coronavirus were in Italy for about a week in mid-February, and likely became infected at a convention in the northern city of Bergamo, the government said.

All three were being held in isolation, Mr. Lopez-Gatell said, and officials are observing five family members in isolation.

The Mexico City resident had light, cold-like symptoms and was at low risk, he added. However, the man in Sinaloa did not show symptoms, Sinaloa's health minister Efren Encinas said at a separate news conference.

For now, there are no grounds for closing schools or having people stay away from their workplaces, Mr. Lopez-Gatell said.

“There's absolutely no reason at this point,” he added. ”There is no generalized transmission.”

Still, Mr. Lopez-Gatell recommended that people refrain from light hugs and kisses on the cheek that are commonplace greetings in Mexico.

It is due to be held from March 9 to 20.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has recommended that ministers and diplomats skip travelling to a meeting in New York of the Commission on the Status of Women due to the coronavirus outbreak, according to a letter seen by Reuters on Friday.

More than 7,000 people usually attend the annual meeting, officials said, which is dedicated to the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of women. It is due to be held from March 9 to 20.

However, in a letter to U.N. member states from the chair of the commission, Armenias U.N. Ambassador Mher Margaryan said Guterres had recommended that member states “shorten and scale down the session” and cancel dozens of side events.

“He also strongly recommended that capital-based representatives refrain from traveling to headquarters for the session,” Margaryan wrote.

The bureau of the Commission on the Status of Women proposed that member states agree to Guterres recommendations at a meeting on Monday.

U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Guterres made the recommendations given the “fast-evolving situation” with the coronavirus and the need to “balance the UNs critical work and public health concerns.

29,2020/02/29,"Afghanistan's future in the balance as U.S., Taliban sign deal","The deal was drafted over a tempestuous year of dialogue marked by the abrupt cancellation of the effort by U.S. President Donald Trump in September, 2019

Washington and the Taliban are set to sign a long-sought deal in Doha on Saturday that would see the two foes agree to the withdrawal of thousands of U.S. troops from Afghanistan in return for insurgent guarantees.

The agreement, which could herald the start of a new era for Afghanistan after decades of conflict, is expected to also lead to a dialogue between the Kabul government and the Taliban that, if successful, could ultimately see the Afghan war wind down.

But the position of the Afghan government, which has been excluded from direct U.S.-Taliban talks, remains unclear and the country is gripped by a fresh political crisis amid contested election results.

The deal, drafted over a tempestuous year of dialogue marked by the abrupt cancellation of the effort by U.S. President Donald Trump in September, 2019 , is expected to lay out a timetable for a U.S. force withdrawal.

“There's been so much speculation about the contents of the deal... we know the broad outlines but it's not even clear whether the full terms of the deal will be made public,” said Andrew Watkins, senior analyst at the International Crisis Group consultancy.

While Kabul will not be represented at the Doha signing, set for around 1100 GMT, it will send a six-person taskforce to the Qatari capital to make initial contact with the Taliban political office, established in 2013.

'Enormous opportunity'

Qatar, a peninsula nation protruding from the Arabian desert into the Gulf and better known for its gas riches and controversial 2022 World Cup bid victory, was a seemingly unlikely choice to host negotiations.

But by providing neutral space for talks on ending the conflict it has boosted its international profile and helped it defy a painful regional embargo enforced by Saudi Arabia, which accuses it of being too close to Islamist movements.

Also read: Explained | Talking with Taliban

Talks have taken place in a plush members' club in Doha, where turbaned Taliban fighters-turned-negotiators and suited American officials have rubbed shoulders with club-goers in Hawaiian shirts and swimwear.

As many as 30 nations are expected to be represented at Saturday's signing in the Qatari capital. The U.S. will stage a separate ceremony in Kabul with the Afghan government at 1215 GMT, said an Afghan source.

The inking of the deal will come after a week-long, partial truce that has mostly held across Afghanistan aimed at building confidence between the warring parties and showing the Taliban can control their forces.

While isolated attacks have continued in rural areas, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Tuesday that the truce period was “working”.

“We're on the cusp of an enormous, enormous political opportunity,” he said.

Blood and treasure

The U.S., which currently has between 12,000 and 13,000 troops in Afghanistan, could draw that number down to 8,600 within months of the agreement being signed.

Further reductions would depend on the Taliban's engagement with the government of President Ashraf Ghani, whom they have until now dismissed as a U.S.-backed puppet.

“This is just a precursor to get that process started, it's not a cause for celebration among the government or its allies,” Watkins said.

Mr. Ghani has been declared winner of last year's elections, but his main rival, Abdullah Abdullah, is refusing to recognise the win and has vowed to set up a rival government.

Any insurgent pledge to guarantee Afghanistan is never again used by jihadist groups such as Al-Qaeda and Islamic State to plot attacks abroad will be key to the deal's viability.

The Taliban's sheltering of Al-Qaeda was the main reason for the U.S. invasion following the 9/11 attacks.

The conflict has cost the U.S. taxpayer more than $1 trillion in military and rebuilding costs since the U.S.-led invasion of 2001.

30,2020/02/29,UN chief urges Syria cease-fire but Russia and China oppose,"Mr. Guterres said he’s been in very close contact with Russia and Turkey, appealing for a cease-fire in the Idlib region but “we are not yet there.” ""Without urgent action,” he warned, “the risk of even greater escalation grows by the hour.”

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres again called for an immediate cease-fire in northwestern Syria on Friday “before the situation gets entirely out of control,” and 13 of the 15 nations on the U.N. Security Council supported his appeal at an emergency meeting - but not Syria’s closest ally Russia and China.

The U.N. chief made the appeal after airstrikes in the last opposition stronghold in Idlib killed at least 33 Turkish troops on Thursday. The attack heightened tensions between pro-opposition Turkey and Russia, and raised the possibility of an all-out war with millions of Syrian civilians trapped in the middle.

Mr. Guterres said he’s been in very close contact with Russia and Turkey, appealing for a cease-fire in the Idlib region but “we are not yet there.”

""Without urgent action,” he warned, “the risk of even greater escalation grows by the hour.”

The four European Union council members - France, Germany, Belgium and Estonia - said in a joint statement that “the military escalation in Idlib must stop.”

""We demand an end to this Syrian military campaign supported by Russia, and fully back the calls made by the U.N. secretary-general for an immediate cease-fire and unimpeded humanitarian access,” they said. “We strongly urge the U.N. to accelerate and intensify their engagements with all relevant parties to secure an immediate cease-fire effort in northwest Syria.”

The four EU countries requested the emergency meeting along with the United Kingdom, United States and Dominican Republic.

U.S. Ambassador Kelly Craft condemned the attacks on the Turkish troops “in the strongest possible terms,” calling them “wholly unjustified, senseless and barbaric.” She reiterated U.S. calls for “an immediate, durable, and verifiable cease-fire”

Ms. Craft said the council meeting is “about the reckless and serious risk of the Assad regime and Russia’s offensive places on the security of a NATO ally,” but it is also about the 950,000 Syrians who have fled the government’s offensive that began in December, many now living in flimsy tents and in the open in freezing temperatures.

She asked again- “Are we going to sit back and watch? Are we going to remain silent? Or will we deliver? How many more babies have to freeze to death before we raise our voices and say, `Enough!’”

Estonia’s U.N. Ambassador Sven Jurgenson said Russia has blocked Security Council resolutions calling for a nationwide cease-fire.

""In light of what has happened, we urge Russia to reconsider its position and allow a chance for a humanitarian truce,” he said.

But Russia’s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said over recent months, “terrorists” seized Idlib and the Jihadi group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham or HTS, “has upped its incursions” against civilians and Syrian forces.

""The Syrian army is fully in its right to respond and clamp down on the terrorists,” he said. “This is in its own territory.”

China’s U.N. Ambassador Zhang Jun said “terrorism is an underlying factor” in the nine-year Syrian conflict and “eradicating the forces of terror is a necessary requirement for the restoration of peace and stability in Syria and the region.”

Terrorists “should be resolutely crushed, and safe havens established by terrorist forces in Syria should be liquidated,” he said. “At the same time, counter-terrorism operations should be cautious not to harm civilians.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ddc42a/article30887672.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ANTONIOGUTERRES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/un-chief-urges-syria-cease-fire-but-russia-and-china-oppose/article30948699.ece
31,2020/02/29,U.S. postpones summit with ASEAN leaders amid coronavirus fears: sources,"“As the international community works together to defeat the novel coronavirus, the United States, in consultation with ASEAN partners, has made the difficult decision to postpone the ASEAN leaders meeting,” one of the sources, a senior administration official, told Reuters.

The United States has decided to postpone a meeting with leaders of Southeast Asian countries it had planned to host on March 14 due to worries about the coronavirus outbreak, two U.S. officials familiar with the matter said on Friday.

President Donald Trump had invited leaders of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to meet in Las Vegas after he did not attend a summit with the group in Bangkok in November.

“As the international community works together to defeat the novel coronavirus, the United States, in consultation with ASEAN partners, has made the difficult decision to postpone the ASEAN leaders meeting,” one of the sources, a senior administration official, told Reuters.

The official added that the United States values its relationships with ASEAN member nations and looks forward to future meetings.

A spokesperson for the U.S. State Department provided an identical statement.

The U.S.-ASEAN Business Council said it was aware of the decision and said a major technology summit it was planning on the sidelines of the leaders' meeting was also being postponed.

“We look forward to working closely with U.S. and ASEAN leadership to ensure the success of this important engagement at a later date, the council's vice president, Elizabeth Dugan, said in statement.

The postponements come amid growing fears that the virus will spread in the United States as countries report new infections, companies announce curbs on employees' travel and global stock markets continue to plummet.

The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States is still relatively small at around 60, most of them repatriated American passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship that docked in Japan.

The coronavirus outbreak started in China late last year. The latest World Health Organization figures indicate over 82,000 people have been infected, with more than 2,700 deaths in China and 57 deaths in 46 other countries.

While the outbreak appears to be easing in China, it has surged elsewhere and countries other than China now account for about three-quarters of new infections.

China is not a member of ASEAN, which groups Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

Although the State Department has repeatedly stated that ASEAN is at the heart of its strategy to maintain a “free and open Indo-Pacific” in the face of rising Chinese power, Trumps decision not to attend the Bangkok meeting had raised questions about the U.S. commitment to the region.

Japan's Nikkei Asian Review earlier this month quoted diplomatic sources as saying that leaders from Vietnam, Laos, Singapore, Cambodia and Thailand had planned to attend the Las Vegas summit.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/i118rb/article24599930.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ASEAN-SINGAPORE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-postpones-summit-with-asean-leaders-amid-coronavirus-fears-sources/article30948684.ece
32,2020/02/29,"PM Modi among special guests invited for Sheikh Mujibur Rahman centenary in Dhaka, says envoy","Amid a recent unrest over the contentious law in Delhi, there have been some calls for Bangladesh to withdraw Mr. Modi’s invite to the centenary celebrations

Prime Minister Narendra Modi is among the special guests invited for the centenary celebrations of Bangladesh founder Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in Dhaka next month, according to Bangladesh High Commissioner to the U.K. Saida Muna Tasneem.

The envoy said the celebrations on March 17, which coincide with the 100th birth anniversary of Sheikh Mujib – referred to as “Bangabandhu” or the father of the Bengali Nation – will kick off a year-long series of events in Bangladesh as well as the U.K..

“Prime Minister Modi is among the special guests invited to the centenary, which also has intrinsic links with Bangabandhu’s homecoming in 1971,” Ms. Tasneem said.

“The roadmap of that journey is that he first stopped in London, where he was officially recognised as the president of the independent state of Bangladesh and had bilateral meetings at 10 Downing Street. Then he was flown to Delhi, where he held a public gathering with (the then Indian Prime Minister) Indira Gandhi,” she recalled.

The diplomat traced the active role played by the late Indira Gandhi at the time alongside the then U.K. Prime Minister, Edward Heath, to seek Sheikh Mujib’s release from Karachi Jail in Pakistan.

“They collectively played a very proactive role in the release of Bangabandhu and to ensure that he was not harmed in any way. So, at the very genesis of Bangladesh, the relationships were clear and the Bangladesh-India ties remain as strong till date, as do the U.K.-Bangladesh ties,” she said.

In reference to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), which was passed by the Indian Parliament in December last year to grant citizenship rights to persecuted minorities from three neighbouring countries including Bangladesh, the envoy said the implication of the law was “hurtful” to Bangladesh.

“The Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina, has said it is an internal matter of India but also quite unnecessary. Bengali Hindus in Bangladesh have done very well for themselves, especially in the financial sphere, as they have a particular skill with mathematics and accounts,” she said.

Amid a recent unrest over the contentious law in Delhi, there have been some calls for Bangladesh to withdraw Modi’s invite to the centenary celebrations in Dhaka next month, a demand rejected by the Bangladeshi government.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/dmoc1r/article30948675.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MODI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pm-modi-among-special-guests-invited-for-bangladesh-centenary-says-uk-envoy/article30948668.ece
33,2020/02/29,Malaysian turmoil takes new twist as Mahathir and Anwar ally again,"That meant that Mr. Mahathir, who is the world's oldest government leader at 94, would reunite with on-off ally and long-term rival Anwar Ibrahim (72), resuming a pact that swept the coalition to a surprise election victory in 2018.

Malaysia's Mahathir Mohamad will stand for the premiership on behalf of the former ruling coalition, the interim prime minister said on Saturday, less than a week after he quit and plunged the country into turmoil.

“I am now confident that I have the numbers needed to garner majority support,” Mr. Mahathir said in a statement.

That meant that Mr. Mahathir, who is the world's oldest government leader at 94, would reunite with on-off ally and long-term rival Anwar Ibrahim (72), resuming a pact that swept the coalition to a surprise election victory in 2018.

“Pakatan Harapan states its full support towards Dr Mahathir as candidate for prime minister,” said a statement from the coalition formed by the two men whose struggle has shaped Malaysian politics for two decades.

Mr. Mahathir has thus secured the likely support he needs to return as prime minister full-time, less than a week after he resigned and was appointed as interim leader.

The political futures of both Mr. Mahathir and Mr. Anwar had appeared in doubt on Friday, with Anwar competing as a candidate in his own right and Mr. Mahathir finding little support for a unity government that would have strengthened his power.

A new alliance had formed behind former interior minister Muhyiddin Yassin, 72, who had the backing of the old ruling party, the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO).

It was that party, tarnished by corruption, that Mr. Mahathir and Mr. Anwar united to drive from power in 2018 under then prime minister Najib Razak, who now faces graft charges.

Tension had persisted between Mr. Mahathir and Mr. Anwar over the prime minister's promise to one day hand power to the younger man. No date for that was ever set, however.

Neither Mr. Mahathir nor Pakatan Harapan made any mention of that promise in Saturday's statements.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kortum/article30370386.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH21-KALLOL-IndGP56SO67U7jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/malaysian-turmoil-takes-new-twist-as-mahathir-and-anwar-ally-again/article30948662.ece
34,2020/02/29,North Korean leader calls for stronger anti-virus efforts,"""In case the infectious disease spreading beyond control finds its way into our country, it will entail serious consequences,” the agency quoted Mr. Kim as saying during the politburo meeting of the Workers’ Party.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has called for stronger anti-virus efforts to guard against COVID-19, saying there will be “serious consequences” if the illness spreads to the country.

During a ruling party meeting, Mr. Kim called for the country’s anti-epidemic headquarters to strengthen screening and tests to seal off all “channels and space through which the infectious disease may find its way,” Pyongyang’s official Korean Central News Agency said Saturday.

Mr. Kim emphasized that all fields and units of the country should “unconditionally” obey quarantine instructions laid-out by the anti-epidemic headquarters. He called for the strict enforcement of preventive measures against what he described as a tricky virus that spreads rapidly.

""In case the infectious disease spreading beyond control finds its way into our country, it will entail serious consequences,” the agency quoted Mr. Kim as saying during the politburo meeting of the Workers’ Party.

The North has yet to report its first infection from the new coronavirus, but it has been pushing a tough campaign it has described as a matter of “national existence.” The country has shut down nearly all cross-border traffic, banned tourists, intensified screening at entry points and mobilized tens of thousands of health workers to monitor residents and isolate those with symptoms.

Experts say an epidemic in North Korea could be dire because of its chronic lack of medical supplies and poor health care infrastructure. But the country’s self-imposed lockdown could also hurt an economy already battered by stringent U.S.-led sanctions over its nuclear weapons and missile program.

State media reported that Mr. Kim during the recent meeting also stressed that the country’s economic goals should be met without fail amid strengthened anti-epidemic efforts.

Some experts say the country’s intensified anti-virus efforts could potentially hamper Mr. Kim’s ability to mobilize his people for labor. That could lead to possible delays in some of Mr. Kim’s ambitious development projects.

In a separate report, KCNA said Mr. Kim supervised a military drill that simulated an attack on an island target. The North’s Rodong Sinmun newspaper published photos of Mr. Kim watching from an observation post and artillery vehicles firing from a coastal area.

The report said the drill was aimed at testing the combat readiness of units in frontline and eastern areas. The report didn’t specify when and where the drill took place.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/fxnwb1/article30448385.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NORTHKOREA-POLITICS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/north-korean-leader-calls-for-stronger-anti-virus-efforts/article30948641.ece
35,2020/02/29,COVID-19: China reports 47 more deaths,"The National Health Commission also tallied 427 new cases, an increase from the previous day, bringing the total number of infections to 79,251.

China on February 29 reported 47 more deaths from the new coronavirus, raising the death toll in the country to 2,835.

The National Health Commission also tallied 427 new cases, an increase from the previous day, bringing the total number of infections to 79,251.

One person died in Beijing and another in Henan province, while 45 died in Hubei.

All but four of the new cases were in Hubei, and 420 were in its capital, Wuhan, where the virus is believed to have originated in a market that sold wild animals.

While the number of new cases rose from 327 on Friday, they remain in the hundreds, far below the huge, daily increases that China was recording more than 10 days ago.

The World Health Organization said earlier this week that there were now more daily cases abroad than in China.

China has placed 56 million people in Hubei under strict quarantine for more than a month and limited crowds across the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus.

Officials say the country has made progress against the virus but measures remain in place, including the closure of schools.

36,2020/02/29,New coronavirus case in California is of unknown origin,"“This is the third case identified in our county. But it's different from the other two cases in an important way ...Our third case did not recently travel overseas or have any known contact with a recent traveler or infected person,” Dr. Cody told an afternoon news conference.

The latest confirmed case of coronavirus in the United States, diagnosed in a California woman, is of “unknown origin” and was found in a patient who had not traveled overseas or had contact with any known travelers, local health officials said on Friday.

The woman, identified only as an adult with chronic health conditions, was referred by her physician for testing after she developed difficulty breathing, said Dr. Sara Cody, chief health officer for Santa Clara County.

Santa Clara is home to the Silicon Valley tech hub in Northern California.

“This is the third case identified in our county. But it's different from the other two cases in an important way ...Our third case did not recently travel overseas or have any known contact with a recent traveler or infected person,” Dr. Cody told an afternoon news conference.

It is also the second case of a patient who contracted the virus from an unknown origin. On Wednesday, health authorities announced a woman in Solano County, California, about 145 km to the north, was the nation's first case of community transmission.

It means the virus is now spreading within at least two separate locations in California.

Dr. Cody said that the discovery of a second patient suffering from coronavirus from unknown origins marked a new chapter for public health officials where quarantines and travel restrictions were no longer enough to contain the virus.

“We will continue to trace close contacts of our cases to try to limit the spread of the virus. But now we need to add other public health tools to the mix,” Dr. Cody said.

“Now that we have a case that did not recently travel or come in contact with anyone known to be ill, what does this mean? What we know now is that the virus is here, present at some level. But we still don't know to what degree,” she said.

The number of confirmed U.S. cases of the respiratory disease is still relatively small at roughly 60, most of them repatriated American passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Japan, but there are growing fears that the country is on the cusp of wider outbreak.

The U.S. State Department has issued travel advisories for several nations and on Friday it said Americans should reconsider travel to Italy, where nearly 900 coronavirus cases have been confirmed.

A similar warning was issued earlier this week for South Korea, which with more than 2,300 cases, has the largest outbreak outside China.

The United States will make a decision “very soon” about whether to bar entry to travelers from the countries with the most cases of the new coronavirus, U.S. President Donald Trump said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ia2zsa/article30827779.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th27-BINDU-LANCGA271L4VR3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/new-coronavirus-case-in-california-is-of-unknown-origin/article30948616.ece

The United States will sign an agreement with the Taliban as part of its efforts to bring lasting peace in war-torn Afghanistan, President Donald Trump announced on Friday.

“Soon, at my direction, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will witness the signing of an agreement with representatives of the Taliban, while Secretary of Defense Mark Esper will issue a joint declaration with the government of Afghanistan,” Mr. Trump said in a statement.

“If the Taliban and the government of Afghanistan live up to these commitments, we will have a powerful path forward to end the war in Afghanistan and bring our troops home,” he added.

The commitments represented an important step to a lasting peace in a new Afghanistan, free from al-Qaeda, ISIS and any other terror group “that would seek to bring us harm”, Mr. Trump said, adding that ultimately, it would be up to the people of Afghanistan to work out their future.

“We, therefore, urge the Afghan people to seize this opportunity for peace and a new future for their country,” the President said.

Nearly 19 years ago, American service members went to Afghanistan to root out the terrorists responsible for the 9/11 attacks, he noted.

“In that time, we have made great progress in Afghanistan, but at great cost to our brave service members, to the American taxpayers, and to the people of Afghanistan. When I ran for office, I promised the American people I would begin to bring our troops home and seek to end this war. We are making substantial progress on that promise,” Mr. Trump said.

He thanked the hundreds of thousands of American warriors who had proudly served in Afghanistan.

“We have killed or captured many ISIS and al-Qaeda terrorists. We honour your service and the sacrifices you and your families have made for the American people. These agreements are a result of the strenuous efforts of those who fought so hard in Afghanistan for the United States of America,” the President said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/9ljuge/article30887476.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/USA-TRUMP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-to-sign-agreement-with-taliban-trump/article30946954.ece

39,2020/02/29,"In Sri Lanka, yet another chance at post-war recovery","More than a decade after the civil war ended in Sri Lanka, the Tamil people in the Northern Province continue to emphasise the need for jobs, livelihoods, and a reliable market. The new government’s promise of development, they say, must come with meaningful reconciliation. Meera Srinivasan reports

The cellophane wrap is yet to be peeled off. The brand-new shutters are rolled up in almost all the 20 stalls along the margins of the large hall, 10 on each side. “It is nearly done. After all that delay because of the rains, it is finally over,” says the middle-aged man supervising the construction. He looks relieved.

The structure in Madduvil village in Jaffna district in Sri Lanka’s Northern Province is an ‘economic centre’ initiated by the previous Maithripala Sirisena-Ranil Wickremesinghe government. Built at a cost of LKR 150 million (approximately ₹6 crore), the facility came as a response to northern farmers’ frustration over being unable to sell their produce. They found the local market inadequate and fragile, and their links to the national market, from which they were cut off during the war, virtually non-existent.

The ‘economic centre’ was conceived as a central point where farmers could deposit their produce. From there, it could be transported to similar hubs, such as Dambulla in the Central Province, thereby linking the farmer to the island’s major markets, and potentially more consumers.

An intense monsoon and many bureaucratic hurdles dragged the project over the last two years, and now, the change in government three months ago has cast doubts on its future. Officials in the Northern Province administration say they are awaiting directions from the new government.

A decade may have passed since the civil war, fought by the state armed forces and rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), ravaged Sri Lanka’s Tamil-majority north and east. But the local economy is far from revived.

In 2018, the contribution of the Northern and Eastern Provinces to the national GDP was lowest in the country, at 4.1% and 5.6%, respectively. The Western Province, where the capital Colombo is located, contributed 38.5%, according to data published by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.

The Tamil people, who passionately demand accountability and justice for alleged rights violations, and a political solution to the national question, have also been drawing attention constantly to the need for jobs, livelihoods, a reliable market and rural credit that isn’t predatory. And they have been made a promise.

‘Development, not devolution’

Following his big election win in November 2019, propelled mostly by the majority Sinhalese community, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s message to the Tamils was unambiguous: “It’s going to be development, not devolution.”

“For 70 odd years, successive leaders have promised one single thing: devolution, devolution, devolution. But ultimately nothing happened,” he told The Hindu in an interview a fortnight after he assumed office, and asked people to judge him by his record on development after five years. His older brother and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa has also reiterated the message.

For people listening to the brothers’ renewed thrust on development, the fate of projects initiated by the predecessor government is only one of the many questions that arise. The nature of development that the leaders might pursue is another key concern.

As the war ended in 2009, brutally claiming tens of thousands of civilian lives, then President Mahinda Rajapaksa undertook large-scale development — building roads, providing electricity and restoring railway networks — and never missed a chance to flaunt them. The infrastructure was no doubt necessary to rebuild the area razed by incessant bombing, but it was not sufficient to win over the Tamil people residing there. The government’s version of development did not speak to the everyday concerns of Tamils yearning for a decent living, and a life without fear amid curbs by a powerful and omnipresent military. The Tamils registered their protest at every opportunity — in the 2013 provincial election and the 2015 presidential poll when Mahinda Rajapaksa was unseated after a decade in power. Even in the November 2019 presidential election, they rejected the Rajapaksa brand, despite their many disappointments with the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe government.

Meanwhile, the post-war decade had left the Tamil community heavily in debt. Sporadic, piecemeal efforts from development organisations and NGOs proved futile and at times, compounded their misery. Struggling to keep their head above water — as living costs have spiralled and joblessness prevails — people wonder if the Rajapaksas’ development vision might be any different this time.

Patchy resettlement

It is only in the last few years that B. Sekar started using multi-day boats for tuna fishing. It was a big jump from his smaller, fibre glass boat that couldn’t go much beyond the coastline. “The tuna is for exports, mainly. We don’t eat it, our people can’t afford it,” he says, standing at a newly painted shelter facing the harbour.

The former government began reconstructing the damaged fisheries harbour to help revive livelihoods of the fisherfolk of Myliddy, located on the island’s northern tip, in Jaffna peninsula. Its first phase, completed at LKR 150 million (about ₹ 6 crore), was inaugurated in August last year. This was significant because the harbour was retrieved from the military and finally available for people to access and use. After having been displaced to places far away – in some cases even to India — about 100 fisherfolk families are now resettling in their former lands around the harbour.

Data from the District Secretariat show that in Jaffna district alone, over 400 families continue to live in temporary camps for the internally displaced. They are yet to return to their original lands, some of which the army still holds.

Post-war resettlement has been at best patchy in the north and east, according to residents, for it’s never about families simply “moving back”. Resettlement entails finding housing (most houses were destroyed in war-time shelling), schooling for their children, and a steady income to rebuild lives. But for now, they at least get to go back to their land or sea, like in Myliddy.

“If this fisheries harbour is to really work for us, it has to be extended to accommodate more boats. Otherwise it will be a clamour for space all the time. If only they would take our views, we can explain exactly what is required here,” Sekar says.

Barely a few feet away, other fishermen have lined their small boats that have no place in the big harbour. “They’re developing this fisheries harbour, but you can see how they benefit only the large [multi-day] boats. Our catch has taken a big hit because the oil from the bigger boats coat and damage our nets, and we have no place to even mend them,” says P. Rasakumar. His family has returned to the area after being displaced for 28 years.

The “fruit” of development, going by his account, is skewed in favour of the relatively more powerful, even within a vulnerable community. If a multi-day boat owner like Sekar says his views are yet to be factored in by policymakers, Rasakumar has little hope his might even be heard.

On the one hand, the locals can’t let go of the development — however slow-paced, inadequate or lopsided it might be. On the other, the nascent development at their doorstep threatens to breed new conflicts — for instance, between the fishermen operating large boats and those owning small ones; or between the local Tamil fishermen of Myliddy and the Sinhalese fishermen from the southern parts of the island who park their large boats and land their catch here.

Resolving conflicts

Lebbai Rifas in neighbouring Mullaitivu district shares the concern. “Local contradictions constantly weigh us down,” says the 42-year-old, who runs a bakery in Mulliyawalai town. He is referring to the difficulties faced by Tamil-speaking Muslims who were trying to resettle in their lands after living elsewhere since the 1990s when the LTTE evicted them overnight. Rifas was in class nine when his family was forced to leave their home. “Nearly 1,000 families have returned now and it’s not just about their land. It’s about having access to agriculture, fisheries. How can you plan for development without addressing the gaps in resettlement? A progressive vision to develop our district cannot emerge unless we resolve these local tensions,” he says. “There cannot be development without reconciliation within.”

Also Read Sri Lanka’s unsettled land question

If Rifas cannot envision development without reconciliation, farmer K. Sivalingam from Kokkilai town sees no point in development without power devolution. “It has been 10 years since the war ended and look at us! All we want is to be able to govern ourselves, manage our own affairs at the provincial level. They don’t even want us to sing the national anthem in Tamil,” he says, dejected.

Like him, many people in Jaffna and Mullaitivu repeatedly referred to the Rajapaksa government’s decision to drop the Tamil anthem from the Independence Day celebrations on February 4. They see it not just as a denial of their basic right to express in their language, but also as a move foretelling more exclusion in future. Some are cynical and others, hopeless.

The people of Mullaitivu, one of the poorest districts in the country, speak of their alienation from Colombo. But they also feel distant from Jaffna. “Whether it’s provincial administration or policymaking, everything is so Jaffna-centric. They don’t understand our specific needs,” says M. Kuhanathan, a retired school principal from Vattappalai town.

The persisting disparity within the Province, between Jaffna peninsula and the Vanni (the mainland area including Mullaitivu, Vavuniya, Mannar and part of Kilinochchi district), is a familiar refrain here. “Even the war hit the Vanni a lot more, but we are still cut out,” Kuhanathan says, seated in the airy veranda at his home, barely 15 km from Mullivaikkal, where the war witnessed its gory end. He urges authorities to move on a proposed bridge connecting Mullaitivu with the Eastern Trincomalee district. “That will bring more people to our district. We cannot have investment without enabling infrastructure. And that infrastructure should benefit the people here,” Kuhanathan notes.

“There are many local needs that both the Central government and our own provincial government [2013-2018] have ignored for long. Now the national leaders are using the trope of development only to access big international loans, nothing else,” he adds.

Zooming into the rural

“We have natural resources, we just need to tap them thoughtfully,” says Kuhanathan, echoing a sentiment often heard from people of the Northern Province, particularly the Vanni. Their developmental aspirations are closely tied to their reliance on the rural economy — agriculture and fisheries.

At the same time, officials who have worked in the Province for long emphasise the need for industries if the challenge of unemployment has to be addressed — more so in Jaffna, where agriculture is not as central to the economy as in the Vanni.

According to Sri Lanka’s Labour Force Survey in 2018, the Northern and Eastern Provinces have among the highest unemployment rates in the country, 5.6% and 6% respectively, though the figure doesn’t capture those precariously engaged in the informal sector, or others who have simply given up looking for jobs.

“Most youth want government jobs, but that’s not practically possible. There is a young labour force with few options. They are not inclined towards agriculture or fisheries even if their parents are in those sectors. We need industries to come up, so they can be absorbed,” says a senior official, requesting not to be named.

A Central Bank-commissioned report in 2018 on an economic development framework for the north too recommends investing capital in existing and new small-scale industries to boost local productivity. It underscores the need for greater capital investment “to compensate for the tremendous destruction of capital assets and decades of crippled capital accumulation”.

Elusive investment

Small industries are not alien to Jaffna. Records of the Department of Statistics show that in 1983, Jaffna district alone had 3,121 manufacturing units, where thousands were employed until the war began raging. Similarly, the industrial estate in Atchuvely, Jaffna, was set up in 1971 and had over 30 factory units employing a few thousands. They were destroyed during the war. The estate was revived in 2014 with Indian assistance, but the half-a-dozen medium-scale industries functioning now have been able to employ barely 100 people. Successive governments have spoken of reviving defunct old factories, including cement and tile across the Northern Province, that is home to about 10 lakh people, but are yet to show just how they would.

Further, the industries have to be re-oriented towards production for local consumption, not merely for exports, notes Ahilan Kadirgamar, a political economist at the University of Jaffna. Post-war, the thrust has been either on large-scale development, including World Bank or Asian Development Bank-aided projects for millions of dollars, or export-oriented production that is yet to kick-off. “Neither addresses the very specific needs of the people of this Province. We need development that appreciates the strengths and challenges of our rural economy, we need jobs to generate incomes here, and a market locally and nationally to sell what is produced here,” he says.

However, industries, small or big, cannot simply be resurrected in a war-battered economy unless there is a conducive environment. That is perhaps why many are pinning their hopes on the Palaly airport, redeveloped last year, and the Kankesanthurai harbour that the new government has promised to develop. At present, army-run hotels dot the coast here, with no other commercial activity in sight.

The Government of India is involved in both projects. It offered an LKR 300 million (about ₹12 crore) grant to upgrade airport facilities, and also approved a $45.27 million Line of Credit to redevelop the harbour that could attract investment, in addition to improving logistics and connectivity.

Potential investors and officials in Jaffna say once operational, the harbour will ease import of raw materials. Locals see the opening of the airport as crucial, especially after India’s Alliance Air in October launched direct flights connecting Jaffna and Chennai thrice a week. However, high costs and a limited baggage allowance of 14 kg has set limits to business opportunities in the sector. The promise of this “regional airport” depends on the government further upgrading its facilities.

“That is our main focus — improving connectivity through the airport and the port,” says P.S.M. Charles, Governor of the Northern Province, concurring with the popular demand. As a representative of the President at the provincial level, the Governor holds considerable administrative powers, particularly in overseeing Central government-backed projects. “We have ancient temples, beautiful beaches and places of historic significance in this Province. There’s great potential for both industry and tourism. We welcome Indian pilgrims and tourists. We are also keen to have Indian investors,” she told The Hindu at her bungalow.

The projects would need at least a few years to become fully operational, and much longer to help create the “hub”. It’s not just time, but also human resources that are crucial.

“So many of our people left the country during the war. Today, human resource is also a challenge. But we have to somehow overcome this. If Japan and Germany could re-emerge so strong after their wars, why aren’t we able to,” asks Kandasamy Suseendran, a retired banker from Jaffna.

Meanwhile, those facing the brunt of the post-war impact are desperate to move ahead. This is especially true of the generation that witnessed the war all through, and those who had nowhere else to go. “There isn’t a job I haven’t done to survive,” says M. Arunthavamalar in Mullaitivu, who works in small farms.

“Everyone seems to want to promote individual entrepreneurship, like sewing or livestock farming, and not collective work. We are all left to our own devices and there’s no way we can scale up our business. See the interior roads here, they’re rickety and quite unmotorable. How do we reach the market,” asks the 57-year-old leader of a women’s co-operative society.

As a single mother, Arunthavamalar has had to brave displacement to other districts for years and raise her daughter with her income. The end of the war brought little relief to her. “If I had this hand, I could do a lot more work,” she says looking at her left arm. It is amputated till over her elbow, following a grievous injury in a bomb shelling in Mullivaikkal where scores of people moved in May 2009, after the army declared it a safe zone. That is also where tens of thousands of civilian deaths were reported.

For her, development is not insulated from the trauma of the war, or a decade’s fatigue since. At some level, the challenging life she leads today is a stark reflection of the failed promise of post-war recovery. “A lot of time has gone by. From the outside it might seem somewhat normal now. But if you ask me if there is peace, I can’t say yes.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/18a5ia/article30945173.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Gurunagar-fishingJaffna,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/yet-another-chance-at-post-war-recovery/article30945177.ece
40,2020/02/29,"Facebook, Twitter, Google threaten to suspend services in Pakistan","In a letter to Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan earlier this month, the Asia Internet Coalition (AIC) called on his government to revise the new sets of rules and regulations for social media, The News International reported

A coalition comprising digital media giants Facebook, Google and Twitter (among others) have spoken out against the new regulations approved by the Pakistani government for social media, threatening to suspend services in the country if the rules were not revised, it was reported.

In a letter to Prime Minster Imran Khan earlier this month, the Asia Internet Coalition (AIC) called on his government to revise the new sets of rules and regulations for social media, The News International reported on Friday.

“The rules as currently written would make it extremely difficult for AIC members to make their services available to Pakistani users and businesses,” reads the letter, referring to the Citizens Protection Rules (Against Online Harm).

The new set of regulations makes it compulsory for social media companies to open offices in Islamabad, build data servers to store information and take down content upon identification by authorities.

Failure to comply with the authorities in Pakistan will result in heavy fines and possible termination of services.

It said that the regulations were causing “international companies to re-evaluate their view of the regulatory environment in Pakistan, and their willingness to operate in the country.”

Referring to the rules as “vague and arbitrary in nature”, the AIC said that it was forcing them to go against established norms of user privacy and freedom of expression.

“We are not against regulation of social media, and we acknowledge that Pakistan already has an extensive legislative framework governing online content. However, these rules fail to address crucial issues such as internationally recognised rights to individual expression and privacy,” The News International quoted the letter as saying.

According to the law, authorities will be able to take action against Pakistanis found guilty of targeting state institutions at home and abroad on social media.

The law will also help the law enforcement authorities obtain access to data of accounts found involved in suspicious activities.

It would be the said authority’s prerogative to identify objectionable content to the social media platforms to be taken down.

In case of failure to comply within 15 days, it would have the power to suspend their services or impose a fine worth up to 500 million Pakistani rupees ($3 million).",internet,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/qx8juf/article30949045.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29NETTECHGIANTS,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/facebook-twitter-google-threaten-to-suspend-services-in-pakistan/article30949046.ece
41,2020/02/29,"CoronaCoin: crypto developers seize on coronavirus for new, morbid token","The supply of ‘CoronaCoin’ will diminish every two days based on the rate of new cases, according to its website, suggesting its price could move higher the more people the virus kills

Cryptocurrency developers have created a digital coin that allows traders to bet on the coronavirus epidemic, based on how many people fall ill or die.

Called the ‘CoronaCoin’, its supply will diminish every two days based on the rate of new cases, according to its website, suggesting its price could move higher the more people the virus kills.

The coronavirus epidemic is becoming global, with six new countries reporting their first cases on Friday and the World Health Organisation raising its global spread and impact alert to “very high.”

Latest WHO figures indicate that more than 82,000 people have been infected, with more than 2,700 deaths in China and 57 deaths in 46 other countries.

The rapid spread of the virus, which emerged in China in December, has stoked a frenzied sell-off in global markets, with the three major U.S. stock indexes on track for their worst week since the 2008 financial crisis.

Total supply for the CoronaCoin is based on the world population, and tokens will be burnt once every 48 hours based on the number of those that have been infected or have died, according to its website.

“Some people speculate a large portion of the supply will be burned due to the spread of the virus, so they invest,” Sunny Kemp, a user who identified himself as one of the developers, said in a chat on messaging app Telegram.

Kemp said the team comprised seven developers, with more coming on board. He declined to identify others, but said they were located mostly in Europe.

Cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin, are digital currencies that rely on advanced cryptography to validate their transactions. The nascent asset class has been plagued by frequent price crashes and scams.

Transactions are recorded through a digital ledger called blockchain. The CoronaCoin blockchain documents the spread of the virus and the token can be bought and sold on some online exchanges, such as Saturn.Network, according to Kemp.

Around 20% of supply of supply will be allocated for donation monthly to the Red Cross using a well-known cryptocurrency payments processor, Kemp said.

Some users of social media platform Reddit criticised the token.

“Frankly, this is amoral,” said one.

“Tasteless,” commented another.

“This is why we cant have nice things,” wrote a third.

Asked whether the token could be seen as morbid, Kemp said: “There are currently active pandemic bonds issued by the WHO. How is that different?”",internet,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/e0ok6z/article30949042.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29NETCORONA,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/coronacoin-crypto-developers-seize-on-coronavirus-for-new-morbid-token/article30949043.ece

Facebook Messenger has ditched chat bots and removed Discover tab as part of a larger redesign process to remain simple and catch more eyeballs.

The changes will appear next week, reports TechCrunch, in a move to focus on speed and simplicity.

“The changes are part of a larger Messenger redesign that reorients the People tab around Stories as Facebook continues to try to dominate the ephemeral social media format it copied from Snapchat,” said the report.

Under Stan Chudnovsky, the app has been streamlined as a functional messaging app.

In the new design, Facebook is promoting a ‘People’ section where you can see large squares dedicated to friends who have recently updated their Facebook Stories.

One can also see contact list organised to promote most used contacts who are actively online.

Instant Games and Transportation will also be removed from the chat composer’s utility tray and moved inside the app so you will need to search for those.

Not just the main app, the company is also tweaking Messenger Kids.

In a bid to give parents more control over what their kids do on Facebook Messenger Kids, the company earlier this month added new privacy features on Parent Dashboard in the app.

Parents will now be able to see more details about who their children are messaging with, whether they’re video calling them, and a history of anyone they’ve blocked in the app.

43,2020/02/29,"Hackers can use ultrasonic waves to activate Siri, Google","Researchers have previously shown that ultrasonic waves can be used to deliver a single command through the air. However, the new research from Washington University in St. Louis expands the scope of vulnerability that ultrasonic waves pose to cellphone security

Ultrasonic waves do not make a sound, but they can still activate Siri on your cellphone and have it make calls, take images or read the contents of a text to a stranger — without the phone owner’s knowledge, suggests a new research.

Researchers have previously shown that ultrasonic waves can be used to deliver a single command through the air. However, the new research from Washington University in St. Louis expands the scope of vulnerability that ultrasonic waves pose to cellphone security.

These waves, the researchers found, can propagate through many solid surfaces to activate voice recognition systems and — with the addition of some cheap hardware — the person initiating the attack can also hear the phone’s response.

The results were presented at the Network and Distributed System Security Symposium in San Diego.

“We want to raise awareness of such a threat,” said Ning Zhang, Assistant Professor of at the McKelvey School of Engineering. “I want everybody in the public to know this.”

Zhang and his co-authors were able to send “voice” commands to cellphones as they sat inconspicuously on a table, next to the owner.

With the addition of a stealthily placed microphone, the researchers were able to communicate back and forth with the phone, ultimately controlling it from afar.

Ultrasonic waves are sound waves in a frequency that is higher than humans can hear. Cellphone microphones, however, can and do record these higher frequencies.

“If you know how to play with the signals, you can get the phone such that when it interprets the incoming sound waves, it will think that you are saying a command,” Zhang said.

To test the ability of ultrasonic waves to transmit these “commands” through solid surfaces, the research team set up a host of experiments that included a phone on a table.

Attached to the bottom of the table was a microphone and a piezoelectric transducer (PZT), which is used to convert electricity into ultrasonic waves.

On the other side of the table from the phone, ostensibly hidden from the phone’s user, is a wave form generator to generate the correct signals.

The team ran two tests, one to retrieve an SMS (text) passcode and another to make a fraudulent call.

The first test relied on the common virtual assistant command ‘read my messages’ and on the use of two-factor authentication, in which a passcode is sent to a user’s phone — from a bank, for instance — to verify the user’s identity.

The attacker first told the virtual assistant to turn the volume down to Level 3. At this volume, the victim did not notice their phone’s responses in an office setting with a moderate noise level.

Then, when a simulated message from a bank arrived, the attack device sent the ‘read my messages’ command to the phone. The response was audible to the microphone under the table, but not to the victim.

In the second test, the attack device sent the message ‘call Sam with speakerphone,’ initiating a call. Using the microphone under the table, the attacker was able to carry on a conversation with ‘Sam.’

The team tested 17 different phone models, including popular iPhones, Galaxy and Moto models. All but two were vulnerable to ultrasonic wave attacks.

Ultrasonic waves made it through metal, glass and wood

Zhang said there was a simple way to keep a phone out of harm’s way of ultrasonic waves: the interlayer-based defence, which uses a soft, woven fabric to increase the “impedance mismatch.”

In other words, put the phone on a tablecloth.",internet,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/6hur2a/article30949016.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29NETHACKER,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/hackers-can-use-ultrasonic-waves-to-activate-siri-google/article30949017.ece
44,2020/02/29,Queer Azaadi Mumbai 2020: For whose pride?,"The ways in which religious extremism, caste discrimination and body shaming have infiltrated queer spaces

Is a queer pride march a protest or a celebration? I have lost track of the number of times I have seen this question being hotly debated online, especially after February 1, when the solidarity gathering that happened in lieu of a pride march widened the ideological rifts within the queer community. A collective space meant for queer people to find strength in each other became unsafe, toxic and exclusionary for some. The organising committee of Queer Azaadi Mumbai issued an official statement, distancing itself from queer protesters who raised slogans against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens.

It began to appear that there were broadly two camps — those for whom queer identity is only about celebrating non-normative expressions of gender and sexuality, and those for whom queer identity encapsulates a de facto kinship with all marginalised people.

My affinity lay with the latter even though I dislike ideological ghettos. My spiritual practice, which draws encouragement from Tibetan Buddhism, reminds me that my job in this world is to empathise with the suffering of all sentient beings and do what I can to lessen it. What made me sad was the fact that a section of the community had turned against its own people to become cheerleaders for a political establishment that seeks to link citizenship and religion.

Deadnaming

Many of the protesters, including students, had sedition charges slapped against them. I was aghast to see prominent gay men from the community actively participate in endangering a young trans person whose political beliefs they were opposed to. Being pushed out of the closet without one’s consent is a painful experience, and trans people are usually more vulnerable than gay men — especially the ones who occupy the higher echelons of the caste hierarchy — because of the gender dysphoria they experience. Many of them choose to go by names that are different from the ones assigned by the families they were born into. Being addressed by a name they have rejected is often called deadnaming, and is understood as an act of violence.

I feel disturbed to see gay men who are oppressed by patriarchy resorting to the same old patriarchal tactics of shutting people down, shaming individuals who think differently, calling them names and throwing them under the bus, in order to claim power. Our critical analysis of structural violence has not empowered us with the inner resources needed to engage compassionately. We have to challenge the transphobia that is rampant even within the queer community.

What we need now is to reflect, and create spaces for dialogue, so that diverse voices can be heard and common ground can be found. Lashing out at one another will cause further harm and only feed into the agenda of a state that would like to divide and rule. Gathering the courage to hear those we love to hate might bring us rewards far greater than legal victories.

Why shut up?

This is, of course, easier said than done. My review of Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan brought me a stream of angry messages from savarna gay men in private Facebook groups who hated my guts for raising questions about the ableism, misogyny and caste violence in that Bollywood film. I was told to shut up and be grateful about queer representation instead of overanalysing a comedy that was meant to be taken lightly. Why does our laughter need to find release at someone else’s expense?

It is worth remembering that queer was not always a term of self-identification; it was a slur meant to pathologise and isolate people who did not conform to traditional expectations. When queerness is being reclaimed as a source of pride, we need to examine who is being left out this time around.

What are the ways in which religious extremism, caste discrimination and body shaming have infiltrated queer spaces?

Who is, who isn’t

We will have to resist totalitarian narratives that determine who is allowed to call themselves queer, and who is not. Else, we will slip into another kind of normativity that is defined by theoretical frameworks that have been adopted from American and European contexts as a result of our education, activist work, or participation in a neoliberal capitalist discourse. What will it take to actualise a society that truly believes love is love beyond social media hashtags?

In the last month, I have heard of at least two queer people who took their lives because the pain of living in a heteronormative society was too much to bear.

Apart from advocating for diversity and inclusion in hiring practices, we must urgently direct our attention to mental health issues within the community. If we are not going to show up for each other, hold each other, and talk about our differences from a place of love, who will?

45,2020/02/29,‘In the Field’: A podcast that takes you inside the social sector in loving detail,"The episodes traverse a range of vexing questions, from malnutrition to environmental justice to primary education to protest movements

By and large, ‘NGO work’ is seen by many as hopelessly idealistic and driven more by good intentions than strategy and planning. Those within the sector often struggle to explain what they do, and descriptions reduce nuanced processes of engagement and change to numbers and narrow outcome measures — reduction in school dropouts, increase in under-5 survival rates, an attitude tuck here, a behaviour nip there.

“Most stories about development don’t really deconstruct what is happening in the field, or link this with the larger contemporary debates in society,” says Radhika Vishwanathan, one of the hosts and originators of the podcast In the Field, a show that takes you inside and alongside the many parts of what is loosely termed the social sector. Vishwanathan and her partner-in-podcasting Samyuktha Varma launched the series in October 2017, hoping to feature the multiple voices and stakeholders in the development process and the ways in which this connects to the larger discourses around social, political and economic change.

Tales in detail

Each episode in the two-series-old show is (in their words) ‘lovingly crafted’ to move away from the tedious unidimensional narratives that submerge the complex, wonderfully detailed stories of individuals, communities, networks and systems that make change happen. The 15 episodes (plus a couple of bonus pieces) traverse a range of vexing questions, from malnutrition to environmental justice to primary education to the promises and perils of protest movements. It’s hard to fit an episode into a neat thematic label; that is, after all, the nature of the beast. Nutrition is connected to education is connected to livelihoods is connected to caste is connected to gender. It is in their refusal to shy away from complexity that Vishwanathan and Varma find their métier.

Take Episode 2 in the second series, for instance, about ‘worklife’. You are caught in one of Bengaluru’s famed gridlocks listening to a familiar conversation about traffic and the frustrations of the daily commute: “one of the greatest points of tension in a worker’s life,” says Varma.

A hopeful space

She then expertly steers your attention beyond the blaring horns to the work of a transport economist from Bangladesh and the idea of the commute “as a commodity,” explicating, in some detail, the relationship between mobility, congestion and urbanisation, and the ways in which spending on public transport (or the lack of it) further disadvantages the poor. We then enter a hopeful space as we listen to the members of a feisty civil society group that is advocating for more sustainable transport systems in Bengaluru. Varma then flies us across to Sakinaka in Mumbai where we are introduced to the work of Aajeevika, an NGO that works on the messy issues concerning labour and migration. In the space of an hour, we begin to understand how urban planning, public transport, livelihoods, all undergird our worklife — whether you are a Bhojpuri-speaking construction worker in Mumbai or an IT worker in Bengaluru.

Both Vishwanathan and Varma have worked in the development sector, and their impetus for the show was the recognition that outside the sector, there was very little understanding of what went on inside it, how the wheels moved and what form roadblocks took, and how even small victories were shaped. “While we were mainly addressing the sector, we were pleasantly surprised to find that others — for instance family — reacted very positively,” says Varma.

The success of the show, which is supported by Rohini Nilekani Philanthropies, has encouraged them to explore other themes, under the umbrella of their new podcasting company, Vaaka (spoken word, in Malayalam/Tamil). One of these to watch out for is City of Women on how women in Bengaluru navigate the city.

46,2020/02/29,Goren Bridge by Bob Jones,"East-West vulnerable, South deals

North’s jump to four spades showed a terrible hand with a spade fit and 0-3 high-card points. South didn’t need much to have an adequate play for slam, so he carried on anyway.

South won the opening heart lead with his ace and took a moment to plan the play. Dummy didn’t have much, as advertised, but the doubleton diamond and the nine-eight of trumps provided hope. One line of play was to cash the ace of clubs and then lead the queen of clubs. Should the opponents hold up the king, South would revert to diamonds and play to ruff two diamonds with dummy’s high trumps. If an opponent took his king, there were enough clubs in dummy to discard three of declarer’s diamonds. This would need a trump split of no worse than 3-1. It was possible that the opponent who won the king of clubs could play another club for his partner to ruff. South could ruff high, of course, but there would no longer be enough clubs in dummy to discard three diamonds. The diamond finesse would then be needed.

South found an elegant improvement on this line. At trick two, South led the queen of clubs! West could win with his king but could do no damage to the contract. Should West duck his king, South would play to ruff two diamonds. This line needed clubs no worse than 4-2 and spades no worse than 3-1. No finesse would ever be needed.

47,2020/02/29,My exclusive tête-à-tête with Trump-ji,"We met in a garden not far from Agra’s beautiful Shiv temple, Tejo Mahalaya. As a demure FLOTUS served goat’s milk and broccoli samosa to POTUS, I began my interview

Regular readers of this column would know that I hate crowds. That’s one big reason I don’t do press conferences. Another reason is that our PM doesn’t do them either. A third reason is that I don’t like spending time and energy to land up at a place and sit through an hour of nonsense statements just to be able to ask one question, that too if you get lucky. The ROI is just not worth it.

So when POTUS, FLOTUS and OCTOPUS came to India, I made it very clear to American officials that I wouldn’t be attending any press conference. They had no choice but to organise an exclusive tête-à-tête between President Trump and yours truly. We met in a garden not far from Agra’s beautiful Shiv temple, Tejo Mahalaya. As a demure FLOTUS served goat’s milk and broccoli samosa to POTUS, I began my interview. Some excerpts:

Me: Shri Trump-ji, Namaste.

POTUS: No-Moose-Tray to you too, buddy!

Me: Sir, since this is your first official visit to India, can you please lavish some praise on us? We Indians, and especially our politicians, still suffer from a post-colonial inferiority complex. We need to have our puny self-esteem boosted by the validation of the world’s most powerful white man. Say some nice things?

POTUS: Sure. But what’s the deal?

Me: I give you my word that, in exchange for your passionate endorsement of India and Indians and the father (and son) of India, India will buy $3 billion worth of weapons from American companies.

(POTUS and I shake hands on the deal.)

POTUS: India is unbelievable. India has incredible energy. Wall to wall people. Never seen anything like it. India has given me the greatest welcome given by any country to any leader of any country anywhere in the world at any time. Unbelievable. Millions came to cheer me in Goo-rat’s capital city, I’m-a-Bad. Seven million people gave me a standing ovation at Motorola stadium. Incredible!

Me: Sir, it’s not difficult to gather a crowd in India.

POTUS: I know a lot of people live in India. But it’s fantastic that all of them came out to show their respect to me. All credit to the chee-wala who became Prime Minister, a great man, a true friend of mine.

Me: How do you know he is a true friend of yours?

POTUS: He built a wall, didn’t he? Anyone who builds me a wall is a true friend of mine.

Me: Mr. President, you love deals. What happened to the trade deal you were supposed to sign with your true friend during this trip?

POTUS: India has the highest tariffs in the world. You have tremendous tariffs on Harley Davidson, a fantastic bike that doesn’t deserve any tariffs. You know, every Indian should be able to own a Harley Davidson. They’d love it. I would love to see thousands of Harley Davidsons on Indian roads. India has a lot of people. More than a billion, I’m told. Imagine all of them on Harleys. That would be incredible India.

Me: Shri POTUS-ji, some U.S. organisations have raised concerns about the CAA and how it will affect religious freedom in India. Did you bring it up with our PM?

POTUS: I assure you, Mr. Modi wants the people of India to have religious freedom. India’s future is bright under his fantastic leadership, brighter than even China’s. I spoke to Xi the other day, and he told me he’s having a tough time with the coronavirus. America is doing a great job on the coronavirus. We have a lock-down in place, and I am sure the Russians are supporting Bernie.

But let me tell you this: Europe will have to pay more for NATO. They gotta pay. Merkel is a great lady. I don’t like her much but she’s better than Greta Thunberg. But Modi is the best. Swami Viveka-Moon-Moon-Sen would be proud of him.

Me: Mr. President, one question is uppermost in the mind of every Indian journalist. In fact, this is the only question that any Indian journalist would like to ask you, no matter how many times it’s been asked before, and how many times you’ve given the same non-answer. Please tell us, what are you going to do to stop Pakistan from sponsoring cross-border terrorism against India?

POTUS: I have great relations with Mr. Khan, the President of Pakistan. He is a fantastic guy. I spoke to Mr. Khan. He has promised me he is as serious about ending terrorism as Mr. Modi is about ensuring religious freedom in India. I am telling you, they are both great guys. Both good friends of mine. I am not saying I want to mediate. But I am there, you know, because I’m incredible that way. I am always available for incredible leaders.

48,2020/02/29,The sad tale of a broccoli samosa prepared for Donald Trump,"Hath not a samosa dimensions, senses, affections, passions?

It was not supposed to end this way. I was destined for greater things.

I am but a humble button samosa, a corn and broccoli button samosa to be precise. But I was meant to play a small but key role in building ties between India and America, the two great democracies of the world.

Donald Trump was visiting Ahmedabad. He had “hi-tea” there. A menu had been drawn up by Fortune Landmark chef Suresh Khanna with cookies and tea and coconut juice in tetra packs. Representing Gujarati cuisine was the spongy khaman dhokla.

And then there was me, hands down the most exciting thing on the menu. Something new yet traditional. A samosa with broccoli and corn in it. Broccoli would be something POTUS would recognise even if the samosa looked forbiddingly “foreign”. Americans love broccoli, with the late President George H.W. Bush being a notable exception. I was excited about what Donald Trump might say as he bit into an exotic samosa and encountered the familiar taste of broccoli and corn.

But the tukde tukde gang tore me apart before I could serve my nation. Bengalis who cannot stop talking about the delights of a cauliflower singhara during winter turned up their noses at a broccoli samosa. And these are the people who mash up beetroot with aloo and shape it into croquettes, deep fry them, call them vegetable chops and serve them to guests. They have the audacity to call broccoli samosas a sacrilege.

Someone called me a fake samosa. Someone created a hashtag #samosaruinedforever. Someone even said “I doubt this unappetising menu will prompt anyone into giving any kind of deal to India. #broccolisamosa.”

Soul of a samosa

Broccoli or not, I am a samosa. Hath not a samosa dimensions, senses, affections, passions? Fed with the same chutneys, subjecting all to the same indigestion, warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as an aloo samosa? If you prick us do we not break?

Even those people who blockade roads in the name of minorities who they say were wronged by the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, mock us, the poor broccoli-corn button samosas. Are we not a minority too lost amidst the aloos? Are our rights not worth defending? Why are they demanding that we prove we belong in the great diverse family of the Indian samosa, which has accepted gobi samosas and keema samosas and packets of ready-made cocktail samosas but somehow questions our legitimacy.

Go check out broccoli samosa recipes online (they exist) but hum bhi kaagaz nahin dikhayenge to prove our samosa roots.

From my lonely spot on the hi-tea table I have watched this historic visit unfold. I have seen how India rolled out the red carpet for the POTUS. Nothing was too good for him. The Yamuna has been given an IV injection of gangajal to make it look fresher, adding a new meaning to Ganga-Yamuna tehzeeb. The tombs of Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal got their first claypack deep cleanse in 368 years. Twenty-five thousand flower pots were placed along the presidential route. Langurs were pressed into service to scare away ordinary monkeys. Entire walls were built because Donald Trump loves walls.

And one humble button samosa got stuck in your collective gullet? Isn’t that kind of petty?

A sad fate

Forgive me if I sound bitter but what did you get for all that hoopla? A trade deal? The President mangled the name of your most famous cricketer. He forgot to mention Mahatma Gandhi in the visitors’ book at Gandhi’s ashram. Oh, yes, he did give the gays a boost by tweeting “Great” about that new rom-com Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan.

If he had been given the chance perhaps he would have tweeted “Great” about me too. Or called me “cute as a button (samosa)”. He could have praised it as an example of Indian innovation and vitality, a Bharat-Amreeki tehzeeb, proof of a country that could balance modernity with tradition yet be proudly and wholly Made in India.

But that was not to be because you could not see beyond the aloo. How is India supposed to chart new frontiers if we cannot learn to reinvent ourselves? The samosa could have been a good place to start. In hot sultry weather, a broccoli samosa could have been the perfect antidote to the heaviness of aloo. I could have been the Trump-approved cocktail canapé for the new India. I could have made history on a “historic” visit.

Instead mocked, dissed, bullied, I ended up unloved and untouched. The Trumps ate nothing while Twitter trolls chortled with glee at my tragic fate. Journalist Barkha Dutt tweeted, “Nobody had the broccoli samosa.” That was pretty much the epitaph that summed up the short and unhappy life of a broccoli-corn button samosa.

As Trump would say, “Sad”.

49,2020/02/29,Why Hyderabad’s Yemeni descendants worry about proving their citizenship,"Tucked away in tech city is the neighbourhood of Barkas, where descendants of Yemeni tribes have lived since the 17th century

Through the arterial thoroughfares of Hyderabad’s Old City, past the imposing Charminar and the Falaknuma Palace (now a Taj Hotel) atop a hillock, I reach Chandrayangutta. Nestled here, south of River Musi, is the Barkas neighbourhood. This is where descendants of Yemeni tribes have lived for over three centuries. It was in the late 17th century that Lahmadi Yemeni tribesmen, among many others, migrated to the subcontinent, mostly to join the Hyderabad State’s armed forces. They eventually made the city their permanent home. When India became independent, the Yemenis also became citizens.

Today, Ali bin Saleh Lahmadi, a businessman and a descendant of the Lahmadi Yemenis, is among those worrying about his citizenship, like so many others. For the last three Fridays, after the jumma namaz, the people of Barkas have been congregating on the sprawling grounds here to protest the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. For the last fortnight, they have also organised a symbolic ‘lights off’ protest. “From 7 p.m. to 7.15 p.m., shops turn off all lights. It is a protest against the siyaah (black) law,” says Lahmadi.

“I was born here, my parents were born here, my grandparents were born here. My forefathers came here from Yemen and worked as soldiers in the Nizam’s army. It is absurd to be told now that we might have to show documents or be asked where our parents were born,” says Lahamadi.

From the barracks

Barkas is a corruption of the word ‘barracks’. Yemeni soldiers first enlisted in the Asaf Jahi dynasty’s structured armed forces, the Nazm-e-Jamiyat, and in the irregular forces, the Afwaj-e-Beqaidah. The area was named after the barracks in which they were housed. The late Omar Khalidi, a famous Hyderabadi historian, notes that the Nizam’s Diwan or Prime Minister, Salar Jung, established a special court for Arabs — the Qazaat-e-Uroob. He also records that these soldiers were called chaush, the Turkish equivalent of a palace guard. This word, at times, is used in a pejorative sense as well. Today, the number of Yemenis here number between 50,000 to a lakh, and represent 100-150 tribes.

It is early in the morning. Boys and girls in school uniforms are riding pillion on bikes as their fathers drive them to school. At a tea stall on the pavement, a group of men sit around on stools, cigarettes pressed between their fingers, sipping tea. The tea of choice here is Sulaimani chai, an inalienable part of Yemeni culture: golden, sans milk, with mint leaves and a gentle squeeze of lemon. “Assalaamualaikum! Atashribu shai? (Peace be with you! Want some tea?)” Mohammed bin Saalam, the tea-seller, asks teasingly in Arabic, waving at an acquaintance who is rushing past. At the shop, the customers solemnly discuss the new developments: the frequent protests the city has witnessed over the past months.

The men zipping by on motorcycles wear the ghatra, the traditional headgear worn in the Arabian Peninsula, wrapped around their head, its ends flapping on their backs and their lungis slapping against bare shins. The footwear most favoured is the arba chappal, sandals with a thick sole and two horizontal straps, usually adorned with a golden or silver buckle.

Some 45 years ago, the people of Barkas were primarily agriculturalists. But with Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries striking oil, employment opportunities poured into Hyderabad. Much like the Dakhnis, the Barkas men too grabbed these jobs.

“Most of us had lost contact with our relatives in Yemen. Finding work in GCC countries not only helped us get back on our feet, it gave our community better access to education. We reconnected with family. Members of the Yemeni diaspora live in Saudi Arabia, UAE and other countries. We traced them through our tribe names. The internet played its part — we found many relatives online,” says Saleh Ahmad bin Abdat, an office-bearer of Jamiatul Yemeniyya bil Hind, an association of Yemenis in India. As he introduces himself, the aspirated ‘h’ in Saleh and Ahmad is hard to miss.

Empowering daughters

With money pouring in, and the focus moving towards education, many more girls began going to school and college, says Ayesha Bahameid, who is both a graduate from a regular college and an aalimah, a woman who has received traditional madrassa education. “My sister is a doctor. The community has realised that women should be educated and has made rapid strides in this regard,” she says.

The Yemenis are now a powerful political bloc. Unlike the descendants of another migrant community, the Habashis, for instance, who were enlisted in the Nizam’s African Cavalry Guards, the Yemenis have thrived politically. The community continues to be represented in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC). Fahad bin Samad Abdat, now in his 20s, is one of the youngest corporators; Ahmed bin Abdullah Balala is an MLA in the Telangana State Legislative Assembly. Ausaf Sayeed, a Hyderabadi-Yemeni, is the present Indian Ambassador to Saudi Arabia.

While jobs in the Gulf have immensely improved the fortunes of many Hyderabadis from the 70s on, it gave the Yemeni groups another opportunity: the business of food. By the late 2000s, Arabian cuisine had become an integral part of Hyderabad’s culinary culture. Mandi is a dish of rice and meat (beef, mutton, chicken, fish, quail) garnished generously with raisins, cashews and almonds. Such is its popularity today that mandi finds a place on the traditional dastarkhwan alongside Hyderabadi biryani. Techies in Hyderabad, students, families, visitors — everyone throngs to mandi restaurants in Barkas and Errakunta, which is its geographical extension. Customers sit cross-legged at low tables as waiters bring in massive thaalas or plates. Everyone eats from a single plate.

Old world and new

The first mandi restaurant opened in 1997, a small eatery that only locals frequented. Then another one opened in 2004. “But the real change came around 2010, when the Matam al Arabi restaurant opened. That is when everything changed and the people of Barkas realised we could do well in the Arabian cuisine business,” says Khalid ‘Jameel’ al Barzikh, who runs the Qasr al Mandi restaurant. “Here, we use the original recipe. The rice and meat are cooked together in a special pit. You can say that the mandi is buried, so the cooking technique is known as madfoon, meaning ‘to bury’,” he says. Qasr al Mandi is located on the Srisailam Highway that connects Barkas to the famous temple town of Srisailam on the Telangana and Andhra Pradesh border.

Thanks to the demand from foodies willing to travel miles for a feast, some 30 mandi restaurants have sprung up along this 5-km stretch alone. Indeed, the stamp of Arabian culture, of the Yemeni community and their cuisine, is no longer confined to the Old City. Mandi restaurants have mushroomed in newer parts of town too: there are two in uptown Jubilee Hills Road Number 36, popularly known as ‘36’ among the IT crowd and another in HiTec City.

A stone’s throw from the Barkas Library is Hadrami Harees, which has been in business for over half a century. Harees is a forerunner to the Hyderabadi haleem, a dish that combines pounded meat and wheat. Two men with chiselled features and deep-set eyes walk into the restaurant. “Do mitthi diyo, bhai (two sweet ones, brother),” they say in Dakhni, an idiom known for its propensity to contract words. Promptly, Qaiser Haftoor, sitting cross-legged in his lungi straddling the harees kiln, scalps the cauldron and plops two large ladlefuls on a white, scalloped metal plate with blue rims. He then does something unexpected. He mixes two spoonfuls of sugar in the harees and stirs until the crystals dissolve. “Mitthi harees is very popular. People come from all over the city for it. Of course, we also serve khaari (salty) harees,” says Haftoor, whose father started the eatery 53 years ago.

It is now afternoon. The strains of azaan waft across from the Jama Masjid. The faithful heed the call and join the congregation. Prayers here are like any performed in mosques elsewhere in the city, but if you look closely, you will notice that some hand gestures are different. “In most parts of Hyderabad, and indeed India, the Hanafi school of Islamic jurisprudence is practised. In Barkas, and especially among the Arabs, the Shafai’i school is predominant,” says Farooq Arifi, who comes from a family of hereditary qazis and is a senior employee at the Telangana State Waqf Board.

The area has been home to both the traditional and modern, says Raheem Bawazir, a media professional and Barkas resident. The community has produced doctors (and built the Bakoban Hospital), lawyers, educationalists, politicians, and IT professionals, but it continues to be as steeped in tradition as always. Case in point: the daily fruit harraaj or auction. Abdul Aziz Misri is in his late 60s. Every morning near the Barkas ground parking lot, he presides over the harraaj of mulberry, guava and figs. Pushcart vendors gather around him and place their bids. The highest bidder takes the whole lot. “The harraaj is around 90 years old. No matter what happens, some things here will remain the same. Ninety years ago, fruits grew on trees in home orchards here; in 2020, the yield has decreased, but the fruits still come from homes,” he says.",society,https://www.thehindu.com/society/8kfg8m/article30949521.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01SM1BARKAS9,https://www.thehindu.com/society/why-hyderabads-yemeni-descendants-worry-about-proving-their-citizenship/article30949526.ece

52,2020/02/29,‘India among most dollarised countries in terms of invoicing’,"U.S. seen as insurer on external dollar liabilities’ value

India is among the most dollarised countries as far as invoicing is concerned, and by all these measures of internationalisation, the dollar is largely ahead of other currencies with euro as a distant second, Professor Hélène Rey, Lord Bagri Professor of Economics, London Business School, said.

Ms. Rey was speaking at the Export-Import (EXIM) Bank of India’s 35th Commencement Day Annual Lecture in Mumbai on ‘financial globalisation and international financial markets’.

“While international reserves are held in dollars, dollar is a vehicle currency on the foreign exchange market.

“One can also see the U.S. as an insurer, since the value of its external dollar liabilities such as Treasury bills and U.S. government bonds held by the rest of the world tend to appreciate in bad times, thereby insuring the people holding them,” she said.

As a result, the U.S. gets seigniorage as people from different countries use dollars, she said, adding that India was one of the most dollarised countries in the world, following Brazil, Pakistan and Indonesia, in the share of imports and exports invoiced in dollars.

Ms. Rey said that according to a survey by the European Central Bank, the dollar dominated 62.2% international debt, 56.3% international loan and 62.7% global exchange reserves, whereas the euro had acquired much less global market.

“The dollar is becoming more unstable over time as the relative size of the U.S. shrinks in the world economy while the stock of dollar liabilities in the rest of the world keep growing,” she added.

“Euro maybe the closest substitute to dollar, as the euro area is comparable to the U.S. in terms of economic size and in international trade, but the incomplete architecture of the of the euro area with 19 finance ministries backing the currency, and the absence of a euro area wide safe assets inhibits the internationalisation of the euro,” she said, adding that the cryptocurrency and the private or public digital currency were alternate options, but would not play an important role in the international monetary system.

“People are not clear about where would they make the payments through the cryptocurrency. Private digital currency has a threat of cybersecurity whereas the legal framework here also remains unclear. Therefore, there is no alternative to the dollar which can be seen for other couple of decades,” she added.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/india-among-most-dollarised-countries-in-terms-of-invoicing/article30952568.ece

55,2020/02/29,Foreigners’ passport not must for citizenship: HC,"‘Applicant should cite reasons in detail’

The Calcutta High Court has ruled that foreigners could apply for Indian citizenship even without a valid passport from the country of their origin, if they could furnish detailed reasons for the “non-furnishing of passports”.

Justice Sabyasachi Bhattacharyya said that despite the provision to apply online, a provision has to be made for persons who do not have all the particulars of their passports, which is read as optional, to file the applications manually, which are to be treated as valid applications under Rule 5 of the Citizenship Rules, 2009.

“... alternatively to amend the necessary software so that the online applications can be presented with or without passports — in the latter case, furnishing the detailed reasons as to the non-furnishing of passports,” the judge said.

The court said that after receiving such applications, and upon being satisfied about the reasons given by the applicants, in connection with the absence of passports and as to the correctness of the particulars of the applications, the Collector shall forward such applications to the State government.

“Upon a consideration under Rule 12(a) shall, if satisfied about the reasons for the absence of passport, forward the said application to the Central government, which will dispose of such application in accordance with law, giving due credence according to its own standards to the reason furnished by the petitioner for not being able to produce his passport,” said the court.

The court observed that an applicant has to submit an application on the ground of acquiring citizenship under Section 5(1)(c) of the Act mandatorily in Form III as given in the rules. The language of Rule 5(1) specifies that the application from a person cannot be entertained unless the application is made in Form III.

“A perusal of Form III shows that Clause 9 of the same requires the passport particulars of the applicant to be filled in and the documents to be attached with the application, includes a valid foreign passport,” noted the court.

The court also observed the rule “contemplates that an application shall not be entertained unless the application is made in Form III, such provision does not make the availability of a passport a mandatory requirement”.

The court granted liberty to the petitioner to file an application before the authority as contemplated in Rule 11 of the Citizenship Rules 2009, upon furnishing response on the non-availability of the passport.

Petitioner Bismillah Khan had moved the court saying that he was being denied the citizenship of India due to the online application process that makes a copy of the passport of the applicant a mandatory requirement.

Petitioner’s counsel Sharmistha Podder submitted he was a Pakhtoon and due to political turmoil in his native land and subsequent to its merger with Afghanistan and Pakistan, he migrated to India as a five-year-old along with his father in 1973.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/foreigners-passport-not-must-for-citizenship-hc/article30953028.ece

The petition was filed on Friday. The date of execution of their death sentence is March 3 at 6 a.m.

Gupta’s lawyer, advocate A.P. Singh, told the media that he was a juvenile at the time of the crime and was not present at the place of crime. He was at a park attending a musical show, he claimed. The petition said the court did not follow the principles of natural justice while confirming his death sentence.

Six youth were held for raising incendiary slogans at Rajiv Chowk Metro Station on Saturday afternoon. They were subsequently released, police said.

A video of a group shouting “Shoot the traitors” went viral on social media.

The police said that six boys were found raising the slogans, after which they were detained and interrogated. The boys were released later. “The boys detained were found to be students. They had no criminal antecedents and were released after due diligence,” said a senior police officer.

58,2020/02/29,U.S.-Taliban agreement | India hails peace deal in “contiguous neighbour”,"The agreement was announced in the backdrop of Harsh Vardhan Shringla’s conversations with the leadership of the government of Afghanistan.

India has welcomed the agreement between the U.S. and the Taliban sealed in Qatar on Saturday. Official spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs Raveesh Kumar said the government noted that the agreement had received the support of all sections of Afghanistan.

“We note that the entire political spectrum in Afghanistan including the government, the democratic polity and civil society has welcomed the opportunity and hope for peace and stability generated by these agreements,” he said.

The agreement was announced in the backdrop of Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla’s conversations with the leadership of the government of Afghanistan during a two-day trip to Kabul. It was Mr. Shringla’s first foreign trip after taking charge in late January. During his meetings with President Ashraf Ghani and other Afghan decision makers, he highlighted New Delhi’s commitment for “enhanced political, economic and development partnership” with Kabul.

The Indian leadership had taken up the U.S.-Taliban negotiations during the February 24-25 visit of U.S. President Donald Trump. Officials on Saturday said India would support all opportunities that can bring peace, security and stability in the country which witnessed continued civil war and foreign occupation since 1979 because of the Soviet and the post-9/11 U.S. actions.

Mr. Raveesh Kumar described Afghanistan as a “contiguous neighbour” as India considers Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) as part of its sovereign territory and assured Afghanistan that it would continue to receive support from India for “realising aspirations for a peaceful, democratic and prosperous future where the interest of all sections of Afghan society are protected”.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/9lauam/article30952508.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH01RAVEESHKUMAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-hails-peace-deal-in-contiguous-neighbour/article30952509.ece

According to the Delhi police, the speeches made by BJP leaders were not hate speeches, and the protests and dharnas by citizens are a threat to society,” he said, pointing to the cases filed against activists working under United Against Hate, including Harsh Mander. A case of attempt to murder has been filed against them.

“We urge the Supreme Court to take cognizance of all these cases. Let the Supreme Court appoint an amicus curiae to scrutinise all such cases wherein people are being framed and put in jails,” Mr. Sharma said. Any further delay, he said, would only add to the tension. “We have no expectations from the Centre or the Home Ministry or the Delhi Chief Minister [Arvind Kejriwal], but we have hopes from the courts,” he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/mfe0hm/article30952416.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AnandSharma,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/appoint-amicus-curiae-to-look-into-delhi-riot-cases-congress/article30952412.ece
60,2020/02/29,Kanhaiya will come out unscathed: CPI,"‘AAP govt. bowed to political pressure and granted permission to prosecute him’

A day after the Aam Aadmi Party government in Delhi sanctioned the prosecution of former JNU Students’ Union president Kanhaiya Kumar and nine others in a sedition case, the Communist Party of India (CPI) said that it would fight the case legally and politically.

In a statement, CPI general secretary D. Raja said the party was confident that Mr. Kumar, a member of its national executive, would come out unscathed as the charges were false and politically motivated. “It is unfortunate that the Arvind Kejriwal-led AAP government has succumbed to political pressure and granted permission to prosecute Kanhaiya. It may be recalled here that the Chief Minister himself has in the beginning said that there is no case of sedition against Kanhaiya and videos were doctored. We are yet to ascertain why this sudden change of heart has happened,” Mr. Raja said.

Senior Congress leader and former Home Minister P. Chidambaram joined the CPI in protest.

He said on Twitter that the Kejriwal government was “no less ill-informed than the Centre” in its understanding of the sedition law.

“Delhi Government is no less ill-informed than the central government in its understanding of sedition law. I strongly disapprove of the sanction granted to prosecute Mr. Kanhaiya Kumar and others for alleged offences under sections 124A and 120B of IPC,” the former Home Minister said.

The sanction was granted by the Delhi government on February 20, Mr. Chidambaram said. The Delhi police filed a chargesheet at a city court against Mr. Kumar and others last year, saying he was leading a procession and allegedly supported seditious slogans at an event in February 2016.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nizn4s/article30952207.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH01DRAJA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kanhaiya-will-come-out-unscathed-cpi/article30952208.ece
61,2020/02/29,SC Bench will deliver J&K ruling on March 2,"It has reserved verdict on two judgments about nature and extent of Article 370

A five-judge Constitution Bench, led by Justice N.V. Ramana, will on March 2 pronounce its order on a plea to refer to a larger Bench the petitions challenging the abrogation of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 of the Constitution.

The Bench had heard arguments and reserved its verdict on whether there was a “direct conflict” of opinion between two judgments — one of 1959 and the other of 1970 — about the nature and extent of Article 370.

The President’s notification of August 5 abrogated the special status by blunting Article 370, the source of the privileges accorded to the erstwhile State in accordance with the assurances made in the Instrument of Accession signed between the Jammu and Kashmir ruler and the Government of India.

However, the two judgments, both by five-judge Benches of the Supreme Court, had given contradictory views on Article 370. The 1959 one, Prem Nath Kaul versus State of Jammu and Kashmir, had indicated that Article 370 was applicable only till the Jammu and Kashmir Constitution was enacted on January 26, 1957. Thereafter, no further changes could be made to the relationship between India and Jammu and Kashmir.

But the judgment delivered in 1970, Sampath Prakash versus State of Jammu and Kashmir, ignored the 1959 verdict and concluded that Article 370 was permanent and a “perennial source of power” for the Centre to govern its relationship with Jammu and Kashmir.

Senior advocate Dinesh Dwivedi, seconded by senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan, had argued that Justice Ramana’s Bench was the third five-judge Bench examining a case concerning the use of Article 370. They had urged that the petitions be referred to a larger Bench.

The Constitution Bench had asked pertinent questions, including who was the “competent authority” to bring the extinct Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir back to life.

The Constituent Assembly had ceased to exist in January 1957, with the coming of the Jammu and Kashmir Constitution. Before it disbanded, the Constituent Assembly did not take a decision in favour of abrogation of Article 370.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/qk9993/article30318002.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SUPREMECOURT-NKV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-bench-will-deliver-jk-ruling-on-march-2/article30952178.ece

66,2020/02/29,BSF to rebuild burnt house of constable,"Mr. Anees’ house in Khajuri Khas extension was pelted with stones before being set on fire on February 25.

The Border Security Force (BSF) said it would rebuild the house of one of its constables that was burnt down by a mob earlier this week when a wave of communal riots hit the northeast part of Delhi.

Constable Mohammad Anees (29), posted in Malkangiri in Odisha, is to get married in May.

A Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) spokesperson said senior officers of the BSF spoke to the constable and a Deputy Inspector General (DIG) rank officer visited his family on Saturday.

BSF Director General V.K Johri said the constable had not informed his seniors about the incident and they got to know about the damage from media reports.

“We contacted his father here who told us that he had spoken to his son. Our engineering wing visited the house today and we will also help the family monetarily. Senior officers will pool in money and help will be offered to Anees,” Mr. Johri told The Hindu.

Senior Congress leader P. Chidambaram on Saturday hit out at the Delhi government for its sanction to prosecute former JNUSU president Kanhaiya Kumar and nine others in connection with a sedition case, saying the Kejriwal dispensation is “no less ill-informed than the Centre” in its understanding of the sedition law.

The Delhi government has given a go-ahead to the city police to prosecute former Jawaharlal Nehru University Students’ Union (JNUSU) president Kanhaiya Kumar and nine others in connection with a four-year-old sedition case, as the ruling AAP denied the persistent BJP charge of blocking the proceedings in the matter.

It also charged former JNU students Umar Khalid and Anirban Bhattacharya with allegedly shouting anti-India slogans during the event to commemorate the hanging of Parliament-attack mastermind Afzal Guru.

69,2020/02/29,Numbering of houses begins in Madhya Pradesh,"State is yet to inform census officials of its resolve to disallow update

Census officials are numbering houses in Madhya Pradesh while preparing for house-listing, along which the update of the National Population Register (NPR) will be undertaken from May. The State government is yet to inform them of its resolve to disallow the update.

“We are yet to receive an official communication from the State government on the Chief Minister’s remarks against the update,” said a census official, requesting anonymity. “So we are continuing preparations for the enumeration as per the schedule.”

Heeding a January 3 order of the State census office to undertake the update and house-listing in 45 days in the first phase of Census 2021, district authorities have deployed officials to number houses and list them at the ward-level, along with the names of owners.

For instance, the Ratlam district administration on February 11 said in an order that houses “are to be numbered” as per the “Corporation Ward Limitation, 2014”. On each house, the census number and the ward number will be marked. Moreover, a ward-level list will be prepared with the names of owners and the house numbers.

On February 17, Chief Minister Kamal Nath said the NPR would not be implemented in the State “at present”, attempting to quell fear over a December 9 notification of his government scheduling the exercise. But the government is yet to pass an official order.

“The notification being talked about was issued on December 9,” he was quoted as saying in a note issued by his office. “After this, the Centre implemented the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. Therefore, the NPR notification has not been issued under the CAA, 2019.” Earlier, the State Cabinet passed a resolution calling upon the Centre to abrogate the law, and begin the update only after withdrawing the proposal to add new questions.

Law Minister P.C. Sharma told The Hindu that Mr. Nath’s announcement should be taken as an “official communication” by census officials. “We have an unambiguous and unconditional stand on the NPR. We will not implement it at any cost, and Mr. Nath has made that clear.”

In case the census was preparing for the update exercise, he said, the State government would look into it, and ask it to “stop the process”.

Congress media chief in the State Shobha Oza said, “Any decision of the BJP government at the Centre with a hidden agenda, we’ll not implement it.”

“The Congress doesn’t oppose the NPR per se. In fact, we introduced it in 2010,” she said. “But the present government is playing foul by planning to combine the NPR, the CAA and the National Register of Citizens.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/numbering-of-houses-begins-in-madhya-pradesh/article30948829.ece

A 22-year-old furniture shop owner who was arrested on Friday from south Kashmir for his alleged role in the Pulwama terror case got some of the bomb-making material delivered home through online marketing platform Amazon, a senior National Investigation Agency (NIA) official has said.

The NIA arrested Shakir Bashir Magrey, a resident of Kakapora in Pulwama, for allegedly aiding and providing logistics to Jaish-e-Mohammad suicide bomber Adil Ahmad Dar.

The agency is said to have made a breakthrough in the Pulwama terror attack case with the arrest of Magrey. Forty CRPF jawans were killed in the suicide attack on February 14, 2019.

The official added that Magrey purchased batteries and gloves online. There was no Internet shutdown in Kashmir Valley in 2019 when the attack was planned. The NIA said Magrey is an overground worker of the Pakistan-based terror outfit JeM.

The NIA said, “Magrey revealed he had harboured Dar and Pakistani terrorist Mohammad Umar Farooq in his house from late 2018 till the attack in February 2019, and assisted them in the preparation of the improvised explosive device (IED).”

The official added that Magrey drove Dar close to the spot where the attack took place. “He got down 500 metres ahead of the site where the attack took place. Later, Dar rammed the bomb-laden car into the CRPF bus, which killed 40 personnel,” said the official.

The clashes between the Khasi Students Union members and non-tribals broke out during anti-CAA and pro-ILP meeting held in Ichamati area of the district on Friday, they said.

Mobile internet services have been suspended in six districts — East Jaintia Hills, West Jaintia Hills, East Khasi Hills, Ri Bhoi, West Khasi Hills an South West Khasi hills — of the state from Friday night for 48-hours, officials said.

Curfew was imposed in Shillong and adjoining areas with effect from 10 pm of February 28 to 8 am of February 29, an official order said.

The Maharashtra Navnirman Sena has opened a counter in Aurangabad for people to give information about ‘infiltrators’ and those whose tip-offs prove correct would be given a reward of ₹5,000, a functionary of the Raj Thackeray-led party said on Friday.

The MNS has started one counter in Akashwani area, manned by party workers, and five more are in the pipeline, MNS Aurangabad unit president Sumit Khambekar said.

“People can give information on infiltrators staying here and we will forward it to the police. If the police verification finds the information to be correct, we will give the person who gave us the tip-off a reward of ₹5,000,” said Mr. Khambekar.

When contacted, Aurangabad police commissioner Chiranjeev Prasad refused to comment saying the news (of MNS setting up ‘infiltrator information’ counter) was being verified.

The MNS’ move comes after Mr. Thackeray, in a rally in Mumbai on February 9, signalled a turn towards hardline Hindutva by claiming his party would work towards evicting illegal Pakistani and Bangladeshi migrants staying in Maharashtra.

In his speech, Mr. Thackeray appealed to the Central government to give a “free hand to the police for 48 hours to evict infiltrators from Mumbai, as it is useless to ask the state government“.

75,2020/02/29,President gives nod for delimitation in NE States,"Deferred exercise to be carried out

President Ram Nath Kovind on Friday cancelled an earlier order of the Union government that deferred the delimitation exercise in the northeastern States of Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur and Nagaland.

An order issued by the Law Ministry said, “The President is satisfied that the circumstances leading to the deferment cease to exist and is, therefore, pleased to rescind the February 8, 2008 order.”

The latest Law Ministry order noted that there has been a significant improvement in the security situation and a reduction in insurgency incidents, making the situation conducive for carrying out the delimitation exercise now.

The delimitation exercise to readjust the division of each State and Union territory into territorial constituencies for the purpose of elections to the Lok Sabha and to the State Legislative Assemblies on the basis of 2001 census figures was completed by November 26, 2008.

However, this exercise under aegis of the Delimitation Commission, was postponed in Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur and Nagaland on apprehension of threat to the peace and public order.

According to the Election Commission of India’s website, delimitation literally means the act or process of fixing limits or boundaries of territorial constituencies in a country or a province having a legislative body.

And the process is assigned to a high power body known as Delimitation Commission or a Boundary Commission.

“In India, such Delimitation Commissions have been constituted four times -– in 1952 under the Delimitation Commission Act, 1952, in 1963 under Delimitation Commission Act, 1962, in 1973 under Delimitation Act, 1972 and in 2002 under Delimitation Act, 2002,” the EC said.

The Delimitation Commission in India is a high power body whose orders have the force of law and cannot be called in question before any court.

These orders come into force on a date to be specified by the President and copies of its orders are laid before Lok Sabha and the State Legislative Assembly concerned.

However, he made it clear that New Zealand would not get involved in the ""local politics of a foreign country"".

Mr. Peter’s visit coincided with that of U.S. President Donald Trump and came during the violence over the CAA in the capital, which left 42 people dead. In sharp contrast to Mr. Trump, who said he had not discussed the CAA or the violence, Mr. Peters told The Hindu he discussed both, as there were questions being asked “back home” about them.

Mr. Peters was accompanied by his Trade Minister and they met External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal on bilateral trade and multilateral cooperation in the Indo-Pacific.

Asked about India’s entry as a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), which New Zealand blocked along with China and others in 2016, Mr. Peters said his government’s stand had not changed on the issue.

New Zealand continued to ask the NSG to develop “fixed norms and criteria” for all non-signatories to the Non Proliferation Treaty.

India and New Zealand have committed to working closer on their Indo-Pacific strategies and bilateral trade issues this week, but India’s admission to the Nuclear Suppliers Group remains an unresolved issue. New Zealand Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters said he had also raised questions over the Citizenship Amendment Act during his discussions with External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar.

New Zealand has brought out its vision for India-New Zealand bilateral ties- 2025. What are your priority areas, and what do you hope will be India’s?

The plan is to bring far better cooperation between our two countries, not just on domestic and bilateral issues like trade, but on the big picture — the Indo-Pacific commitment — and to give it shape and form on the basis of fundamental principles of the rule of law, belief in democracy, multilateralism and the aspirations of the Indian government to be more involved in the Pacific region.

You are in Delhi at a time there has been violence over the Citizenship Amendment Act... Did that come up in your talks?

We asked for better information, and what were the surrounding circumstances around this event [violence], yes, we did. We are not a country that interferes in the local politics of another country. We might have a view, but we respect the right of democracies to make specific decisions.

What we were interested in finding out was all the aspects surrounding the legislation and where it would all lead to. The last part of the question is unknown. But we are interested to know, because our population back home will ask the question, did you raise it? The answer is yes, and we wanted to know what the political view about the legislation is and we go away better informed about what the system thinks, and what the opposition thinks.

What is your response to India’s decision to walk out of the RCEP, which New Zealand is a part of and do you think the government will rethink?

We have looked at some of the reasons for India’s decision, including their concerns on dairy imports, and our considered view is that New Zealand’s dairy industry represents no threat to the Indian economy or the farming community. We didn’t ask for the government to rethink [its RCEP position], but we do think it is necessary to avoid knee jerk reactions to the open market. This is not meant as a criticism, as politicians we understand how democracies work.

One of the thorns in the India-New Zealand relationship is your refusal to make an exception for India’s membership at the Nuclear Suppliers Group. Was this discussed and is New Zealand likely to change its stand?

Not at the moment. We have come here to reiterate why we have made the statement in the first place that New Zealand would like to fix norms and criterion for all non-NPT states to be admitted into the NSG. We had a very valuable discussion with the External Affairs Minister [S. Jaishankar] on our position. Remember, we have planes in the air surveilling North Korean movement and the nuclear threat, which we need to deter and we need to play this role.

On the Indo-Pacific strategy for the region, New Zealand is not part of the Quad (Australia-India-Japan-US). Would it like to be?

We don’t have ideas above our station, and we haven’t been invited [to join the Quad]. We are a serious international player, and we are proud of that. When there is a crisis in the region, our military, airforce and navy are there.

It is also our job to ensure that in the Pacific Islands neighbourhood we live in, there are no vacuums and our neighbours’ national interest is supreme. So we provide aid, do development cooperation with them. We may not give them big loans at low interest rates at levels of debt against the GDP that they can’t pay back.

India has shown an interest in the region, and what we have offered is our understanding and our expertise of the Pacific Island region to work on projects together. If 4-5 partners work together, our money will go a whole lot farther and per project, a whole lot cheaper, as long as we agree that the object is to benefit the people.

Did you also discuss how to tackle the 5G challenge, and whether Chinese company Huawei should be allowed to participate in the networks, given the security concerns?

It came up. We were at pains to point out that the international narrative that we have banned Huawei, as a government, is entirely wrong. The legislation on this passed by a former government, required that government communications and the security bureau to analyse whether the security conditions were adequately met. So it is not a political decision, it is a technical process for 5G. The security and safety of our citizens remains our number one priority.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/h7mns5/article30945273.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH29WINSTONPETERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/new-zealand-deputy-prime-minister-winston-peters-interview-new-zealand-wants-defined-norms-for-entry-of-non-npt-states-into-nsg/article30945275.ece
77,2020/02/29,Araku Utsav off to a colourful start,"People in large numbers throng the venue on the first day of the festival

The two-day annual festival -- Araku Utsav 2020 -- was off to a grand start at Araku Valley in Visakhapatnam district on Saturday. Tourism Minister M. Srinivasa Rao and officials from the district took part in the event.

Addressing the gathering, Mr. Srinivasa Rao said that development was not up to the mark in the tribal areas due to lack of awareness about various government schemes.

The State government was keen on tribal development and releasing adequate funds for the same, the Minister said and underlined the need for creating awareness about the welfare schemes to ensure reach of their fruits to the targeted group.

The Minister said the aim of organising such festivals was to spread the tribal tradition and culture to other regions. Such utsavs would also put Araku on global map, he opined.

Mr. Srinivasa Rao also said that making of Vizag as an Executive capital would lead to development of the Agency. He further said the festival would be made an annual affair.

Pravin Kumar, Managing Director, APTDC, listed various programmes being organised in the tribal areas. Paderu MLA K. Bhagya Lakshmi stressed the need for eco-friendly tourism in the region.

Mimicry show

People in large numbers from Araku and surrounding mandals thronged the utsav venue on the first day. A number of stalls exhibiting handlooms, garments, tribal foods and others were put up. The food stalls with tribal delicacies received good response. Cultural programmes, including folk dances, entertained the visitors.

79,2020/02/29,"Board exams: Coping with stress, phobias and depressions","Many students become vulnerable to anxiety pangs as the Board exams near

March is a dreaded month for students gearing up to write their Board exams, an important milestone in their life. Exam season invariably brings loads of stress for the young learners, as many of them become vulnerable to anxiety pangs that sometimes result in panic disorders, phobias and depressions. It becomes imperative to shift focus on ways to breeze through this ‘challenging’ phase.

""This is the season we get maximum number of ‘exam stress’ cases of students from 10th standard to those preparing to write competitive exams,"" says psychiatrist Indla Vishal. He says considering the fact that stress and anxiety are at their peak between January and April, ""we tell worried parents that stress, to some extent, is good as it gives them the much-needed push to excel. But they should make sure that it does not go beyond a point.""

Also read: Avoid junk food to stay fit for exams, say experts

Students affected by exam phobia slip into a zone of nervousness, confusion and agitation. ""We also tell parents not to put too much pressure on their children and deal with the issue in a positive way by telling them success tales of how people have managed to overcome pressure by doing the right things,"" says Mr. Vishal, adding that when a child complains of sleeplessness, palpitation, extreme anxiety, panic attack or blanking out, he needs low dose medication for the examination period.

Also Read Mock tests add to the pressure

Psychologist T.S. Rao, who recently distributed brochures with tips on how to bust exam stress in schools, sees a slight improvement in the overall scenario. ""Schools in corporate sector continue the pressure tactics, but those in government schools are in a far better situation,"" he opines.

The problem, he says, starts with the fear in the minds of the children of not meeting their parents’ expectations, which in many cases are far from reality.

Without realising that a burnout can leave a long term effect, some parents don’t allow enough sleep and rest to the child, he rues. Good sleep, a balanced diet and regular breaks from study sessions is imperative, he urges.

Preparatory mode

With the announcement of the dates of the SSC and Intermediate exams, schools and junior colleges have switched to a preparatory mode.

""We are conducting special sessions for 10th class students on how to remain stress-free in the exam season. Using the model question papers set according to the new pattern, we have explained to our students to prepare for exams accordingly,"" said V. Sasikala, convener of KCP Siddhartha Adarsh Residential Public School, Kanuru.

For the government and municipal schools, ""motivation"" is the catchword. Teachers have been asked to conduct extra classes wherever necessary and motivate not just the children but their parents. They are expected to visit homes and talk to parents of low-performing students about the need to extend all kinds of support to their wards and help him/her pass the exam with good marks.

An official said the focus was on around 100 low-performing schools where teachers and headmasters were doing all they can to help children prepare for the test.

Elaborate planning

Director of Government Examinations A. Subba Reddy said elaborate planning was being done to ensure smooth and fair conduct of the exams. Instructions had been issues to officials concerned to implement effectively and monitor constantly the arrangements in their respective jurisdictions.

The District Education Officers (DEOs), with the help of Assistant Commissioners and Deputy EOs, will monitor the examination works. Senior officers of School Education Department will be appointed as State-level observers in each district, coordinating with the Collector and the DEOs.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/6j62rf/article30955654.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/examJPG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/stressing-on-score/article30953070.ece
80,2020/02/29,Mock tests add to the pressure,"With the final examinations set to began shortly, students have started to feel the stress. Many private schools in the district have been conducting mock tests for students, adding to the pressure.

The situation for students pursuing Intermediate is even more pathetic, as private colleges have been organising tests everyday apart from extending the study hours, even on Sundays. A few day scholars are made to study on the college premises for almost 13 hours a day.

""There are two categories of students who approach us. One category of students say they have not finished some part of the syllabus or have not prepared well and they just fear that they might fail or score less marks. Students facing such kind of stress can be handled with little bit of counselling. But there is another category that does not even want to go to examination and get into depression, this is a dangerous trend,"" said N.N. Raju, former Superintendent of Government Hospital for Mental Care.

Dr. Raju said they generally ask the parents to be friendly with their children and explain to them that failing in examinations was logical and we motivate them to try better the next time. ""In extreme cases, we give medication,"" he said. ""Proper food with vegetables, proper sleep and most importantly, scheduled study hours is required to beat examination stress,"" he said.

No counselling

The claims by the Education Department to provide proper counselling to the students remain only on paper and there is no dedicated toll-free number for counselling and guiding the students on how to get over depression and examination stress, said a senior teacher from a government high school.

A senior official from District Education Department said the responsibility of conducting counselling sessions had been given to the class teachers itself. However, it was observed that in most of the schools they had been conducting counselling to students who are good in studies and can easily secure 9 CGPA, and they ignore the students who really need it, he said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/mock-tests-add-to-the-pressure/article30953054.ece
81,2020/02/29,"Avoid junk food to stay fit for exams, say experts","Doctors and personality development trainers have been urging youngsters to avoid junk food completely during exams, since they would lead to further stress while writing the examination.

Ahead of Intermediate and Class X examinations, many institutions are conducting special programmes for children to overcome examination-related stress.

Intermediate examinations begin on March 4 and Class X exams start on March 23 in Andhra Pradesh. As many as 1.2 lakh students are appearing for both exams in Srikakulam and Vizianagaram districts.

Indian Academy of Paediatrics-AP chapter president D.V. Srikanth suggested to the parents to serve absolute healthy food and make children drink ample water during preparation and exams. ""Junk fund leads to many health complications. It is not at all advisable, since junk food may lead to further stress as it can’t ensure required strength which only the healthy food prepared in home can give,"" he added.

New lessons

Personality Development Trainer Duppala Ravikumar suggested that students should not concentrate on new lessons since it would not be possible for them to memorise at this crucial juncture. ""The students should not worry about a few chapters which are not covered during study. They can leave questions of those chapters in choice,"" he added.

Srikakulam Oxford School Director M. Ramesh Babu urged teachers and parents not to force children for ranks and marks. ""We must make children face the examinations confidently. More expectations will lead to depression and kill their natural ability,"" he says.

Rural students

Meanwhile, a majority of the students from rural areas have been facing examination-related stress with the lack of opportunity for full-fledged preparation in the absence of infrastructure and faculty.

For instance, students of Intermediate courses of Kasturiba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas are reportedly facing exam fear as the government reportedly delayed the appointment of lecturers. They reportedly started classes only in September and October could not cover syllabus completely. Officials of the departments concerned claimed that special classes were conducted for completing the teaching of entire syllabus. However, they agreed that they could not set up laboratories for MPC and BiPC students as Intermediate courses had started only in 2019-20 academic year.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/avoid-junk-food-to-stay-fit-for-exams-say-experts/article30953036.ece
82,2020/02/29,When worked-up children do the ‘vanishing act’,"Under tremendous emotional turmoil, students tend to run away from ‘crushing academic environment’ to find some solace

Terminology such as ""stress factor, yoga, meditation and planning"" are common and seem to be an unending rhetoric in academic circles, from Class X to B. Tech.

With each passing year, the number of motivational speakers and psychologists is steadily on the rise, addressing lakhs of students with so-called ""power-loaded"" verbose to boost their morale during examinations, drawing quotes of the great personalities and referring to anecdotes from mythology. It is just one side of the coin.

But, there is a serious change of mindset among the students, who are taking to adventurous ideas in order to get rid of the stress which grips them with the intensity of a virus. An alarming number of students now find recourse in ""going missing"" to beat stress. It’s not an exaggeration when it comes to Chittoor district.

According to the police records in Chittoor, Madanapalle, Palamaner, Puttur and Sri City sub-divisions, 497 missing cases were registered during the last three years (2017-19), all involving students in the age group of 10-18. The number included 422 girls.

However, the positive side is close to 99.9% of the missing students were traced by the cops, while the missing period of the students ranges from just one day to one year. Senior police officials attribute this escapades to the ""crushing levels of stress"" coming from teachers and parents as well.

One worst side of the stress was that in 2019, two girls, with only a couple of weeks left for the Class X examination, went missing from a western mandal. The police found themselves simply dumb after knowing the reason for their three-day escapade. A parent threatened to commit suicide, if his daughter failed to get 10 GPA. The stress was so severe that the girl just wanted to have some escape. She just left for a temple in neighbouring Karnataka, along with her classmate, to pray to the deity there to prevent her mother’s emotional blackmail.

""After involuntarily leaving home, the girls just shudder to return, and debilitating nervousness grips them,"" a cop said.

In another case, a Class X girl from Madanapalle division went missing early in January this year for the reason that she had lost hope of passing the Mathematics examination. After travelling in various buses, she finally reached a relative’s home two days later.

Stress blamed

A sub-inspector of police said that a majority of the missing cases originated from stress in the classrooms, and at home works and with poor marks. Other major causes which drive students to ""go missing"" are when they

are denied mobile phones, motorbikes and other luxuries by the parents. ""Fortunately, the girls could be easily traced as they spend the missing period at houses of their friends,"" he said.

The subject of stress faced by students took a serious turn in Chittoor district with about half a dozen suicides in acts of jumping from the hostel and college buildings and hanging. It is observed that suicides among students becomes a burning topic only a few days before and after the examinations and results. Many cases that follow in later months go unregistered and reportedly pass on as natural deaths, the police said.

Healthy diet

Responding to this oppressing scenario, D.G. Rama Murthy, a noted motivational speaker and head constable, said the recently introduced new menu for midday meal scheme in government schools with good nutritional values, would definitely contribute in bringing down the negative thoughts among students, and the results could be seen at the earliest.

""Coming to corporate institutions, the villain is total absence of games and sports and tyrannising study hours. Parents should completely stay away from pressurising children for ranks and marks. The alumni of all institutions, with successful records and careers, could enliven the campuses by encouraging students with positive thoughts,"" he said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/when-worked-up-children-do-the-vanishing-act/article30953009.ece

85,2020/02/29,YSRCP blames TDP for airport incident,"‘People blocked Naidu’s convoy as he is opposed to making city as the Executive capital’

YSR Congress Party city president Vamsi Krishna Srinivas on Saturday said people blocked the convoy of TDP president and former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu on Thursday to register their protest against his opposition to make Visakhapatnam the Executive capital of the State.

Addressing a press conference along with party leaders Kolla Guruvulu, Perla Vijay Chander and Satish Varma, he justified the stopping of his convoy due to his ‘anti-North Andhra’ statements.

Mr. Srinivas said Mr. Naidu instead of supporting decentralisation was only championing the cause of people of a few villages in the Amaravati region due to real estate interest and had been raising ‘Jai Amaravati’ slogans wherever he was visiting. He said unless Mr. Naidu changed his stand, the people of North Andhra would continue to oppose his visits to Visakhapatnam in future.

Denying the charge that YSRCP was behind the protest at the Visakhapatnam airport, he said Mr. Naidu was trying to dent the brand image of Visakhapatnam. He said the Leader of Opposition should explain as to what he had done for the development of North Andhra during his stint as Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh before and after the division for a total period of 14 years.

Local body polls

Mr. Srinivas said in the ensuring local body elections, the people would teach TDP a fitting lesson for its ‘anti-North Andhra’ stand.

87,2020/02/29,Expert sees need to conserve king cobra,"‘It feeds on other venomous snakes endangering human lives’

Students from different schools and the Zoology Department of Andhra University were exposed to different facets of biodiversity and importance of wildlife conservation, here on Saturday.

A documentary ‘Snake Rescue Call’ based on true story of wildlife conservationists who are engaged in solving human-snake conflict was screened by Eastern Ghats Wildlife Society, at the Bioscope – Zoo Education Centre at Indira Gandhi Zoological Park.

The film is based on the snake conservation work carried out by the Eastern Ghats Wildlife Society in collaboration with the Andhra Pradesh Forest Department and the Agumbe Rainforest Research Station in the western Ghats of Karnataka.

The 50-minute documentary showcases some stunning drone shots of amazing snake species found in and around Visakhapatnam and the king cobra conservation effort by the Agumbe Rainforest Research Station.

Speaking on the importance of conserving king cobras, Murthy Kantimahanti, Founder of Eastern Ghats Wildlife Society, said that king cobras are the largest venomous snakes in the world, and they are intelligent and timid snakes and afraid of human presence.

“King cobras feed on other venomous snakes such as kraits and vipers, who amount to about 50,000 human casualties in India alone. So it is necessary that they be conserved for our own good. But instead of taking things on their own hands, they should call professionals so that the snake can be handled well,” he said.

The film is about creating an awareness to conserve this specie, as saving them is a win-win situation for both, he said.

According to him, king cobras are rare but they inhabit north coast AP, and it is our duty to educated farmers and rural populace to safeguard them and call us for rescuing them.

We are also teaching locals to handle such snakes, he said.

“The violence taking place in Delhi for the past four days is not happening at random. They are communal attacks, meticulously planned by the BJP, RSS and other communal forces,” said district CPI(M) secretary K. Prabhakar Reddy.

The Left parties along with the Kurnool Bar Association, AP SC-ST Lawyers’ Forum, Loukika Rajyanga Parirakshana Vedika, BSNL Employee’s Union and farmers’ associations launched a hunger strike in the city on Friday condemning the government for its failure to save the lives of people in Delhi.

90,2020/02/29,"Concern over Maoist threat toVizag is far-fetched, say police","‘Operational capabilities of Naxalites limited to the cut-off area in AOB region’

Ever since Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy proposed the idea of decentralisation and setting up of three capitals with Visakhapatnam as the Executive capital, the threat from the banned CPI (Maoist), has been a topic for debate.

The concern is logical and reasonable, as the LWE (left wing extremists) have their presence in the Visakha Agency, and it is located about 150 to 180 km from the city limits.

But many senior police officers say that the ‘concern’ for threat is ‘far- fetched’, and they do not view it as a serious danger.

According to a senior officer from the APSIB, the Maoists have been present in Visakha Agency since last two decades, but now their presence and operational capabilities are limited only to the cut-off area in the Andhra-Odisha Border region.

Maoist documents found at a few recent exchange of fire sites reveal that they (Maoist) are unable to move out of the AOB region, due to intensified combing and area domination exercise by the security forces in the Agency areas. In a few documents the Maoists have also revealed that the killing of Araku MLA Kidari Sarveswara Rao and former MLA Siveri Soma in Livitiputtu village in Dumbriguda mandal in Visakha Agency in September 2018, was a ‘mistake’, as post the incident, the security forces have not only increased their operation but also gained ground into the deep pockets and have pushed them (Maoist) back to the 1,500-sq km of cut-off area. “There presence in urban area is minimal and more importantly the police officers present in this area are well oriented to the Maoist threat, as every officer would have served in the Visakha Agency in anti-Maoist operation during some part of their career. We are well equipped with good intelligence network,” said Superintendent of Police Attada Babujee.

Threat from Maoist action teams are also minimal, as they do not have any urban base, as in the past. They can only step up their voice through their frontal agencies, but at present they do not have the resources and manpower to run action teams, as they did in the past, said Commissioner of Police Rajeev Kumar Meena.

But leaving no grey areas, it is learnt that the intelligence wing of the police have stepped up the vigil and are in the process of increasing their intelligence network.

City security

Coming to basic security, there is an immediate need to increase the manpower both in crime and law order section by at least 20%.

Basically, the security aspect is dealt with the law and order wing and officers feel that the strength needs to be enhanced by at least 500 additional men and officers. The current strength is around 800.

Though the basic security or close quarter security of the Ministers and lawmakers are dealt directly by the AP Police from the ISW (Intelligence Security Wing) and CSW (City Security Wing), additional manpower is needed for convoys, road opening parties, bandobust duties and special teams for sanitising key areas such as places where bureaucrats and lawmakers reside.

“We also need more vehicles, bomb disposal and dog squads, if Vizag is made the Executive capital,” said a senior police officer from the security wing.

There is also a talk that a proposal has been sent to draw men from the 16th Battalion of APSP, which is stationed at Bakkannapalem in Visakhapatnam. When Amaravati was declared as capital, men were drafted from the AR Battalion at Mangalagiri.

CCTV cover

The police are also contemplating to increase the CC TV cover in the city by another 10,000. “At present there are about 24,000 cameras, including 2,500 cameras installed by GVMC. We intend to take this number to 34,000, in the next one year. This will enhance our security and surveillance system,” said Mr. Meena.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/mz1a6x/article30946513.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29-maoist-graphiccol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/concern-over-maoist-threat-tovizag-is-far-fetched-say-police/article30946514.ece
91,2020/02/29,Koundinya sanctuary too small a habitat for elephants: expert,"‘Seshachalam biosphere reserve or Srisailam belt can be better’

After the straying of elephants from Koundinya sanctuary into the Irala fields near Chittoor, a herd of seven elephants sneaked from Mamandur forest into Karakambadi Road, on the outskirts of Tirupati, three days back, though for a brief period. Strangely enough, both incidents involving elephants are witnessed for the first time in nearly two decades.

“The wayward movement of elephants into hitherto-unknown areas in southern Andhra Pradesh is actually part of their larger move to explore newer territories,” says Raman Sukumar, a professor at Centre for Ecological Sciences (CES) in Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru. In an informal chat with The Hindu, Dr. Sukumar observed that the foray started in the early eighties with the migration of around 50 elephants from Hosur forest division of Tamil Nadu into Kuppam area of Andhra Pradesh. From Kuppam to Palamaner, they moved in herds, causing panic among the forest fringe villages en route. “Koundinya is actually a very small area, which the elephants find hardly suitable to dwell and hence tend to move out,” he observed, adding that a larger and denser forest stretch such as Seshachalam biosphere reserve (which already has over three dozen elephants) or Nagarjuna Sagar-Srisailam belt could be a better place.

Conflict zone

Even as the villages in south-western Chittoor are finding it hard to cope with the movement of the pachyderms, a new batch has very recently moved from Hosur into Koundinya, which indicates the need for higher preparedness and conflict resolution measures in place from the Forest Department. “The conflict typically stays for a period of 10 years, as either the villagers get adjusted to the straying or the elephants tend to move out to newer territories,” notes Dr. Sukumar, an expert on the ecology of Asian elephants who has extensively researched on human-animal conflict.

Feeding proclivities

Earlier, in his talk on ‘The elephant is a foodie: ecology, behaviour and management’ at Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) campus, Dr. Sukumar mentioned the elephant’s feeding proclivities as bringing it into direct conflict with humans. He explained the tuskers’ adaptation to a changing environment, both over evolutionary as well as contemporary time scales, and their implications in their management, in the face of diminishing prospects for coexistence with humans. He was felicitated by IISER Director K.N. Ganesh on the occasion.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/qrzjiw/article30946478.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29-VJ-ELEPHANTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/koundinya-sanctuary-too-small-a-habitat-for-elephants-expert/article30946479.ece
92,2020/02/29,Irregularities plague govt. hospitals: ACB,"Over 100 officials inspect hospitals across the State on Thursday and Friday; report to be submitted

The 48-hour raid on Government District Headquarters and Area Hospitals and Dispensaries across the State by the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) officials highlighted the poor maintenance and irregularities in drug stores, wards and kitchens in many hospitals.

Following the directions of ACB Director General P.S.R. Anjaneyulu, more than 100 ACB officials inspected the facilities in government hospitals and Primary and Urban Health Centres on Thursday and Friday.

They found that medicines and other equipment were purchased without approval from Hospital Development Societies (HDSs), in some hospitals

HDS meetings were not conducted regularly and the diet being served to the patients was not as per the menu prescribed by the medical officers.

“Aarogyasri, Talli Bidda Scheme is not being implemented properly in many district and area hospitals. Registers in drug stores, out and in-patient registers, staff attendance, indent registers and records in blood banks are not properly maintained in some hospitals,” Mr. Anjaneyulu said.

Unqualified persons

In some dispensaries, unqualified persons were discharging duties as technicians and security personnel are maintaining some registers. Private persons, moving on the premises of some hospitals, were diverting the patients to private clinics and diagnostic centres for lab tests, X-rays, ECG and other reports.

Unhygienic conditions were seen in male, female, surgical, burns and paediatric wards in many hospitals. Condition in toilets was worst and there was no power to toilets in some hospitals.

In Gudur Area Hospital in Nellore district, variations in stock registers and the availability of the drugs were noticed, security personnel and sanitation supervisor were issuing outpatient slips and no citizen chart was found.

‘Fake bills’

In Tenali Government Hospital, some medicines were purchased without placing orders, diet registers were not maintained properly, difference between number of in-patients present in the hospital and the number of persons entered in the register was observed.

Ambulance allotted to the hospital was not in a good condition and fake bills submitted by unregistered diagnostic centre were noticed.

The 100-bedded Government Area Hospital, Gudivada, in Krishna district was functioning without installation of fire fighting equipment and there was no ‘NOC’ from the

Fire department. Blood bank funds were diverted to other purposes and private diagnostic centre staff were operating in the radiology department in the hospital.

‘No food licence’

When the ACB team visited Jangareddygudem Area Hospital, doctor, nursing superintendent and head nurse were absent.

No food licence was given to the diet contractor and huge stock variations were found in drug stores.

In NTR Hospital at Anakapalle, records indicate that seven in-patients, including five female patients under Aarogyasri were undergoing treatment in the hospital, but no patients were found in the ward.

The ACB Director General said that a detail report would be submitted to the government on the pathetic and unhygienic conditions and irregularities in the government, area and general hospitals in the State and action would be recommended against the erring staff.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/2rww63/article30946371.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29-VJ-ACBRAIDS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/irregularities-plague-govt-hospitals-acb/article30946372.ece

98,2020/02/29,"J&K is the best tourist destination, say Tourism officials","Road show to be held in Vijayawada on March 2 to invite tourists, investors

Officials of the Jammu and Kashmir Tourism Development Authority (JKTDA) and local tour operators opine that Jammu and Kashmir is the perfect place for nature lovers who can enjoy their visit to the region.

Tourists can enjoy visit to mountains, rivers, temples, lakes and the historic places in the State and Jammu and Kashmir is a perfect tourist destination throughout the year, the tour operators said.

JKTDA CEO (Business) and special officer of Surinsar Mansar Lake Nagendra Singh Jamwal said the situation in J&K and the neighbouring places was peaceful and the visitors could experience lush green nature.

“There is a rumour that the situation is Jammu and Kashmir is unstable after abrogation of Article 370, but it is not true. Lakhs of tourists are visiting the place every year which is blessed with mountains, valleys, lakes, wonderful gardens and pilgrim centres,” Mr. Singh said.

Surinsar Mansar Ramsar Lake Wildlife Sanctuary is a place to visit in which many species of birds, wild animals and flora and fauna could be seen in the lake, the CEO said.

He thanked the Andhra Pradesh government and the Tirumala Tirupati Devastanams (TTD) for establishing a Lord Venkateswara temple, which will become another tourist attraction for visitors.

99,2020/02/29,Traditional fishermen urge government to declare ‘fish famine’,"They say they have returned with empty boats on most of the days this fishing season

Over two lakh traditional fishermen across the three coastal districts in Karnataka have been hit hard by non-availability of catch throughout the fishing season starting August and have urged the government to come to their rescue by declaring “fish famine.”

“In the last four decades, we have not seen fish famine as serious as this,” said Mohan Kharvi from the Traditional Fishermen Association, Maravanthe, one of the important fishing villages in Udupi district. Traditional fishermen normally venture into the sea very early in the morning, around 2 a.m. and return to the shore once they get sufficient catch. “Most of the days, we have returned with empty boats,” Mr. Kharvi said.

There are two kinds of traditional fishing boats along the three coastal districts — about 8,000 large boats that can accommodate up to 30 people fitted with outboard engine and about 9,000 conventional boats (paathi doni) that can hold two-three persons either fitted with small outboard engines or without engines.

While they give direct employment to over two lakh people, at least 10 lakh depend on them for livelihood.

Stating that the Fisheries Department has no data on traditional fishermen’s catch, Shobendra Sasihithlu from Sasihithlu Traditional Fishermen Cooperative Society near Mangaluru demanded an immediate survey to know the ground reality. “Fishermen have not even got ₹25,000 during the season,” he said. Fishermen could not venture out owing to turbulent sea till November. Thereafter, no catch was available, he said.

The government is yet to pay money to fishermen under the savings-cum-relief scheme since 2017, Mr. Sasihithlu said. The Centre, State, and fishermen member of a fishing cooperative society equally contribute ₹1,500 during the three months of monsoon towards the scheme. In all, ₹13,500 is to be paid to about 27,000 fishermen.

Many reasons for famine

In its recent report, College of Fisheries, Mangaluru, noted that higher atmospheric temperature had led to increased carbon dioxide concentration making water acidic with lower dissolved oxygen levels, thus affecting primary productivity. Conventional marine species were thus affected with non-availability of phytoplankton, zooplankton and other micro organism components.

This, apart from factors such as unregulated and erratic fishing and increase in seawater temperature, are cited as the reasons for dwindling marine population.

Though banned, light fishing where large fishing vessels use LED lights to attract fish, still goes on across the coast thereby affecting traditional fishermen, said Shobendra Sasihithlu, a traditional fisherman near Mangaluru. Catching of juvenile fish, thereby affecting further growth, still continues even as recommendations from the Centre for Marine Fish Research Institute on regulating mesh size of fish nets are yet to be strictly implemented.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/5ybypw/article30952767.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29BGFISH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/traditional-fishermen-urge-government-to-declare-fish-famine/article30952768.ece
100,2020/02/29,Bangladeshi with Indian passport arrested at KIA,"Harassed in Saudi, he had sought Indian embassy’s help

A 25-year-old man who applied for and received an emergency Indian passport while trying to escape from his employer in Saudi Arabia landed at Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) here only to be arrested after the authorities discovered that he was an illegal immigrant from Bangladesh.

The accused, Ripan Debnath hailing from Dhaka, allegedly crossed the border into India six years ago. Over the years, he was able to acquire valid documents which he used to get an Indian passport, said the police. He used the passport to apply for a job in Saudi Arabia.

In August 2019, he left for Riyadh to work as a labourer. However within the days, his employer started harassing him. He told the police that his passport was confiscated and he was locked in a room with little food. He was not paid the promised salary either.

Unable to bear the harassment, Ripan managed to escape from his employer and approached the Indian Embassy for help. “Officials there got him an emergency passport and even helped him book tickets to return to Bengaluru,” said the police. Ripan arrived on Monday at KIA but immigration officials took him into custody after they spoke to him as they suspected something was amiss.

Ripan allegedly confessed that he crossed the border at Bengal and came to India in 2014. He stayed in various parts of the country and with the help of touts got a fake birth certificate. He later applied for a driving licence and Aadhaar. He obtained his passport in Hyderabad, said the police. “We are now trying to track down the tout in Hyderabad who helped him,” the police said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/srsa32/article30952743.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01BGAIRPORT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/bangladeshi-with-indian-passport-arrested-at-kia/article30952744.ece

102,2020/02/29,"With cut in Central funds, State to borrow from financial institutions","Government is making efforts not to reduce the budget size from that of last year

With a likely shortfall in collection of taxes in the State and reduction in the Central pool of taxes, the State government is expected to raise funds from multilateral institutions such as the World Bank, Asian Development Bank (ADB), and domestic institutions such as NABARD and other market sources.

This expected to go into funding rehabilitation work in flood-affected areas, farm loan waiver scheme, irrigation and infrastructure projects, expected to spelt out in the State budget on March 5.

Big shortfall

The shortfall in collection of taxes in the State and receipts in the Central pool of taxes is expected to touch nearly ₹20,000 crore in 2019-20. The slowdown in the economy and below target collection of taxes both at the State and Central level were the major reasons for reduction in available financial resources in the State for funding projects and schemes.

The State can borrow up to 3% of its Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) (up to ₹54,000 crore) as per the Karnataka Fiscal Responsibility Act. The H.D. Kumaraswamy-led government, in its budget 2019-20, borrowed up to 2.6% of the GSDP. The State cannot cross the prescribed 3% limit of the GSDP without the Centre’s approval.

The State budget for 2019-20 had proposed to borrow a whopping ₹46,127 crore from the markets in in order to finance its expenditure during the year.

Sources said the government is likely to approach the World Bank for funding the multi-crore Sujala Watershed project, and ADB for infrastructure and irrigation projects in the State. It is expected to borrow ₹1,100 crore from NABARD.

The financial crunch comes in the backdrop of the 15th Finance Commission fixing Karnataka’s share in Central taxes at 3.646% for FY 2020-21, which is 1.07% lower than the share of 4.713% awarded by the 14th Finance Commission. Cut in 15th Finance Commission, GST, and grants-in-aid from the Centre as well reduction in mobilisation of resources in the State’s own taxes could severely impact the funding of welfare/populist schemes such as Anna Bhagya and Indira Canteens, sources said.

Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, who is presenting the State budget for 2020-21 on March 5, is expected to spell out the methods of resource mobilisation both from the domestic and multilateral institutions, sources in the State Secretariat said.

The government is making efforts not to reduce the budget size from that of last year’s budget, which was pegged at ₹2,34,153 crore.

In the Goods and Service Tax (GST), the Centre has to released about ₹17,000 crore to the State. But so far, it has released only about ₹11,000 crore. The Centre has promised ₹15,000 crore in the form of grant-in-aid but the State has received only 50% of the promised amount so far, sources said.

Karnataka has registered a moderate revenue collection of 73.6% in the first three quarters of the present fiscal (2019-20). The State’s revenue collection stood at ₹87,862.01 crore on December 31, 2019, against the target of ₹1,19,274 crore set for the year.

Longer office hours

To realise the target in the Stamps and Registration Department, the government has issued a circular to open all sub-registrar offices in the State from 9 a.m. to 6.30 p.m. on all working days till the end of this financial year (March 31, 2020).",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mkrkaq/article30952733.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01BGFARMER3,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/with-cut-in-central-funds-state-to-borrow-from-financial-institutions/article30952734.ece

104,2020/02/29,It’s a frugal diet in government hostels sans rice and wheat,"Supplies under PDS were due in October, but are yet to arrive

The menu in many government-run hostels in the State has been downgraded over the past few months following delay in supply of rice and wheat under the Public Distribution System.

Several hostels have not had supplies of rice and wheat that was expected to be supplied in October 2019 to this day and the local authorities have cut out non-veg items, eggs, sweets or fruits to be able to buy the staple grains from open market.

Allocation per student

The Social Welfare Department runs pre-matric, post-matric hostels, residential schools and ashrama schools. The Union government, under the Public Distribution System (hostel scheme) provides rice and wheat for students in two instalments in a year. Hostels get rice at the rate of 10 kg per student per month and wheat at the rate of 5 kg. In the current financial year, the second instalment of foodgrains, which was expected to be provided in October 2019, has not been released so far.

The government has fixed the food expenses for pre-matric hostels at ₹1,500 per student per month, post-matric hostels and residential schools at ₹1,600, and ashrama schools ₹1,400. Hostel wardens have to manage the ration within this amount. Under the scheme, rice was available at ₹5 to ₹6 per kg. But as the supply has been delayed, wardens are procuring rice from open market paying ₹25 to ₹35 per kg.

“When the cost of procuring rice increases by six times, we cannot afford to provide egg, banana, sweets, and non-veg. That has to be cut to meet the expenses,” said a Deputy Director of the Social Welfare Department, who did not wish to be named.

A student at a pre-matric hostel in Hassan district, on condition of anonymity, said that menu had been cut, but the warden had pleaded helplessness and said that they had no option as they had to arrange money for rice.

Another student, who stays at a hostel in Koppal, said that over the past two months, they were using too few vegetables in the food.

R.S. Peddapaiah, Commissioner of Social Welfare Department, in January, wrote to the Additional Chief Secretary (Food and Civil Supplies) of the State government requesting him to send a proposal to the Centre or provide 38,666.34 tonnes of rice and 19,333.16 tonnes of wheat.

‘Supply soon’

When The Hindu spoke to the Commissioner, he said: “Rice and wheat would be supplied to hostels soon.” However, he did not mention any time frame. He denied any cut in the menu. “The hostel staff have been managing with the available stock of rice and wheat. If there are any instances of cutting menu, I will take action against the staff,” he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/72s84x/article30952671.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01BGMarchhostelcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/its-a-frugal-diet-in-government-hostels-sans-rice-and-wheat/article30952672.ece

Major and Medium Irrigation Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi visited Kanakumbi village near the birthplace of Mahadayi river and held an informal meeting with officials, but returned without visiting the Kalasa-Banduri worksite in the forest near the village.

He also refused to speak at a meeting organised by farmers in the village. “The Supreme Court is hearing the petition filed by Goa on March 2 related to the Mahadayi issue. At this juncture, I should not have come to Kanakumbi as it could create problems for the State. Goa can raise objections to my visit. I have only come to assure farmers that we will take steps to ensure that the State gets its due share of the Mahadayi waters,” the Minister said.

“The State government is ready to release ₹2,000 crore for the project in the forthcoming budget. But we will go ahead only after clarifying some issues with the court and the Union government,” he said.

“We hope to get more water once the Supreme Court gives its final verdict in the Mahadayi dispute and related matters. We hope that the final verdict will be given in July,” he added.

106,2020/02/29,HDK accuses BJP govt. of diverting loan waiver funds,"The issue of farm loan waiver is back in the middle of a contentious debate with former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy accusing the BJP government of diverting ₹25,000 crore reserved for loan waiver and Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa stoutly denying it.

Mr. Kumaraswamy has said that he would take up the issue during the legislature session starting Monday. In series of tweets, he alleged that BJP government has dropped the names of over a lakh farmers from the loan waiver scheme citing document issues. He also alleged that the move was nothing but “cheating” farmers of the State and said: “The State is acting irresponsibly and I’m going to raise the issue on the floor of the House.”

CM refutes

Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa said that such allegations were baseless and it was an effort to spread disaffection among farmers. “All farmers who have submitted documents will be benefited,” he said.

109,2020/02/29,‘State’s tree cover has grown by 1.2 lakh ha’,"Farmers planted saplings given by Forest Dept. in their fields: CCF

Karnataka’s tree cover has expanded by about 1,02,500 hectares over the last couple of years, T. Hiralal, Chief Conservator of Forests, Mysuru, has said. Farmers were responsible for making this happen because of their sincere efforts in planting and nurturing saplings distributed by the Forest Department (Social Forestry).

Speaking after inaugurating an interactive session with farmers and a programme to felicitate achievers, including progressive farmers, at the Mysuru zoo here, he said the Forest Survey of India has cited in its report the increase of tree cover in the State; the rise in the number of trees was among the highest in the country.

Besides bringing income to farmers, the planting of saplings distributed by the Forest Department has resulted in significant growth in tree cover.

Mr. Hiralal said lakhs of saplings had been distributed to farmers at a nominal price over the last decade and the farmers had planted them in their fields as a measure to add up their revenue by growing revenue-earning trees.

Besides sandalwood and other saplings, neem and mahogany are among the species sought after now and are being planted extensively by farmers. A small and a medium-size sapling bag costs ₹1 and ₹3 respectively.

He said farmers in Hunsur have successfully planted neem saplings in their fields and are rated among the largest cultivators of neem, using water resources thoughtfully.

Felicitated

The programme was organised by Aranya Parisara Mattu Yoga Prathistana, Mysuru, and the Social Forestry division of the Forest Department. Progressive farmers Gowtham Kadam and Chennabasappa Gavadagere; senior journalist Amshi Prasanna Kumar; and industrialists Firoze Khan and Siraj Khan were felicitated on the occasion.

Retired Forest Secretary A.C. Lakshman presided over the occasion. The inaugural programme was followed by an interaction with farmers who had come from Mysuru and Chamarajanagar districts.

The farmers shared their thoughts on social forestry and how planting of trees could help in improving their income.

Mysuru zoo Executive Director Ajit Kulkarni, and Deputy Conservators of Forest Alexander, Prashanth Kumar, Bhanuprakash and P. Sridhar were present.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/states-tree-cover-has-grown-by-12-lakh-ha/article30952193.ece
110,2020/02/29,Plea filed to transfer Veerappan aide case to Juvenile Justice Board,"A petition has been filed in a Kollegal court seeking the transfer of the case relating to the arrest of Stella Mary, a Veerappan aide, for her alleged role in the Palar blast in 1993, to the Juvenile Justice Board (JJB).

P.P. Baburaj, an advocate and child rights activist who has filed the petition, has contended that Mary, who is now 43, was barely 16 years old when the alleged crime took place. Mary was arrested about a month ago and sent to judicial custody when the Kollegal police stumbled upon her while investigating the outbreak of a minor fire in a sugarcane field at Javeri village of Chamarajanagar district. Mary, the wife of Veluswamy, had fired in the air to drive away a herd of wild elephants that had entered their sugarcane field, leading to the outbreak of fire. When the police probed her about her ability to wield a firearm, they realised about her past association with the dreaded forest bandit.

Though she was arrested for the crime 27 years later, she was a minor when the actual blast took place, said Baburaj, who had earlier served as a member of the Juvenile Justice Board and the Child Welfare Committee of Mysuru district. “According to Section 9 of the Juvenile Justice Act, this court has no jurisdiction to try her. As she was a minor when the alleged offence took place, the case has to be transferred to the JJB,” he said.

Furthermore, Baburaj said Mary’s name in her school records was Elizabeth Rani. She was allegedly kidnapped by Veerappan’s gang when she was a minor. Subsequently, she was married to a gang member, Sunda Veliyar, who was later killed in a police encounter, Baburaj claimed.

Mary has two daughters — one from her earlier marriage and one with Veluswamy. Mary’s judicial custody has been extended twice since her arrest. She is produced once every 14 days for extension of custody, according to Baburaj.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/plea-to-transfer-veerappan-aide-case-to-juvenile-justice-board/article30952140.ece
111,2020/02/29,UAHS graduates set sights on civil services,"Many of the meritorious students who bagged gold medals at the convocation of the University of Agricultural and Horticultural Sciences (UAHS), Shivamogga, on Saturday want to carve out careers in civil services as they believe it offers an excellent opportunity to bring about positive change in society.

Poornima Sajjan from Challakere, who was awarded two gold medals for emerging topper in B.Sc (Horticulture), is now pursuing M.Sc (Horticulture) and has also commenced preparations for the civil service exams. Darshan H.M. from Adichunchanagiri, who received two gold medals for his performance in B.Sc (Forestry), is now preparing for the Indian Forest Service (IFS) exam. He told The Hindu that as part of the course, he was involved in field work in Nagarahole and Anshi national parks. “I have also participated in tiger and elephant census. Conservation of forest and wildlife is necessary to maintain the ecological balance,” he said.

Mohammed Thamseer from Madikeri, who won two gold medals for his performance in B.Sc (Agriculture), is a good singer and has represented the university at many cultural festivals. At present, he is pursuing M.Sc (Agriculture) at Choudhary Charan Singh Haryana Agricultural University.

112,2020/02/29,Govt. to change rule on appointment of KKRDB chairman,"Deputy Chief Minister and Kalaburagi in charge Govind Karjol said that an appropriate amendment will be made to the relevant legislation to empower the government to appoint any legislator from Kalyana Karnataka as the Chairman of the Kalyana Karnataka Region Development Board (KKRDB).

As per the existing regulation in force, only a Minister who acts as the in-charge of any district in the region could be appointed to the post.

“We have already prepared the amendment which would allow the government to appoint any MLA or MLC from the region as chairman of the KKRDB. Soon after the completion of the Legislature session, a new chairman wïll be appointed and the development activities will be fast-tracked from April 1,” Mr. Karjol said while addressing a press conference in Kalaburagi on Friday.

When asked about the demand for raising the cap set for the procurement of red gram under the price support scheme, Mr. Karjol said that the State government had already written to Union government proposing the increase of the procurement quantity to 20 quintals a farmer.

“The Union government has given permission to procure 10.28 lakh tonnes at the minimum support price of ₹5,800. The State government will add ₹300 incentive to make the actual MSP ₹6,100. Thanks to the better rainfall in the red gram growing areas this year, the crop yield has increased. We have requested the Union government to proportionately increase the procurement quantity and I hope that the Centre will positively respond,” he said.

Considering the damage to roads and bridges in the floods, Mr. Karjol said that he had requested Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa to increase the budgetary allocation to ₹15,000 crore to the Public Works Department so that it could take up repair and reconstruction of infrastructure.

“Last year, the PWD had received ₹9,500 crore.

He was suffering from high fever from February 19. On February 26, he was admitted to a private hospital in Shivamogga for treatment and his blood samples tested positive for KFD the next day. As his condition worsened, it was decided to shift him to a private hospital in Manipal.

Kiran S.K., Deputy Director of Viral Diagnostic Laboratory (VDL), the main arm of the State government in tackling KFD, told The Hindu that the patient breathed his last on his way to Manipal. This is the second death reported due to KFD in Karnataka since January 1.

114,2020/02/29,Universities should help in raising farm productivity: NITI Aayog member,"Agriculture universities should strive to raise farm productivity in Karnataka, said Ramesh Chand, member of NITI Aayog and the 15th Finance Commission, on Saturday. He was speaking at the convocation of the University of Agricultural and Horticultural Sciences (UAHS) in Shivamogga.

Two-thirds of the cultivable land in Karnataka is rain-fed and lacks access to permanent irrigation facilities. Erratic rains and recurring droughts have made life miserable for farmers. In 2017-18, one hectare under cultivation in Karnataka yielded a crop output worth around ₹99,000, as against the national figure of ₹1.1 lakh. There is a huge potential to raise agriculture productivity and reach higher growth in the farm sector, he said. “Agriculture universities, policy-makers and farmers should work together to bring a complete turnaround in the sector,” he said.

The second crop is cultivated only on 23% of the cultivable area in the State. At present, the agriculture sector here is dominated by low-productivity crops. More than 40% of the timber requirement of the country is met through imports. It is an opportunity for States, including Karnataka, that have vast tracts of barren or unused land to take up cultivation of trees with timber value, he said.

Referring to the trend among engineering graduates of opting for managerial jobs, he said agriculture graduates should tread a similar path. As the sector is getting modernised and commercialised, there are good opportunities for talented youngsters in the agriculture business, which includes agro-processing and post-harvest value addition. Agriculture universities should offer short-duration courses in agri-business skills, Mr. Chand added.

Naik, Vice-Chancellor of the university, were present at the programme.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/varsities-should-help-in-raising-farm-productivity-in-karnataka/article30950251.ece

117,2020/02/29,FMCG distributors feel the heat of e-commerce giants,"After retail traders, it is the turn of distributors of fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) in Mysuru to feel the heat of competition generated by online shopping avenues of e-commerce giants.

e-commerce companies and hypermarket chains are luring not just customers with heavy discounts on a variety of FMCG and other items of daily use, but also retailers with huge cuts.

e-commerce giants like Amazon, Flipkart, Walmart, Udaan, and hypermarket chains like Reliance, Mega More and Big Bazaar are threatening the existence of traditional trading community including distributors, said Chethan, a distributor for edible oil in Mysuru and president of the Mysuru District Distributors’ Association (MDDA). “Ever since e-commerce companies and hypermarket chains began supplying goods even to retail shops in Mysuru at discounted prices, our sales have dwindled considerably,” he lamented. “How will we be able to sustain our business and meet our expenditure including the salaries we pay to our employees?”, said Sripathy, a distributor of deodorants, and joint treasurer of MDDA.

The MDDA, a representative body of more than 160 stockists and distributors in Mysuru, held a protest in front of Kote Anjaneya Swamy Temple in Mysuru on Friday before taking out a march to DC’s office to submit a memorandum. It demanded the constitution of a Trade Board at the national level to regulate discounts and pricing. “Like one nation one tax, there should be a uniform pricing policy across the country,” Mr. Chethan said.

The protest by MDDA has received support from the Wholesalers and Retailers, besides Mysuru City and District Retail Chemists’ Associations and Mysuru Chamber of Commerce and Industry (MCCI).

Even items of daily use like sugar and edible oil are being delivered by the e commerce giants and hypermarket chains to the doorstep of the buyer at a hugely discounted price, Mr Chethan said.

“Our inquiries with the manufacturers revealed that they are providing goods and products to them at the same rate. Yet, the e-commerce giants and hypermarket chains are offering huge discounts to the customers to grab the market and establish their monopoly”, he said.

It is not just the livelihood of the distributors and their families, which is at a risk, even their employees and their family members face a bleak future, he said.

In Mandya

Shopkeepers across Mandya staged a protest here on Friday to urge the Union government to ban online trading. According to them, e-commerce firms have badly affected the livelihood of small and medium-level traders across the country.

The traders closed their shops, assembled at Pete Beedi, and reached the office of Deputy Commissioner at a rally.

The agitators alleged that e-commerce giants like Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra and Snapdeal were affecting the revenue of traders and also violating laws pertaining to business activities.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/9bprb2/article30946640.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28BGMANDYAPROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/fmcg-distributors-feel-the-heat-of-e-commerce-giants/article30946641.ece

In an hour, the officer received 18 calls on information about various activities, including the illegal sale of liquor, illegal sand extraction, and police demanding money from truck drivers, among others.

The SP had appealed to the public to call him at his office between 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. on the day. People from Hassan town, parts of Arkalgud, Arsikere, and Alur taluks responded. He received the calls in the presence of Additional SP B.N. Nandini, Dy.SP Puttaswamy Gowda and other officers at his chamber.

A person from Hassan town told the SP that ganja was being made available in some parts in the city. The officer assured him of immediate action. Soon after answering the call, he directed his subordinates to work on this. A couple of people called up to inform the officer about the illegal sale of liquor and sand mining activities. A resident of Kattaya complained the SP that the policemen on highway patrol duty collect money from the trucks that carry vegetables to APMC market in the town every day. The SP instructed his officers to verify the issue.

There were three calls regarding the inconvenience caused to the business establishments on Kasturba Road and Subhash Square in Hassan, due to flower sellers who have put up their shops roadside. The SP said the issue could not be resolved by the police alone. It required the cooperation of the urban local body as well. He said he would personally visit the place in the evening to analyse the problem.

120,2020/02/29,Lakes in Mysuru taluk to be rejuvenated,"Project to lift water from KRS backwaters to fill tanks in villages begins

Many parched waterbodies in villages surrounding Mysuru city are expected to get back their lost glory as the project of filling up these tanks through lift irrigation, drawing water from the backwaters of Krishnaraja Sagar dam was launched on Friday.

Several lakes — once major water sources for the local community — had run dry owing to the obstruction in freshwater flow, encroachment of stormwater drains, and dumping of solid waste. Another reason for the depletion of water in tanks has been the drop in groundwater, according to authorities.

With the implementation of the lift irrigation project at Anandur village in the taluk, over a dozen tanks are expected to get water from the backwaters. The project will also help raise groundwater in and around the villages.

Minister in charge of Mysuru district V. Somanna and Minister for Law and Minor Irrigation J.C. Madhuswamy initiated the project at a programme organised at Yelachanahalli on the outskirts of Mysuru on Friday. As many as 16 tanks in 13 villages, including Erappanna Koppalu, Nagawala, Bommenahalli,, Hulilalu, Maratikyathanahalli and Dasanakoppal will be filled with the lift irrigation in Anandur. The project has been taken up at a cost of ₹50 crore. As part of it, water will be lifted from the backwaters 90 days a year (20 hours daily). A total of 87.73 million cubic feet of water will be lifted.

A pump house will be constructed by installing two heavy duty pumps of 525 HP capacity to transfer water to tanks through the 550 mm diameter pipelines to the distribution point located at a distance of 8.15 km from the source. The waterbodies that will benefit are: Karakanahalli lake, Karakanahalli katte, Erappanakoppal lake, Nagawala lake, Hulilalu lake, Huhilalu katte, Bommenahalli lake, Sahukarahundi lake, Sahukarahundi katte, Jettihundi lake, Shankarapura Hosahalli lake, Dasanakoppal lake, Maratikyathanahalli lake, Kergalli lake, Ijanahundi lake and Linganbudhi lake.

A second lift irrigation project at Anandur aims to fill up seven lakes in Maidanahalli, Megalapura, Yelwala, Gungral Chatra, Yelachanahalli and Chikkannahalli.

Addressing Mysuru Zilla Panchayat members and other representatives from local bodies, he said the CM has promised to consider his appeal though the grant allocation to Mysuru city may be reduced by half. Besides, an additional sum of ₹10 crore has been sought for diversion of sewage from the Kukkarahalli lake and its maintenance.

The Minister also gave his concurrence for the constitution of the district planning committee to consolidate plans prepared by the Panchayati Raj institutions and ULBs. He assured to take members’ feedback in the preparation of the plan and said that a meeting on the same would be held before March 31st. The members submitted a memorandum to him seeking a special package for the ZP with provision for local bodies at the grassroots.

Earlier in the day, Mr. Somanna visited Chamundi Hills to inspect infrastructure projects launched by the government and expressed confidence that they would be completed before March 31st. This includesthe construction of 196 permanent stalls to accommodate roadside vendors. Basic amenities including toilets and drinking water facilities have also been provided.

With regard to rehabilitation of the flood victims, the Minister said that in all, 3.5 lakh houses have been constructed and will be distributed to beneficiaries in due course. Initially, there were nearly 15 lakh applications seeking houses but on linking the BPL, APL and other documents the number of beneficiaries was trimmed to 6 lakh. Of these 3.5 lakh genuine cases have been identified and the stage is set for the distribution of the houses by June.

122,2020/02/29,Hope for Greater Mysuru plan,"There is a glimmer of hope for the realisation of Greater Mysuru entailing expanding the boundary of Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) by bringing 42 villages within its jurisdiction.

Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa has been apprised of this, said district in-charge Minister V. Somanna here on Friday. The concept has gained traction in recent weeks though it lay dormant for almost 10 years when it was first mooted.

Supporters of Greater Mysuru aver that it was necessary for the planned development of the city. The city, already witnessing an outward horizontal sprawl. New semi-urbanised villages were devoid of proper planning. If unresolved, Mysuru, among the first cities in India to have a separate board for planning — the City Improvement Trust Board, could see islands of planned development overrun by unplanned growth and squalor.

If approved and notified, the MCC limits will increase from 128 sq km to 298 sq km, bringing under the ambit GPs like Alanahalli, Hanchya, Kadakola, Ramanahalli, Srirampura, Jayapura, Bogadi, Hinkal, etc., some of which display a high degree of urbanisation.

123,2020/02/29,Jarkiholi urges farmers in Karnataka not to celebrate prematurely,"Even as there was an air of celebration over the notification of the Mahadayi verdict, Minister for Major and Medium Irrigation Ramesh Jarkiholi said on Friday that it was not yet time to rejoice as there were still several issues to be sorted out before work on the project could begin.

Responding to a felicitation by farmers at Sambra airport in Belagavi, he said, “There are many issues that need to be resolved still. Notification of award is only a preliminary step. I urge all my farmers not to celebrate the notification as yet.”

According to him, the government cannot take any decisive step before the Supreme Court gives a final judgment on the dispute. “A hearing is coming up on Monday. Let us wait at least till Monday,” he said. Goa has moved a special leave petition in the apex court pleading that Karnataka should not take up any civil works before the final judgment on the matter by the SC. This is scheduled to come up on Monday.

He said the notification should not be viewed as his personal victory or that of the State government. “It is the victory of farmers. And I consider farmers as one, whether they are from Karnataka, Goa or Maharashtra. The project will help all of them,” he said. Mr. Jarkiholi also said that he would go to Kanakumbi, the birthplace of the Mahadayi river near Khanapur.

Meanwhile, at Naragund in Gadag district, the epicentre of the indefinite agitation of farmers, crackers were burst and sweets distributed at the protest venue. The indefinite protest was launched in 2015 seeking a resolution to the long-pending dispute over the sharing of Mahadayi water and the Kalasa Banduri nala project.

Scores of organisations from different parts of the State, who had extended support to the agitation, came together to celebrate at different places, including Naragund, Navalgund, Gadag, Hubballi, Dharwad, Belagavi and other places.

124,2020/02/29,‘IOCL stations in Karnataka are BS VI compliant ahead of April deadline’,"All fuel stations of Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. (IOCL) in Karnataka are now BS VI compliant, ahead of the Petroleum Ministry’s mandatory fuel quality migration deadline of April 1, said D.L. Pramodh, the oil company’s executive director and head for Karnataka.

Karnataka has more than 4,000 fuel stations, of which 1,900 are of IOCL. In fact, IOCL will be investing ₹17,000 crore towards the upgrade of its refineries, pipelines, storage terminals and retail outlets across the country as part of its BS VI preparedness. This includes changing quality standards, implementing new technologies, systems and processes, and installing de-sulphurisation facilities.

“By complying with BS VI, India will leapfrog from BS IV without having gone into BS V. With this, the country is joining the lowest fuel sulphur club, the highest international standard for fuel quality as of now,” he told The Hindu. BS VI will have sulphur content of 10 ppm (parts per million), a reduction from 50 ppm sulphur content under the BS IV specification.

Commenting on the liquefied petroleum gas scenario in Karnataka, he said, “The LPG penetration in the State is absolutely 100% thanks to the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana. In 2014 it was only 68%, but things have changed in the last five years,” he said.

Karnataka currently has some 1.6 crore LPG connections, and 30% of them came through PMUY. Interestingly, each family gets 3.4 cylinders a year in the State, as against the national average of 2.88.

On the electric vehicle front, the company said it would be installing EV-charging infrastructure at 500 of its retail outlets. Some 50 fuel stations situated in Bengaluru, Mysuru, Hubballi, Bengaluru-Chennai highway, and Bengaluru-Mysuru highway will be part of this EV drive. “We have already entered into MoUs... for setting up electric vehicle charging service at Indian Oil ROs,” he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/iocl-stations-in-karnataka-are-bs-vi-compliant-ahead-of-april-deadline/article30946018.ece

The Chief Minister’s Office is reportedly set to take a call on a complaint to investigate “leaks” to the media and the Opposition allegedly from the police headquarters (PHQ) here.

A resident of Thrissur had complained to the State Police Chief that the public was concerned about the succession of indulgences from the police headquarters, which he claimed had imperilled the confidentiality of the law enforcement.

The complainant appeared to be miffed that Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala had flaunted documents pointing to alleged nepotism in the bid to contract a private firm to implement the proposed Centralised Intrusion Monitoring System (CIMS).

Cyclical news breaks

The police had also faced cyclical news breaks that appeared to portray higher-ups in an unflattering light.

With the Assembly session commencing on Monday, the government could politically ill afford to be buffeted by adverse reports against the Home department.

126,2020/02/29,Operators uneasy in Wayanad,"A slew of factors have taken a toll on their prospects

Recurring natural calamities, panic over COVID-19, night traffic ban on the Kozhikode-Kollegal National Highway 766, and closure of major ecotourism destinations under the Forest Department have cast a shadow over the tourism prospects of Wayanad.

“Tourism stakeholders faced massive cancellations from August to September last year owing to floods and are facing a similar situation since January owing to COVID-19,” P. Soman, a homestay owner at Cheeral, says.

“We got an average of 100 bookings a year till 2016-17. But it has declined to 25 to 30 now, thanks to floods in 2018 and 2019, Nipah outbreak in Kozhikode, Sabarimala issue, and finally COVID-19,” he said.

K.R. Vancheeswaran, president, Wayanad Tourism Organisation (WTO), says rain-related calamities in the past two years have scared off foreign and domestic tourists. “There was a decline in the arrival of tourists by 20 to 25% in the 2018-19 fiscal when compared to 2016-17,” he said. “However, the WTO has started organising roadshows in major metros to convince tourism operators that Wayanad is now a safe destination,” he said.

Major issues

The ban on tourists to the Soochipara waterfalls, Kuruva islets on the Kabani river, Chembra peak, and the Meenmutty waterfalls at Padinharethara, as per a High Court directive last year, has affected the industry.

Road connectivity issues and the night traffic ban on the Bandipur part of the Kozhikode-Kollegal National Highway 766 are the other dampeners.

DTPC initiatives

“We have started efforts to vacate the stay on ecotourism centres,” A. Anand, secretary, DTPC Wayanad, said.

He said the DTPC was planning to organise more destination-based events in the district, apart from travel marts and roadshows being organised by the Tourism Department to attract tourists. The DTPC would organise a ‘Fleamarket’, a ten-day event to provide night-life experience in Wayanad to attract more tourists, especially youths, to the destination.

The programme would be held at the Sulthan Bathery town square from April 4 to April 14, Mr. Anand said.

“Though there was a lull during the monsoon last year and the end of January after the COVID-19 scare, we expect the inflow of tourists to increase from the first week of April,” Mr. Vancheeswaran said.

“We hope that the proximity of the district to the Kannur and Mysuru airports will bring in more domestic and foreign tourists in the coming years,” he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/nj9igd/article30953248.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01tvwycoronachecking1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/operators-uneasy-in-wayanad/article30953247.ece
127,2020/02/29,When COVID-19 hit Kerala tourism,"COVID-19 has taken a toll on travel and tourism with a sharp decline in footfall and the industry facing job cuts and low margins. The Hindu takes a look.

Three persons testing positive for COVID-19 and declaration of the epidemic a “State calamity’ by the government have come as a bolt from the blue for the tourism industry. It came when the industry was on the recovery path after Cyclone Ockhi, Nipah outbreak, and floods in the past three years.

Though the government withdrew the calamity warning within five days and the scare that gripped the State is gradually dying down, tourism, one of the fast-growing sectors in Kerala, is at the crossroads.

With COVID-19 spreading to Europe, Middle East, and Latin America, holidayers, both domestic and international, have preferred to keep away from the destination and leisure tourism has almost been wiped off. There has been no recovery from the mass cancellations that poured into the reservation desks of hotels and resorts in the first week of February as soon as reports of positive cases came in.

The holidayers spotted at the destinations were mainly free independent travellers, Europeans who had prior bookings and preferred to fly down ignoring travel advisories, and those who came for wellness therapies.

Checks at airports

“Leisure tourism has been hit and it is one of the worst crisis faced by the tourism industry. Checking at the three international airports is creating panic. There is a feeling among both domestic and international tourists that Kerala is not safe to travel and holiday. Our occupancy that was 65% in March last year has gone down to 30% this year,” says Rajgopal Iyer H., CEO, UDS Hotels.

COVID-19 has taken its toll on the vibrant hospitality industry. Tourist arrivals have seen a sharp decline and the industry has faced job cuts and low margins. With holidayers preferring not to travel, online portals have been badly hit.

“Even domestic tourists are preferring to play it safe as the virus outbreak is spreading fast. Hoteliers are the worst hit as the operational cost has gone up and the tariff has not been hiked after the Nipah outbreak in 2018. There is retrenchment even in online portals.

Holidayers need assurance that the destination is safe to travel, which is missing,” sources in an online portal said.

The downturn has hit all categories of the hospitality industry, including hotels of the Kerala Tourism Development Corporation (KTDC), homestays, and MICE (meeting, incentive, cConvention, exhibition). Even prime properties of the KTDC, such as Tea County and Bolghatty, have been hit, with the dip in occupancy during the January 15-February period hovering at 25 to 30%. However, Samudra property in Kovalam has bucked the trend.

“The situation is alarming as no further enquiries are reaching the reservation desks. The booking window is 30 to 45 days. March and April are going to be worse going by the feedback from hotels, resorts, and tour operators. The outbreak in the Middle East is also a concern as the airports in Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Doha are hub for travelling to Europe and the U.S,” says Dillep Kumar P.I., CEO, Intimice Hospitalities.

The peak season for foreign tourists is from November to February and for domestic guests from April-May, August-September (Onam festival), and December-January.

Minister positive

Tourism Minister Kadakampally Surendran admits that there have been more cancellations after reports of COVID-19 than in the case of the Nipah outbreak. Braving odds, the tourism sector registered 70% growth in the past four years. The revenue has gone up from ₹26,689.63 crore in 2015 to ₹45,242.74 crore in 2019.

Mr. Iyer said the State should have avoided the ‘calamity’ tag as it triggered panic and negatively impacted the industry. “It will take time to bounce back. The government should spread the message that Kerala is safe. Local media in other States should be used to promote the destination . Reduction in room tariff is not a solution,” he added.

However, senior vice president, Indian Association of Tour Operators, and chairperson, Confederation of Tourism Industry, Kerala, E.M. Najeeb says the State calamity declaration helped to prevent the infection from spreading and confine it to those who returned from Wuhan.

New marketing strategy

“It is a serious situation and people will avoid India and Kerala like other places where positive cases have been reported. The government should take steps to instil confidence among travellers that Kerala is safe for holidaying. Marketing strategy needs a shift and new source markets need to be tapped for Kerala,” Mr. Najeeb said.

Marketing of Kerala Tourism should focus on domestic tourists as there is no point in promoting the destination abroad as the virus outbreak is spreading fast. Instead of concentrating on tour operators and travel agents, Mr. Dileep says domestic roadshows should concentrate on corporate clients as they will help incentive tours and MICE tourism. “Kerala Tourism has been able to overcome challenges over the years through marketing strategies and this will be resorted to overcome the present crisis as well,” Mr. Surendran said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/chzplp/article30953219.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01tvHealthdesk,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/tourism-in/article30953215.ece
128,2020/02/29,Tourism yet to be back on rails in Idukki,"Governmental efforts sought to promote destinations in district

The travails of the tourism sector started with the floods in 2018 that dampened the spirit of the neelakurinji flowering season in the Munnar hills. Though the season was scheduled to start by August end, it got delayed and all efforts to revive it went awry.

Much of the hotel bookings for the season were cancelled. The government abruptly announced an end of the neelakurinji season in October-end that year. The floods also damaged the roads, negatively impacting the tourism sector.

The main attractions in Munnar are the winter season, with the temperature dropping to sub-zero levels, and the monsoon season, when heavy rain lash the hills. For the past two years, there was only tepid response from tourists to the charms of the hill station.

The manager of a hotel in Munnar said a change in climate was evident at the hill destination. Unlike in the past, the temperature dropped to sub-zero level this year only once or twice in February and the winter season too was delayed. Usually, frost was experienced by the first week of January.

Under stress

Munnar Hotel and Resorts Association president V.V. George said the tourism sector was under tremendous stress. The frequent travel curbs on Gap Road did not do any good for tourism in Munnar. He said the climate this year was clear without much cloud and frost.

He called for governmental efforts to promote the destination in foreign countries.

“In addition to the other factors, the change in climate also had a role in reducing the arrival of tourists to Thekkady. It is true that some of the bookings have been cancelled following the COVID-19 scare,” said Jayan P .Vijayan, secretary, District Tourism Promotion Council.

He said COVID-19 had a negative impact on the tourism sector.

Kumily, a town close to Thekkady, is dependent on tourism. Many hotels were closed for days after the 2018 floods and last year too. “There is a downward trend in tourism at Thekkady in terms of the arrival of both domestic and foreign tourists. Over the past three years there has been a continuous drop in hotel bookings, especially group bookings,” said a travel agent.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/telajz/article30953190.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01tvPTRboatlanding,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/tourism-yet-to-be-back-on-rails-in-idukki/article30953189.ece
129,2020/02/29,Backwater tourism facing headwinds,"COVID-19 has brought industry reeling under back-to-back floods to its knees

Tough times don’t last — but not for everyone. After enduring difficulties, one after another in recent years, the backwater tourism sector has found itself facing headwinds with a downturn in tourism activity.

The woebegone sight of submerged houses and people being rescued in houseboats from Kuttanad during the great deluge of 2018 won’t be forgotten any time soon.

The floods had brought the industry, already gasping for breath after Cyclone Ockhi and Nipah outbreak, to a grinding halt with zero visitors in the weeks and months following it.

When it seemed to be slowly limping back to normality, the 2019 floods brought further pain to the sector. COVID-19 was the last thing the industry needed.

Many cancellations

“The COVID-19 scare and the subsequent declaration of State calamity stemmed the tourist flow and led to large-scale cancellations in February. Compared to the corresponding period the previous year, business is down by more than 50%. In our hotel, around 60% of rooms are lying vacant,” says Tomy Thomas, managing director, Arcadia Regency.

Houseboat owners say they are finding it difficult to keep the business afloat in the face of recurring setbacks. Houseboats do the majority of business during the peak tourism season between November and February.

“The Nipah outbreak and back-to-back floods had left the houseboat industry tottering. COVID-19 is the final nail in the coffin. It has resulted in at least 60% cancellations in February. Even domestic tourists are skipping the destination. In peak season, on average, we get 25 to 28 trips a month. Contrary to expectations, a large number of boats remain at anchor for the past several days without guests. But, we are still obliged to pay tax and salaries to employees, making the business unsustainable,” says, K. Vijayan, secretary, All Kerala Houseboats Owners Association.

Kevin Rosario, general secretary, All Kerala Houseboat Owners and Operators Samiti, said the houseboat sector witnessed 50 to 70% cancellations in February alone following the COVID-19 scare. He put the average loss suffered by a houseboat owner due to the decline in activity at ₹1.2 lakh.

Job potential

Around 8,000 people are attached directly with the industry and many thousands indirectly. The houseboat owners have urged the government to market the destination as a safe and responsible host. “Better marketing can reverse the trend and help revive the sector. Besides, the government should initiate steps to prevent another flood in the region. ,” Mr. Vijayan says.

T.G.

130,2020/02/29,"As fire risk lurks, Wayanad ecotourism centres to be closed to tourists","Move to ensure trouble-free movement of migrating wild animals

The Forest and Wildlife Department is preparing to close ecotourism centres in Wayanad district for a short while to ensure trouble-free movement of migrating wild animals and to avert the outbreak of forest fires.

Ecotourism centres at Muthanga and Tholpetty in Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary will be closed to visitors from Sunday following high fire risk. The ecotourism centres under the North Wayanad forest division have already been closed since February 10. “Scanty summer showers and dried vegetation have heightened the fire risk in most protected areas of the district, especially the forest areas adjacent to the tiger reserves in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka,” North Wayanad Divisional Officer Ramesh Bishnoi told The Hindu.

Restriction on tourism activities and curbs on visitors had been enforced at the four ecotourism centres under the North Wayanad Forest Division, including Chirappullu near Vellamunda, Meenmutty waterfalls near Makkiyad, Brahmagiri near Thirunelly, and Muneeswaran Kunnu near Thalapuzha, to minimise risk of fire, said Mr. Bishnoi. The centres would remain closed to tourists till the forest fire risk subsided, he added.

The Soochipara waterfalls, Kuruva islets on the Kabani, Chembra peak, and the Meenmutty waterfalls at Padinharethara, under the South Wayanad forest division have been closed for past one year as per a direction of the Kerala High Court.

The ecotourism centres under the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary will be closed from March 1 to April 15 as per the direction of the Principal Chief Forest Conservator (Wildlife), said sanctuary warden P.K. Asiff. The restriction had been imposed considering security reasons and to ensure trouble-free migration of animals, he added.

“Seasonal wildlife migration from the nearby Bandipur Tiger Reserve in Karnataka and the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve in Tamil Nadu to the sanctuary has increased considerably owing to the dry spell in those regions,” said Mr. Assif. The Department had made highly structured measures to ensure the availability of fodder and water and protection measures for migrating animals, he added.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/4x5q6p/article30953129.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01tvwyelephantbreakingelectricfence,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/as-fire-risk-lurks-wayanad-ecotourism-centres-to-be-closed-to-tourists/article30953130.ece
131,2020/02/29,A film lacking subtlety and finesse,"Too much of violence and gore and an unconvincing script tire out the audience

Some opening sequences provide one a pretty accurate picture of the tone and tenor of the whole movie. Forensic opens with a rather loud, in-your-face sequence that could have become a chapter titled ‘childhood of a serial killer'.

A young boy is at a chicken shop, peering intently at the flesh being cut into pieces.

The setting and the background music tells you that this is no look of curiosity, but one with a touch of evil. The following scene which shows his collection of severed chicken heads, frogs and other insects kept in glass jars in his room seals it. This lack of subtlety is something which pops its head often in the narrative.

Forensic, directed by Akhil Paul and Anas Khan, follows the mysterious disappearances of young girls from a city. Police officer Rithika Xavier (Mamta Mohandas) gets entrusted with the investigation. Medico-legal advisor Samuel John Kattukaran (Tovino Thomas), with whom she shares some uncomfortable history, joins her in the pursuit.

Red herring

The writers invest much of their effort in misleading us about the true identity of the serial killer, throwing at us one red herring after another.

So, when close to the interval, the identity is provided to us on a platter, one can easily see through the game, of them setting up the whole thing to make the end reveal on a seemingly inconsequential character. These attempts at surprising the audience get tiring after a point that one does not feel much when the final reveal happens.

Though a lack of motive is certainly a kind of mandatory requirement for serial killers, the incidents that work as a trigger for the person to go on a killing spree hardly appear convincing here.

The only thing that keeps our interest even mildly alive till then is the way the forensic expert works out some of the clues leading to the killer. The downplaying of the heroic elements and the care taken in not slipping in a needless romantic track are to the credit of the writers.

Some of the violence, especially those inflicted on children, are quite disturbing. One wished the makers were a little more sensitive in such cases, for thrills and chills can be created without actually showing that much amount of gore involving minors.

The same has to be said about the relentless background score, which forces one to shield the ears at more than one point.

Forensic lacks the subtlety and finesse that separates the more effective police procedurals from the also rans.

Vilangan Kunnu, a panoramic hillock near Thrissur city, which is referred to as the ‘Oxygen Jar’ of Thrissur, has in place a slew of new facilities for tourists.

With summer vacation round the corner, the Tourism Department has developed the centre at a cost of ₹2 crore. The renovated site has two separate sections for children. One section is a ‘non-electric’ park with swings and slides. Entry to the other section, which has giant wheels and other games, is restricted with fees.

View of kole fields

Situated just 8 km away from the city at Adattu panchayat, the hillock gives an excellent view of the city and its vast kole fields.

Situated around a height of 80 metres from the sea level, the hill was earlier a military observation camp. Vilangan Kunnu has an open theatre, Kudumbashree canteen, and a trekking path. Asokavanam, a medicinal garden, is being maintained by Vilangan Trekkers Club and Asokavanam Samity in association with the Tourism Department and Oushadi.

The hillock has a watchtower with binoculars, a resting room, pavilion and a snacks bar.

Facilities

Five new resting places have been built at strategic view points and new benches have been added, along with electric lamps with solar panels.

New illustrations and paintings have been put up and existing sculptures given a facelift.

Hundreds of members of the Jacobite faction of the Malankara Church marched to the office of the District Police Chief (Rural) K. Karthik on Saturday, alleging that the faction was being “denied justice” by the State administration and the police.

A spokesman for the Jacobite group said Mr. Karthik had promised the protesters that their grievances would be looked into. The spokesman alleged that the government and the police were using force to evict them from parish churches to which they were entitled under the cover of the Supreme Court verdict of July 2017. Metropolitan trustee of the Jacobite church Joseph Mar Gregorios was among the church leaders who joined the protest march at Aluva on Saturday.

Earlier in the day, leaders of the Jacobite church met at Aluva to discuss the state of affairs and to chalk out the future course of action in the wake of the State government showing more urgency in handing over parish church administration to the Orthodox group.

The meeting of the Jacobite group and its public protest follow the State administration’s efforts to implement a Supreme Court verdict banning all parallel administration of Malankara churches and handing over control of all parishes to the Orthodox group.

The deceased persons have been identified as Sherin, 44, Mukkoottuthara; Gireesh, 55, Thiruvananthapuram; and Yohannan, 23, Thottakkad.

According to reports, the three persons, one woman and two men, had earlier been undergoing treatment at Puthujeevan Trust Hospital for Psychological Medicine and De-addiction.

Sherin collapsed while being shifted to a nearby hospital last Sunday.

Gireesh, who was hospitalised with symptoms of an infectious disease, died on Wednesday at a private hospital in Thiruvalla. Yohannan was referred from a private hospital at Thiruvalla to Government Medical College Hospital, Kottayam, on Thursday night and died on Saturday morning.

Local people protest

Six residents of the centre have been admitted to the Kottayam Government Medical College Hospital. Another resident was discharged on Saturday after undergoing treatment at the Thrissur Government Medical College Hospital. Following the incident, local residents staged a protest against the centre, demanding action against its director V.C. Joseph.

In the wake of the deaths at the centre, a team of doctors led by District Medical Officer (DMO) Jacob Varghese visited the hospital on Wednesday and Thursday.

“Examination of their medical samples at the National Institute of Virology, Alappuzha, has ruled out diseases like Nipah, COVID-19, H1N1, leptospirosis and dengue fever,” the DMO said.

Toxicology tests

An autopsy of Sherin’s body attributed her death to myocarditis while Yohannan died of pneumonia.

Medical samples of Yohannan have been sent to the Amrita Institute of Medical Science, Kochi, for toxicology tests.

Health Minister K.K. Shylaja has directed the Principal Secretary, Health, to probe the incident.

She said that an investigation had been launched upon the reporting of the first death itself. Relatives of the second victim turned down the request for an autopsy. A strict directive to conduct autopsy was issued as soon as the third incident came to light.

Forensic team

“That the deaths were not due to COVID-19 became evident during a primary examination itself. A detailed investigation has been ordered to ascertain the actual cause of these deaths. A medical board led by Renju Raveendran, forensic head of the Kottayam medical college, has been constituted to probe the incidents. Blood samples have been sent to the forensic laboratory,” Ms. Shylaja said.

District Collector P.K. Sudheer Babu said the examination of samples collected from those under treatment had confirmed that it was not a case of COVID-19 outbreak.

He said that he had directed Additional District Magistrate Anil Oommen to look into the details.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/de-addiction-centre-deaths-to-be-probed/article30953056.ece

137,2020/02/29,Police officers lauded for selfless efforts,"Cash awards for Pathanapuram SHO M. Anwar and Konni civil police officer Subeek Raheem

State Police Chief Loknath Behera has lauded the selfless efforts of two police officers who made the Kerala Police proud by going beyond the call of their duties.

Pathanapuram station house officer M. Anwar and civil police officer Subeek Raheem, attached to the Konni police station, came in for rich plaudits for their service.

Mr. Anwar did not think twice before jumping into the Valathukara canal in Pathanapuram to retrieve a dead body after a few labourers had demanded ₹2,000 to get the job done. An autorickshaw driver Shafeeq also lent the officer a helping hand to bring the corpse to land.

Mr. Raheem has been credited for his noble gesture of helping an emaciated beggar whom he found lying on a street. After bathing him and providing him food, the civil police officer took him to an old-age home. Mr. Behera has announced rewards of ₹2,000 and ₹500 respectively for their efforts.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/police-officers-lauded-for-selfless-efforts/article30952863.ece

Religious fervour and gaiety marked the Kumbha Bharani festival at the Chettikulangara Devi temple, near Mavelikara, on Saturday.

A large number of devotees from across the State and outside turned up at Chettikulangara to have a glimpse of the ‘kuthiyottam' performance and ‘kettukazhcha’ pageant.

Festive mood

The rituals and pujas that commenced on Sivaratri reached their crescendo on the festival day with all 13 ‘karas’ (provinces) that are part of the temple joined in a festive mood.

Boys aged between 8 and 12 performed kuthiyottam in the presence of devotees in the morning.

Kettukazhcha

Gigantic temple cars known as ‘kuthira’ (horse motifs), ‘theru’ (chariots) and mammoth idols of Bheema and Hanuman, were drawn to the temple from the 13 ‘karas’ — Erezha South, Erezha North, Kaitha South, Kaitha North, Kannamangalam South, Kannamangalam North, Pela, Kadavoor, Anjilipra, Mattom North, Mattom South, Menampilly and Nadakkavu.

139,2020/02/29,KLDB to conserve indigenous breeds,"Plan to develop breeds that can adapt to changing weather

The Kerala Livestock Development Board (KLDB) will be upgraded as centre of excellence for conserving indigenous breeds, said Minister for Animal Husbandry K. Raju here on Saturday.

Inaugurating KLDB’s indigenous cow hub project at the Oachira Parabrahma temple ground, he said the government had been implementing many projects to ensure the comprehensive development of agriculture in the Onattukara region.

“Currently there is a dip in the number of indigenous breeds and the government is trying to address the issue. Along with implementing the new breeding policy, discussions are on to develop breeds that can adapt to the changing weather conditions of Kerala,” he said.

The KLDB is currently distributing frozen semen of Vechur and Kasaragod Dwarf bulls to all artificial insemination centres in the State to conserve the breeds.

As part of the efforts to protect indigenous breeds, a large number of Vechur calves were produced in 2017 at Kayamkulam in connection with a special project and the KLDB has been buying calves from there.

Embryo transfer

In a bid to increase the number of Vechur and Sahiwal breeds, the board is also implementing an embryo transfer programme. The Centre had sanctioned ₹2.48 crore for the project which started in 2018 at Mattupatty and six calves were born as part of the project. “Onattukara will be developed as a cow hub by systematically increasing the number of indigenous breeds,” the Minister said. He handed over indigenous calves, free fodder and financial assistance for renovating cattle sheds to the beneficiaries of the project. R. Ramachandran, MLA, presided over the function.

He was inaugurating the first Janakeeya Bhakshanasala (food court) in the State under the programme for providing meals at ₹25 at Mannancherry, near here, on Saturday. In the State Budget 2020-21, the government has announced that 1,000 food courts will be started for providing food at ₹25 under the aegis of the Kudumbashree Mission.

141,2020/02/29,Pinarayi declares completion of two lakh houses,"Chandran, Omana and their young daughter Rohini have been living for years in their leaking one-room house before their names were included in the State government's Livelihood, Inclusion, Financial Empowerment (LIFE) housing scheme. On Saturday, when Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan handed over the keys of their new house at Enikkara, their happiness was representative of two lakh other families in the State who have got houses under the LIFE scheme.

Later, at the Putharikkandam Maidan here, packed with LIFE beneficiaries from across Thiruvananthapuram, Mr. Vijayan made the official declaration of the scheme, saying it was a tribute to the efficiency of LIFE Mission that the number has now increased to 2,14,262 houses.

“In villages and towns across the State, today is a day of celebration for numerous families for whom a house of their own has always been a long-held dream. Today, we saw tears of joy and satisfaction on many eyes,” he said.

On the funds of the Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana (PMAY) being used for around 63,000 of these houses, he said the State had contributed a larger share of funds. For the PMAY-LIFE (rural), the Centre had provided ₹75,000 for each beneficiary, while the State pitched in with ₹3.25 lakh. For the PMAY-LIFE (urban), the Centre provided ₹1.5 lakh, while the State contributed ₹2.5 lakh. ""But, in our State, we were able to complete the houses because everyone, the rich and the poor from society contributed. There were many who helped in the construction of houses in several areas, offering their labour for free. There is Tamil Nadu native Abdullah, a groundnut seller who has now settled at Kadakkal, who bought a piece of land and contributed it for the LIFE project. It is the unity of this State that has made this milestone possible,"" said Mr. Vijayan.Mr. Vijayan said that no one will be left out of the project, as those who did not find a place in the list due to technical reasons will be included in the succeeding phases.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/liwmxc/article30953699.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH29KRAPINARAYI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cm-declares-completion-of-two-lakh-houses/article30952001.ece
142,2020/02/29,Ban on campus politics unfortunate: Speaker,"‘Will taken up issue with Chief Justice’

Speaker P. Sreeramakrishnan has said the recent High Court order banning political activity on campuses of educational institutions is “unfortunate” and that the issue will be taken up with the Chief Justice.

“What India today is, to a good extent, the way student politics churned out on campuses. I feel it should continue and for that I will contact the Chief Justice,” he said replying to queries at a press conference convened here on Saturday in connection with the Assembly session beginning on March 2.

To another query, the Speaker said the inquiry by the Legislature Secretary confirmed that the CAG audit report on the social and general sector during the 2013-18 period had not ‘leaked’ after reaching the Assembly.

The CAG report was tabled in the Assembly on February 12 and the Speaker had earlier said that there were valid reasons to draw the inference that the CAG report was leaked before it was tabled in the Assembly. On further inquiry, the Speaker said it was for the government to decide.

Congress legislator P.T. Thomas had levelled serious corruption allegations against the State Police in the Assembly on February 11. The CAG report tabled the next day contained damning revelations of corruption and financial irregularities in the police force.

The Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB) had not approached the Speaker seeking permission for the arrest of former Public Works Minister V.K. Ebrahim Kunju and the former Health Minister V.S. Sivakumar, he said replying to another query.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ban-on-campus-politics-unfortunate-speaker/article30951530.ece
143,2020/02/29,It’s a political gimmick: Chennithala,"‘1.1 lakh of 2 lakh houses have nothing to do with Life Mission’

Terming the State government’s claim of completing two lakh houses under the Life Mission a big lie, Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala has accused the Left Democratic Front regime of misleading the people for political gains.

Addressing mediapersons here on Saturday, Mr. Chennithala pointed out that construction of about 52,000 houses, among the two lakh buildings, had been completed during the tenure of the last United Democratic Front government.

‘‘While the government claims to have completed two lakh houses under the scheme, the official figures released by it put the number at 1.73 lakh,’’ Mr. Chennithala said.

Similarly, 55,000 houses constructed under a Central government housing scheme, which has been implemented as a separate project, too have been included under the Life Mission project. ‘‘This means about 1.1 lakh out of the total two lakh houses constructed in Kerala have nothing to do with the Life Mission,’’ he said.

Utilisation of funds

A closer scrutiny of the government’s claims further reveals that 20% of the Plan funds of all local bodies had been diverted to the scheme. Similarly, a fund of ₹885 crore received from the Centre under the Pradhan Manthri Awaz Yojna too had been used up for it, alongside a loan availed from the Housing and Urban Development Corporation (HUDCO).

‘‘Of the ₹4 lakh spent on each house, ₹2 lakh belonged to the Plan funds of the local body concerned while ₹1 lakh was from HUDCO. This makes the actual allocation of the State government towards each house just ₹1 lakh,’’ he said.

KPCC chief

Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee president Mullappally Ramachandran described Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan as a person habituated to making tall claims. He could not complete even half the number of housing units, over four lakh, delivered during the time of the Oommen Chandy government. Mr. Vijayan had shamelessly claimed credit for UDF schemes such as the Kochi metro project and the Kannur airport.

Mr. Vijayan had slammed Sashi Tharoor, MP, and Mr Chennithala for skipping the function marking the completion of the second phase of the LIFE Mission project.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/asmcnv/article30951463.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01TVTVUDFDHARNA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/its-a-political-gimmick-chennithala/article30951464.ece
144,2020/02/29,VACB closer to charging Kunju,"Agency questions him for four hours in Palarivattom flyover case

The Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB) on Saturday appeared to have moved closer to indicting former Public Works Minister V.K. Ebrahim Kunju for corruption in the shoddy construction of the recently decommissioned four-lane flyover bridge at Palarivattom in Kochi.

The Indian Union Muslim League legislator presented himself before anti-corruption investigators here at 11 a.m., and they questioned him for nearly four hours. The VACB is probing Mr. Kunju on suspicion of having used public funds and political heft to aid the private builder responsible for the hazardous construction.

The Oommen Chandy government had touted the flyover project as one of its flagship projects. However, the Pinarayi Vijayan government found the construction fractured and dangerous to public safety and ordered an anti-corruption inquiry.

Rationale questioned

Investigators reportedly asked Mr. Kunju about the rationale for having extended a ₹9-crore low-interest loan to the builder. The government had no contractual obligation to extend the ""advance mobilisation fund"" to the builder from the public exchequer. The terms of the loan were advantageous to the private entity. The government had charged the builder a nominal rate of interest much less than that billed by nationalised banks.

The ""largesse"" had resulted in the treasury losing an estimated ₹60 lakh, according to the VACB. Mr. Kunju was reportedly unfazed during the interview. He responded to the pre-set questions in a slow and measured tone. However, the investigators felt the answers did not always add up. Mr. Kunju reportedly averred that he had accorded administrative sanction for the flyover given the pressing need to alleviate the traffic congestion in Kochi. He wanted the project completed expeditiously and tried to avoid red tape.

He went by the counsel he received from Public Works Department officials and was hard-pressed as Minister to verify the quality and pace of work at the field level. He relied on reports sent to him up the chain of governance.

Earlier, the agency had arrested former Public Works Secretary T.O. Sooraj, the private contractor and three other officials in connection with the construction scam. Mr. Sooraj's statements had brought the probe to Mr. Kunju's doorstep.

The Vigilance directorate will vet Mr. Kunju's responses and determine its future course of action.

Speaker P. Sreramakrishnan said the VACB had not sought his permission for the arrest of Mr. Kunju and former Health Minister V.S. Sivakumar.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/gwtvj3/article30953669.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH29KRANEWIBRAHIMKUNJU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/vacb-appears-closer-to-charging-kunju/article30951348.ece

146,2020/02/29,Fighting blaze at Brahmapuram an uphill task: report,"‘Brahmapuram plant lacks proper road access for free movement of fire tenders’

The 100-odd firefighters who battled a major blaze at the Brahmapuram dumping yard on February 18 faced five crucial challenges while trying to douse the flames, according to a report released by the Department of Fire and Rescue Services.

The waste dump spread over 30 acres lacked adequate road access for free movement of fire tenders.

Shortage of water

Firefighting was hit by shortage of uninterrupted water supply. The solid waste treatment plant lacks permanent firefighting equipment. Moreover, tools for turning waste heaps to contain fire were not available.

The construction of walls hampered drawing of water from the nearby Kadambrayar, said the report, which was submitted to the District Collector.

The report came up with six recommendations for immediate implementation, including construction of eight-metre wide roads around the plant and seven-metre-wide ones within the plant. It suggested that legacy waste be divided into heaps of 1,000 square metres each, besides ensuring adequate number of roads on four sides.

A ring main should be set up for effective distribution of water in an emergency, while yard hydrants should be installed in every 45 metres. Ring main refers to a primary loop that is connected to the pumps so that there are two routes for water to flow in case one side gets blocked.

Fire pumps

Fire pumps with 2,850 LPM (flow rate of water in litres per minute) should be set up, with the farthest pump having a 3.5 bar (energy with which the water will hit the surface).

A static tank that can provide water for four hours uninterrupted has to be set up at the site.

An open water source has to be developed near the main gate of the plant.

Corporation employees have to be posted for security, and regular police patrolling should be ensured, according to the report.

The massive operation at Brahmapuram began at 2.34 p.m. on February 18 and ended at 9 a.m. on February 20.

The operation was led by K.K. Shiju, Regional Officer, Fire and Rescue Services, Ernakulam, and A.S. Gogy, District Fire Officer.

As many as 15 fire tenders and high-power equipment from stations at Kottayam and Alappuzha were pressed into service.

Forty cleaning staffers under the Kochi Corporation aided the operation. By 4 p.m. on February 19, several firemen fainted after experiencing dehydration and breathlessness caused by the thick smoke billowing out of waste heaps.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/jtvv/article30946886.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ki28fire,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/fighting-blaze-at-brahmapuram-an-uphill-task-report/article30946887.ece

A single judge of the Kerala High Court turned down the petition of the 28 students of the Arooja’s Little Star School, Moolamkuzhi, Kochi, seeking permission to appear for the remaining CBSE examinations for Class 10. The examinations began on February 24.

The petitioners could not appear for the exams as the school did not have the affiliation of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE). The court pointed out that the prayer of the petitioners could not be entertained at this stage as the school lacked the affiliation of the board for conducting Class 9 examinations. There has been serious lapses on the part of the school authorities and the CBSE, the court observed while expressing its concerns for the students.

The petitioners submitted that the students, who trusted the school authorities, waited for their hall tickets to appear for the exams. However, it was only a few days before the exams that the parents came to know that the school did not get the hall tickets from the board and the school never had any CBSE affiliation.

Case on March 4

Although the coronavirus (COVID-19) threat has, to an extent, diminished in the State, the Health Department has no plans to withdraw the alert for now, Health Minister K.K. Shylaja said on Friday.

“At the moment, we don't have an alarming situation. But we have decided to continue surveillance as more countries, Iran for instance, have reported outbreaks. There have also been deaths.

150,2020/02/29,HC orders CB probe into Karakkonam medical college scam,"Cases registered against college authorities, including director Bennett Abraham and Bishop Rasalam

The Kerala High Court has ordered a Crime Branch probe into the complaints that the management of the Dr. Somervell Memorial CSI Medical College, Karakkonam, cheated several people and collected huge sums by offering admission at the medical college.

It was on a batch of petitions from the parents of some students that the court ordered the probe.

Though the police had registered cases against college director Bennett Abraham and CSI Moderator Bishop A. Dharmmaraj Rasalam in three police stations, the investigation did not progress as the accused were very influential people. according to the petitioners.

The accused, who are the college authorities, took huge amounts from them and others promising to give MBBS admission to their wards in the medical college and cheated them without giving admission, they said.

No seats, no money

When the college authorities failed to give admissions as promised, the petitioners demanded the money back, However, the money was not returned, they submitted.

The petitioners submitted that the accused had collected huge amounts from the parents of other students too by promising to give admission to MBBS seats in their college and cheated them. Though crimes were registered against the accused, no investigation was conducted, they submitted. The petitioners further submitted that the police initially refused to register complaints against the accused. It was after a magistrate court’s order that the police registered a crime against the college authorities.

The accused in the case were highly influential people and the State police machinery would not conduct an effective investigation against them, they feared.

According to the petitioners, who had approached the court for a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation, the complaints filed with the Chief Minister, Home Secretary, Director General of Police and District Police Chief failed to evoke any response.

While ordering the Crime Branch probe, the court also directed that the cases registered in different police stations be transferred to the agency.

Panel report

The Admission and Supervisory Committee for Medical Education in Kerala, chaired by former Kerala High Court judge R. Rajendra Babu, had recommended that the government initiate criminal proceedings against Bishop Rasalam, Mr. Abraham, and others.

151,2020/02/29,Inventory of sacred ornaments taken,"Move follows apex court directive

Former judge of the Kerala High Court C.N.Ramachandran Nair, along with a team of jewellery appraisers and assistants, inspected the sacred jewellery (Thiruvabharanam) of the presiding deity of the Sabarimala Ayyappa temple at the Pandalam Srambickal palace on Friday.

The Supreme Court had directed him to prepare an inventory of the ornaments and submit a report in four weeks.

The apex court’s directive followed an alleged dispute between two branches of the royal family of erstwhile Pandalam kingdom, which is the custodian of the sacred ornaments.

Mr. Nair reached the palace in the forenoon. Palace managing committee members P.G. Sasikumar Varma, P.N. Narayana Varma, and Deepa Varma received him and handed over the jewel boxes for verification.

The team ascertained the quality, quantity, and purity of the jewellery using electronic equipment.

Report soon

Mr. Nair later informed the media that his job was over and he would submit the report at the earliest. “Now, I will submit my report in a sealed cover to the Supreme Court. In my stocktaking, I was assisted by jewellery experts and we did everything using electronic devices,” said Mr. Nair, adding he was happy with the security arrangements in place for the ornaments.

A Bench of Justices N.V. Ramana, Ajay Rastogi, and V. Ramasubramanian on February 7 directed Mr. Nair to complete the inventory report and submit it to the Supreme Court Bench.

152,2020/02/29,"Bharat AirFibre, IPTV services launched","Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited’s (BSNL) Bharat AirFibre service across India was launched here on Friday by Vivek Banzal, Director (CFA), BSNL Board.

Thus, Kochi becomes the first city in India to have the service. The Bharat AirFibre network is a break from the conventional fibre-cable connection and provides high-speed Internet connection using radio waves.

Mr. Banzal also launched the BSNL’s Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) service in the State at the function. Apart from voice and data, TV channels too will be available through IPTV service.

Better services

He said the BSNL was striving to make available better facilities to consumers at a reasonable tariff through these services.

“Bharat AirFibre is a system whereby different utilities in houses and offices can be operated through a single fibre connection. They include monitoring/controlling of security cameras and lights. This concept of smart homes will be attainable in another couple of months through the connection. This is a paradigm shift in the ecosystem, where multiple aspects are covered by a single system, including through artificial intelligence. This is just a beginning of changes taking place in the BSNL stable,” he said.

The wireless system cannot be relied on at all times in all places, even within the same building. But Bharat AirFibre will ensure much higher reliability, he added.

153,2020/02/29,Lending online support,"CSIE is a unique platform that hosts a variety of programmes to support students across the board

Just a few months before college was to get over, it struck Jose Rohan that his project that could prevent motorcycle accidents may actually solve the problems of the public. However, once project submissions were over, they were just thrown away. Inspired to put the projects into use for the benefit of communities, he founded the Chennai Society of Inventors and Eco-Freaks (CSIE).

“I want to connect local inventors with communities in need and be a platform for bringing great inventions to common people, at the same time increase awareness about climate change among people,” he says.

At work

Today, the CSIE consists of over 15 members, a mix of engineering students and recent graduates, who have just started working. So far, they have released two magazines, “How to Invent”, and “Saving Planet Earth”, which educates people on how to invent and tinker with great products, as well as how to live a minimalist life. They also regularly post on social media, calling attention to problems such as empty ATMs and their identification.

However, their biggest project has been their website, “lostfoundtn.com”, that was started recently. Users can log in here and post items that they have lost, and other users can put up items that they have found, to help retrieve lost items and restore found items to their owners. “If a person finds a wallet, it become easier for him to put it up on the website. In a way, it changes the way people react in such situations.”

Some of the other projects that this team has been working on include The Time Capsule, where they plan to create a magazine based on the crowd’s opinion of what science inventions should be created in the next decade, and placing it in a capsule to be dug up later.

154,2020/02/29,Oxford dictionary redefined,"A look at how the digital era has sharpened this enduring tool for advanced learners of English

Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary (OALD) is really advanced in years, having seen seven decades, but wears its age well. It keeps evolving with the times, bringing a freshness to the table with every print run. The 10th edition of the dictionary was launched recently.

Education Plus caught up with Fathima Dada, Managing Director, Education Division, Oxford University Press (OUP), who was in India, to understand how focus on digitisation is helping this particular brand reach an extended target group.

Beyond OALD, the discussion touched upon how OUP as a whole is redefining itself to stay relevant.

Excerpts from the interview.

India has been a major market for OUP as far as its English language dictionary is concerned. Has the digital world impacted the situation?

Our print version of the OALD may be going down in numbers but it’s still popular among a sizeable section of people. We are still market leaders in India and will continue to be. We are increasingly moving towards digital, right from the way we are delivering content to conducting assessments to training teachers. That does not mean we are less invested in the traditional ways of disseminating information. Both are blended to enhance the experience for a reader.

Our 10th edition of OALD is equipped with several digital tools, including an app. Some of the features it offers include audio/video tutorials, self-study activities, iWriter and iSpeaker tools.

There is a decline in the reading habit among children. Can digital tools be used to revive it?

Children maybe reading less in the printed format but they could be reading in multiple formats. I remember we had long narratives to read in school, today children have unique ways of assimilating lessons. We provide support for teachers and children to understand our learning resources through quizzes, gamification and virtual learning. We launched ‘Oxford Reading Buddy’ — a digital reading device to support each child’s reading journey — last year. It is like an overarching umbrella to support children to love reading. We have good feedback from schools that have signed up with us.

What are some focus areas that OUP is currently working on?

We are working closely with corporates to popularise our content. For example, Google and Microsoft have our licence where one gets to browse a whole lot of the learning resources we keep bringing out. As a brand, we are keen on preserving languages and digital is helping us in this journey. We also print bilingual dictionaries. In India, we are available in 12 regional languages. Cognitive skills are best developed in the mother tongue, and digital is helping us preserve it.

What is the evolving role of the teacher in the digital age?

In the last few decades, a teacher’s role has become more qualitative. We are thinking of how we can save the teacher’s time, so that she can be more productive in the classroom. Technology now offers more personalised solutions. We help schools to benchmark students and use data analytics to take up assessments, thereby providing more support to teachers through training and other ways. We offer online training to nearly a lakh teachers every year. This medium helps them get more used to digital and makes them more comfortable in the classroom. We have 21 online courses for teacher training, which includes those on assessment, interactive learning and classroom management. We will continue to reinvent ourselves to stay relevant with the times.

155,2020/02/29,Speaking is the solution,"Acquisition of English skills in a formal classroom setting, demands creating opportunities for practice

Educationists often blame the State for lack of English language proficiency among students. The Tamil Nadu government’s structural transformation to make spoken English an integral part of the curriculum from the first standard onwards is laudable.

The primacy of speaking skills

Students with high academic scores, who enter the tertiary education with a low communicative competence, sadly, are graduating with almost same level of linguistic competence. The primary reasons for this sordid state are: a) reluctance to use the language for fear of shaming themselves; b) lack of opportunities in the class and with their own peers outside (the proficient ones form their own cliques and look down upon the English have-nots); c) prioritising core subjects over languages; and d) lack of any immediate need.

Obstacles and solutions

Obstacle 1: The physical setting

The 20x20 classroom with two columns of benches and desks and about 40 students, is hardly a place for speaking activities. The rows of classrooms on either side of the building, with doors and windows wide open, can never be an ideal environment.

Solution: Speaking skills cannot be developed by just listening, reading, or writing. Learners become speakers of English only by speaking. Moving them out to an open space, be it the terrace or the playground, will create a facilitative environment to engage in authentic communication.

Obstacle 2: Nature of tasks

The “activities” generally set in the classroom are textbook-based, which promote formal academic English, rarely relating to everyday spoken language.

Solution: Tasks must encourage learners to speak spontaneously and they have to be informal and life-oriented. They should also be Indianised, even localised. Westerners usually have continental breakfast with bacon, croissants, sunny-side up omelette, and sausages. But this would alienate our learners, whereas idly, dosa, and sambar vada would make them salivate.

Obstacle 3: Various formats

Speaking activities are mostly carried out at the individual level. A 40-minute class can provide time just for a handful of learners.

Solution: Individual presentation is perhaps the most difficult task, so it ought to be preceded by group, followed by triad and pair tasks, in that order. Individual tasks must be introduced only after sufficient practice, to minimise the phobia of speaking. Different formats offer equal opportunities to all, so, the perennial issue of articulate students dominating the class is eliminated.

Obstacle 4: Teachers’ English skills

Teachers at the primary level confess their hesitation to teach English, as they never had any real exposure. And, whatever English they learnt is lost as they never get a chance to deploy it either at home or at school. This is the insurmountable challenge encountered now — how could teachers with nearly nil linguistic competence facilitate learners to acquire it?

Solution: Incorporating multimedia contents such as films, videos, podcasts, songs and any other printed texts can be input materials for the speaking tasks so that the teacher dependency is minimised.

156,2020/02/29,Knowing your withdrawal,"Self-reflection and self-observation can help you figure out your inner turmoil

High-engagement, over stimulated days and life-phases need balancing out and slowing down just like the body craves a seven-eight hours sleep cycle daily to reboot. The mind and body crave this cyclical revival and we have learnt to heed this need conditioned by the day and night ritual of Earth’s rotation. There is another level to this switching off that we don’t heed as easily — the need to switch off from habits, recurring patterns, behaviour and ambition that outlive their tenure inside our heads. You would think that an ambition is never a barrier, yet one that has existed without you inching closer to it in incremental ways; or when it no longer connect to your soul, has served its purpose in your growth.

There is no science to assess when an ambition becomes a lump in the throat. A cultivated practice of self-reflection can help in the choice to either set it aside or scrap it forever. Self-observation helps in noticing if you are frequently pulling back and passing off opportunities that would ordinarily be attractive in pursuit of your dream.

Yet all withdrawals are not the same. Many of you write to me experiencing tugs of withdrawal for indescribable reasons and I will attempt to offer some clues to recognise what it could be:

Revive and recentre

This is the most productive and creative call for withdrawal. Many accounts suggest that great creative works emerged out of periods of self-imposed withdrawal from public eye. For us, too, intermissions of pulling back are best to go inward, reflect, reassess and realign with new ideas and desires for the future. Returning to active life is naturally characterised by energy and renewed purpose.

Physical burnout

Withdrawal demanded by dire lack of physical rest and recovery, borne off chaotic demands, long schedules, long work hours, lack of pause and reboot rituals and over stimulated lives. The only way out is to enforce a complete pause and get away to rejuvenate. Saying ‘no’ is a vital part of revival from burnout.

Emotional withdrawal

Emotions can make us hide and reclusive from social contact. Stress due to a breakup, looming deadline, or psychological worry such as college admission or finding a job can trigger a cascade of stress hormones that produce physiological changes. A combination of reactions to stress is the ‘fight-or-flight’ response, which occurs as a survival mechanism, enabling you to react quickly to worsening situations. Often, social withdrawal is a flight response to safeguard our wellbeing.

Depression

At the outset, depression needs medical attention. It is a serious mood disorder that interferes with everyday activities. Losing the will for daily chores and attention to self, a persistent state of lethargy, sadness, emptiness, overwhelming hopelessness, inability to cope with simple tasks are some common signs to know it. The foremost action is to reach out to a therapist or certified counsellor without delay and sign up for expert care.

Gloria Steinem offers a simple cue to differentiate depression from the rest ‘When you’re depressed, nothing has meaning, when you’re sad everything does’. And more than anything, heed your symptom, dear readers.

157,2020/02/29,The balancing act,"A healthy mix of academics and extracurricular activities is key to a successful school experience

Parents expect you to excel in studies, while coaches push you hard to do well in extra-curricular activities. To strike the right balance, every student needs to be organised and become adept at time-management. If you learn to prioritise early in life, you will develop into an efficient and productive adult who enjoys the best of both worlds.

In a learner-centric classroom, the process of evaluation is based on the overall performance of the student throughout the year — in exams, projects, class presentations, and participation in personality development activities. International schools always concur with this and believe it is essential for students to maintain a proper balance between academics, social life, and co-curricular activities.

Integration

As an important part of the international school structure, elementary and middle school students spend around six hours a week and high school students spend around four and a half hours a week on co-curricular activities that vary from participating in physical education to learning music. These activities are integrated into the curriculum and are a compulsory part of the programme.

Most regular schools do not offer subjects such as arts, sports, or music. Although this is slowly changing due to growing interest in pursuing these subjects, they are still considered niche subjects. International schools, on the other hand, offer these subjects right from class I, up until class XII. These schools have excellent theatre and music programmes with a multicultural international faculty.

Although most students do not have the cognitive skills to organise their schedules independently until middle school, teachers start teaching them how to plan and prioritise their time from kindergarten onwards. Time management is a vital skill that helps students prioritise tasks, accurately judge the amount of time needed to complete them, and balance time between learning and playing.

Opportunities

Students must be given opportunities to participate in a wide variety of extracurricular activities. Inter-school competitions in swimming, football, basketball, and other sports are conducted throughout the year in international schools and so are several festivals to celebrate the arts and to nurture creativity and encourage expression in students.

Clubs could be made a mandatory part of elementary, middle, and high school programmes like in most international schools. Teachers and school authorities understand the necessity of helping their students develop skills outside of their classroom, and therefore clubs are a way to cultivate important life skills that a student can use for the rest of his or her life. Research has shown that extra-curricular activities create interest in students and encourage them to participate earnestly in academic activities. This keeps the students, faculty, parents, and peers motivated for higher realms of achievement.

Maintaining a high level of interest in academics as well as co-curricular activities is vital for the all-round development of the students. Teachers and parents should jointly work out how best to equally divide time and interest for their students between the two. A review of the activities offered has to be undertaken periodically to ensure that the students are not falling behind in either of them. Based on the review, suggestions can be made by teachers to students about how to improve in any particular area. This leads to the holistic development of the students. Students with a perfect balance between academics and extra-curricular activities are an asset to society and will be successful in different spheres of life.

158,2020/02/29,The bliss of solitude,"Few moments of peace are needed but are scarce in this age of technology

Being alone versus lonely are two distinct phenomena. While loneliness is associated with a multitude of health risks, both physical and psychological, spending time with oneself is not detrimental and can even be conducive to our health. Psychologist, Guy Winch, points out that loneliness is not necessarily a function of how many friends you have but the “subjective quality of your relationships.” Whether you feel affinity for the people in your life is more important than the width of your social network. If you feel emotionally connected with your family and friends, you are less likely to experience loneliness.

However, this does not imply that you need to be around people most of the time in order to thrive. In The New York Times, writer Micaela Marini Higgs, lists a number of benefits of solitude. Besides promoting creativity and enhancing our relationships, time to ourselves also aids in emotional regulation. Psychologist Thuy-vy Nguyen, clarifies that desiring solitude is not necessarily a reflection of your extroversion or introversion. Even extroverts may crave for some solo time to recharge themselves. Further, as people engage in hobbies when they are alone, they may discover hitherto unknown facets of themselves.

Only when you extricate yourself from the humming buzz of society, do you get a chance to see how you are influenced by sociocultural forces, argues writer Brent Crane in The Atlantic. Time spent alone lends itself to self-exploration and is essential to identity formation. However, developmental psychologist Kenneth Rubin, provides some caveats to the benefits of solitude. He asserts that our separation from others has to be voluntary and not imposed on us. Second, we should be able to regulate our emotions “effectively” when we are alone. If we desire company, we should be able to join others. Lastly, solitude is healthy only if we are able to sustain pro-social relationships with others.

Digitally present

MIT professor and social scientist, Sherry Turkle, bemoans that modern humans are not really reaping the blessings of solitude because none of us is truly alone even when we are away from others. Continual pings from our devices keep us tethered to our networks. As a result, people have less and less uninterrupted time for self-reflection, which is essential for cultivating and maintaining an autonomous identity. While 24/7 connectivity is desirable at times, it comes with costs that we need to recognise. We need to claim our downtime by turning off our devices for some time, preferably every day. And, if you feel at a loss when your phone is switched off, that is a sure sign that you need to disengage from it more regularly.

Renowned educationist J. Krishnamurti exhorts students to spend time by themselves to plumb their inner depths. He cautions that “you cannot find out about yourself if you are always talking, going about with your friends with half a dozen people.” Whether you take a solitary walk, listen to music in your room or sit quietly on a park bench, cherish the time you spend with yourself.

160,2020/02/29,What makes for an argument?,"The point of a debate — to win, or to understand?

We are all familiar with the standard school debate. You get assigned to a side, for or against a topic, and you build your armoury of facts and evidence to support your argument. You look at the other side with a view to demolishing their arguments, to finding better and stronger ways to break them. It is all about winning.

Generally, staged debates are performances put on to give the audience something to think about. The two sides do the best they can to get the audience to buy their argument. The audience, for its part, looks at it as a test of wits and eloquence. Who sounds better? Who uses words more powerfully? Who is more entertaining (or engaging)?

But what really is the point of a debate? Is it to win, or to understand? Is it a competition or a route to achieving clarity about a topic? Ideally, a debate is meant to explore a question fully, and the only reason we have two sides is to share the work of exploration, so that we can arrive at a position after considering these varied points of view. It is entirely possible that after you have listened to the two sides of a debate, you are still not entirely convinced about one or the other. This is usually because there are always more than two sides, and, more importantly, the best position lies somewhere between all the different sides.

Multiple views

The culture of school debates follows us through life, and we see echoes of it everywhere, from student union elections to the shout-outs in our parliament. Those who perform follow the playbook they have learned over the years: make your point loud and strong. Those who watch look for strength of performance, pitting one view against the other. Rarely is there an effort to actually consider the different points in the argument and think about them without linking them to a particular side. And this also seeps into our everyday conversations in the classroom and outside, sometimes mirroring the polarisation we see in the world at large.

So, how can we recover the true meaning and purpose of a debate — the kind that we engage in every day, with those around us? Chris Anderson, curator of the hugely popular TED, said in a recent interview that one should approach any conversation with a healthy combination of scepticism and open-mindedness. Scepticism on all fronts, about your own ideas, your own positions, as well as others’. And open-mindedness particularly toward the (manifestly) opposing views. So, even as you work through your own ideas, you are open to the notion that there may be things or points of view you have not considered. As you listen to others, you balance a questioning attitude with the acceptance that there may be something in what they have to say. There is a mutual willingness to accept flaws in one’s reasoning and to explore different positions.

After all, debates — and conversations — are supposed to help find solutions, or to arrive at greater clarity, or to find a path to moving forward. When they become contests, they end up producing winners and losers, with the biggest loss being the possibility of understanding.

161,2020/02/29,Tamil Nadu close to settling Nissan tax dispute,"The company had alleged that the State had not paid incentives to the tune of $770 million, but now a settlement has been reached, the State Industries secretary said

The Tamil Nadu government is close to settling its tax dispute with Japanese automaker Nissan Motor , with the State cabinet having already giving a nod to this. Soon, an agreement will be signed with the company, a top government official said.

The company had alleged that the State government has not paid incentives to the tune of $770 million with respect to its manufacturing plant at Oragadam on the outskirts of Chennai.

“The settlement agreement will be signed soon with the company, as the State cabinet has already given the nod,” N. Muruganandam, Industries Secretary, said, in reply to an audience query at a Confederation of Indian Industry conference on ‘Building Endurance in a Challenging Business Environment’ on Saturday.

K. Shanmugam, Chief Secretary, Government of Tamil Nadu pointed out that the dispute arose because Nissan changed its business model and wanted to claim the incentives which were spread over the years in an accelerated manner.

According to the conditions of the Memorandum of Understanding, the company is eligible to avail incentives of about ₹5,125 crore in around 21 years. The State Industries Department had alleged that the firm changed its business model which made them avail the incentives much before the completing of 21 years, as stipulated in the agreement.

“We had a long discussion with the company. They have understood our point of view. The Cabinet has approved to make the settlement in one go, so that issue is sorted out,” he added.

To a query on Apple products manufactured in the State, Mr. Muruganandam said the company did not want to publicise its plans. Foxconn’s plant in Sriperumbudur is making Apple products. “Slowly they are shifting some of the production from China. In the coming months we expect more investments and a shift from China,” he added.

To an audience question on lay-offs in the IT sector mainly at the middle level, Mr. Shanmugam said that the survival of the fittest applies not only to industries, but also to employees.

“You can’t fault the industries because they under competitive pressure to control cost and improve productivity. Employees need to constantly upgrade the skills and stay relevant to the industry.

Several employees working for the Tamil Nadu government were in for a rude shock on Friday, as their salaries were not credited on the last working day of the month due to glitches in migration to a new software.

According to informed sources, glitches in migrating to Integrated Financial and Human Resource Management System (IFHRMS) were the primary reason behind the non-payment of salaries to several hundred employees across the State.

Many of them turned anxious and kept checking their balance in their salary accounts through the day.

Some claimed that the server located in Tiruchi was not capable of handling the load and that the migration to new software was problematic in several districts, except Karur.

But, one source claimed that the delay could also be due to non-submission of documents following investment declaration.

A source indicated that the delay in payment might last at least four days for Secretariat staff in Chennai.

“We have EMIs and house rent to pay. This hasn’t happened in so many years, except during the end of a fiscal year due to closing of accounts.

“This could have been avoided if the government planned well,” a government servant rued.

Threat of penalty

Another employee pointed out that the delay in payment of salaries would only lead to paying penalty for not paying EMIs on time.

“The government has paid a huge sum to a private software company and this is what we get to witness,” he said. Salaries of State government employees are paid on the last working day of the month.

When contacted, a senior official in the Finance Department said the delay was only due to the migration to the new software and it would be “resolved soon.” However, he didn’t commit himself to a date.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/software-glitch-delays-salaries-for-several-government-employees/article30946740.ece
164,2020/02/29,"State govt. can seek more clarity on CAA, says BJP","Ban sought on anti-CAA protests across the State

With Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami recently stating that adopting a resolution in the Assembly against the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC) was under the government’s consideration, State BJP leader L. Ganesan on Friday said if the State had any doubts on the issue, it could seek clarifications from the Centre.

The BJP on Friday organised rallies in support of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in different parts of the State, including Chennai.

“I heard that the State government has decided to seek clarifications. Let it seek and get it cleared and then decide,” Mr. Ganesan told journalists after he led a party delegation to submit a representation to Chief Secretary K. Shanmugam seeking a ban on anti-CAA protests in the State. “But, none in India has the right to say that the CAA cannot be implemented,” he said.

The BJP leader alleged that “evil forces” were attempting to instigate riots in a State that was otherwise peaceful. Mr. Ganesan claimed that the DMK was insulting Hinduism and Hindu gods.

Asked how a ban on protests could be sought in a democracy, he said the protesters should not instigate violence. Asked about actor Rajinikanth’s criticism of the Home Ministry for the handling of Delhi riots, he said the Centre would investigate it.

The BJP leader alleged that the DMK, its allies, “anti-social, anti-national elements and certain Islamist terrorist organisations are engaged in spreading falsehood about CAA with the sole intention of fomenting violence.”

They were making women and children to take part in these protests although the Prime Minister and the Chief Minister had assured people that no Indian citizen would be affected by the legislation, he added.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/ou4xq4/article30946731.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29THBJPCAARALLY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/state-govt-can-seek-more-clarity-on-caa-says-bjp/article30946732.ece

Alagiri demanded the Centre drop the move to disinvest in the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) and list it on the stock market and warned of nationwide protests if the proposal is not dropped.

In a statement, Mr. Alagiri said the LIC had been functioning as a trusted organisation and as a friend of the citizens. “LIC is considered as India’s Kamadhenu and any stake sale in it is leading to policy holders, employees and others getting stressed about the move,” he said.

Mr. Alagiri said the move to sell a stake in LIC that was started by Jawaharlal Nehru was equivalent to just giving away the assets of the citizens in the hands of private players.

“LIC is providing ₹4 lakh crore per year as capital to the Modi government,” he said.

The TNCC president said the people would not accept LIC being given away to private players. “LIC has 30 crore policy holders. People will not accept the privatisation of an organisation that is as independent as the LIC,” Mr. Alagiri added.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/drop-lic-ipo-plans-alagiri-urges-centre/article30946720.ece
166,2020/02/29,"DPR for Godavari-Cauvery link ready, says Gadkari","‘Proposal entails investment of ₹60,000 cr. and will end water disputes’

A detailed project report entailing a massive investment of ₹60,000 crore to divert surplus water from the Godavari to the Cauvery via the Krishna and Pennar rivers, as part of the Polavaram Irrigation Project, has been prepared, Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari said on Friday.

The project for linking the inter-State rivers for a length of 1,252 km — 340 km in Telengana, 551 km in Andhra Pradesh and 361 km in Tamil Nadu — would be a lasting solution to the dispute among the riparian States over sharing the Cauvery river water, Mr. Gadkari said.

He was addressing graduands at the convocation ceremony of the National Institute of Technology Puducherry (NITPY) at Karaikal.

“The disputed quantum of water claimed [as entitlement] was much lesser than what would accrue to Tamil Nadu from the Polavaram project,” Mr. Gadkari said.

Seeking to explain that India was a rich country with poor people, Mr. Gadkari advocated research pursuits for students based on two philosophies: waste to wealth, and knowledge to wealth. To buttress this point, he cited the profitable social enterprises generating substantial wealth by converting sewage water into hydrogen fuel cell.

“The project to operate 400 buses in Maharashtra using bio-CNG, bio-diesel, methane gas sourced from vegetable and animal wastes and ethanol generated from sugarcane as replacement for petroleum products will save ₹60 crore a year,” he said.

Cost-effective power

He called for use of cost-effective power generated from integrated solar-wind plants, similar to the one at Kandla in Gujarat, for use in desalination plants by coastal States. Power generated at Kandla power plant was being sold for only ₹2.30 a unit whereas the desalination plants were purchasing power from conventional sources at ₹6.50 a unit. Also, when the operation of desalination plants were made viable through access to cheap power, the treated water after domestic use could be utilised for agriculture, Mr. Gadkari said.

Tamil Nadu was a rich State, he said and added that it needed appropriate policies and to focus on innovative research to convert knowledge into wealth and eradicate poverty.

“Knowledge, technology and resources alone would not suffice; there must be zeal and entrepreneurship,” the Union Minister told students, urging them to develop the attributes of team work and decision-making.

Mr. Gadkari joined Chief Minister of Puducherry V. Narayanasamy, Education Minister R. Kamalakannan and NITPY Director K. Sankaranarayanasamy in honouring medal winners and awarding degrees to 104 B.Tech graduands, eight M.Tech graduands and four Ph.D holders.

Administrative block

Earlier, Mr. Gadkari inaugurated the new administrative building of the NIT. The new building will house administrative offices, library, training and placement cell and an auditorium.

Presiding over the ceremony, Prof. Sankaranarayanasamy said laboratories developed at a cost of ₹12.38 crore for undertaking cutting-edge research would be put to use soon. A Solar Fish Dryer designed and fabricated by the NIT was donated to fishermen of Kottucherrymedu on the occasion.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/cwtub3/article30946708.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29THKARAIKALGADKARI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/dpr-for-godavari-cauvery-link-ready-says-gadkari/article30946709.ece
167,2020/02/29,India must capitalise on China’s slowdown: EEPC India chairman,"Ninth edition of International Engineering Sourcing Show to happen in Coimbatore

India must capitalise on the ongoing slowdown in Chinese manufacturing sector owing to the spread of COVID-19 and the trade wars between China and the United States, said Ravi Sehgal, chairman, Engineering Export Promotion Council (EEPC) India, here on Friday.

Addressing media on the upcoming International Engineering Sourcing Show (IESS) in Coimbatore from March 4 to 6, he said the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) must significantly increase their capacity. He said the Union Ministry of Commerce and Industry along with EEPC India recently did an analysis of major MSME sectors in China catering to the United States and European markets.

Rife with oppoturnity

“We found for instance that the entire water industry in the U.S. was dependent on China for things like pipe fittings and valves. Wuhan in China, which is the most affected in COVID-19, was the manufacturing hub for these items,” he said.

Indian MSMEs in this sector can leverage this opportunity, he added.

Echoing similar thoughts, Rajendra Kumar, principal secretary, MSME Department in Tamil Nadu, highlighted initiatives taken by the State government to promote the MSME sector, particularly through simplifying the approval process.

Stating that Tamil Nadu has been hosting IESS for the fourth consecutive year, he pointed out that the MSME Department is helping more than 100 MSME players from the State to exhibit their products at IESS.

C.H. Nadiger, regional director, EEPC India, said this is the first time the IESS is being hosted in a Tier-2 city.

“We could not think of a better city than Coimbatore, which is home to a variety of industries,” he said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/india-must-capitalise-on-chinas-slowdown-eepc-india-chairman/article30946682.ece
168,2020/02/29,Nalini files new writ petition against Governor’s ‘inaction’,"She says her detention since Sept. 2018 should be ruled illegal

Even as the Madras High Court is yet to deliver its verdict on a writ of habeas corpus petition filed by S. Nalini, convict in the former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, early this year, she has filed another plea in the court. The writ seeks wants the Governor’s “failure” to act upon State Cabinet’s September 2018 recommendation, for release of all seven convicts involved in the case, to be declared unconstitutional.

In the habeas corpus plea before a Bench led by Justice R. Subbiah, she had sought her release on the ground that her detention since September 9, 2018 should be considered illegal because the recommendation made by the Council of Ministers was binding upon the Governor and that he could not take a contra view.

In the new plea for a writ of declaration, she sought her release from prison after declaring as unconstitutional the Governor’s “failure” to act upon the recommendation.

Death sentence

In an affidavit, filed through her counsel M. Radhakrishnan and P. Pugalenthi, the convict said, she was found guilty in the assassination case in 1998 and was sentenced to death by the trial court. The conviction as well as the sentence were confirmed by the Supreme Court on May 11, 1999. Thereafter, she sought pardon and the then Governor commuted her death sentence to life imprisonment on April 24, 2000 by exercising powers under Article 161 of the Constitution.

Thereafter, claiming to have become eligible for premature release in 2001, the 52-year-old convict said, the government was not considering her case at all, even while scores of other convicts were released on occasions such as birth anniversaries of former Chief Ministers. Claiming that the Governor had accepted recommendations made by the Cabinet for release of convicts in other cases, she said, there was no justification for keeping her release pending.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/4oy04g/article30946666.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29FEBTHNALINIRAJIVGANDHIASSASINATIONCONVICT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/nalini-files-new-writ-petition-against-governors-inaction/article30946667.ece
169,2020/02/29,High Court quashes transfer of government doctors,"Judge also rules that doctors do not have the right to go on strike

The Madras High Court on Friday made it clear that doctors have no right whatsoever to go on strike. Yet, it quashed charge memos and transfer orders issued to select government doctors who had spearheaded a strike last year and held that the government’s action smacked of mala fide intention of exhibiting its might over the employees.

Justice N. Anand Venkatesh said that out of 18,000-odd government doctors, the Health Department had chosen to issue charge memos and transfer orders only to 135. “It was not done to bring the situation under control but to warn the doctors that any one who spearheads such agitations will be dealt with iron hands,” he observed.

Squarely blaming the government for not having handled the issue properly, the judge said the government should have given top priority to some of the demands, which included pay hike and taken a firm decision. He said even if the government was not in a position to accept the demands, it should have been told to the doctors in black and white.

“By keeping the issue pending, the government was only unnecessarily escalating the already charged atmosphere... The government doctors started getting a feeling of betrayal. This ultimately resulted in a State wide agitation. If the government had been proactive, the entire incident could have been avoided,” the judge opined.

Pointing out that the doctors were on strike between October 25 and November 1, the judge said Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami and Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar on October 30 requested the doctors to resume work with a promise that their demands would be considered and an appropriate decision would be taken.

“Immediately, the agitation was called off and the doctors resumed duty on November 1.

“As a model employer, the government ought to have followed up and come out with solutions for the demands made by the government doctors. Instead of resorting to such a positive step, the government decided to show its might against the office-bearers,” he added.

Agreeing with the submissions of advocates C. Kanagaraj, M.R. Jothimanian, K.C. Karl Marx and C.S.K. Satish, who represented a huge batch of government doctors who had challenged their charge memos and transfer orders, Mr. Justice Venkatesh said: “There are not many government servants who will willingly spearhead any agitation.

“However, there are some who will put their interest behind and take the over all interest of the doctors to the forefront and decide to lead an agitation... It is seen that some of these doctors are highly qualified and they have a lot of experience and service. These doctors who spearhead the agitation are not instigating or conspiring or inciting an unlawful act.

“They are merely the representatives of the entire body of the government doctors.

They should not be assigned the role of a villain and singled out and dealt with in such a harsh manner,” the judge said and quashed all the charge memos and transfer orders. He directed to post the doctors in their original place of work during the next transfer counselling.

‘Settled issue’

In the same breath, the judge reminded the doctors that no government employee had a right to strike and that the law had been settled well by the Supreme Court in T.K. Rangarajan versus Government of Tamil Nadu (2003) case.

The Supreme Court had gone a step further and held that a strike could not be justified even on moral and equitable grounds.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/ggyiji/article30946636.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29THMADRASHC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/high-court-quashes-transfer-of-government-doctors/article30946637.ece

BJP leaders C. Vasudevan and V. Anbazhagan addressed a gathering of Tirupattur unit party cadre, during a meeting, and spoke on the ways of countering arguments and protests against the CAA.

Memorandum submitted

State spokesperson for the BJP, T. Narayanan, met Tirupattur Collector M.P. Sivanarul at his office and submitted a memorandum urging action against those instigating violence in the name of protests against CAA.

Mr. Sivanarul said so far more than 100 FIRs were registered against those organising ‘Shaheen Bagh’ protests in Vaniyambadi town.

Maintaining peace and tranquillity is priority for both the police and district administration and would not be compromised at any point of time, he said.

Actor Daniel Radcliffe continues to take up projects that give him chances to move away from Hogwarts. He has now opened up on why he won’t be reprising his role as the young wizard, Harry Potter, anytime soon.

Asked if he would return as Harry Potter in the Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them films, Radcliffe told Variety: “I don’t think so. I don’t like to say no to things, but it’s not something that I’m rushing to do. I feel like those films have moved on and they’re doing just fine without us. I’m happy to keep it that way.”

“I like what my life is now. I’m not saying that I’ll never go back into any franchise, but I like the flexibility that I have with my career now.

174,2020/02/29,Watch | Ryan Reynolds gives a Leap Day ‘21-year-old’ her first 'legal' alcoholic drink,"84-year-old Arlene Manko was born on Leap Day, February 29, in 1936

Hollywood star Ryan Reynolds has made a hilarious video in which he gives ‘leap year’ baby Arlene Manko her ""first legal alcoholic drink.""

The twist is that Arlene is 84 years old. But since she was born on February 29, which occurs only once every four years, this is technically her 21st birthday, and by that logic, enters ""legal drinking age"".

In a hilarious video that the Deadpool actor shared on Instagram, Arlene even remarks that she got married at 5 years of age and had kids when she was 10. She added, “I had seven kids in 10 years, do you think sometimes I didn't want to drink?”

The octagenarian then proceeds to ‘legally’ have her first alcoholic sip, that was given to her by Ryan Reynold's Aviation Gin company.

Reynolds posted the video on his Instagram with the caption, “Arlene Manko was born in 1936. But tomorrow, she'll turn 21 years old. #HappyLeapDay” with Arlene saying that she’s finally ready for it!

The actor’s last film was 6 Underground, and he’s presently working on two comedy outings Free Guy and The Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/q1ctz5/article30949707.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ryann,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/watch-ryan-reynolds-gives-a-leap-day-21-year-old-her-first-legal-alcoholic-drink/article30949708.ece
175,2020/02/29,"‘Sonic the Hedgehog’ movie review: A (super) fast, fun and jolly road trip","A spectacular return to form by Jim Carrey propels this family-friendly action adventure to greater heights

Jim Carrey is back! As mad scientist, Dr Robotnik, with an IQ of 300 and a triple PhD, he is a hoot with the funniest lines. Sample this: “Stand at the edge of your personal abyss!” is priceless. He brings an irresistible energy to this already fun film. Based on a video game franchise, Sonic the Hedgehog has enough Easter eggs for the dedicated fan and enough zing for Sonic newbies.

The laughs start with Paramount’s logo, where instead of the stars there are the rings Sonic uses for interplanetary travel. Sonic (Ben Schwartz) is a blue hedgehog who can move super-fast. When he is attacked in his home planet, his guardian, a wise owl gives him a bag of golden rings and sends him to earth. Sonic hides in Green Hills, Montana living vicariously through the sheriff, Wachowski (James Marsden), who he calls the Donut Lord because he “talks to donuts and then eats them if they get out of line.”

When Sonic causes the power grid to trip, the US defence hires Dr Robotnik to find the cause, which he does because he is “the top banana in a world full of hungry little monkeys.” What follows is a jolly road trip with bonding, friendship, adventure and quips.

The release of the film was pushed back to redesign Sonic after test audience hated the initial design. Whatever damage control was done seems to have been done right as the film and its title character have a charming, bubbly, look and feel with Sonic seamlessly seguing with the live action. We sure have come a long way from Who Framed Roger Rabbit.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/xz928b/article30949605.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/sonic,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/sonic-the-hedgehog-movie-review-a-super-fast-fun-and-jolly-road-trip/article30949606.ece
176,2020/02/29,"Roman Polanski wins best director at Cesars amid protests, several women walk out of audience","‘Portrait of A Lady On Fire’ actor Adèle Haenel was among those who left when the French-Polish director won for his film ‘An Officer and a Spy’

Roman Polanski cast a shadow over France’s Cesar Awards on Friday even as he won best directing for his film An Officer and a Spy, with several women in the audience walking out in protest at honouring a man facing rape accusations.

The French version of the Oscars was held in Paris, amid protests by several women’s rights activists and groups over the nomination of the director’s most recent film for awards.

The French-Polish director’s dozen nominations had divided opinion in France, a country where the #MeToo movement that inspired women globally to out powerful men for sexual misconduct has struggled to gain traction.

Polanski, 86, whose film also picked up awards for best adaptation and best costume designer, stayed away from the event, saying he feared he would be lynched.

Controversy had swirled around the inclusion in the awards programme of Polanski, who fled the United States for France in the late 1970s after admitting raping a 13-year-old girl, and faces more recent allegations of sexual assault.

Polanski denies the latest accusations against him.

During the ceremony, the biggest night on the French cinema calendar, Polanski served as both lightning rod and punch line, with the ceremony’s host quipping about paedophilia.

“It is the last (event) of one era and the first of another,” actress Sandrine Kiberlain said.

Among those who left the venue early was leading actress Portrait of A Lady On Fire star Adèle Haenel, who last year revealed she had been sexually abused as a child by another director.

Haenel told the New York Times before the ceremony that France had “missed the boat” on #MeToo and criticised the Cesar Awards for recognising Polanski.

“Distinguishing Polanski is spitting in the face of all victims. It means raping women isn’t that bad,” she said.

Protesters outside clashed with police shortly before the biggest names in French film arrived at the Pleynel concert hall, but none made it onto the red carpet. Nearby, other protesters peacefully waved placards reading “Shame on an industry that protects rapists.”

Wrong message in the #MeToo era

An Officer and a Spy chronicles the persecution of French Jewish army officer Alfred Dreyfus in the 1890s. It lost out on best film to Les Miserables.

Polanski himself survived the Holocaust, while his mother died in a Nazi concentration camp. He shot to fame in the United States with his 1968 Hollywood film Rosemary’s Baby.

Polanski’s cast and production team boycotted the Cesars on Friday after Culture Minister Franck Riester said the success of a director accused of sexual violence would send the wrong signal in the #MeToo era.

French photographer Valentine Monnier last year accused Polanski of raping her in 1975 when she was an 18-year-old model and actress. Polanski has denied the charge.

It is the second time in five months that recognition of Polanski, who was expelled last year from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences — which bestows the Oscars — has prompted disquiet.

Organisers of the Venice Film Festival drew criticism for including Polanski’s work in the programme. It went on to take the festival’s Silver Lion Grand Jury in September.

The French awards come in the same week that Harvey Weinstein, once one of Hollywoods most influential producers, was convicted of sexual assault and rape by a New York court.

Several male actors tiptoed carefully around the subject of Polanski on Friday night.

“I hope that we will always be able to continue playing the game of seduction with each other in cinema and in real life. There, I made it, I offended no one,” said actor and director Mathieu Kassovitz.

Critics of the #MeToo movement in France say it is puritanical and fuelled by a hated of men.

Ahead of the Cesars, former French film star Brigitte Bardot rallied support for Polanski.

“We should be thankful that Polanski is alive and saving French cinema from mediocrity,” Bardot said on Twitter. “I judge him by his talent, not his private life.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/24s3mc/article30949527.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AWARDS-CESARSPOLANSKI,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/roman-polanski-wins-best-director-at-cesars-amid-protests-several-women-walk-out-of-audience/article30949529.ece
177,2020/02/29,Portal on internship for students on cards,"It will increase the choice for companies, says Vice Chairman of the TSCHE

Telangana State Council of Higher Education Vice Chairman V.Venkata Ramana on Saturday said a State-wide portal to facilitate internships for students is on the cards.

“We are shortly going to launch a State-wide Telangana portal for internship,” he said, adding the objective is to help improve access to internships for engineering students from tier II and III locations.

“A boy or girl from Adilabad, Warangal or somewhere in Nirmal can apply for the internships,” he told ‘Startup Connect 2020’ organised here by the Indian Chamber of Commerce (ICC). For the companies, the portal would translate into more choices, he pointed out.

Mr. Ramana said this listing measures taken by Telangana government to update the curriculum to make it more relevant for the industry. He highlighted the various initiatives of the government to promote start-ups, the ecosystem for them and to encourage innovation. The State was keen to promote start-ups working in the areas of emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and social enterprises.

Addressing the meeting, SEBI Chief General Manager Jeevan Sonparote said the regulator is open to stakeholder feedback on ways to facilitate the start-up ecosystem regarding issues of raising capital.

Ramesh Loganathan, Professor of Practice and Co-Innovations, IIIT-Hyderabad stressed the need for start-ups to connect with corporates as well as industry associations for open innovation and co-creation.

Southern Council Member of ICC Rajiv Reddy said mentorship remains at the core of the start-up ecosystem and ICC had taken the onus of hand-holding start-ups through its pan India initiative “ICC Nexxt” which facilitates, policy advocacy, open innovation and start-up investment.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/o31ola/article30953372.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY01PORTAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/portal-on-internship-for-students-on-cards/article30953373.ece
178,2020/02/29,Unopposed win for many DCCB chiefs,"TSCAB chairman proves three-time lucky as party command suggests that he continue in the post

Lady luck smiled once again on Konduru Ravinder Rao, who was elected chairman of District Cooperative Central Bank (DCCB) for the third time in Karimnagar on Saturday. He was elected unopposed from Gambhiraopet cooperative society, with the party high command recommending the continuation of his candidature for the post and also as chairman of Telangana State Co-operative Apex Bank (TSCAB).

During the formal conduct of election of DCCB chairperson, Mr Ravinder Rao alone filed the nomination and was, thus, elected. He was first elected as DCCB chairman in 2005 and then in 2013. He became TSCAB chief after the bifurcation of the State in 2015. He had won accolades for bringing in several reforms in the cooperative bank and helping it run in profit.

On the other hand, Allela Srikanth Reddy of Dharmapuri was elected chairman of District Cooperative Marketing Society (DCMS).

Speaker’s son elected

Pocharam Bhaskar Reddy, younger son of Assembly Speaker Pocharam Srinivas Reddy, and Sambari Mohan were elected unopposed as chairperson of the DCCB and DCMS respectively, on Saturday.

Mr. Bhaskar Reddy was earlier elected chairman of Primary Agricultural Cooperative Society (PACS) from Desaipet and Mr. Mohan from Nallavelli.

Minister for Roads and Buildings V. Prashanth Reddy read out the decision of the party leadership. He played a key role right from the filing of nominations to pacifying dissidents in the party. Talking to mediapersons later, he said TRS got a landslide victory in the cooperative elections by winning 136 out of 144 PACS in the integrated old district.

The Minister said of the 30 director posts in DCCB and DCMS, TRS won 29 and election was not held for one post.

SC leader wins

Namdev Kamble, chairman of Narnoor PACS, was elected chairman of Adilabad DCCB here on Saturday. The election of the Scheduled Caste leader was unopposed as the ruling TRS had recommended his name along with that of three others for the post of DCCB chairperson and vice-chairperson, as well as DCMS vice-chairperson.

Mr. Kamble is a DCCM managing committee director from Narnoor in Adilabad district and a veteran of the cooperative movement. He had served earlier as vice-chairman of the organisation and chairman on the death of an incumbent in the 1990s.

The Dalit leader’s name came as a surprise as other directors, supported by Forest Minister A. Indrakaran Reddy and Adilabad MLA Jogu Ramanna had been circulating in political circles. The high command apparently thought it fit to nominate a non-controversial person acceptable to both sides to smother any problem in future.

Earlier in the day, the 18 directors of DCCB arrived from their ‘camp’ in Hyderabad to start the process of election with Mr. Kamble’s name being proposed by Tamsi director A. Bhoja Reddy and seconded by Mamda director Harish Rao.

Thippani Lingaiah, director from Luxettipet in Mancherial district, was elected DCMS president.

Big surprise

Kondapaka PACS chairman Chitti Devender Reddy was elected DCCB chairman for the second time. M. Shivakumar was elected chairman of DCMS.

M. Devender Reddy, chairman of Konapur PACS and husband of Medak MLA M. Padma, was expected to bag the top post but according to sources, Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao and IT Minister K.T. Rama Rao opted for Mr. Chitti Devender Reddy for the post once again.

A sealed cover sent by the party leadership was reportedly opened on Friday night at a resort in the presence of Finance Minister T. Harish Rao.

Clean sweep

The ruling TRS made a clean sweep by winning the chairman and vice-chairman posts of both DCCB and DCMS.

Kurakula Nagabhushanam and Dondapati Venkateswara Rao were unanimously elected as the chairman and the vice-chairman of the DCCB here on Saturday. R. Seshagiri Rao and K. Srinivas Rao bagged the chairman and vice-chairman posts of DCMS unopposed.

Transport Minister Puvvada Ajay Kumar congratulated the newly-elected heads of the two cooperative bodies here on Saturday afternoon.

Expected result

As had been predicted, Marneni Ravinder Rao was elected as DCCB chairperson here on Saturday.

Since the TRS reigned supreme in the recently held elections to the PACS, the appointment of DCCB chairperson was seen as just a formality. So was the appointment of Guguloth Ramaswamy Naik of Khanapur in Warangal Rural district as chairperson and vice-chairperson posts for the Orugallu DCMS.

Minister for Panchayat Raj E. Dayakar Rao and Minister for Tribal Welfare and Women Development Satyavathi Rathod disclosed the leadership’s choice for DCCB and ODCMS posts.

Mr. Ravinder Rao, who joined the TRS in 2008, actively participated in separate Telangana movement.

TRS leadership ensured representation from four districts – Warangal Urban, Rural, Jangaon and Mahabubabad.

181,2020/02/29,Shelter for the homeless to open soon,"The State-run home in Khammam has the capacity to accommodate 150 inmates

The long wait for a State-run shelter for urban homeless including destitute persons is all set to end with a spacious building constructed for this purpose getting ready for inauguration.

The new building has been constructed along the bypass road here under the aegis of Khammam Municipal Corporation (KMC) with all requisite amenities to offer a comfortable and safe stay for the homeless persons. Built under the National Urban Livelihoods Mission (NULM), the new building has the capacity to accommodate around 150 inmates, sources said.

It will be run under the supervision of an executive committee comprising officials of municipal administration and allied departments, elected representatives, representatives of civil society organisations and non-governmental organisations NGOs). The Mission for Elimination of Poverty in Municipal Areas (MEPMA), the State-run society, in association with an NGO has identified around 70 homeless including destitutes, migrant daily wage labourers, infirm and sick persons during a survey held in the KMC limits last month.

Rehabilitating inmates

Those identified are presently sheltered in a home run by a town-based NGO. Plans are afoot to shift all those rescued homeless persons to the State-run shelter after its inauguration on March 1. Minister for Municipal Administration K T Rama Rao is scheduled to inaugurate the new facility during his half-day visit to Khammam on Sunday.

Apart from offering safe and secure shelter to homeless persons, the new facility will also extend its services to properly rehabilitate the inmates and help them in accessing health, livelihood and social security schemes, said MEPMA District Mission Coordinator Sujatha. The shelter will be manned by a full-time manager and caregivers, she told The Hindu when contacted.

182,2020/02/29,Redgram farmers unable to get MSP for their produce,"State wants Centre to procure at least 50% of estimated production

The State government is struggling hard to cope with the farmers’ demand for procurement of redgram under the price support scheme at the minimum support price of ₹5,800 per quintal this year with the targeted quantity on behalf of National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation (Nafed) has already been procured.

According to officials of the Agriculture Department, the major pulses crop has been cultivated in over 2.86 lakh hectares during 2019-20 kharif season and the production is estimated at 2.07 lakh tonnes, taking into account a conservative yield of 7.2 quintals per hectare. However, the actual average production, even according to the official sources, has been about 10 quintals per hectare.

As per the norms of the price support scheme, the Centre (Nafed) would generally procure 25% of the estimated production quantity from every State at MSP and according a target of 46,500 tonnes was given to Telangana and it was completed in only a month’s time. Later, repeated requests made to the Ministry of Agriculture, the procurement quantity was enhanced by another 4,125 tonnes to a total of 51,625 tonnes.

High yield

Sensing that the actual yield and production of redgram in the State is much higher this year with the help of favourable weather conditions, Minister for Agriculture S. Niranjan Reddy has taken up the matter with the MoA frequently requesting for increase in the procurement quantity to at least 50% of the estimated production. “He has even taken up the matter personally with Union Minister for Agriculture Narendra Singh Tomar at an ICAR event in New Delhi on Thursday,” a senior official said.

After his personal request the Minister had also sent a formal request (letter) to the Union Minister seeking to enhance the procurement quantity under the price support scheme by another 56,000 tonnes, highlighting the fact that the farmers would be forced, otherwise, to resort to distress sale to traders. Official sources stated the Chief Minister was also planning to take up the matter with the Centre to protect the interests of the farmers.

Last year crop

Official sources stated that Telangana State Cooperative Marketing Federation (TS-Markfed) was not in a position to procure the redgram produce since it already has about 24,000 tonnes stocks procured last year with it, which it has not yet been able to dispose. In the hope of getting additional quantity of procurement the State government has recently permitted Markfed to utilise ₹381 crore out of ₹1,500 crore loan borrowed from National Cooperative Development Corporation (NCDC) for procurement of maize, still available with it, for procurement of additional 56,000 tonnes of redgram.

The farmers were also facing problems due to lack of coordination between the Agriculture and Marketing departments on account of discrepancies in the list of farmers who have cultivated the crop since the lists were prepared during the initial months of kharif season.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/27qelo/article30960964.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY01REDGRAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/redgram-farmers-unable-to-get-msp-for-their-produce/article30952259.ece
183,2020/02/29,"Stalker rapes girl, sets her ablaze in Suryapet","Victim suffers severe burns on hands and stomach

A 17-year-old girl was allegedly raped and set ablaze by a man, reportedly for not accepting his love proposals, at a village in Tirumalagiri mandal on Friday night.

The incident came to light on Saturday when the girl’s father approached the local police station and filed a petition. Tirumalagiri police said the girl had suffered severe burns on her hands and stomach and was immediately shifted to the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Hospital in Warangal for emergency care.

According to the petition by the girl’s father, one Guguloth Venkatesh belonging to the same village was after his daughter for the past two years. He followed her to college, back to the village and constantly harassed her in the name of love.

The 42-year-old father, who works as a coolie and resides in Boduppal, Hyderabad, also said that a village panchayat was organised recently, warning Venkatesh to keep away from the minor girl. The girl lives along with her relatives in the village in Tirumalagiri mandal and is pursuing a paramedical course from a nearby college.

On Friday, at around 8.30 p.m., Venkatesh who made sure that no one was at home, got into an exchange with the girl, took her to the backyard and raped her. Later he poured petrol on her and set her ablaze, the father’s petition said.

The victim’s family members said her medical examination was conducted and she was kept in a critical observation unit. Tirumalagiri sub-inspector B. Daniel Kumar said the accused Venkatesh was booked for rape and attempt to murder, under various charges of the IPC and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012.

184,2020/02/29,35 lakh farmers in TS benefitted from PM Kisan Samman Nidhi,"Scheme restricted to BPL ryots completes one year

The Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi, a Centrally sponsored scheme on the lines of Rytu Bandhu but with several filters to identify beneficiaries, has completed one year and enrolled 34.81 lakh farmers which is about half their total strength in Telangana.

The scheme was formally launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh on February 24.

Observers feel the assistance of ₹ 6,000 per annum provided under the scheme as an income support to all landholding farmers’ families had not had much impact on agriculture because of the small size of amounts transferred to their bank accounts. A sum of ₹ 2,000 was transferred to accounts in three instalments but the periodicity of release was not maintained. The releases were made irrespective of the seasons and at odd intervals to suit nationwide interests.

The Samman Nidhi is applicable solely to BPL families as against comprehensive coverage of farmers based on their land holdings in Rytu Bandhu. The acreage was not a parameter but family, irrespective of its holding, was considered in Samman Nidhi.

Sources expressed the hope that the scheme would be beneficial to farmers if it was streamlined systematically. It could supplement the income of farmers under Rytu Bandhu wherein they get ₹ 5,000 per acre per season. Farmers accessing Rythu Bandhu were also eligible for Samman Nidhi provided they fulfilled the criteria.

The scheme excluded Income-Tax payees, government employees above Class IV, retired employees other than subordinate services, public servants, professionals and land holders above below poverty line. The Centre had so far released over ₹ 50,850 crore to about 8.46 crore farmers out of the targeted 14 crore in the country. The scheme was initially meant for farmers holding land up to two hectares but it was extended to cover all farmer families irrespective of the size of their holdings from June 1 last year.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/35-lakh-farmers-in-ts-benefitted-from-pm-kisan-samman-nidhi/article30952143.ece
185,2020/02/29,Italian rice variety ready for harvest in Nizamabad,"Progressive farmers experimented with rice brought from overseas

The Risota or Risotto, a northern Italian rice variety, is being cultivated in organic method by one Basetti China Gangadhar under the guidance of the progressive farmer Nagula Gangaram popularly known as Chinni Krishnudu, at Gutpa village in Makloor mandal.

“It is not cultivated anywhere in the country and we are raising it here as a challenge. The interesting thing is that we raised the nursery using rice grain and not paddy seed. Chief executive officer of Gajanan Rice Mills, Hithin Bhimani, brought one kg risota rice from an international rice exhibition held in Cologne in Germany. With which we raised the nursery and transplanted in a 60 square yards,” said Mr. Chinni Krishnudu.

Agriculture scientists in Prof. Jayashankar Agriculture University were surprised and initially did not believe it. However, after observing the crop they realised that the paddy nursery could be raised even with rice. The four-month-old crop is now about to be harvested. Since a lot of rice in the nursery was eaten away by ants in the beginning we are not expecting much quantity, he said.

The nursery was raised for 25 days before transplantation, like any other paddy variety. Water was also given to the crop like other paddy varieties. It has been transplanted amid the regular paddy varieties of 1010, Sona Masuri and BPT. Cow urine and dung, groundnut cake and neem seed powder were used as manure, said Mr. China Gangadhar.

Mr. Hithin said that he had brought one kg rice in October last as there was no seed put on display in the rice fair. Beside, international rules do not allow the seed to be brought to India.

Risota is used to prepare a special dish Risotto which is mostly consumed in northern Italy. The Risotto is a carbohydrate rich dish cooked with broth derived from meat, fish or vegetables.

Mr. Chinni Krishnudu who developed seed of several ancient varieties of rice is confident of popularising the risota seed in future as it has a good demand for export. However, he is not sure of exact quantity of its yield in Indian soils.

Govind who visited the field on Friday praised the efforts of Mr. Chinni Krishnudu and Mr. Gangadhar in cultivating an exotic variety paddy experimentally against the risk.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/j5bgzj/article30951727.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY01RISOTO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/italian-rice-variety-ready-for-harvest-in-nizamabad/article30951728.ece
186,2020/02/29,Bringing back cheetahs will pose a big challenge: scientist,"India needs a protocol on introduction of wild animals, says Lacones scientist

Days after the Supreme Court green-lighted introduction of cheetahs into India, the top scientist at the laboratory for saving extinct species says it will be a challenge. “Our work (the lab’s) on cheetahs has been in the limelight because re-introduction of any species back into nature is as challenging as a moon mission or a mission to mars,” says Karthikeyan Vasudevan of Laboratory for Conservation of Endangered Species (Lacones).

The SC recently gave the nod to the National Tiger Conservation Authority to reintroduce African cheetahs, nearly 10 years after the plea was first made. “The background extinction rates are over 100 to 1000 times due to various reasons like hunting, destruction of habitat and human intervention. Species die out naturally but when a species becomes extinct unnaturally it is like murder,” said Mr. Vasudevan. “Cheetahs became extinct due to sport hunting and recreation hunting,” he said, adding: “Cheetahs are good antelope hunters. Antelopes are adapted to dry conditions. Historically we have not cared for grasslands as we planted trees for our requirements. We had extensive flat areas but these are gone.”

Captive cheetahs were used to hunt other animals in the princely states including the Nizam's Dominions. Archival Image

Mr. Vasudevan said India will need a protocol to introduce wild animals in the country. “The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has a protocol. It has reintroduction specialist groups. It has template guidelines but we need to adapt them to our needs and we have to develop for our own species,” he said. There is a need to create provisions under the Wildlife Act for a policy on introduction of wild animals. Otherwise, citing this (cheetah introduction) many things can be done. We need to safeguard the interests of other species,” he said.

The laboratory set up in 1998 during the heady days of success after the cloning of Dolly in Scotland has had the goal of breeding cheetahs from the time of its inception. Scientists considered the Iranian cheetahs to be the closest related to the extinct Indian cheetah and have been trying to get the germplasm to carry on with the research, but without success.

One of the success efforts of Lacones has been the reintroduction of mouse deer in the wild with their captive breeding programme in collaboration with the Nehru Zoological Park in Hyderabad.

The Lacones is building up National Genetic Wildlife Bank which now has the germplasm of 23 species, including red panda, pygmy hog, asiatic lion and gharials.

187,2020/02/29,Air cooler prices likely to shoot up thanks to COVID-19,"Supply of Chinese components has been suspended, says manufacturer

The economic fallout of spread of COVID-19 has its impact even in distant composite Adilabad and surrounding areas this summer as the import of cheaper air cooler components from China got suspended. The price of assembled air coolers is set to shoot up by 20 % to 50 %, which will only burden the lower middle class.

“While the forecast of an unusually hot summer ahead was scary enough, matters got a little worse thanks to the rise in cost of air coolers,” lamented Sarsan Pradeep, a customer who came to purchase a piece at a shop selling the assembled product. “The price will rise further as the season progresses,” warned the shopkeeper in an apparent bid to sell the air cooler to the customer.

“We buy the exhaust fan motor and the water pump made with Chinese components from New Delhi,” revealed Md. Tajuddin, the wholesaler of air coolers running the biggest workshop in Adilabad town. The unit manufactures about 20,000 pieces during the season. “The price of the motor has gone up from ₹ 420 to ₹ 580 and that of the water pump has jumped up from ₹ 68 to ₹ 90,” he pointed out.

“It is but logical that there will be an increase in the price of the air cooler. We, however, have not increased the price as yet,” he hastily added. “The current wholesale price of a 2 ft (measured by height of the cooler frame) cooler is ₹ 1,250 and that of the 4 ft variety is ₹ 3,900,” he disclosed to drive home the point that the prices have not shot up as yet.

Md. Tajuddin, who supplies air coolers to places like Karimnagar, Nizamabad and even Hyderabad, sources the components like tin sheets, grass for stuffing the cooling sheets etc from Nagpur. Even the workers including assemblers and painters are from Nagpur.

The only good news for the common man is that there would be sufficient water to be used in the guzzlers that the air coolers are due to a good monsoon. The largest of these use at least 60 litres of water during a single night.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/fs9qjh/article30950997.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY01ADB-COOLER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/air-cooler-prices-likely-to-shoot-up-thanks-to-covid-19/article30950998.ece

189,2020/02/29,IIT-H planning to enhance ties with JICA,"The Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad (IIT-H) is planning a major boost to its partnership with Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) in Phase II of their collaboration.

The institute is proposing an increased collaboration with Japanese industries and academia besides research laboratories. The major emphasis is being laid on exchange of Ph.D students, Joint Masters and Ph.D. programmes, according to a release on Friday.

IIT-H is seeking to build a long-term sustainable collaboration with Japan. JICA is a governmental agency that coordinates official development assistance for the government of Japan.

Recently, JICA officials paid a visit to the campus here for terminal evaluation of the FRIENDSHIP project of IIT-H with JICA, which is ending in March this year. JICA officials are extremely happy with the outcome of the project.

The collaboration between IIT-H and Japan started in August 2007 based on the commitment between the Prime Ministers of India and Japan. A Project for Future Researchers at IIT-H to enhance network development with scholarship of Japan (FRIENDSHIP) was initiated by JICA in July 2010.

“As is evident through the numerous patents, publications, faculty, student exchanges and projects, the outcomes of the Phase I of the JICA Friendship Programme are quite rewarding. As the current FRIENDSHIP project is ending soon, we are enthusiastically looking forward to the sanction of Phase II of the FRIENDSHIP project so that we can continue to have this remarkable collaboration & take it to the greater heights for the mutual benefit of both Japan and India,” said director of IIT-H B.S. Murty.

IIT-H received significant assistance for research in five areas, namely, Next Generation Communication Technologies (NGCT), Design and Manufacturing (DM), Sustainable Development (SD), Environment and Energy (EE), and Nano Technology and Nano Science (NTNC).

191,2020/02/29,In‘quiz’itive minds at their best,"WWF organised quiz show for tribal students recently

Quizzing can elevate the level of awareness of participants, especially students from backward areas. A proof of this was the recent quiz programme organised by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) for Nature-India, ‘Vana, Vignana, Vinoda’, on nature and environment for tribal students of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh in collaboration with the Tribal Welfare departments of the respective states.

The quiz programme, which was conducted at different levels all through February and involved tribal students only, revealed that students know about the nature around them but face the handicap of being articulate about it. The quiz format seemed to have been of much help when it came to crystallising their thoughts on relevant subjects.

The month of February saw the WWF organising school and district level quiz competitions in the tribal districts, followed by the State level competition on February 25 at CII Sohrabji Godrej Green Business Centre (CII-GBC), Hyderabad. The competition at the State level was won by the students of Vemanpalli Tribal Welfare Ashram High School, Mancherial.

“Some of the participants have seen Hyderabad for the first time,” pointed out WWF State director Farida Tampal. “They are happy to learn through fun and understand what they need to do for bettering the environment,” she observed while overseeing the competitions at the CII-GBC.

Class IX students of Kalwakurthy AHS in Nagarkurnool B. Pallavai, G. Mahalaxmi and B. Pujitha, were first-time participants in any quiz show and asserted they had learnt much from this form of education. “We now know what is polluted air and use of chemicals in agriculture farms,” they revealed when asked to quote an example of the increase in their awareness about environment.

Students from both the Telugu states who had arrived to participate in the quiz were shown around the CII-GBC campus that in itself is a model of energy and environmental sustainability. The students were especially keen to understand the concept of saving energy through simple means and that of the vertical garden. Ms. Tampal was of the view that the Wild Wisdom Quiz in Telugu would make a greater impact as it involves tribal students who are the immediate stakeholders of nature and natural resources. WFF Advisory Board chairman Anil Kumar Epur and WWF volunteers attended the State level and inter-state level quiz competitions at CII-GBCtook part.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/iqh8l2/article30946207.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYD-ADILA-QUIZ,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/inquizitive-minds-at-their-best/article30946187.ece

The Meerut police have said Aleem, one of the five persons who died during the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act violence on December 20, 2019, was killed by a bullet fired by rioters. Investigating officer Ramsanjeevan of the Nauchandi police station said the investigation was still on but the CCTV footage, post-mortem and circumstantial evidence indicate that Aleem was killed by Anees, Mohsin, and Mehtab.

“Anees and Mohsin are already in jail while Mehtab is on the run. We have added Sections 301 (unintended murder), 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) and 120B of IPC to the FIR,” he said. The Inspector said a potassium nitrate test conducted on Aleem’s body for gunshot residue revealed that he handled a firearm before death. “This indicates that he could have been killed in the crossfire.”

Also read | 69 killed in 79 days since Parliament passed Citizenship Amendment Act

For a long time, police had been maintaining that Aleem was killed by unidentified men and he was brought dead to the district hospital. Mr. Ramsanjeevan said the confusion was created because the FIR of Aleem’s death was earlier lodged at the Lisadi gate police station, while he died under the Nauchandi police station area.

However, Ali Zaidi, Supreme Court lawyer who is arguing for the five victims, described it as a “bogus story” being made to save the culprit and senior police officials involved in “destruction of evidence”. “We have lodged a complaint against police officials with video evidence with the district Magistrate and Senior SP but an FIR has not been registered,” he said.

Aleem’s brother Salahuddin, alleging the role of policemen in the death, had on February 14 written to district officials that he had video evidence that Aleem was shifted to the government hospital by the Meerut police in their vehicle. Mr. Ramsanjeevan said he didn’t receive any such video evidence.

Salahuddin and Idul Hasan, father of another victim Asif, have approached the National Human Rights Commission for registration of an FIR against police officials. “Let them come up with these stories, the truth will be revealed in the courtroom,” said Mr. Zaidi.

194,2020/02/29,Only J&K will use 2011 Census for delimitation,"Provision for J&K enabled as per change in J&K Reorganisation Act, 2019; 2013 to be basis for rest of country.

The newly created Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) will be the only one in the country to undergo a delimitation exercise based on the population figures recorded in the 2011 census. The latest readjustment of boundaries of constituencies in other States and UTs has been done on the basis of 2001 census and in future it will be carried out according to the 2031 census.

A senior Home Ministry official said the unique provision for J&K was enabled through an amendment that was introduced in the J&K Reorganisation Act, 2019. The Act passed by Parliament on August 6, downgraded and bifurcated the State of J&K into two Union Territories – J&K (with a legislature) and Ladakh (without legislature). The J&K Assembly was dissolved in November 2018 and the region has been Centre’s rule since June 2018.

As per 2011 Census, the population in Kashmir region is 68,88,475, Jammu has a population of 53,78,538 and Ladakh has 2,74,289.

As per a government answer in Lok Sabha last year there are 37,33,111 voters in Jammu division, 40,10,971 voters in Kashmir division and 1,79,147 voters in Ladakh division in undivided J&K.

Delimitation was last done in J&K in the year 1995.

“Section 63 was introduced in the J&K Reorganisation Act so that delimitation exercise can be conducted smoothly without overlapping with other provisions of Delimitation Commission Act, 2002. It is a saving clause and since J&K is a UT, it now has constitutional safeguards. The provision did not require any separate legislation as it was incorporated in the primary Act,” said the official.

Section 63 (Special provisions as to readjustment of Assembly and Parliamentary Constituencies) says that “until the relevant figures for the first census taken after the year 2026 have been published,” it shall not be necessary to readjust the constituencies and any reference to the “latest census figures” in shall be construed as a reference to the 2011 census figures.

On February 17, on a request by the Department of Legislative Affairs of the Ministry of Law and Justice, Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora nominated Election Commissioner Sushil Chandra as his nominee to the proposed Delimitation Commission for J&K. The Act says that the number of seats in the Assembly of J&K would be increased from 107 to 114. The full delimitation commission for J&K is yet to be appointed.

“The delimitation will be done for 90 seats as 24 seats fall in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (PoK). The exercise will take at least a year to complete. Till then no elections can be held,” said the official.

In rest of India, Delimitation Commissions have been constituted four times -– in 1952, 1963 1973 and in 2002.

Last year, the Centre informed the Lok Sabha that J&K was not included within the purview of the Delimitation Act, 2002 as Article 170 of the Constitution of India that deals with delimitation of constituencies of State Assemblies had not been extended to J&K owing to its special status under Article 370.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ke9oor/article30952005.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/JAMMUANDKASHMIR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/only-jk-will-use-2011-census-for-delimitation/article30952006.ece

Curfew was reimposed in Shillong and other parts of the State on Saturday after a person was killed in a marketplace, taking the toll to two in as many days of communal clashes.

The situation in six districts of the State’s eastern half has been tense following Friday’s clash at Ichamati in the East Khasi Hills district between members of the Khasi Students’ Union (KSU) and non-tribals during a meeting over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the Inner Line Permit (ILP) that left one person dead and several injured.

Tribal organisations, including the KSU, have been opposing the CAA and demanding the ILP — a temporary permit for outsiders to enter the State — as is mandatory in four other north-eastern States.

Violence erupted again on Saturday morning in Shillong’s Bara Bazar after the curfew was relaxed after 10 hours since the imposition on Friday night. A vegetable vendor was stabbed and at least six others were injured. He succumbed to his injuries later.

The incident made the authorities reimpose curfew. Mobile Internet services remained suspended in six districts since Friday night while SMS services had been limited to five per day.

Chief Minister Conrad K. Sangma assessed the situation at a meeting with Home Minister Lahkmen Rymbui and the police and the civil administration. He also met Governor Tathagata Roy and briefed him on the law and order. A probe into Friday’s violence was ordered.

Every penny dispatched from Delhi was reaching its rightful beneficiary under the BJP government, Prime Minister Narendra Modi stated in Bundelkhand on Saturday.

Under the previous governments, farmers in the region were deprived of the benefits of the multi-crore Bundelkhand package, he remarked.

Mr. Modi was in Chitrakoot to lay the foundation stone for the Bundelkhand Expressway that will come up at a cost of ₹15,000 crore. The 296-km long expressway would pass through the districts of Chitrakoot, Banda, Hamirpur and Jalaun, and connect the drought-prone region to the national capital through the Agra-Lucknow Expressway and the Yamuna Expressway.

Mr. Modi said the expressway would alter lives in Bundelkhand, “creating thousands of employment opportunities” and link the region to big cities. It would “speed up” the Defence Corridor that's coming up in the region. Bundelkhand would be known for making India self-reliant in manufacture of arms and ammunition.

“The Bundelkhand region is going to become a big centre of Make in India”, Mr. Modi said in a speech bereft of any political attacks or reference to burning issues such as the violence in Delhi or the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

Instead, he listed the policies and schemes brought by his government for farmers.

The National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) has sanctioned funds to the tune of ₹400.64 crore to the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir for the current financial year, an official spokesman said on Saturday.

Against the normative allocation of ₹500 crore for the current fiscal, ₹400.64 crore was sanctioned for various projects of Public Works Department (PWD), Public Health Engineering (PHE) and animal husbandry, thus registering a cumulative achievement of 95.95%, the spokesman said.

Financial Commissioner (Finance) Arun Kumar Mehta chaired the meeting to review the performance achieved under NABARD funded projects.

The meeting discussed the sanctioned projects which include 85 rural roads and bridges, 38 water supply schemes, and two animal husbandry projects, he said.

He said the projects worth ₹99.08 crore have already been sent for sanctioning to NABARD. These include five of horticulture (fruit and vegetable market), six for extending the agriculture extension facilities, and eight for minor irrigation and flood control works.

202,2020/02/29,"BJP conspiring to destabilise Chhattisgarh govt., says Bhupesh Baghel","The Chief Minister says raids were conducted on premises of officials, associates for two days

As a string of raids against government officials and associates spilled into Friday, Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel has written to the Governor alleging the BJP government at the Centre was “conspiring to destabilise” its government and attacking federalism by conducting raids on premises of its officials.

Stating the raids intended to put pressure on his government, Mr. Baghel on Friday wrote, “The way it is being done along with the central paramilitary forces, it appears to be a direct attack on the Congress government inspired by political rancour.”

The irony, he added, was that the State government was not even informed which agency was conducting raids. “Without the prior permission of the Chhattisgarh government, central paramilitary forces have been deployed, which is unconstitutional and an interference in its jurisdiction,” he wrote. Usually, the local police accompany income tax officials during raids.

Mr. Baghel, in a memorandum signed by Cabinet Ministers, urged Governor Anusuiya Uikey to intervene in the matter, so that “democracy is preserved and the elected government can function within the contours of the constitution without fear.”

Pointing out that an alleged team of income tax officials raided residences of government officials, including those attached to his office, for the second day on Friday, he said, “The Chhattisgarh government is investigating corruption of the former Bharatiya Janata Party government and has registered several cases. Rattled by this, the Bharatiya Janata Party government at the Centre is conspiring to destabilise the Congress government.”

Mr. Baghel claimed his government, formed after Congress secured a thumping majority, had developed a unique image in the country by continuously working for people. “Our wins in byelections, urban bodies and panchayats have shocked it [BJP],” he added.

As the BJP was unable to contest the Congress through democratic means, he contended, it was resorting to unconstitutional methods “to attack the federal structure”.

“The BJP has become infamous for such vengeful acts in the world and this action has created an atmosphere of fear and terror in the country,” he wrote, adding that it was an attack on democracy, and the State’s people would not tolerate it.

The alleged income tax department teams on Thursday raided at least 25 premises linked to Chhattisgarh government officials and others on charges of tax evasion. State government officials said the teams were assisted by the CRPF, a central paramilitary force, to conduct the raids in Raipur and a few other locations.

While on Thursday teams raided residences and offices of Raipur Mayor Aijaz Dhebar; Joint Secretary, Commerce and Industries department, A.K. Tuteja; and State Real Estate Regulatory Authority chairman and former Chief Secretary Vivek Dhand, among others. A day later officials raided the residence of, among others, Saumya Chaursia, Deputy Secretary in the Chief Minister’s office.

On Tuesday, the State’s Economic Offences Wing registered a case against former Principal Secretary Aman Singh and his wife Yasmeen Singh, both considered close to the State’s former BJP government, in a disproportionate assets case.

203,2020/02/29,Madhya Pradesh High Court directs State to ban single-use plastic,"Move has to be considered “most significant moment of life”, says Bench

The Madhya Pradesh High Court has passed an order directing the State government to ban single-use plastic in the State, curb use of plastic altogether across educational institutions and make biodegradable carry bags of other material affordable for consumers.

Observing that banning plastic bags had to be considered as a “most significant moment of life”, the Division Bench in Gwalior, comprising Justices Sheel Nagu and Rajeev Kumar Shrivastava, on February 26 directed the State government to issue directions to industries to immediately stop the production and use of single-use plastic.

Furthermore, the Bench, while ordering the government to ensure bags and packets made of non-plastic, biodegradable material be made and sold at subsidised rates, asked it to encourage the small-scale industry to set up units across all districts towards this end.

Besides ordering the setting up of single-use plastic crushing machines at public places, the Bench stated plastic waste shall be used to produce at thermal power plants.

To ensure compliance, the court directed all stakeholders to submit independent progress reports to its Principal Registrar through District Collectors every three months.

The Bench, while passing the order on a public interest litigation plea, stated the time had come to make “citizens and stakeholders aware of their duties and liabilities” to deal with environmental pollution caused by plastic-use.

The court suggested that the State government incorporate in school curriculum a subject on adverse effects of plastic use and the ways to manage waste. In addition, it said, “Citizens (parents/teachers) should teach children not to use plastic bottles/ tiffin boxes in schools/ park/ malls.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/cmhodr/article30949381.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PLASTICWASTE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/madhya-pradesh-high-court-directs-state-to-ban-single-use-plastic/article30949382.ece
204,2020/02/29,Assam lecturer held for Facebook post on Delhi violence,"His arrest was based on a complaint by the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad

A college lecturer in southern Assam’s Cachar district was arrested late on Friday for his views on the Delhi riots and the role of the Hindutva forces on his Facebook page.

His arrest was based on a complaint by the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) in district headquarters Silchar, although he had deleted the “derogatory” posts and had apologised for “some irresponsible comments about a communally sensitive issue”.

Cachar Superintendent of Police Manabendra Debroy said the police acted on the complaint to pick up Souradeep Sengupta, a guest lecturer at Sichar’s Gurucharan College from his residence in the Itkhola area of the town. “He will be produced before the local court,” he said.

The court put Mr. Sengupta’s bail application on hold and sent him to judicial custody till March 2.

Mr. Sengupta was arrested under three sections of the Indian Penal Code and 66A of the Information Technology Act that defines the punishment for sending “offensive” messages through a computer or any other communication device. The IPC sections slapped against him include 295A dealing with deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings.

One of Mr. Sengupta’s cousins, declining to be quoted, said trouble for the teacher began on Thursday night when Kunaljit Dey used screenshots of the teacher’s posts and said he had insulted followers of Sanatan Dharma.

The teacher had, in one of the posts, sniffed a BJP-RSS design to “recreate Godhra in Delhi”.

“Dada (elder brother) deleted his posts soon after and apologised for inadvertently hurting religious sentiments. The matter should have ended there but some 50 ABVP members stormed his college and staged a demonstration before filing an FIR at the Silchar Sadar police station against him,” the cousin said.

“If that were not enough, the ABVP boys surrounded his house. Some them barged in and abused everyone, including his parents for not teaching ethics to their son. The police came later to arrest him,” she added.

The college principal said he was under pressure to terminate Mr. Sengupta following a memorandum by the ABVP. Mr Sengupta, members of his family said, offered to resign.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/8u4or3/article30949144.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FACEBOOKPRIVACY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/assam-lecturer-held-for-facebook-post-on-delhi-violence/article30949145.ece

The four were nabbed after a person, who was arrested on Thursday along with a huge quantity of Fake Indian Currency Note (FICN), revealed details of their hideout in Howrah, a senior officer of the Kolkata Police Special Task Force (STF) said.

The ZUF is a Manipur-based militant outfit operating in the Nagaland-Manipur border.

An amount of Rs 34,54,270 was seized from the possession of the four ZUF militants, who admitted of accumulating the booty after abducting Avijit Dhar, project manager of Simplex, on February 19 from Noney district of Manipur, he said.

“Out of the four ZUF militants, two each are from Assam and Manipur,” the officer said.

The Kolkata Police STF had on Thursday arrested an Assam resident from the city’s Dharmatala bus terminal area and seized from his possession FICN amounting to Rs 1,50,000.

“During grilling, he had informed us about his associates hiding in Howrah. A raid was conducted in Golabari Police Station area today the ZUF militants were arrested,” he said.

206,2020/02/29,"Left, Congress criticise Mamata for meeting Amit Shah","The Chief Minister has been waiting for meeting Amit Shah for four days and camping in Bhubaneshwar.

The Left parties and the Congress on Friday criticised the visit of West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee to Bhubaneshwar, where she met Union Home Minister Amit Shah at the Eastern Regional Council Meeting, along with Chief Ministers of other eastern States.

Leader of the Congress in Lok Sabha and MP from Bengal Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury alleged a “tacit understanding” between the BJP and Trinamool Congress. Mr Chowdhury alleged the Chief Minister’s meeting with the Prime Minister and Home Minister is to ensure that her party leaders are spared in the Narada and the Saradha chit fund scam investigations.

Later in the day State Congress president Somendranath Mitra, who held a rally in Kolktata against the violence in Delhi along with Mr. Chowdhury, said Ms Banerjee’s meeting with Mr. Shah indicated a “political understanding”.

Leader of the Left Legislature party in the State Assembly Sujan Chakraborty echoed the Congress’ allegations and ridiculed the meeting between Ms. Banerjee and Mr. Shah, saying it indicates the trust between “Delhi and Bengal”.

The Chief Minister has been waiting for meeting Amit Shah for four days and camping in Bhubaneshwar, Mr Chakraborty saying that there is “nothing more shameful for the people of Bengal that the Home Minister holding a rally in Kolkata after what happened in Delhi”.

Mr Chakraborty, CPI(M) MLA added that when anti-CAA protests were raging in the country in January, Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Kolkata and participated in a number of events and held a meeting with the Chief Minister.

Nod for Shah rally?

Meanwhile, the State BJP leadership expressed confidence that they will go ahead with the rally of Union Home Minister Amit Shah on March 1. When asked about the permission being denied for the use of microphones for the proposed rally at Shahid Minar Grounds, BJP State president Dilip Ghosh said the party will go ahead with whatever permission they have.

208,2020/02/29,Kolhapur varsity cancels controversial Marathi kirtankar’s talk,"Decision follows objections by rationalist outfits

A programme at Shivaji University in Kolhapur district which was to feature Marathi kirtankar (preacher) Nivrutti Maharaj Indurikar was cancelled on Friday after the event turned into a flashpoint between progressive outfits who opposed the event and right-wing outfits that supported it.

The varsity had invited Mr. Indurikar, known for addressing social issues through his kirtans (devotional songs) and sermons, and use of witty though hard-edged satire, as part of events to mark Marathi Bhasha Din (Marathi language day) which was celebrated on February 27.

Earlier on Friday, outfits led by the Kolhapur unit of Maharashtra Andhashraddha Nirmoolan Samiti (MANS) opposed Mr. Indurikar’s event, warning that they would disrupt his programme if it took place on the varsity premises.

‘Only postponed’

However, the organisers denied that the event was ‘cancelled’ owing to any external pressure and said Mr. Indurikar’s programme was merely being deferred to a later date.

“We are only postponing this event, which had been scheduled several months ago. But this is not due to any pressure from any organisation. The preacher was short of time and he had another engagement this evening. The new schedule for Indurikar Maharaj’s programme will be announced soon,” said Praveen Kodolikar, one of the organisers.

Mr. Indurikar has been at the centre of controversy following his alleged remarks during a sermon in Ahmednagar earlier this month that intercourse by a couple on an even date would beget a male child.

The preacher’s statements has drawn the ire of several activists and rationalist outfits like the MANS, who have been clamouring for a police case to be lodged against Mr. Indurikar on grounds that his comments violated provisions of the Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (PCPNDT) Act.

MANS activists claimed that it did not behove of the varsity to invite Mr. Indurikar who was known for his “derogatory remarks” on women and for his “unscientific claims”, especially on the occasion of National Science Day.

In response, right-wing outfits including the Yuva Sena (the youth wing of the Shiv Sena) backed Mr. Indurikar and said the preacher was invited to address a sermon on the occasion of Marathi language day and there were no grounds for opposing his talk.

Heated exchange

A war of words transpired between MANS activists and Yuva Sena leaders prior to the event after which both contending parties held a meeting with Dr. Devanand Shinde, the Vice-Chancellor of Shivaji University.

After the meeting, they announced that Mr. Indurikar’s programme had been postponed to a later date.

Gender rights activist and Bhumata Brigade leader Trupti Desai, too, has demanded a police case be lodged against the Marathi kirtankar despite Mr. Indurikar already issuing an apology for his remarks.

The preacher, who has a massive following in State among both men and women, has claimed that his remarks during his Ahmednagar sermon had been taken out of context.

Minister of State for Women and Child Welfare Bacchu Kadu had earlier made clear that the State government would not file a case against Mr. Indurikar as the latter was working towards enlightening people, indicating that too much fuss was being made over the preacher’s remarks.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/wmo11w/article30946829.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29BMPREACHER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/kolhapur-varsity-cancels-controversial-marathi-kirtankars-talk/article30946830.ece
209,2020/02/29,12 get life in Assam mob lynching case,"Father-son duo was attacked by 19 men over auto fare in 2013

A court in central Assam’s Karbi Anglong district on Friday awarded life imprisonment to 12 people who were convicted in a case of mob lynching seven years ago.

The police had filed a chargesheet against 19 autorickshaw drivers for the death of 16-year-old Jhankar Saikia on July 1, 2013. They had assaulted Jhankar and his lawyer-father Haren Saikia after they had refused to pay ₹30 instead of the regular fare of ₹20.

Mr. Saikia recovered but his son succumbed to injuries in a private hospital. On February 24, almost two years after the trial began in 2018, district judge Amiruddin Ahmed convicted 12 for lynching the teen and acquitted four of them.

Two others, Barlong Terang and Gibson Timung, have been absconding since the incident while another was tried by a court for juveniles. The sentence was pronounced under five relevant sections of the IPC.

A local organisation, Joint Action Committee for Autonomous State, said it was not happy with the district court’s verdict and would challenge it in the Gauhati High Court.

The judgment came a day after the Mizoram government condemned mob assault on three non-tribal traders in the State’s Mamit district on Tuesday.

The people of West Lungdar village in the district had attacked the three – two from Uttar Pradesh and one from Assam – on suspicion of being child abductors.

“The incident happened because of rumours spread via social media about strangers attempting to kidnap a 13-year-old boy in the area,” Mizoram’s Home Minister Lalchamliana said.

The assaulted trio was travelling in an SUV.

This was reminiscent of the lynching of two Guwahati-based men, Nilotpal Das and Abhijeet Nath, in Assam’s Karbi Anglong district in June 2018.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/12-get-life-in-assam-mob-lynching-case/article30946826.ece
210,2020/02/29,"Caste-based census: all-party delegation from Maharashtra to meet PM, Shah","Centre rejects January 8 resolution passed by Assembly seeking enumeration of OBCs: Speaker

An all-party delegation from Maharashtra will meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah to seek enumeration of OBCs in the 2021 census.

This was announced by Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar in Assembly on Friday after the Speaker Nana Patole asked him to make a statement on the issue.

The matter came up in Assembly after question hour when Vikas Thakre (Congress) sought to know the Union government’s reply to a resolution passed by the Assembly on January 8 urging the Centre to hold caste-based Census in 2021. Mr. Patole said the Centre has rejected the unanimous resolution passed by the House.

He read out the reply from Vivek Joshi, Registrar General & Census Commissioner of India, which said, “collection of data of OBCs, SEBCs, other castes etc. will adversely affect integrity of census exercise. Hence the enumeration of OBCs, SEBCs, other castes has not been taken up in 2021 Census which has been notified in Gazette of India on March 28, 2019.” The Census exercise would begin from April 1 and therefore the government needs to resolve the issue at the earliest, the letter said.

Bihar assembly too, few days ago, passed a similar resolution seeking caste-based census for the enumeration of the OBCs.

The letter said that total number of OBCs in the country is nearly 6,285 including sub-castes, sub-groups, synonyms etc. whereas the corresponding number of OBCs as per lists of States and UTs is 7,200. “In case, a question on OBCs is canvassed, it will return names of hundreds of thousands of castes, sub-castes as the people use their clan/gotra, sub-caste, caste interchangeably,” it said. The letter added that unlike Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes, there is no such constitutional mandate to provide census numbers of OBCs.

Senior minister and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Chhagan Bhujbal said the Centre’s excuse of “too many” caste is not valid as equal number of castes were existing in 1931 where caste-based Census was carried out. “Today we have technology, human resource which we can use to do this. I suggest that a delegation of CM, Deputy CM, LoP and senior leaders should meet PM Narendra Modi for the same,” he said.

Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis said a policy decision at the Centre needs to be taken. “BJP too is positive on this demand and I am sure that we can find out a way if we decide to meet the PM together,” he said.

Senior NCP leader and Housing Minister Jitendra Awhad said that the Assembly need not wait for Centre’s order. “The staff conducting the Census will be of State government. Let this Assembly pass a resolution asking them to include an OBC column. Let this be the guiding light for rest of the country. Let’s do OBC census of Maharashtra,” said Mr. Awhad.

Congress leader and minister Vijay Vadettiwar, and independent MLA Ashish Jaiswal seconded the demand to hold State census of OBCs, while BJP MLA Yogesh Sagar said it would not be appropriate to do so.

It was then that Mr. Patole asked Mr. Pawar to make a statement regarding the same.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/qz6ids/article30946815.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29BMCENSUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/caste-based-census-all-party-delegation-from-maharashtra-to-meet-pm-shah/article30946816.ece
211,2020/02/29,Decision soon on 5% reservation for Muslims in Maharashtra educational institutions,"The government is positive, even Shiv Sena MLAs are positive, says Nawab Malik

The State government will take a decision on bringing 5% reservation for Muslims in educational institutions soon, Minority Affairs Minister Nawab Malik said in the Legislative Council on Friday. However, the Bharatiya Janata Party demanded to know whether Shiv Sena had agreed to this as a “setting” during government formation with Congress and Nationalist Congress Party.

Mr. Malik was responding to a question by Sharad Ranpise (Congress) who wanted to know, “On July 9, 2014, the then government had come out with an ordinance allowing 5% reservation for Muslims in jobs and educational institutions and had issued orders to implement it. The High Court had approved of reservation for Muslims in government jobs and educational institutions and given such directions to the government. What is the status of this reservation and when will it be implemented?”

In his written response, Mr. Malik mentioned a 2014 interim high court order that allowed reservation in government and aided educational institutions but stayed a decision on private unaided institutions and government jobs. The ordinance did not become a law in six months and had therefore lapsed. The matter is still sub-judice, he said.

In 2018 as well as in 2019, the then Sena-BJP government had ruled out reservations for Muslims citing various court orders.

During Friday’s discussion, Bhai Girkar said, “Andhra Pradesh gave reservation to Muslims but it was rejected by Supreme Court. Then how will you do it? When reservation was given to Marathas, a commission was appointed to prove backwardness.”

Vinayak Mete (BJP) said, “The State Backward Class Commission cannot recommend reservation based on religion. In order to give a legally valid reservation, what steps will be taken?”

During the debate, Mr. Malik said, “While giving reservation to Maratha community, a lot of legal measures were taken. Similarly, a decision to give reservation to Muslims will be taken soon. The government is positive, even Shiv Sena MLAs are positive. Government will take a decision to bring it by May before admissions or as soon as possible.”

Council chairman Ramraje Nimbalkar instructed that “Sustainable reservation for Muslims should be given, do whatever is needed for it.”

Leader of Opposition Pravin Darekar sought to know the Chief Minister’s stand in the matter. In a statement issued later, Mr. Darekar said, “The Maha Vikas Aghadi’s stand has now become clear related to Muslim reservation. Now, the CM needs to make Shiv Sena’s stand clear. In the house, Aaditya Thackeray also nodded when the Minister said Shiv Sena supports this. Shiv Sena’s stand has become clear today. The minister is doing this for Muslim votes but this reservation will not stand in court. This is just an attempt to please Muslims. We are not against giving reservation to any deprived community but the CM needs to make his stand clear.”

Leader of Opposition in the Assembly and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis told reporters outside the House that, “According to the Constitution, reservation cannot be given on religious basis. Modiji has given 10% reservation to economically backward classes and Muslims and other communities get it. But there is no such provision in Constitution (about today’s announcement). This announcement is a revelation. We want to know there was ‘setting’ on which other issues during government formation, which other things has Sena agreed to by leaving its ideology and during that discussion, is it true that Sena agreed to this reservation? The Minister represents the government. We are clear that there is no such provision in Constitution. We need an explanation regarding this.”

‘No decision yet’

Meanwhile, shortly after Mr. Malik’s statement, senior Sena leader and Urban Development Minister Eknath Shinde said no such decision had been taken.

Leaders of the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi will take a call on the issue after discussions, he said. Mr. Shinde told reporters outside the legislature complex that he was not aware of Mr. Malik’s announcement on 5% reservation for Muslims.

“Leaders of the MVA will together take a call on policy decisions about giving reservation to any community. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray will take appropriate decisions at the appropriate time. No decision has been taken yet,” he said.

212,2020/02/29,Activists turned away from Assam border,"They were headed for detention centre being built in Matia

The Assam police on Friday prevented a 17-member team, comprising activists from eight States, from visiting a detention camp for foreigners here.

The team had set off from Raj Ghat in Delhi on February 23 and reached Srirampur on the Assam-West Bengal border around 1 p.m. on Friday. The bus was intercepted by scores of police and paramilitary personnel as soon as it entered Kokrajhar district from the border check gate.

The activists, including Magsaysay award winner Sandeep Pandey, had launched the ‘Delhi to Detention Centre’ trip under the banner of “Sambidhan Bachao, Nagarikta Bachao, Bharat Banao Yatra”.

Their mission was to visit the new detention centre being built at Matia in Assam’s Goalpara district, and build a human chain near it.

“We had given the district authorities in Assam prior information about the visit, but the police said they had orders to make us return. We told them to arrest us, but they detained and released us around 5 p.m. after a medical test,” Faisal Khan of Khudai Khidmatgaar told The Hindu from Siliguri in West Bengal. The team also included members of the Socialist Party India, National Alliance of People’s Movements and Justice Forum Assam.

The police said the team was denied entry as their presence in the State would have vitiated peace and tranquillity. Besides, prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the CrPC had been imposed in Kokrajhar, adjoining Dhubri and Goalpara districts.

“The team’s presence could have disturbed the fragile balance among the communities. The Deputy Commissioner issued an order and we acted accordingly,” said Anurag Agarwal, the Inspector General of Police for Bodoland Territorial Autonomous Districts.

213,2020/02/29,A new dimension to the Mahabharata,"What are the positives of Duryodhana? Watch his character from the Mahabharata come to life at the play ‘Suyodhana’ that has a different take

This weekend Sandhya Kalavidaru performs a well-acclaimed mythological play ‘Suyodhana’ a 90-minute Kannada mythological that highlights the positives of the Kourava ruler, Duryodhana, referring to him as Suyodhana. “Duryodhana is often mistaken to mean ‘bad ruler’ but his name coined from two Sanskrit words means ‘one who is extremely difficult to fight with or wage war against. This is actually why the 10th Century poet Ranna in appreciation of many other qualities of Duryodhana, referred to him as Suyodhana in one of his Kannada epics. Since our play brings out the positives of Duryodhana, we picked the name Suyodhana,” says SV Krishna Sharma, playwright and director of the play. “This would be the 120th show for ‘Suyodhana’ and I am happy that the play going on since 1977 when we first staged it, still beckons an encore. The play makes people contemplate while considering the larger picture,” says Sharma, founder of the 40-year-old drama troupe Sandhya Kalavidaru who has also acted as Suyodhana in 100 shows.

Known for his lateral thinking and taking interesting episodes from the epics Ramayana and the Mahabharata, Sharma recently staged Poulasthyana Pranaya Kathe where the researched work showed the other side of Ravana. “When we have a large epic that has multi-layered stories within which characters reveal themselves due to situational psychology, we need to show them in all shades. Based on saint Vyasa’s Mahabharata, and many Sanskrit and Kannada works, I have delved into the character of Duryodhana to have a narrative that is sympathetic towards many of his actions,” says Sharma.

‘Suyodhana’s narrative is seen through the eyes of Duryodhana who justifies his decisions and actions, that later culminates in the colossal war of Kurukshetra between the cousins Kouravas and the Pandavas. ‘Suyodhana’ the last survivor, reflects on the turn of events, people and the rational behind his defeat, despite having a bigger army.

The play begins with Duryodhana’s role towards the end of the 18-day epic battle. Duryodhana is at the Vishampayana lake, deep in grief after losing his kith and kin in the bloodshed, including his close associate Karna. Krishna tells Duryodhana to pick his opponent from the Pandavas for the final clash. Krishna chooses Bheema, and in the mace battle that follows, GadhaYuddha, between Bheema and Duryodhana, Duryodhana’s skill and technique of weaponry comes through. After a long and brutal battle between the two disciples of Balarama, as Duryodhana begins to exhaust Bheema, Krishna signals Bheema to hit Duryodhana on his thigh - his weak point. “That is against the rules of fair play as it is a clever pitch by Krishna. Isn’t this a clear cheat,” asks Duryodhana. “Even as children when we were studying warfare, it was Dronacharya who favoured Arjuna. And why did Krishna choose to be become Arjuna’s sarathy (charioteer) when both of us had gone to Krishna for help before the war?” Duryodhana’s outcry yields no answers, but soon gets to witness Krishna’s Viswaroopa in the battlefield, underlining His divine powers to balance the good and the evil.

“But from Duryodhana’s perspective, he fought bravely and for the just reasons,” explains Sharma adding that the play has eight male characters with no female on stage. All the actors are IT professionals, apart from one senior officer from BSNL. Narendra Kashyap as Suyodhana, along with Kuldeep Somayaji , V Ranganath Rao, V Ashok, Pradeep Anche, Madhukar, Manoj Kumar and Madhusudhan will take to the stage. Music by Krishna Sharma also includes slokas from the Bhagavad Gita.

214,2020/02/29,Klaasen’s ton lifts SA against Australia,"A maiden international century by Heinrich Klaasen lifted South Africa after it made a poor start in the first one-day international against Australia at Boland Park on Saturday.

Klaasen hit an unbeaten 123 in a South African total of 291 for seven after home captain Quinton de Kock won the toss and decided to bat on an easy-paced pitch in hot, windy weather.

South Africa was 48 for three when Klaasen went to the wicket. He shared stands of 78 for the fourth wicket with Kyle Verreynne, who made 48 on his international debut, and 149 for the fifth wicket with David Miller (64).

Klaasen, 27, was playing in his 15th ODI. He more than doubled his previous highest score of 59. He faced 114 balls and hit seven fours and three sixes on a day when boundaries were scarce on a large outfield.

Pat Cummins was Australia's best bowler, taking three for 45.

Rabada injured

Meanwhile, Kagiso Rabada has been ruled out of South Africa’s three-match ODI series against India after sustaining a groin strain.

The 24-year-old will be out of action for four weeks.

Brief scores: South Africa 291/7 in 50 overs (K. Verreynne 48, H. Klaasen 123 n.o., D. Miller 64; M. Starc 2/59, P.

215,2020/02/29,New Zealand rallies to beat Bangladesh,"Seamer Hayley Jensen and off-spinner Leigh Kasperek took three wickets apiece as New Zealand produced a tremendous comeback to beat Bangladesh by 17 runs in a low-scoring match at the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup here on Saturday.

The White Ferns were left in a spot of bother having been bowled out for 91 in 18.2 overs but their bowlers produced a stunning display to dismiss Bangladesh 17 runs short.

Bangladesh was dismissed for 74.

Not enough

Ritu Moni’s (4/18) first four-wicket haul, the best figures of the tournament so far, was not enough to steer Bangladesh to a historic victory.

It was only the third time the White Ferns had been kept under 100 runs at a World Cup, but it was clear they weren’t going to go down without a fight as Jensen (3/11) and Kasperek (3/23) made amends.

Finding itself at 32 for three at the midway point, Bangladesh’s attempt to lower the asking rate proved costly.

The win for New Zealand means Group A is perfectly set up for a trans-Tasman showdown on Monday, with the winner set to reach the semifinals.

The scores: New Zealand 91 in 18.2 overs (Rachel Priest 25; Ritu Moni 4/18, Salma Khatun 3/7) bt Bangladesh 74 in 19.5 overs (Hayley Jensen 3/11, Leigh Kasperek 3/23).",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/w29j2/article30952158.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH01KIWIS,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/nz-rallies-to-beat-bangladesh/article30952159.ece
216,2020/02/29,Jamieson — hungry for more,"Four wickets in the first innings in Wellington and a five-for on day one here. After the first Test Kyle Jamieson had oozed confidence and belief. “I am going to make rapid strides,” he had said.

Firepower

Jamieson’s arrival on the scene has given the Kiwi pace attack more firepower. Here was someone tall who would push the batsmen back with his height and bounce and then pitch the ball up to have the batsmen caught at the crease.

Or he could get the ball to seam away with bounce from a good length. It is this combination of movement and lift that makes Jamieson so difficult to negotiate.

After the day’s play, Jamieson spoke more about the team than himself. He said, “I think, the high point [of the day] was how good we were — to take those wickets, restrict the Indians, and being without loss at stumps was massive.”

The beanpole seamer added, “We were clear in our plans, bowled in partnerships. The ball moved around a bit.”

Asked about the surface at the Hagley Oval, Jamieson said, “It probably doesn’t do as much as it does in Wellington. It is truer.”

Jamieson felt the Kiwis took wickets at critical moments. “The way Tim (Southee) bowled before and after lunch and the breakthrough (Neil) Wagner got before Tea were crucial.”

Queried on the Indian batting, Jamieson said, “They played more shots. The pitch allowed them to as well. They were playing shots off the short ball but looked a bit indecisive there.”

The paceman added, “The way the ball bounced at Wellington, it took a few of their shots out of the game. Here they could play them. So the margin for error became smaller for a bowler.”

Jamieson has a lot more left to do in the Test. And he’s got an appetite for wickets.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/rjt5f9/article30951929.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH01TIM,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/jamieson-hungry-for-more/article30951930.ece
217,2020/02/29,Ranji Trophy semifinal | Majumdar to Bengal’s rescue again,"Shahbaz and Akash lend support; Abhishek becomes ﬁrst batsman to be dismissed through DRS

Anustup Majumdar hammered another splendid unbeaten century to perform a familiar rescue act for Bengal on the opening day of the Ranji Trophy semiﬁnal against Karnataka at the Eden Gardens here on Saturday.

Also read: Ranji Trophy semifinals | Limited DRS set to make debut

Majumdar’s second consecutive hundred (120 batting, 173b, 18x4, 1x6) pulled Bengal out of trouble — from a disastrous 67 for six to 275 for nine at stumps — in the ﬁrst innings. Familiar collapse Bengal, put in, needed to see oﬀ the morning session, in which the Karnataka seamers generated movement and applied pressure from both ends.

But the hosts experienced another familiar collapse. Abhishek Raman, who became the ﬁrst batsman to be dismissed through DRS in the tournament, was caught behind in the third over while trying to drive Abhimanyu Mithun outside the oﬀstump.

Abhimanyu Eawaran played Prasidh Krishna to short mid-wicket, Arnab Nandi got a gem of a delivery from Mithun and an aggressive Manoj Tiwary fell to K. Gowtham. More strikes Sudip Chatterjee, returning after two months, patiently consumed two hours before being adjudged lbw oﬀ Ronit More at the stroke of lunch. More completed his unﬁnished over after the break by sending back Shreevats Goswami.

Majumdar, who saved Bengal on three earlier occasions, had his plans in place. The 35-year-old combined with Shahbaz Ahmed to play positively on a surface that had eased out. Majumdar drove beautifully and ﬂicked gracefully to relieve the pressure with some boundaries. Shahbaz (35, 50b, 7x4) also did not let any chance go waste. Useful partnership The two put up the ﬁrst substantial partnership (72) of the innings as they put pressure on the Karnataka ﬁelding.

The exit of Shahbaz, whowas bamboozled by Mithun, did not halt Bengal’s progress. Akash Deep (44, 72b, 3x4, 3x6), coming back from an injury, hit three sixes oﬀ Gowtham while giving good support to Majumdar. They added an invaluable 103 runs for the eighth wicket in less than two hours. Following the departure of Akash, who fell leg-before to Gowtham, Majumdar pulled Mithun to the fence to reach his ninth century.

Brief Scores:

Bengal: B — 1st innings: Abhishek Raman c Sharath b Mithun 0, Abhimanyu Easwaran c Gowtham b Prasidh 15, Sudip Chatterjee lbw b More 20, Arnab Nandi c Sharath b Mithun 17, Manoj Tiwary c Rahul bGowtham 8, Anustup Majumdar (batting) 120, Shreevats Goswami lbw b More 0, Shahbaz Ahmed b Mithun 35, Akash Deep lbw b Gowtham 44, Mukesh Kumar c Sharath b Prasidh 7, Ishan Porel (batting) 0; Extras (b-2, lb-1, nb-5, w-1): 9, Total (for nine wkts. in 82 overs): 275

218,2020/02/29,Ranji Trophy semifinal | Gujarat bowlers keep Saurashtra in check,"Sheldon Jackson and Chirag Jani’s partnership holds the key for the host

Gujarat bowlers stuck to their task of testing Saurashtra batsmen’s patience to gain early advantage on the opening day of the Ranji Trophy semiﬁnal at the Saurashtra Cricket Association stadium.

Also read: Ranji Trophy semifinals | Limited DRS set to make debut

Visiting captain Parthiv Patel’s decision to insert Saurashtra in raised a few eyebrows on a hazy morning since the strip — despite the tinge of green on the surface, primarily to bind the pitch together for the ﬁve-day affair — is a typical Rajkot ﬂatbed. But the manner in which his bowlers, except an oﬀ-colour Roosh Kalaria, stuck to their task of bowling a ﬁfth-stump line justiﬁed the decision at the end of the day.

With Saurashtra top-order succumbing to the temptation of playing away from the body, the home team posted 217 for ﬁve. In-form pair of Sheldon Jackson (69 n.o., 132b, 169m, 10x4, 1x6) and Chirag Jani (16 n.o., 66b, 82m, 2x4) stitched together a 55-run stand.

Thrice before the unbroken partnership did Saurashtra look set for a big partnership but lost wickets in quick succession. Openers Harvik Desai (35, 148b, 192m, 7x4) andKishan Parmar (37, 73b, 109m, 6x4) managed to see through the morning spells by Gujarat’s three-pronged pace attack. While Harvik displayed his tight defence and judged oﬀ-stump well, Parmar was fortunate twice (caught oﬀ a no-ball in slips on 3 and dropped at deep ﬁne-leg by Roosh Kalaria on 36) to deprive Chintan Gaja of a wicket.

Just when boundary balls had started trickling in, Parmar’s attempted cut oﬀ Axar Patel resulted in an edge on to the stumps. Avi Barot then had a ﬂurry of boundaries to take Saurashtra to 89 for one at lunch, but just when Harvik and Barot’s association

appeared threatening, Gujarat struck in successive overs. Harvik’s uppish slice was caught by a lunging Bhargav Merai at cover-point gaving Axar his second scalp, while Arzan Nagwaswalla was rewarded with Barot’s extravagant drive lobbing to covers. At 102 for three, Jackson resurrected the innings along with Vishwaraj Jadeja but Nagwaswalla shifted the balance back in Gujarat’s favour after tea.

Vishwaraj edged the left-arm seamer to Parthiv while leftie Arpit Vasavada poked the ﬁrst ball to Rujul Bhatt in the slips. Jani then saved the hattrick and gave Jackson the vital support to see the day oﬀ. But the duo’s work is far from done if the home team is to claw its way back in the Gujarat Derby.

219,2020/02/29,"ICC Women’s T20 World Cup | Shafali given freedom to play natural game, says Harmanpreet","The 16-year-old announced her emergence on the global stage by becoming the second highest run getter in the ongoing tournament.

India skipper Harmanpreet Kaur on Saturday said the team management has given Shafali Verma the freedom to play her natural game, which has set the Women’s T20 World Cup ablaze.

The 16-year-old announced her emergence on the global stage by becoming the second highest run getter in the ongoing tournament. She has so far scored 161 runs, hitting 18 fours and nine sixes in four matches at an astounding strike rate of 161.

On Saturday, Shafali hit a 34-ball 47 to steer India to a seven-wicket victory over Sri Lanka after spinner Radha Yadav produced a career-best 4/23.

“Shafali is someone who loves to play big shots, and we don’t want to stop her. She should continue doing the same and she should continue enjoying her game,” Harmanpreet said after the match.

India entered the semifinals with an all-win record as they led Group A with eight points from four games and the captain insisted it is important to continue the winning momentum.

“It’s really important to keep the momentum when you are winning games. You really work hard, so you can’t afford to lose that momentum. You can’t bowl same pace and lengths on these wickets, so you need to keep rotating the bowlers.”

The skipper, herself known to be a power hitter, has endured a poor start to the tournament by failing to reach double digit scores. However, against Sri Lanka, she hit two boundaries and a maximum.

“Today I tried to be positive and got a few boundaries. In the upcoming games I’ll try to give my best,” Harmanpreet said.

Meanwhile, Sri Lanka skipper Chamari Atapattu rued the reprieves given by her side to Shafali in the form of two dropped catches.

“I think that score was not enough, we lost couple of chances, specially Shafali, it was hard to stop her,” she said.

“Yeah, I got a good start but unfortunately got out in the 10th, would have wanted to stay in there till the 16th or the 17th over. I hope we can beat Bangladesh in our last game,” she added.

Radha Yadav praises Narendra Hirwani

Spinner Radha Yadav hailed the impact of bowling coach Narendra Hirwani after claiming a career-best 4/23.

India’s spinners have been the talk of the tournament so far in Australia and Yadav was the latest to shine, laying the foundation for their win.

But the left-arm spinner, who was not in the starting XI when Poonam Yadav spun a web around Australia in their opener, was reluctant to take the credit herself and heaped praise on former India spinner Hirwari for getting her back to her best.

“Narendra has been with us since the West Indies tour last year in November. He has definitely worked a lot on my bowling,” Yadav said.

“My mindset often gets jumbled and I start overthinking about a lot of things, especially my action and my deliveries in general, but he has supported me a lot by freeing my mind up and clearing the clutter.”

India head into the semifinal of the tournament with a 100 percent win record and Yadav is hoping for a better show in the coming days.

“We were working hard for this, so I’m really happy that we have won four consecutive matches. I’m feeling good in general now and I want to do even better in the semifinals.”

After Yadav flummoxed the Sri Lankan batters with her match-winning bowling performance, Shafali Verma showed her class again by hitting a 34-ball 47.

Sri Lanka were left to rue their dropped catches -- two off Shafali’s blade. Kavisha Dilhari spilled one at extra cover before Sathya Sandeepani also failed to hold on to an offering from Shafali.

Captain Chamari Athapaththu, who scored 33, knows dropped catches against match winners have cost her side but also recognised the need for others to step up alongside her in the middle.

“We dropped Sophie Devine twice, then we dropped Rachael Haynes twice and now Shafali Verma. Catches win matches, and we have to be taking them when aggressive batters give them, otherwise we can’t stop them,” she said. ricket.

“India are a great team and I hope to see them play in the final,” she added.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/rft8ni/article30950059.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Shafali-Harmanpreet,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/icc-womens-t20-world-cup-shafali-given-freedom-to-play-natural-game-says-harmanpreet/article30950060.ece
220,2020/02/29,"NZ vs IND second Test: Should have stuck at it, says Vihari","Timing of set batsmen’s dismissals rock the boat

Hanuma Vihari is quietly efﬁcient. He is not one of those modern high batspeed batsmen who demolish attacks. Vihari’s strength is solidity in the middle-order. He gets behind the line, into good positions and can construct an innings.

By his standards, Vihari’s 70-ball 55 with 10 boundaries — he was the top-scorer for India — was an unusually brisk innings here on Saturday.

Vihari said: “It was a personal decision to play positively, score runs when the ball was short. And the pitch too had more pace. The ball was coming on to the bat.” About his dismissal at the stroke of Tea, Vihari mulled, “Perhaps, it was one shot too many.”

In fact, Vihari said all three batsmen who made half-centuries in the Indian innings — himself, Prithvi Shaw and Chesteshwar Pujara — got out at the wrong time.

“We would have been happier if we had got over 300. One of us should have made a hundred,” he said. Vihari said the Indians had discussed how to put the Kiwi attack under more pressure. “The bounce sometimes is spongy and it can get diﬃcult to play shots.” On the threat from Kyle

Jamieson, Vihari said, “He’s a tall bowler, gets bounce. Then he can strike with the deliveries he pitches up.” Vihari felt the scoreboard did not reﬂect the intensity with which the Indian pacemen bowled in the evening. He’s nothing if not combative.

The win meant India entered the semifinals with an all-win record. This was India’s fourth successive victory in the tournament as the Harmanpreet Kaur-led side consolidated their position on top of the group with eight points.

The 16-year-old Shafali, who was dropped twice in the second and fourth over, hit seven fours and a six in her knock but was unable to reach her maiden fifty for the second time in the tournament, getting run-out in the 11th over.

Mandhana mistimed the ball to Kavisha Dilhari in the fifth over while the skipper departed while trying to clear the long on fielder in the 10th over.

For Sri Lanka, Udeshika Prabodhani (1/13) and Shashikala Siriwardene (1/42)picked up a wicket each, before the duo of Jemimah Rodrigues (15) and Deepti Sharma (15) sealed the victory.

Earlier, Sri Lanka were dealt a blow when opener Umesha Thimashini (2) tried to go for a big shot off a Deepti Sharma delivery, only to be caught by Rajeshwari Gayakwad in the third over.

In-from skipper Atapattu (33) continued to attack, hitting five fours and a six, and stitched a 30-run partnership with Harshitha Madavi (12).

However, left-arm spinner Gayakwad tightened the screws in the eighth over, bowling a wicket maiden while dismissing Madavi.

The introduction of Radha in the ninth over worked as immediately after hitting a six over deep wicket, the Sri Lankan captain was caught at square leg.

Sri Lanka then suffered a batting collapse as Radha accounted for Hansima Karunaratne (7) and Hasini Perera (7) in her next over. She also dismissed wicket-keeper Anushka Sanjeewani (1).

The Indian spinners dominated the proceedings as besides Radha, Gayakwad (2/18) picked up two wickets, while Deepti (1/16), Shikha Pandey (1/35), and Poonam Yadav (1/20) took one apiece.

222,2020/02/29,NZ vs IND: Jamieson cuts a swathe through Indian batting,"Lanky paceman’s ﬁve-for negates good work done by Pujara, Vihari and Shaw; New Zealand makes sedate start

A carnival atmosphere prevailed at the Hagley Oval, with its hills and lovely white canopies. The trees around the ground swayed in the wind.

Amidst the pleasant surroundings, an intense battle was playing out. A giant of a predator was gobbling up batsmen with his oﬀ-stump line, steep bounce and subtle movement. Ruthless Kyle Jamieson, all of 6’8”, has agaze that is cold and a bowling style that is ruthless in the way it probes the batsmen in the corridor. His ﬁve for 45 derailed the Indian innings on the opening day of the second Test here on Saturday.

Inserted, India was dismissed for 242. On a green surface where there was good carry and a measure of seam movement, the Indians were more positive in their approach but lost wickets at regular intervals. New Zealand, in reply, was 63 without loss with southpaw Tom Latham and Tom Blundell, secure in defence and striking the ball with conﬁdence and timing.

Earlier, the Kiwi pace pack seldom allowed the Indians to breathe easy. They changed angles, mixed lengths and created opportunities. From 195 for four, when Hanuma Vihari gloved an attempted pull oﬀ Neil Wagner’s short-pitched delivery at the stroke of Tea, the Indian innings went on a downward spiral. Vihari (55) had a slice of luck early — he was dropped on nine in front of ﬁrst slip by ’keeper B-J. Watling after Jamieson’s short-ball-fullerlength routine — but went on to play some spanking shots, pulling, slashing, cover-driving and ﬂicking for runs. But, he should have read the situation before Tea better. Set batsmen should not give their wicket away at critical points.

His dismissal ended the 81-run partnership for the ﬁfth wicket. Same was the case with the experienced Pujara after Tea. He, fatally, attempted to hook Jamieson from the oﬀstump even as the delivery was climbing into him. This was a more positive innings from Pujara (54). Between periods of defence — he batted with a more elaborate back-lift — Pujara essayed some lovely strokes such as the cover-drive and on-drive oﬀ Trent Boult.

Southpaw Rishabh Pant was put down by Colin de Grandhomme at mid-wicket on three, but perished soon, freeing his arms against Jamieson, when the bowler gave him little width to do so, and playing on. Another left-hander Ravindra Jadeja fell, unable to keep a hook oﬀ Jamieson down. The Indian wickets fell in a heap.

In the morning, Mayank Agarwal departed early, playing across a full-length ball from left-armer Boult to be trapped in front. Counter-attack Prithvi Shaw, though, was oﬀ

like a runaway train. And he played a brand of counter-attacking cricket that was fearless. On view during his attractive 54 were lightness of feet and bat-speed. Tim Southee erred in length and Shaw rocked back to smack

him past point. When Southee pitched up, Shaw drove straight. Shaw reached his half-century with a top-edged pull oﬀ Neil Wagner; the ball eluded Jamieson’s outstretched hands at ﬁne-leg. Shaw was living dangerously. He soon fell as Jamieson moved one away; Shaw ﬂashed and Latham took a one-handed blinder at second slip. Tim Southee dragged Virat Kohli across the crease after lunch. The India captain was looking for an outswinger but the ball swung back into the right-hander. Caught right in front, Kohli opted for awasteful review. Making the right moves Then Southee prised out Ajinkya Rahane with a little bit of trickery. Rahane was playing the ball late, leaving deliveries outside oﬀ, but this one delivered wide of the crease was angled into Rahane, so he had to play at it. The sphere then swung away a tad, taking the outside edge. Taylor held on to a smart catch in the cordon. The sun came out in all its glory after rain in the morning. And the Kiwis made all the right moves.

223,2020/02/29,Ranji Trophy semifinals | Limited DRS set to make debut,"Rival captains welcome the move

Two words that will draw the attention of cricket followers during the Ranji Trophy semifinal between Gujarat and Saurashtra will be “limited DRS”. As the Decision Review System’s budget avatar makes its debut in domestic cricket, both captains remained guarded about the technological aide, despite welcoming the move.

“It’s a very good call. We have seen in the past umpiring has at times impacted outcomes. So when you have technology at your disposal, you should always try and use it. It’s a welcome decision by the BCCI. It’s going to be a new experience, that too in a big match. It’s limited DRS but still it’ll help in avoiding errors,” said Parthiv Patel, the Gujarat captain, on Monday.

Unlike the international arena, technology will be limited to a slow-motion camera, a pitch map along with spin vision — which tracks the ball behind a bowler’s arm till it’s delivered — to assist the television umpire. Each team will have four reviews in every innings.

While the pace of the game is likely to slow down further, it will be interesting to see how the teams — with the majority of players having not yet experienced DRS even in IPL — end up using the technological assistance.

“It will definitely be tricky since it’s being used for the first time and no one is familiar with it,” said Saurashtra captain Jaydev Unadkat. “It’s going to be challenging not only for the players but even for umpires. I hope it turns out well.” That S. Ravi, the only contemporary umpire who has been a part of ICC’s Elite Panel, will be officiating should be a boost for Rohan Pandit at the other end and television umpire C.

The Association’s coordinator told mediapersons that 42 units in the district were supplying 60,000 water cans during rainy season and over one lakh water cans during summer to houses, commercial establishments and hospitals. Over 4,000 dealers and 10,000 door delivery persons were involved in the industry. But 33 units have been sealed by officials, affecting the supply of packaged drinking water cans to consumers, he said. Only after clearing 55 types of water tests and obtaining no objection certificates, units were bottling the water and marketing them.

“Since 33 units were sealed, unauthorised units have started supplying water”, he said and claimed that poor quality water was supplied through Corporation’s reverse osmosis plants in the city.

Mr. Ganesan said that the government order issued by the Public Works Department in 2014 was being implemented from 2017. The order states guidelines for issue of no objection certificate in safe, semi-critical, critical and over exploited blocks periodically.

“Water availability changes in the blocks and hence established units cannot be relocated according to it”, he said and sought exemption from the government order.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/packaged-drinking-water-manufacturers-seek-exemption-from-government-order/article30952514.ece
226,2020/02/29,Elephant deaths: Jerahalli forest rangeofficer placed under suspension,"Forest guard, personnel in the range to face action for laxity in patrolling

A day after two wild elephants were electrocuted at a farm land in Karalavadi village at Talavadi, Jerahalli forest range officer Kantephen was placed under suspension on Saturday.

V. Naganathan, Chief Conservator of Forest and Field Director, Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve (STR), issued orders placing Kantephen under suspension. He also directed the Hasanur Division Forest Officer and Deputy Director K.V. Appala Naidu to initiate action against forest guard and forest personnel in the range for failing to carry-out patrolling in the area.

On Friday, a six-year-old male elephant and a five-year-old female elephant had come into contact with an electric fence put up around and inside a sugar cane field belonging to V. Karuppasamy. The field is located around five km from Jerahalli Forest Range in Hasanur Forest Division. The elephants had reportedly entered the field in the late hours of Thursday.

On Saturday, forest officials removed the electric fencing installed at the farmland. During inquiry, it was found that farmer had erected the fence around his three-acre land and inside the field to keep wild boars away. Power supply to the fence was drawn from the main electric box. Earlier in the day, villagers questioned the forest officials for failing to ensure measures to prevent wild animals from entering farmlands in the area. They said that their crops were frequently damaged by wild animals and sought adequate compensation. Later, police personnel were posted at the spot.

A team led by K. Ashokan, wildlife veterinary surgeon at Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve (STR), autopsied the carcasses and buried them in the same location.

A special team has been formed to nab the farmer, who is at large.

Aravind A hesitates to shake hands when we meet at the paediatric department of Coimbatore Medical College Hospital (CMCH). “It is covered in paint,” he says. Aravind is one of the volunteers engaged in painting the walls at the hospital.

This project is part of Vannam, an initiative by the NGO Chandran’s Yuva Foundation in association with Sri Krishna Adithya College of Arts and Science. “We wanted to make the walls livelier for the kids.

We hope that this makes them happy and facilitates their fast recovery,” says S Sasikala, the foundation’s chairman and CEO. “I got the idea in January and spent a month finalising what will go on each wall. The students are now painting the wards and the corridors on three floors. There are around 450 art works in total.”

One painting shows a child painting a sapling; another is of kids collecting garbage. Social consciousness seems to have been the theme. Sasikala agrees. “I stayed away from popular cartoons consciously. I hope this influences them to be socially responsible citizens,” she explains. The NGO started preparing the walls last week. A team of 10 volunteers — transgenders and people with special needs — cleaned and drew the outlines for the paintings. “We identified people with an interest in art,” she says. It took them 10 days to finish. The second phase of filling in the colours was taken over by 300 students “also members of Chandran’s Yuva Club that functions in 10 educational institutions,” Sasikala explains.

Venkat S is busy painting a tiger. “I have been here since yesterday. It feels good to see children smile when they see my work. A little girl gifted me one of her drawings yesterday,” he says. Another volunteer Rohith M adds that many parents congratulated them and offered them snacks. Gethciyan T says that the colourful walls have cheered up her five-year-old son Levi Joyson A who has been admitted for fever. “I tell him stories based on these paintings now,” she says. Four-year-old Sugitha B shows me her drawings. Her mother Krishnaveni says, “She asked if I could buy her art supplies when she saw the volunteers work.”

This is Vannam’s second project. “Last year we painted the walls of Ukkadam bus stand and the theme was Tamil Culture. We painted temples, dance forms and food of the region. We plan to paint the walls of the blood bank and wards for people with special needs in CMCH soon,” says Sasikala.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/lb8u0/article30949420.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/WALLPAINTING5,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/the-paediatric-department-of-coimbatore-medical-college-hospital-gets-a-makeover/article30949421.ece

The State Highways Department is taking efforts to ensure that traffic flow is not affected as it continues the flyover work on Trichy Road at Sungam junction and Ramanathapuram junction.

An official of the Department said that construction of the flyover, which started last March, was scheduled to be completed by end of March next year. The ₹ 250-crore project was to have a four-lane flyover for 3.15 km on Trichy Road till Stock Exchange building, covering Sungam and Ramanathapuram junctions. It would have 121 pillars in total, including nine pillars for the down ramp, and 120 spans. Nearly 40 % of the work was over, the official said.

The Department had also written to the Coimbatore Corporation to remove the encroachments on Ukkadam bypass road so that the down ramp works could start.

“We have marked the encroachments. These need to be removed,” the official said.

On regulating traffic on Trichy Road, the official added that vehicle movement would not be stopped at the Sungam junction. When the span work would be on at the junction, traffic would be regulated to use the road where the work was over.

When works were taken up at the Ramanathapuram junction, vehicle movement would have to be blocked for a couple of days. But it would be done only later.

A couple of road users said the motorable space had shrunk because of the flyover work. The waste on the roadsides should be cleared and parking should not be permitted so that moving vehicles would get a little more space to use.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/rfm3fp/article30946545.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB29FLYOVER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/flyover-work-not-to-affect-vehicle-movement-on-trichy-road/article30946546.ece

Incendiary slogans of “Shoot the traitors” — raised by BJP leaders during the recent election campaign — were shouted at one of the busiest stations on the Delhi Metro network and during a peace march in the centre of the city on February 29, as Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal issued an appeal to displaced residents of riot-hit northeast Delhi to return to their homes.

The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) deputed a fact-finding team to investigate cases of communal violence in the national capital, where at least 42 people were killed and over 200 injured between February 23 and 25.

Though no violence was reported in the riot-affected northeast district, residents of the affected areas were hesitant to resume work. Though many shops re-opened, the shopkeepers said the employees were scared to return.

Assuming charge as acting Commissioner of Police, S.N. Srivastava said his first priority was to bring back peace and communal harmony to the city. He also said the police were registering riot cases and including murder sections to the charges to ensure that such incidents don’t happen again.

The police continued to patrol the areas and a heavy deployment of security personnel was seen across the district. Senior officials held meetings with residents to restore peace in the area.

According to the police, a total of 167 FIRs have been registered and 885 persons have been held in connection with the riots. The police also claim that social media accounts and web pages which were circulating offensive content have been suspended. Delhi Police PRO M.S. Randhawa said no PCR call regarding rioting was received on February 29.

Earlier on February 29, a group of five to six men wearing saffron T-shirts and kurtas allegedly engaged in sloganeering on a train about to halt at the Rajiv Chowk Metro and continued shouting slogans after getting off train. Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) personnel, responsible for the security of the Delhi Metro, intercepted the group and handed them over to the Delhi Police.

The CBSE had earlier postponed board examinations in up to 86 centres in East and North East Delhi between February 26 and 29, due to the unrest there. These centres are all Delhi schools, which will now stay closed until March 7, as per the state government's order.

“The board has filed an affidavit in Delhi High Court and the court has directed Delhi Police and Delhi government to ensure safety of students and render all help to conduct exams in these areas,” said a CBSE spokesperson.

Meanwhile, following Mr. Kejriwal’s announcement of compensation for riot victims, several people, on February 29, queued up at the North-East Delhi SDM office to complete the required formalities.

While victims were required to bring their government IDs, volunteers assured those who turned up, that in cases where documents have been destroyed, authorities would carry out the verification by using phone numbers or the Aadhar biometrics. Many of those who turned up at the SDM office also raised questions over the procedure as authorities were not issuing a receipt against the applications being submitted.

While a majority of protesters chanted “Jai Shree Ram” and “Bharat Mata ki Jai”, some in the march raised slogans such as “shoot the traitors” and “bring the traitors out”.

The protesters used #DelhiAgainstJehadiViolence on almost all placards. The same hashtag was used by Mr. Mishra in his tweets.

Mr. Mishra had led a gathering in support of the CAA at Maujpur Chowk in Jafarabad area in north-east Delhi on Sunday, after which violence erupted between pro and anti-CAA groups.

During his pro-CAA demonstration at Maujpur Chowk, Mr. Mishra issued an ultimatum to the police to vacate the roads blocked by anti-CAA protesters in Jafarabad and Bhahanpura areas in three days, warning that he would come back on to the streets if no action was taken.

On Saturday, the march started from Jantar Mantar after a meeting in which Mr. Mishra also took part. Asked about the aim of the march and its demands, Mr. Mishra refused to comment.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/buxern/article30949481.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH29DL-Peace-March,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/delhi-violence-kapil-mishra-participates-in-connaught-place-peace-march/article30949482.ece

238,2020/02/29,Bodies of brothers fished out of drain in Gokalpuri,"Two of them were returning home when they were allegedly murdered

Two of his daughters had the opportunity to grow up before their father’s eyes but their third sibling will not be able to. Mohammad Aamir was on his way back with his 16-year-old brother Hashim, when they were allegedly murdered and their bodies dumped into a drain in Gokalpuri during the communal clash on Tuesday night.

On Thursday, two bodies were pulled out of the drain in Ganga Vihar. Later, the deceased were identified as Mohammad Aamir (24) and his younger brother Hashim.

“They went to visit their maternal grand mother’s home in Sundar Nagari. Amir had called around 8.30 p.m. and said that they would be home in just five minutes. Hashim was with him on a bike. But, they did not return. Later, when we called his phone, it was not reachable,” said Ballu Khan, his father.

He added that Aamir was a cab driver and was the only source of income for the family of eight. “Now who is to take care of Aamir’s family. His daughters are unaware of his death and I do not have the courage to face their [daughters] questions,” said the father.

The image of our department and social work profession has been tarnished due to his provocative acts and communal statements. The DSSW fraternity is against hatred, violence and communalism spread by Kapil Mishra, who has also maligned our profession,” the students’ union said in a statement.

The statement added that Delhi School of Social Work, University of Delhi played an eminent role in addressing the situations which occurred during 1947 partition riots and 1984 anti-Sikh riots.

“In one way, we have a glorious past and on the other hand we also have ‘blot’ such as our alumnus, BJP leader Kapil Mishra, who has organised the recent Delhi riots and incited mob to disturb communal harmony of the city,” it said

240,2020/02/29,Activists write to CM seeking his intervention to help riot victims,"‘Families are being harassed for not producing documents’

With four more fatalities reported at city hospitals on Friday morning, the death toll in Delhi’s communal violence has gone up to 42 from 38 on Thursday. Lok Nayak Jai Prakash hospital recorded three deaths and Jag Pravesh Chandra Hospital has reported one.

“The total death in our hospital stands at 38 [28 were brought dead and 10 people died here during treatment]. Patients have come in with burns, stab injuries, blunt assault and gun wound. We have received 215 patients from February 24 onwards,” said a senior health official at GTB hospital.

Meanwhile, human rights activists have written to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Health Minister Satyendar Jain seeking their urgent intervention to help the victims of violence.

“Families are facing problems in accessing treatment with hospitals not providing MLC numbers and records of treatment. We came to know of instances where hospitals are denying admission to injured persons whose MLCs were done in a different hospital,” read a the letter signed by groups including Jan Swasthya Abhiyan (JSA), Alliance of Doctors for Ethical Healthcare (ADEH) and All India Drug Action Network (AIDAN) among others.

The group has said that families and patients are “being penalised and harassed for not producing documents which are being denied to them in the first place. At one hospital, for instance, it was only upon the intervention by a lawyer that two patients whose MLCs were done in a different hospital were admitted in the emergency ward.”

Lack of support

The group added that hospitals are not proactively supporting families of injured people.

“Information regarding their identity is not being made available and families are running from pillar to post to identify their missing relatives. Multiple individuals who have been victims of violence have reported instances of being subjected to discriminatory language by staff at hospitals. A few people have even expressed fear of going to government hospitals and instead chose to access critical care at local clinics,” said the the letter.

They have added that this amounts to gross violation of the rights of patients and weakens people’s faith in the public health system.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/cub1qm/article30946895.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/demandscol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/activists-write-to-cm-seeking-his-intervention-to-help-riot-victims/article30946896.ece
241,2020/02/29,Ragpicker ventures out for work only to return injured; dies later,"Victim survived an attack on Thursday, claims his son

A 60-year-old ragpicker, who went to collect scrap on early Friday morning in north-east Delhi was brought back home with serious head injuries. He succumbed while being taken to a hospital, his son said.

Ayub Shabbir lived in Nasbandi Colony in Ghaziabad’s Loni with his 18-year-old son Salman Ansari, who is differently abled, and used to earn ₹300-400 a day dealing in scrap.

“I have no one now. What will I do,” he asked. His mother had left them when he was a child, taking his young brother along with her.

Salman claimed his father had survived an attack on Thursday when he had ventured out.

“He was saved by some elderly men on Thursday morning. Today, he left very early when I was sleeping. Around 6 a.m., two men brought him home on a scooter. He had serious head injuries. The two men said they found him lying in an area between Shiv Vihar and Karawal Nagar,” he said.

‘Asked name, hit him’

Salman claimed his father told him that some people asked him his name and religion and then hit him. However, his father did not mention about how many people were there or who hit him.

“I offered him tea but he didn’t have it. When I called police, they arrived but did not help me in taking my father to the nearby dispensary. I had to take him on a cart to a nearby nursing home where he was given first aid and stitches. But I was told that they were not equipped to treat him further as the injuries were severe,” Salman said.

He then shifted Ayub to GTB Hospital in an autorickshaw. “He was not saying anything during the autorickshaw ride and I think he was dead by then,” he said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/ragpicker-ventures-out-for-work-only-to-return-injured-dies-later/article30946888.ece
242,2020/02/29,"For the first time in 40 years, Friday prayers not conducted at Ashok Nagar mosque","Walls, broken furniture of Masjid Maula Baksh stand testimony to violence

For the first time in over 40 years, Friday prayers were not held at Masjid Maula Baksh in north-east Delhi’s Ashok Nagar. The mosque was vandalised and saffron flag was hoisted on top of it during the violence on February 25.

A video recorded on Tuesday showed three persons climbing atop the minaret and sticking a saffron flag. The video, a grim representation of the riots, went viral.

On Friday afternoon, groups of people belonging to Hindu community stood outside the mosque as Central Industrial Security Force officials guarded it. A man wearing teeka on his forehead approached this reporter and asked for her identity and why she was there. The person then said, “Yahan sab theek hai, aap jaiye. Apko sirf Masjid hi dikhani hai, koi mandir nahin dikhta apko [Everything is fine here, you leave. You only want to show mosques and not any temples],” he said.

When asked why the groups were standing, a resident who identified himself as Sandeep said: “Aisa sunne main aaraha ki jumme ki namaz ke baad ye kuch karenge [We have heard that they’ll do something after the Friday prayers].”

Right behind the mosque, on a street, what reminded of a few houses were broken doors, burnt bikes and belongings. The houses belonged to the minority community while those of others remained untouched. It was learnt that the families got scared and left after the violence to safer places and haven’t returned permanently though they have visited to take stock of the situation.

The street also houses a Delhi Police official’s residence.

In one of the streets behind the mosque stood 21-year-old Nadeem, perhaps the only one from his community who had stayed back to take of his multiple storey house. His Hindu neighbours and friends made sure that he is fine and fed.

In the grip of fear

Nadeem, a first year B.A. student, said, his entire family including his parents, brothers and sister-in-law has gone to stay with her sister in Ghaziabad and he hasn’t stepped out of the house for three days.

“My friends from the Hindu community are staying with me at night. On Wednesday night, four-five men wearing helmets and carrying sticks knocked on our door. My friends went outside and told them that it’s their house after which they left. My friends are only taking care of my food,” he said.

Nadeem said that on Thursday, members of about 35 Muslim families who reside in the locality had come to the mosque to take stock of the damage and how to rebuild it. But men wearing black masks came and stood outside, creating fear.

“About 10-15 of them stood outside. They were outsiders. There were no policemen. We then went to Jyoti Nagar police station and reported the matter after which they sent security officials,” he said. “It was earlier decided that we’ll hold the Friday prayers but after yesterday’s [Thursday] situation, it was decided by the elders and Imam sahab that it should not be held.”

Traces of vandalisation

Inside the mosque, what’s left is blackened walls with smoke and pieces of broken furniture lying around. The Municipal Corporation officials cleared the debris from outside on Friday afternoon. As the reporter went inside, a group of locals followed and threatened her to delete the pictures and leave the premises. The CISF officials who were stationed right outside entered the scene five minutes later after the argument ended; the group was then asked to disperse.

Talking about the day, Nadeem said that a person identified as Jitender, whom he called bhaiya, tried to stop the men who were vandalising and burning the mosque but the rioters pelted stones at Jitender’s house instead.

As the clock struck 1.35 p.m., Nadeem looked at the watch and said: “Nazam to masjid main hogi nahin, main ghar pe hi padhunga [Namaz won’t happen in the mosque, I’ll pray at home].”",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/rc8800/article30946875.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL29-NAMAZ,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/friday-prayers-not-conducted-at-ashok-nagar-mosque-after-40-years/article30946876.ece
243,2020/02/29,SC to hear plea for shifting rape case against Chinmayanand,"Victim fears for her life in U.P., says lawyer

The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to urgently list a petition by a woman, who had complained of sexual exploitation against former Minister Swami Chinmayanand, to transfer the case from Uttar Pradesh to Delhi.

A Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde said the petition would be heard on March 2.

Senior advocate Colin Gonsalves told the court that his client, a law student, feared for her life in Uttar Pradesh.

The court advised him to approach the police for security. Mr. Colin then replied that the police had assigned her a gunman.

The Allahabad High Court granted Chinmayanand bail on February 3. He is accused of sexually exploiting the complainant at a college run by his trust at Shahjahanpur in Uttar Pradesh. He was arrested on September 20 last for allegedly misusing his authority to “induce or seduce” a woman into sexual intercourse.

The Shahjahanpur police in August last filed an FIR against Chinmayanand after the student went missing following her allegation made in a video clip. Her father had lodged a complaint with the police accusing Chinmayanand of sexually harassing her. But Chinmayanand’s lawyer said it was a “conspiracy” to blackmail him.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/pptn9y/article30946859.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH28CHINMAYANAND,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/sc-to-hear-plea-for-shifting-rape-case-against-chinmayanand/article30946861.ece
244,2020/02/29,Airline to pay passenger for not issuing boarding pass,"Complainant told flight was overbooked

A District Consumer Disputes Redressal forum here has directed Air India to compensate a passenger by paying over ₹20,000 for not issuing a boarding pass to the complainant despite her having a valid ticket and reaching the airport on time.

Holding the airline deficient in services, the panel said: “The undisputed facts are that the complainant was denied boarding and despite having a confirmed ticket...It is also not disputed by the airline that the boarding was denied due to overbooking...In view of the facts we are of the considered view that the airline was deficient in service.”

The directions came when the forum was hearing a petition moved by city resident Deepa Rai who contended that she could not board her flight from Delhi to Bagdogra as the airline cited that the flight was overbooked.

The complainant claimed that despite reaching the airport at 10.30 a.m., it was only two hours later that the manager informed that the flight was overbooked. “The complainant and many other passengers requested at the counter to refund the fare but was refused. The complainant was advised to approach the customer care with a written complaint and the refund would be made after 15 days,” the complaint read.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/airline-to-pay-passenger-for-not-issuing-boarding-pass/article30946848.ece

246,2020/02/29,S.N. Shrivastava named acting Delhi Police chief,"The 1985-batch IPS officer will take charge from March 1

Senior IPS officer S.N. Shrivastava has been given additional charge of Delhi Police Commissioner with effect from March 1 and until “further orders”, an order issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) read.

Mr. Shrivastava, a 1985-batch IPS officer of Arunachal-Goa-Mizoram and Union Territory (AGMUT) cadre, was recalled from the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) last week when several parts of north-east Delhi witnessed violence that has so far left 42 people dead. He was on Central deputation to CRPF. Amulya Patnaik, the present Delhi Police Commissioner, is set to retire on February 29. He was given a month’s extension in January by the Election Commission in the run-up to the Delhi Assembly polls on February 8.

It was not clear why the MHA did not make a full-time appointment to the top police post even though it was known that Mr. Patnaik would retire on Saturday.

As Delhi is a Union Territory with a Legislative Assembly, Delhi Police works and functions under the MHA.

247,2020/02/29,Patnaik’s tenure comes to an end under a cloud,"He demits office as violence hits city

Amulya Patnaik’s tenure as Delhi Police Commissioner since January 2017 ends under a cloud as he demits office on Saturday. More than 40 persons have been killed in the north-east Delhi violence under his watch since Sunday.

June 2019 incident

It was in June 2019 that videos showing two police constables beating up a Sikh tempo driver in Mukherjee Nagar had gone viral, leading to angry protests. The policemen were suspended and then dismissed from service the next month.

Policemen and lawyers

Another crisis befell the force on November 2 last when a tiff over parking issue snowballed into a major clash between policemen and lawyers at the Tis Hazari court complex. Several persons from both sides were injured and vehicles damaged in the incident, leading to angry protests by lawyers.

Two days later, a policeman was assaulted at the Saket court complex. This triggered an unprecedented protest by a large number of policemen outside the Delhi Police Headquarters at ITO on November 5, 2019. The protesting men in khaki demanded action against those involved. Mr. Patnaik had to come out of his office to address the policemen and assuage their anger.

JNU fee hike

Just when things seemed to have gone back to normal, days later, the police were faced with protests by Jawaharlal Nehru University students over their demand for complete rollback of fee hikes. Alleging use of force by the police, the students held a protest at the Delhi Police Headquarters on November 20, 2019.

The Central government’s decision to bring in the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), which was passed by both Houses of the Parliament on December 11 last year, initiated huge protests across the country.

On December 15, violence erupted during the anti-CAA and anti-NRC protests in south Delhi’s Jamia. Amid incidents of stone-pelting, the police resorted to tear-gas shelling and lathi-charge. Chasing the protesters, the security personnel entered Jamia Millia Islamia campus and allegedly beat up the students in its library.

The same day, a group comprising mainly women organised a sit-in in the Shaheen Bagh area. The protest continues to this day.

Amid anti-CAA protests, on January 5, the JNU campus was once again gripped by violence when about 50 masked men sneaked in and attacked the students and teachers, injuring about 40 persons. The police were accused of not taking any action against the assailants and allowing them to leave the campus after the incident.

Anti-CAA protests

While the anti-CAA protests were under way in Jamia, in the presence of security personnel, a juvenile opened fire injuring a student on January 30. The delinquent was then overpowered. Days later, another young man fired in the air close to the Shaheen Bagh protest side.

Mr. Patnaik, a 1985-batch Arunachal Pradesh-Goa-Mizoram and Union Territory (AGMUT)-cadre IPS officer, succeeded Alok Kumar Verma to become the Police Commissioner. His two seniors, 1984-batch officers Deepak Mishra and Dharmender Kumar, were not considered for the post.

Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday said that the government will immediately start distributing ₹25,000 in cash, as part of compensation, to those whose houses have been burnt during the violence in north-east Delhi.

The rest of the compensation that was announced, he said, would be released after assessment in the next two-three days by the PWD department.

The verification, he promised, would be quick to immediately disperse the sum, but added that a proper procedure would be put in place by 12 p.m. on February 29 to avoid any misuse of the immediate compensation that is being offered, by making false claims.

The Chief Minister said that the government set up nine shelters for the people who had fallen prey to the violence and would also provide tents if the numbers grew.

Local community centres have also been opened up so that people who do not have anywhere to go can stay there. He said that the distribution of food and other relief materials have already been started with the help of RWAs and NGOs.

Mr. Kejriwal asked NGOs and others, who want to send any kind of help, to contact the office of North-East DM.

He said that the government has appointed 18 magistrates and four night magistrates for providing assistance to the victims of violence.

He also said that the people of Capital could come up with suggestions so that the relief work could be carried out smoothly.

Mr. Tirkey is also heading an SIT which was formed to probe the incident of violence which took place inside JNU on January 5 and Mr. Deo is heading the SIT formed to probe the violence which erupted inside and outside Jamia Millia Islamia on December 15 last. No arrests have been made in the JNU violence case. A total of 18 people were arrested in the Jamia case and a chargesheet was also filed.

Mr. Deo was barred by the Election Commission from the election duty during the Assembly polls after publicly speaking about the alleged link between AAP and the man who had fired at the protesters at Shaheen Bagh. Mr. Deo had told the media that Kapil Gujjar, the man apprehended for firing in Shaheen Bagh, and his father had joined AAP last year.

“The Commission is of the considered view that the statements referring to a political party at this stage, even as the investigation is still on, can adversely impact the elections,” the EC had said. He was directed to be issued a warning as well.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/1pd6q6/article30946772.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE29SIT1PTI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/forensic-team-visits-chand-bagh-to-collect-evidence/article30946773.ece
254,2020/02/29,Muslim women take refuge in Chaman Park warehouses,"Hundreds of them who have their husbands and teenaged sons missing since Sunday recall how they survived violence

Hundreds of Muslim women, whose husbands and teenaged sons are allegedly missing since Sunday, have taken refuge at nearly half-a-dozen warehouses in Chaman Park to escape the horror that engulfed their houses in Shiv Vihar — an area that witnessed some of the worst incidents of violence and arson — as clashes wreaked havoc across north-east Delhi.

Those displaced, mostly women and young children, continued to arrive at the makeshift camps till as late as Friday morning, slipping across a large drain, in the dead of night, via multiple small bridges from Hindu-dominated areas, skirting around the charred remains of vehicles and push carts then and now manned by paramilitary personnel.

They not only kept asking about their husbands and sons, but also if the locality, which many of them have called home for three decades before being forced to relocate, “now only belonged only to the Hindus”. When, how, and if at all they would be returning to the ruins of their houses was something they chose to leave to fate.

Only one bridge remained open between the two sides by Friday and residents were not of the same opinion regarding who started the violence and who was responsible for stray incidents that continued unabated.

“My entire house was on fire, I was about to die,” claimed Bilkis Bano who has been at the camp since the last three days. “People came out of nowhere and started pelting stones and set everything on fire,” she narrated. With a mob allegedly attempting to break into her house and a fire raging, she and the other members of her family tried to hide in the corner of her house when, she recalled, “someone, I did not know, pulled us out and took us to a safe place”.

Arshi Ansari claimed that hundreds of people, mostly “outsiders”, some of whom were “dressed as policemen” took advantage of the fact that most male members of their families were had gone to a religious congregation or jamaat on Sunday.

‘Dressed as policemen’

“They barged into the area because they knew the men were away. One of the first things they did was damaging the CCTV cameras installed in the area. They were all outsiders... some of them were wearing police uniforms but did not look or behave like policemen. They ransacked and defiled the local mosque. They tried to provoke us for hours and threatened to forcibly get us converted,” she claimed.

Farzaa, another resident of the area, informed that four floors of her building were burnt down. “We could not take anything with us when we left the house. We had never imagined that something like that could happen. We just thought there would be some scuffle and things would settle down,” she said. At the gate of her building, which stands next to a household “bearing a saffron flag”, tens of bikes lay burnt to a crisp on a ramp and the entire construction had turned black from the fire. The buildings next to it were untouched.

Noor Jahan (47) lived in a house rented out by a Hindu landlord in Shiv Vihar, but decided to escape when the violence started. “I was not sure if our door would hold up,” she said. As violence in the area escalated, she said, her nine-year-old son asked her if they were safe. “I told him we had a strong gate and nothing would happen. But they broke that [gate] too and in ways I cannot even explain,” she said.

Gas cylinders were used to trigger explosions and smoke from fires engulfed the room she was seeking shelter in along with others. “I covered my child’s face with a wet cloth and we somehow survived,” Mr. Jahan said. Around 3 on Tuesday night when the violence had subsided, Ms. Jahan and her family escaped. “We just ran for our lives and managed to make our way to Chaman Park,” she said.

Debris of stones that were pelted, shattered glass, broken doors, charred remains of vehicles and gutted stores and houses line at least three streets surrounding the Madina mosque in Shiv Vihar, where a large number of people from the Muslim community resided until recently.

The mosque had been vandalised, with the grills to its doors and windows mangled, windows shattered, debris covering the lanes to its entrance and the insides gutted with the burnt carpet sticking to the floor. Miscreants had also hoisted the Tricolour atop the building, next to loudspeakers set up for calls to prayer.

‘Outsiders’

“It was all people from outside. We do not know where they came from,” said Rahul, another resident of the area. Others, such as Manoj Rohila, said that the violence erupted after Muslim mobs set on fire houses and shops, such as that of Bhetem Singh Bhagel who ran a Kirana store near the mosque. Mr. Bhagel’s store had been looted and burnt down as well, while his family which lived in a house inside, remained trapped, he said.

Farhad Ansari [name changed], a resident who was in the area when the violence broke out, said: “We tried to stop them as much as we could.”

Muslim residents here had reportedly put up makeshift barricades and even took to stone-pelting from the terraces of buildings in the area to protect themselves, the residents said.

“However, after a point, the Maulana at our mosque told us to take the women and children and leave the area to save ourselves,” Mr. Ansari added.

Some of the women at the refugee centre, however, contested the claim that people from outside incited and engaged in violence stating: “How did they identify which houses to burn down then?”",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/5qebxn/article30946761.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE29SHELTER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/muslim-women-take-refuge-in-chaman-park-warehouses/article30946762.ece
255,2020/02/29,Life in Jaisalmer’s living fort,"Built in 1156 by the king Rawal Jaisal, the fort has a population of around 5,000 people — mostly descendants of Brahmin and Rajput families who once lived here

Silence. The predominant aura around any fort is the quietude. Save the flutter of pigeons, the only sound is the echo of your own voice. But the magnificent Jaisalmer Fort in Rajasthan is nothing like that. A row of tiny shops selling trinkets near the main gate does give you that regular fort feeling, but once you pass the boundary walls, there is the buzz of a lively market, the familiar sights and sounds of home — clothes being put out to dry, children running around, the occasional whistle of a pressure cooker. The Jaisalmer Fort, a UNESCO World Heritage site, is India’s only ‘living’ fort. Built in 1156 by the king Rawal Jaisal, the fort has a population of around 5,000 people — mostly descendants of Brahmin and Rajput families who once lived here.

As we navigate the narrow lanes, a bustling city comes alive. Shops lure you with fossil stone cups that promise to set curd without culture, camel leather bags, miniature paintings (with live demonstrations), lahariya saris, patchwork bedspreads with traditional motifs of elephants. The quadrangle at the fort’s centre could be any market square in any Indian town. Signboards point to hotels, cafes selling fresh juice.

The ‘king’

You remember you are in an 800-year-old fortress only when you see the exquisite Rani Ka Mahal with its ornate jharokhas and jaalis. On one side of the central square, called Dussehra Chowk, is the ‘throne of the king’ on a raised concrete platform.

Princely states may have ceased to exist, but in Rajasthan, some royal traditions continue. “During Dussehra there is a big fair organised here and the king comes to grace the occasion. Earlier, animal sacrifice used to take place here during the festival,” says tour guide Rajesh Bharadwaj. Dushyant Singh is the present ‘king’ of Jaisalmer.

A winding lane, lined with musicians playing the flute, takes you to the exquisite Jain temples. But what truly delights are the unexpected discoveries: like the old house that springs up through the Hawa Pol — one of the four gates of the fort — with the most intricate jaali I have seen. Or a haveli, with all the kitchenware and clothes of its former occupants, which has been turned into a museum.

Defensive tactics

Walking up the stairs of these havelis or down the lanes that meander through the fort walls is a tricky thing — they are very narrow. “They were constructed this way so the enemy could not enter the lanes with their elephants,” says Bharadwaj. The houses, similarly, have narrow staircases and low doors “so that if soldiers attacked the homes they would have to lower their heads to enter.”

For a small entry fee, you take home many more stories. About how the shops, eateries, hotels, homestays, and ‘museums’ are run by the people living inside the fort. Bharadwaj’s family has lived here for eight generations.

The eateries here serve a whole gamut of cuisines, Italian and Israeli being favourites, catering to the large number of foreign tourists. Jaisalmer was a popular pit stop for merchants travelling on the Silk Road connecting China, Turkey and Italy via India and Central Asia, says Bharadwaj.

But much has changed within the fort. Households now have piped water and modern toilets, but sewage generated by a growing tourism industry has created a sanitation problem that threatens the fort. Water now seeps into its walls. These issues have been flagged by many, including the royal family, according to local people. But if one thing remains the same it is the bonhomie within the community. “Sure there are differences when it comes to business, but we stand together in joy and in grief,” Bharadwaj tells me.

256,2020/02/29,‘Steer clear of agents for Basti Dawakhana jobs’,"With recruitment process under way, DMHO cautions aspirants

Those aspiring to work as doctors and staff nurses at State-run Basti Dawakhanas have been cautioned against falling in the trap of agents who promise them the jobs.

Hyderabad District Medical and Health Officer (DMHO) J. Venkat said that they have got information of a few agents trying to make money out of job aspirants.

Basti Dawakhanas are established in localities populated by people belonging to low economic strata to minimise out-of-pocket medical expenses as diseases or health issues can be detected early.

There are at least functional 74 such health centres in the city that function from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m and the number will be increased to 164, Dr Venkat said. A doctor and a nurse are posted in each dawakhana where primary health services, diagnostic tests and medicines are provided.

After recruitment process was initiated on February 24, a total of 492 applications were received for 94 posts of doctor (₹42,000 monthly salary), and 3,478 applications received for 58 staff nurses posts (₹21,000 monthly salary).

260,2020/02/29,Rice blast disease reduces paddy yield in rabi season,"Crop starts withering due to fungal attack; ryots have to incur huge expenditure to control the menace

Even as the farmers are hoping to reap a rich harvest by cultivating paddy due to availability of abundant water through Kaleshwaram lift irrigation project during the rabi season, the attack of rice blast disease to the crop has become a cause of concern in the integrated Karimnagar district.

Already, the rice blast disease has become an outbreak in some parts of Rajanna-Sircilla district and Karimnagar district also.

The paddy crop started withering following the attack of rice blast disease and is drying up.

Though the farmers took preventive measures such as spraying pesticides there is every possibility of decrease in the yield of paddy following the disease.

The rice blast is a common fungal disease of rice caused by the fungus which attacks the rice crop at all stages. The fungus attacks are due to excessive usage of fertilizers, intermittent rains and cloudy weather with dew in the fields and low night temperatures.

However, following the fungal attack, the farmers are incurring huge losses in controlling the menace.

“I cultivated paddy in eight acres of land and rice blast disease (aggi tegulu) had attacked the crop in six acres. I spent a huge amount on the purchase of pesticides to kill the fungus and the agricultural costs had increased considerably”, said a farmer and Rythu Ikya vedika district president M Venkat Reddy.

Cashing in on the prevailing situation, the pesticide shop-keepers are doing brisk business. Mr Venkat Reddy said that they were forced to spray fungicides three to five times but in vain.

On the other hand, the agricultural operation costs have increased steadily, he stated and feared that the production of paddy would come down from 40 bags per acre to 25 bags per acre.

District Agriculture Officer V Sreedhar said that they had issued an advisory to the farmers in the district to take prompt measures.

“We had asked the farmers to reduce the usage of fertilizers, water management and the use of pesticide to kill the fungus which affected the crop and stop its spread. The agriculture extension officers are visiting the fields and educating the farmers to take preventive measures accordingly,” he said.

The farmers are being advised to spray fungicides during the morning hours and evening hours, he said and added that the disease spreads very fast and advised the farmers to take up spraying of fungicides to ensure that there is no decline in the yield and the crop does not wither.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ogdfng/article30952812.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY01RICEBLAST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/rice-blast-disease-reduces-paddy-yield-in-rabi-season/article30952813.ece
261,2020/02/29,"Centre’s panel will decide HMR ticket fares, says MD","Fare Fixation Committee to take a call on revised fares mooted by L&TMRH and give necessary approvals

Hyderabad Metro Rail’s future ticket fares will be determined by a ‘Fare Fixation Committee’ to be appointed by the Union government upon a request made by the State government once it is approached by the concessionnaire, L&T Metro Rail Hyderabad (L&TMRH), whenever it sees the need for a revision, said Managing Director N.V.S. Reddy.

“This Fare Fixation Committee will have two representatives from the Central government and one from the State government. They will decide on the revised fares mooted by the L&TMRH and give necessary approvals. There is no blanket permission for the concessionnaire to hike the fares every year based on inflation,” he clarified.

The MD explained that L&TMRH, however, had the right to decide the inaugural fares currently in vogue on their own but the TS government had cautioned them then to consider the prevailing ticket fares in the other metro rail projects across the country before announcing the fares. It has ensured the ticket fares are comparable with other metro rail projects in the country.

Annual inflation

Incidentally, L&TMRH had the option of deciding ticket fares as per a ‘Fare Escalation Formula’ depending on the annual inflation rate according to the Concessionnaire Agreement (CA). The Central government had, in the meantime, brought about the Central Metro Act under which approvals were given to all the new metro rail projects being taken up in different cities.

The Centre had also directed HMR as well as Mumbai Metro Rail, the two Public-Private Partnership (PPP) projects, to be brought under the Central Metro Act — which naturally superseded the CA. Hyderabad and Mumbai Metro Rails permissions were initially given under the Tramways Act as the Metro Act was not existent then, Mr. Reddy pointed out.

Under the Central Metro Act while L&TMRH becomes the ‘Metro Rail Administrator’ (MRA) and can decide on the new fares whenever it deemed fit, the rates will have to be approved by the Fare Fixation Committee of the Central government. Only then any change in fares will be allowed, he added.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/3nsucj/article30953632.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY29-HYDERABADMETRORAIL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/centres-panel-will-decide-hmr-ticket-fares-says-md/article30952806.ece

264,2020/02/29,Congress discusses farmers issues,"‘Only those ryots with less than three acres given Rythu Bandhu benefit’

The Telangana unit of the Congress has accused the government of being selective in disbursal of Rythy Bandhu scheme benefits while Mission Kakatiya has remained on paper.

The party held a meeting of all the MLAs, MLCs and senior leaders on Saturday to discuss issues related to farmers ahead of the Budget session in March and charged the government with making tall claims and doing little. The meeting was presided over by TPCC president N. Uttam Kumar Reddy.

Later, MLC T. Jeevan Reddy, Sangareddy MLA T. Jayaprakash Reddy, and Kisan Congress national vice-president M. Kodanda Reddy spoke to the reporters and said the party would support any move in favour of farmers.

Mr. Jeevan Reddy said even after one year of the TRS government, there had been no clarity on the farm loan waiver promised during the elections. Moreover, all the farmers were not receiving Rythu Bandhu money and it was understood that farmers with less than three acres only were being given the money. It should be extended to all as promised, he said.

Mr. Reddy claimed that over 60,000 farmers had died after formation of Telangana but the government had failed to come to the rescue of their families. Rythu Bheema was also not being implemented properly.

The Congress MLC said the party would not oppose any bill related to farmers and extend its full support but wanted the government to waive farmers’ loans immediately as promised.

Mr. Reddy also demanded that all the redgram available with farmers be procured immediately and farmers should not be left in the lurch. He criticised Nizamabad MP D. Arvind, saying he had promised Turmeric Board but got a regional branch of the Spices Board. “Our MPs will fight in Parliament for an exclusive Turmeric Board”.

Alleging that the State government had failed to allot land to SCs and STs, the Sangareddy MLA said whatever distribution of land to these sections had been done was by previous Congress governments.

He said the Mission Kakatiya programme was a success only on paper. In fact, desiltation of lakes had been taken up by the N. Kirankumar Reddy government but was stopped due to the State bifurcation.

Mr. Kodanda Reddy demanded that the new Municipal Act be introduced in the Budget session only and assured that the Congress would extend its support.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/congress-discusses-farmers-issues/article30952026.ece
265,2020/02/29,Telangana government for realistic 2020-21 Budget,"CM identifies areas for mobilisation of resources

The Budget preparation exercise has reached the final phase with the Finance department completing its round of meetings with all departments.

On Thursday, Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao held a review meeting on the proposed Budget for 2020-21 to give a final direction in the wake of economic slowdown prevailing in the country. The Union Budget too had not held out any promise for the State. The hopes of the State, which had made umpteen representations over the last few years for grant of at least the funds recommended by the NITI Aayog, have been once again dashed by the Union Budget.

At a marathon meeting that lasted almost till midnight with Finance Minister T. Harish Rao, MA & UD Minister K. T. Ramarao and Finance department and CMO officials, Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao had a detailed discussion on the financial policy to be implemented for the coming financial year.

Given the resource crunch, he mainly focused on what schemes and programmes should get the priority in the Budget to be presented in the second week of March, allocations for different sectors and what the government’s priorities should be. He also held deliberations on how to increase State’s own revenue.

The Chief Minister is firm that the Budget expenditure for 2020-21 should reflect reality on the lines of the budget outlay for 2019-20. The State had presented ₹1.36 lakh crore expenditure for the current fiscal. An amount of ₹10,000 crore was proposed to be mobilised through auction of land with an indication that if it was realised, the amount would be spent on important programmes and projects. However, the land auction had not materialised in the current fiscal owing to a petition pending in the court.

With tax revenue improving in the last two months, the current fiscal is expected to end with an estimated expenditure of ₹1.36 lakh crore or may fall short of ₹ 1,000 crore to ₹.2,000 crore.

For additional resource mobilisation, the State would be looking at the mining sector , especially sand and granite mining, and ensure that the government earned the bulk of revenue. The focus hereafter would be on streamlining the process and ensuring that the government got maximum revenue. The Chief Minister made it clear that the mining should benefit the government and the end-user. The contractor would get the percentage due to him legally, according to sources.

Land value

Another proposal would be to revise the market value of lands and reduce the gap between government price and actual market price. The government may also increase property tax and trade licence fee and go for monetisation of its lands judiciously. Equal focus would be on plugging leakages in tax collection and checking corruption on the part of government employees.

The proposed new Revenue Act and the new Act for the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation would not be passed in the Budget session. A separate session would be convened at an appropriate time, sources said.

Given the fall in revenue growth rate, the State would not be making provisions for unemployment dole, or bringing down age limit to 57 years for social security pensions and other promises in next Budget. It would concentrate on effective implementation of existing schemes and programmes. It would encourage tourism sector, especially along the Godavari river front with Kaleshwaram and several other barrages to boost employment and revenue. It is also confident that with irrigation projects and filling of tanks, rural employment opportunities in agriculture and allied sectors would improve pushing the State’s GDP.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ts-government-for-realistic-2020-21-budget/article30951588.ece
266,2020/02/29,‘COVID-19 presents an opportunity to enhance domestic manufacturing’,"The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) president Sangita Reddy on Friday said the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak in China presents an opportunity for India to push up the domestic manufacturing.

Noting that the outbreak and the consequent impact on supply chain has compounded the problem for Indian industry that already is grappling with the economic slowdown and substantial receivables, she sought to highlight how the current situation should not be allowed to bog down the sentiments further.

“This is an opportunity,” she said, suggesting certain modifications to enhance production. “There is a scenario where if a labour law could be slightly modified or a manufacturing process could be enhanced, a plant capacity could go up because China supply chain is constrained.

The Indian internal manufacturing can rise [by] as much as 3-5%,” she said, addressing members of the Federation of Telangana Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FTCCI) here.

“Let us search for opportunity in the middle of this environment and see what we can do for further growth,” she said.

Ms. Reddy said FICCI had given a series of suggestions and is working with government on how to accelerate growth. Highlighting the significance of creating more jobs, she invited suggestions from FTCCI members.

To a query on whether India is prepared to handle COVID-19, she said a lot is being done by the Indian government but is that adequate is a big question. “The scenario is uncertain, potentially scary and could implode at any point of time. The only thing I can say -- please protect yourselves and your families. For now we must take as much precautions as we can… much is being done to contain it in the entry itself, so the airports, screening, quarantine.. all those mechanisms should be strictly followed.”",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/covid-19-presents-an-opportunity-to-enhance-domestic-manufacturing/article30946663.ece

268,2020/02/29,DGP reviews incident through video conference,"The widespread criticism over policemen assaulting a man protesting over his daughter’s unnatural death in Sangareddy district reached Telangana police top brass, compelling them to hold an introspection of those policemen’s behaviour.

State police chief M. Mahender Reddy held a video conference, close to three-and-a-half hours, on the incident on Thursday. It was attended by all ranks of police personnel from home guards and constables to Additional Director General of Police rank officers.

With main focus on Sangareddy district issue involving two policemen kicking a man, video of which had gone viral on social media, suggestions were invited as to how to deal with situations better. Mr. Reddy spoke first for nearly 45 minutes on the incident.

Reiterating that police personnel should remember that they were getting their salaries from the tax paid by people, the DGP made it clear that every citizen should be treated with respect. Mr. Reddy, who often explains that police personnel should remember that they get monetary benefits even after retirement due to taxes paid by citizens, remarked that people are the ultimate authority in administration.

Conceding that behaviour of the policemen in Sangareddy district incident was wrong, he told the entire force to be cautious while dealing with such situations. Policemen of different ranks, who responded, too unanimously held the incident showed the entire department in bad light.

One of the officers suggested that policemen having track record of high-handed behaviour should be identified and trained continuously. Inclusion of a training module based on behavioural science on how to respond to a tricky situation should also be included, another officer said.

The concept that citizens are the ultimate masters should be driven into the minds of every police person through continuous persuasion and monitoring, the DGP said. The video conference was held using Zoom, a software based video-conference application secured as part of Digital India programme of the central government.

Links of the video conference were sent to the mobile phones, tabs, laptops, desktop computers and video screens. The application enables to cover 10,000 locations. From police station, divisional offices and unit head quarters, police personnel of all ranks of the State police force attended the meeting.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/kd9ya2/article30946292.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY29DGP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/dgp-reviews-incident-through-video-conference/article30946294.ece
269,2020/02/29,No need to hoard drugs for COVID-19 scare: IICT,"‘Centre in talks with pharma firm stakeholders to deal with fall in supply of APIs’

The Centre is conducting widespread consultations with all stakeholders, including the pharma industry concerned, to deal with the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak in China, which has led to shutdown of industries resulting in a drop in the supply of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs), said Union secretary of chemicals and fertilizers P. Raghavendra Rao on Friday.

Talking to the media at the CSIR-IICT after delivering the National Science Day lecture, he said that there was no need to panic and the country was capable of handling the situation. “Things should return to normalcy in a couple of months. We are also receiving supplies from other parts of China unaffected by COVID-19,” he said.

Mr. Rao also said that India has the scientific capability to make APIs and it was not as if our institutions or scientists do not know the processes but the sheer scale of cost and volumes make it cheaper to obtain the APIs from China. At the same time, he expressed his concern over the agro-chemical industry involved in manufacturing pesticides that require raw materials from China. “The agro-chemical industry also depends on raw materials known as ‘technicals’ and this could be a challenge in the days ahead. Our dependency on China is high. The saving grace is this is not the agriculture season,” he said.

CSIR-IICT director S. Chandrasekhar advised people not to stock up medicines due to the scare. “There is going to be some impact on the production of drugs because of the situation there but that does not mean, citizens should rush to buy drugs. The present stock should last for up to six months and by then, the crisis is expected to blow over,” he said.

“We have APIs stock for three months. We are receiving supplies from China and the Union government has offered to airlift them from China,” said executive director, Bulk Drug Manufacturers Association (India), P. Eshwar Reddy.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/fr0bxj/article30946278.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy29CSIR1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/no-need-to-hoard-drugs-for-covid-19-scare-iict/article30946272.ece
270,2020/02/29,‘Indian industry must be self-sufficient’,"National Science Day

There is a need to make the Indian industry self-dependent on raw materials, Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs), intermediates, agro and bulk chemicals. The Union Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers has also formed a panel to review existing standards for major chemicals, especially for imported ones in association with the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), said secretary of chemicals and fertilizers P. Raghavendra Rao on Friday.

Mr. Rao sought the help of the institute to develop chemical safety and regulations to suit the Indian conditions.

“Since the adverse effects of excessive use of chemicals and plastics has been well-recorded, it is vital to develop ‘green chemistry’,” he said.

“IICT can play a major role in developing circular economy of converting waste into wealth, thereby creating a sustainable environment. Even as it works on impurity profiles of APIs, drug intermediates, agro chemicals and bulk chemicals, efforts should be made for developing alternative chemical compound as effective as DDT,” the Union secretary said.

The Ministry along with IICT could jointly create a dedicated specialised centre for this purpose making use of the infrastructure and expertise available here. “While we have taken many initiatives to improve the academic and industry interaction to solve industrial problems in chemical sector to minimise imports, there is more scope for CSIR and the industry to work together for the benefit of the nation,” he said.

Referring to the theme of ‘Women in Science’ this year, Mr. Rao said that women occupy important positions, including heading scientific organisations. “The Department of Science and Technology too has been promoting women scientists through various schemes encouraging them to take up both basic and applied science. These schemes are meant to encourage women especially those having a break in career and not having regular employment, to explore possibility of re-entry into the profession,” he said.

Mr. S. Chandrasekhar recalled that this was the day when Sir C.V. Raman propounded the Raman Effect in 1928, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1930. The institute has the expertise and infrastructure to develop technologies to meet the nation’s demands on drugs and chemicals.

Tracing the growth of scientific innovations in the country and the pharma industry, He was confident that very soon China could be importing bulk drugs from India. He felicitated some women scientists on the occasion.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/indian-industry-must-be-self-sufficient/article30946260.ece

This was announced by Animal Husbandry and Fisheries Minister Talasani Srinivas Yadav while inaugurating a three-day Fish Food Festival at the NTR Stadium in the city on Friday.

“The State government is investing crores to help improve the livelihoods of communities that depend on fishing. This has led to a surge in fish production in the State. But the marketing opportunities have not matched this growth. The mobile outlets are a step in the direction,” said Mr. Yadav.

The Minister outlined other marketing efforts as well as financial aids to help improve the community.

Ram Nagar fish market

“Hyderabad has nearly one crore population but the number of fish markets are limited. The Begum Bazaar Fish Market was in a poor shape, we are building a bigger and better facility to help people. I have asked for plans to improve the Ram Nagar fish market as well,” informed Mr. Yadav.

A range of prepared fish items are on sale at the festival where 20 stalls have been set up by different women’s cooperatives in the city. “This festival was planned at a short notice but women have shown their resourcefulness and we have a range of innovative items, including fish haleem,” said K.

272,2020/02/29,High Court takes serious note of illegal constructions,"Court summons GHMC Commissioner and MA&UD Principal Secretary

Taking a serious note of ever increasing number of petitions from people making allegations of illegal construction activities in the State capital, Telangana High Court on Friday summoned GHMC Commissioner and Municipal Administration and Urban Development Principal Secretary to appear before it on April 24.

A division bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A. Abhishek Reddy, while hearing a couple of petitions seeking court intervention on illegal constructions, instructed the officials to explain what efforts they were making to check unauthorised constructions. It directed the government counsel to furnish a list of all writ petitions and PIL pleas related to encroachment of government lands, illegal occupation of ponds and lakes along with buildings erected without permissions.

The bench instructed HC Registry to tag all such writ petitions and PIL petitions together for final adjudication. “It seems there is no wing in GHMC to work on this menace of illegal constructions. If that was the performance of GHMC, first get rid of its chief, suspend all your Deputy Commissioners and initiate departmental inquiries against them,” the bench said.

Observing that complaints about unauthorised structures at every place were being filed, the bench said it is high time the GHMC Commissioner takes the matter seriously. “GHMC Commissioner and staff cannot be permitted to sleep over, they are paid to enforce the law,” the bench said. The way the State government is issuing different orders every five years over building permissions is also encouraging builders to regularise the structures they had built illegally, the bench remarked.

Noting that issuing different GOs is not a correct policy to deal with illegal constructions, the bench said that a batch of writ petitions and PIL pleas challenging those GOs too pending before the court for adjudication.

The CJ said that he had noticed mushrooming of illegal structures around Shameerpet lake while going to National Academy of Legal Studies and Research on city outskirts.

“If this menace continues, days are not far when the Shamirpet lake will die a slow death because of the illegal constructions....”, the CJ said. He wondered if the government officials are permitting the lakes to die out noting that catchment areas of lakes are being filled with concrete structures.

Expressing dissatisfaction over the officials’ response to check illegal constructions, the bench said they should start performing their duties or else the HC would step in to execute that duty. “...Then don’t complain that High Court is tough with the bureaucrats,” it said.

The bench said that, due to inaction of the officials, the beautiful city of Hyderabad would be converted into nightmare cities like Mumbai and Patna. “Please remember, the Telangana government is the trustee of its own land and it is duty bound to protect the land and environment,” the bench said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/high-court-takes-serious-note-of-illegal-constructions/article30946242.ece
273,2020/02/29,All-women concert: It is girl power at its best,"Three women get together to herald the month of March with a memorable show

Instrumental concerts are rare in the city. An all-women concert is even rarer. The month of March celebrates ‘girl power’ as three young women instrumentalists come together for a unique concert at Centre for Cultural Resources and Training (CCRT) in Madhapur this weekend. Organised by ArtHub, the classical concert features a jugalbandi between sisters Sanskrati Wahane (sitar), Prakrati Wahane (santoor) and Savani Talwalkar on tabla.

Sanskriti and Prakrati take women empowerment a notch higher. At a time, when artistes taking up playing the classical instruments like sitar and santoor is on the decline, the sisters carved a niche and are proud of their musical choice. Trained by their father sitar player Lokesh Wahane, the duo perform solo but are mostly known for their musical jugalbandis on stage. Prakrati was nine when she heard the sounds of santoor and sarod but was drawn to santoor because of its unique sound. She says, “Ever since pandit Shivkumar Sharma brought it to classical music, the instrument has kindled interest even among youngsters. Now we also have women playing it.” Calling the Hyderabad show an opportunity for three young women to showcase their musical abilities, she says. “We promise to come out in flying colours.”

Instrumental in many ways

It is a proud moment for Sanskriti as she joins her sister on stage. “We celebrate women in the month of March and it’s special that we perform on this big stage and carry forward the tradition.” She equals her right hand as an engine which helps in sitar play. “Women need power and techniques to pluck strings on sitar through their right hand index finger and also hold the instrument tight. The left hand has many cuts and only through practice one learns to bear the pain and master the techniques,” she adds.

One question that Savani Talwalkar is routinely asked is the pain felt in her fingers after a tabla play. “I just laugh at those comments. People assume a woman tabla player experiences more pain than male tabla players,” she says. Savani was five when she gave her first concert for her grandfather’s birthday and since then it has been an exciting journey in tabla. She started when there were a few women tabla players in the music circuit. “In urban areas, the audience is used to women percussionists. but in towns and districts, the crowd is curious,” she says, and adds, “One of the limitations was in physical strength. Some women feel they lack that muscle power but that is not true. With practice one can do anything and the situation is changing with many young girls making a mark as percussionists.” Savani has been part of Sakhi, an all-women ensemble since its inception and travelled to many countries.

“Oh! You are from The Hindu paper; I have seen it,” beams Ju-Hong Kim, the artistic director-percussionist-vocalist of Korean group Noreum Machi. His group’s first visit to Hyderabad was for the ‘Same Same But Different season 5 series’ (The concert was held at Shilpakala Vedika recently). Besides Noreum’s artistes, Howon Lee and Hyun-ju Oh (traditional percussionists and performers), Gyeongsik Kim (saenghwang and piri player), Hyeyeong Oh (gayageum player), the Indian artistes included dancer Astad Deboo, percussionist B C Manjunath, singer and flautist Varijashree Venugopal and percussionist, music director and composer Praveen D Rao. Korean artistes played percussion instrument like samaluri, and wind instruments like piri and saenghwang. They also introduced to the audience gayageum, a string and classical instrument.

Ju-Hong is in a poetic mood and calls Korea, the moon and India, the stars. “Their love and music is spread out like the sky.”

The group Noreum Machi (referring a ‘skilled performer that no one would dare to follow on stage’) was formed in ’93 and became popular for its elements of music and dance. In the five-member team, four sing and play percussion and Ju Hong plays the traditional folk instrument — an hour glass shaped drum called janggu. With more than 20-year experience, the team has been part of various projects, competitions and festivals. “The members have been to different countries to collaborate and perform with other musicians,” shares Ju-Hong adding the experience encouraged them to start a series. “We wanted this project to be an experience for music lovers; The idea led us to Same Same But Different (SSBD) series.” He explains the concept behind SSBD, “When different musicians share the stage, blend and perform together, they produce unique sounds.” The four editions of SSBD has collaborations between Korean artistes and artistes from Turkey, Australia, Japan and Germany. He says, “A few purists might not like to collaborate for the fear of art getting diluted but contemporary musicians want to create diverse music. Collaborations is one way of achieving it; Travelling to other countries and performing is a learning experience. We learn, adapt and experience their lifestyle and culture.”

Korean music is divided into two types — grand and aristocratic music expressing utopian idea and folk music conveying simple human emotions. Noreum Machi plays folk music. “Both forms have songs and dance but folk music has percussion also and uses traditional folk instruments and that is the main difference.”

Ju-Hong has an eye for talent and selects younger members for their artistic steak. Some youngsters started off as students in the music group and after graduation have even become its members. Speaking about the role of social media in promoting their music, he says, “Social media does help in promoting the event but it doesn’t always serve the purpose. We realised we get more people to our concerts by word of mouth.”

A collaborative SSBD series — six in Mangolia and percussion through voice are their future plans. “Like India’s thom thom thadigana thom, we plan to do a Korean ghum ghum tha,” adds Ju-Hong.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/ht7gi4/article30949031.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hym26korean2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/korean-artistes-of-noreum-machi-talk-about-their-same-same-but-different-series/article30949040.ece

The retail outlets will be at Poojapura in Thiruvananthapuram, Viyyur in Thrissur, Cheemeni in Kasaragod and in Kannur city. The outlets offer an opportunity for rehabilitation and employment for inmates of jails and correction homes.

V.C. Asokan, State head, IOC operations, told a press conference here on Saturday that Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had laid the foundation stone for the project. Kerala was following the example of States such as Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh in offering an opportunity to the inmates of jails for employment and rehabilitation, he said.

276,2020/02/29,"2,285 houses completed under PMAY-LIFE Mission in Kochi","Third phase of project aimed at benefiting landless people in city

Within Kochi Corporation limits, 2,285 houses have been constructed under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) and LIFE Mission (Livelihood Inclusion and Financial Empowerment) run by the State government, Mayor Soumini Jain announced here on Saturday.

Of the total 8,266 beneficiaries of the PMAY-LIFE Mission project in the city, 4,247 houses were under construction. Additionally, 1,344 beneficiaries were likely to be included soon as part of the seventh detailed project report that was prepared recently.

The corporation had taken a bank loan of ₹35 crore to pay its share of the funds for the project. The local body had earlier taken a ₹57-crore loan from the Housing and Urban Development Corporation Limited (HUDCO) out of which ₹50 crore had already been disbursed, Deputy Mayor K.R. Premakumar said at an event held to declare the completion of houses within the city, even as the Chief Minister announced in Thiruvananthapuram the State-level completion of 2 lakh houses under LIFE Mission.

The PMAY and LIFE projects converged in June 2018 in urban local bodies, keeping in mind that the amount from either one scheme would not be sufficient for construction of houses, officials said. Of the ₹4 lakh that the converged scheme provides for construction of houses to people who already own land, ₹1.5 lakh is provided by the Centre, ₹50,000 by the State and the ₹2 lakh by the corporation.

Speaking at the event, Opposition leader K. J. Antony said that while the PMAY-LIFE scheme benefited those with land, thousands of people remained both homeless and landless.

279,2020/02/29,Man killed after drunken brawl,"Accused arrested from Palakkad

A middle-aged man was allegedly hammered to death by his half-brother following a drunken brawl at their home at Illikkunnu near Koothattukulam on Thursday night.

The deceased was identified as Prakashan, 48, while the accused Laiju, 38, was picked up by the police from Palakkad on Friday morning.

According to the police, the two had engaged in skirmishes following a quarrel over drinks, after which Prakashan had retired for the night when Laiju hit him on the head with a hammer. Prakashan succumbed to injuries, while Laiju fled from the scene.

Laiju then rang up his mother around 8 a.m. on Friday probably to know Prakashan’s fate. “We had the mobile phone of Laiju’s mother with us, and we disconnected the call as soon as it was received when a municipal siren went off exactly at that time. That would have been a clear giveaway that the police had his mother’s phone,” said K. Brijukumar, Sub Inspector, Koothattukulam.

However, Laiju probably got the impression that his mother too was in police custody, and so he appeared at the Palakkad East police station, within the limits of which he was at that point. He confessed to the police that he had hit Prakashan, and that he was not able to talk to his mother.

“However, we had alerted the Palakkad police even before he appeared before them as we were able to track down his mobile phone tower location as soon as we received his call though he had dislodged the SIM card shortly thereafter,” said Mr. Brijukumar.

The Koothattukulam police were already on their way to Palakkad when they were alerted that the accused had turned himself in. The police took him into custody and brought him to Koothattukulam where his arrest was recorded.

280,2020/02/29,Corporation told to set up digester at Brahmapuram plant,"SLMC submits report on scenario at dumping yard to green tribunal

The State Level Monitoring Committee (SLMC) on solid waste management has submitted a report to the National Green Tribunal (NGT), recommending that the Kochi Corporation set up an anaerobic digester of 100 tonne capacity at its dumping yard at Brahmapuram without delay.

“The capacity can be increased to 200 tonnes per day with the installation of an additional digester as required. Anaerobic digester allows treatment of wet waste without creating odour, smell, and leachate,” said the report filed by SLMC Chairman A.V. Ramakrishna Pillai before the Principal Bench of the NGT in New Delhi on Friday.

Asking the civic body to initiate steps for anaerobic digestion of wet waste at Brahmapuram without waiting for the establishment of the proposed waste-to-energy (WTE) plant, Mr. Pillai observed that an energy plant at Brahmapuram was unviable for source-segregated wet waste.

“Digesters will have to be provided even after the installation of the plant. Simultaneously, the bio-mining process of legacy waste has to be continued with full strength and figure, deploying sufficient number of trammel machines, and this has to be completed within a time schedule,” he said.

The report suggested that the remaining inert waste after separation of city compost could be used in the WTE plant. To prevent environmental threats caused by the flow of leachate as well as recurrent fire hazards, the directions hitherto issued by the SLMC to the corporation are to be implemented, it pointed out. “However, it is a low-lying area, and it would take considerable time for bringing the site to the level of the nearby road. As the SLMC felt that the establishment of [the] WTE plant is a time-consuming process, directions were issued to the corporation to dispose of the legacy waste part by part by means of bio-mining as per the guidelines of the Central Pollution Control Board involving a technical expert and to make necessary arrangements for addressing the present environmental issues till the WTE plant comes into existence,” the report said.

The SLMC observed that the process of bio-mining was done at the yard at a low pace, and, as a result, legacy waste was getting accumulated.

Expressing their solidarity with Muslims in troubled times, members of the Sikh community observed the Friday noon namaz at the Kochi Grand Mosque at Kacheripady.

Five members of the Gurudwara Sri Guru Singh Sabha committee observed the congregational prayers and the khutba, the sermon delivered by the Imam. The visit was part of the mosque’s second ‘open day’, that involves opening the prayers up to members of other communities to introduce non-Muslims to Islamic rituals and customs, and promote goodwill and friendship among the city’s various religious communities.

“The visit was a way of saying that we are with them in these troubled times,” said Surinderpal Singh, president of the gurudwara committee. “With an atmosphere of distrust prevailing today, such meetings can help dispel suspicion of each other,” he said.

The Imam and members of the mosque committee had, last week, visited the gurudwara at Thevara.

After his sermon on protecting the laws of the land and ensuring justice prevails, particularly in the light of the violence in Delhi, Imam M.P.

283,2020/02/29,Two held for thrashing farmer to death in M.P.,"Row over water led to dispute: police

The Chhatarpur police have arrested two persons for allegedly thrashing to death a farmer on the intervening night of Tuesday and Wednesday over a water dispute in the Bundelkhand region.

Hareram Mishra and Jagprasad Mishra along with their father allegedly thrashed to death Mohan Patel in Mahjguwan village over drawing water for irrigation from a well, said the police.

“Five years ago, the victim bought part of their field, and a well separates their properties. They agreed to use its water alternatively,” said Jaswant Singh, the Bamitha police station in charge. “The accused had been drawing water for three days when the victim wanted to take his turn. This led to a dispute.”

The three men beat Mohan with lathis and rods, and he died while being taken to hospital by family, said Mr. Singh. The post-mortem report has revealed death due to excessive bleeding caused by injuries inflicted by hard and blunt objects, he said.

The accused told the police that Mohan assaulted them first. “There are no witnesses to support this,” said Mr. Singh.

Search on

The police have registered a case under Section 302 [punishment for murder] of the Indian Penal Code, and are searching for the third accused.

Ruling out scarcity of water in the area, Mr. Singh said, “The dispute ensued following a breach of agreement. There is the Ken river nearby, and the water level is good too. Still farmers draw water from wells in the absence of canals.”

Meanwhile, Mahjguwan village secretary Beniram Pal said there had been several conflicts over water in the village earlier, but this was the first one this time ahead of the summer.",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/two-held-for-thrashing-farmer-to-death-in-mp/article30946850.ece
284,2020/02/29,Akali Dal stages protest outside State Finance Minister’s house,"Congress govt. moves privilege motion in the Assembly

Several members of families of farm suicide victims and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) MLAs on Friday staged a protest outside Punjab Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal’s residence here. They were demanding that the Congress include in the State budget its poll promise of giving a government job to one member from each victim’s family as well as a compensation of ₹10 lakh.

The police detained several protesters, including former Minister and Alkali leader Bikram Singh Majithia, after they blocked the entrance of the residence of Mr. Badal.

Former Chief Minister and Akali Dal patron Parkash Singh Badal said the farm suicide victim families wanted a personal audience with the Finance Minister so that they could request him to include the Congress government’s ‘promise’ in the State budget.

“The Finance Minister could have come out and taken their representation. Instead, he let loose the police force on them,” alleged Mr. Badal. Condemning the police behaviour, Mr. Badal said the action was unprecedented and against all principles of democracy.

He also hit out at the Congress government for moving a privilege motion in the Assembly against SAD legislators who had accompanied the farm suicide victim families. He said the legislators were only assisting the victim families and had taken on a just public cause.

“Such actions cannot thwart the SAD from fighting against injustice,” he said. He also lashed out at the Aam Aadmi Party for supporting the privilege motion.",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/29x3b1/article30946840.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE29DETAIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/akali-dal-stages-protest-outside-state-finance-ministers-house/article30946841.ece

Kashmiri students studying in Iran have urged India to arrange for their evacuation from the novel coronavirus-affected country, after facing quarantine in their campuses.

“The college administration has cancelled on-campus examinations for the time being. The authorities have suggested that we can return home till the situation improves here. We have been restricted to our campuses. The cancellation of flights has left us stranded. We want to return to J&K,” said Ejaz Ahmad, an MBBS student in Shiraz city of Iran.

Several other students have also raised SOS online. “The situation is getting worse day by day and the virus is spreading. All the tickets have been cancelled. We appeal to the External Affairs Ministry to evacuate us,” said a joint statement issued by Kashmiri students studying in the Shiraz University of Medical Sciences in Iran.

Officials in Srinagar said that around 250 students from J&K study in Iran. The parents have urged the Centre to intervene. “In the wake of cancellation of flights, the Centre should evacuate the students in special flights.

286,2020/02/29,Tax-free budget in Punjab,"Proposals include slashing retirement age to 58, increasing DA

Punjab Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal on Friday presented tax-free budget proposals for the year 2020-21 with a total outlay of ₹1.54 lakh crore.

Presenting the budget in the ongoing Assembly session, he said the retirement age of government employees will be reduced to 58 years from 60 years at present to enhance employment opportunities for the youth.

“..The fiscal situation is now under control with the indicators going up. Punjab’s economy is better than before. The next two years will witness a substantial improvement in the lives of Punjabis,” he said.

Outstanding debt

Mr. Badal said the outstanding debt of the State in 2020-21 is likely to be ₹2,48,236 crore, as against the 2019-20 revised estimates of ₹2,28,906 crore.

“We are all aware of the economic slowdown in the country. However, given the composition of the State’s economy, our advanced estimates indicate that during 2019-20, the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) of the State has increased from ₹5,21,861 crore in 2018-19 to ₹5,74,760 crore at current prices...the State’s GSDP during the year 2020-21 would further rise to ₹6,44,326 crore. The per capita income of the State has also increased from ₹1,54,996 in 2018-19 to ₹1,66,830 in 2019-20 and is 23.53% higher than the national average of ₹1,35,050,” said Mr. Badal.

Mr. Badal said as a result of the fiscal recovery, this year the government has estimated that the State’s Total Revenue Receipts (TRR) are expected to rise from ₹73,975 crore in 2019-20 (RE) to ₹88,004 crore in 2020-21 (BE) — an increase of 18.96%.

During the same period, the Own Tax Revenue (OTR) is pegged to grow from ₹33,739 crore in 2019-20 (RE) to ₹35,824 crore in 2020-21 (BE),” he said.

“..The State’s total expenditure is projected to be at ₹1,54,805 crore in 2020-21 (BE). A breakdown of the total expenditure shows that the State’s revenue expenditure is expected to grow from ₹86,602 crore in 2019-20 (RE) to ₹95,716 crore in 2020-21 (BE), an increase of 10.52%,” added Mr. Badal.

The Minister said under the next phase of the Crop Loan Waiver scheme, a total allocation of ₹2,000 crore, including ₹520 crore specifically for waiving off the loans of landless and farm workers has been made. He announced that provision of free electricity to farmers will continue, for which ₹8,275 crore have been allocated.

Mr. Badal said in view of the stabilising fiscal consolidation of the State, he proposes to increase the Dearness Allowance (DA) by 6% to all the employees and pensioners.

“The 6th Punjab Pay Commission was set up in 2016 and is expected to submit its recommendation in near future. Aware of this, I have made a suitable provision in the budget estimates for 2020-21,” he added.

Education sector

An amount of ₹13,092 crore have been earmarked for the education sector and ₹4,675 crore for the health sector in the budget.

Mr. Badal added that the government has decided to grant free education in government schools to all students up to Class XII.

288,2020/02/29,₹1.42 lakh cr. budget for Haryana,"Former CM Hooda says it will push the State into ‘debt trap’

Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Friday presented a tax-free budget for the year 2020-21 with a total outlay of ₹1.42 lakh crore, up by 7.70% over the previous year.

Mr. Khattar, who holds the finance portfolio, said the budget reflects the government’s commitment to substantially boost investment in agriculture, rural development, health, education and social justice for comprehensive socio-economic growth of the State. “This is substantiated by the increase in allocation to these departments,” he said.

Presenting the ₹1,42,343.78-crore budget, Mr. Khattar said the government has allocated ₹19,343 crore to education and sports, ₹6,294 crore to rural development and panchayat, ₹6,533 crore to health, ₹349 crore to industries, ₹9,000 crore to pensions and Rs 5,474 crore to agriculture. The State debt is projected at nearly ₹1.98 lakh crore, which in 2019-20 was ₹1.76 lakh crore.

Mr. Khattar said the State’s revenue receipts are anticipated to increase by 15.96% in 2020-21 to ₹8,9,964.14 crore from Rs.7,7,580.73 crore in 2019-20. The expenditure will increase to ₹1,42,343 crore, a rise of 7.7%.

“We have decided to set up a new department — ‘Housing for All’ so as to bring all housing schemes being implemented by different departments, boards and corporations under one roof,” he said. To make Haryana a preferred global investment destination, the State has initiated major regulatory reforms through simplification of procedures. “An amount of ₹349.30 crore for industry and commerce, ₹173.07 crore for civil aviation department and ₹1,522.35 crore for revenue and disaster management department has been proposed,” he said.

Former Chief Minister and Leader of the Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda said the budget would push the State further into ‘debt trap’. “The BJP has suppressed the State under debt of ₹1,98,700 crore,” he said.",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/2tzhzl/article30946807.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE29KHATTAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/142-lakh-cr-budget-for-haryana/article30946808.ece
289,2020/02/29,"Grandsons of Gandhi, Ambedkar address mammoth anti-CAA gathering in Kolkata","""They murdered Bapu with three bullets, now they are out to murder India with the three bullets called CAA, NRC and NPR.""

It was an electrifying Friday evening at the Park Circus Maidan — Kolkata’s Shaheen Bagh — as grandsons of Mahatma Gandhi and B.R. Ambedkar led speakers who addressed a mainly-Muslim gathering of thousands, urging them to keep up their fight against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.​

The atmosphere at the venue resembled that of a packed cricket stadium; the cheering crowd fell silent briefly only twice when the muezzin called from the mosque overlooking it. The speakers, for the first time, also included those who are anchoring the ongoing protests at Shaheen Bagh, including the 82-year-old Bilkis or Dadi and Sonu Warsi.​

“They murdered Bapu with three bullets, now they are out to murder India with the three bullets called CAA, NRC (National Register of Citizens) and NPR (National Population Register). That’s the only language they know, that of bullets, but we have a strong chest,” Tushar Gandhi, one of the Mahatma’s grandsons, told the gathering, referring to right-wing forces.​

“This fight is not going to end in a few days or a few months, it is going to take years. But you have to fight until (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi’s evil designs are defeated. You are fortunate to have a Chief Minister like Mamata Banerjee, she is your support. You must strengthen her hands because they are out to destroy her,” Mr. Gandhi said.​

Cautioning people against sharing too much personal information with government agencies, saying they were always misused by rioters, he thundered: “Next time they come asking for papers, ask them: who are you?”​

Dr. Ambedkar’s grandson Raj Ratan Ambedkar said the implementation of an NRC would not affect Muslims as much as it would the tribal population and backward classes. “Now you say the voter ID is not a sufficient proof of citizenship, but the same ID was valid when people voted for you. So if the voter ID is not valid as a proof of citizenship, then your government should also be rendered invalid,” Mr. Ambedkar said.​

The evening began with a spirited speech by Asmat Jamil, the homemaker who started the movement at the Park Circus on January 7: the prolonged protest has seen her emerge as a fiery speaker. “The other day I asked a Hindu friend, ‘You are a Hindu and so is Modi — what is the difference between the two of you?’ The friend replied: ‘I am a real Hindu, whereas Modi is a merchant of Hinduism.’ Friends, it is time we shut his shop,” Ms. Jamil said.​

She also attacked Home Minister Amit Shah. “This fight,” she declared, “is between homemakers and the Home Minister.”​",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/b4q8kg/article30946805.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29DEKOLKATA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/caa/article30946806.ece

Curfew was imposed in East Khasi Hills district of Meghalaya and Internet services suspended across six districts from 10 p.m. on Friday following the death of a Khasi Students' Union (KSU) leader in a clash with non-tribal people over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and introduction of the inner-line permit system restricting the entry and stay of non-locals in the State.

The State capital Shillong is within the purview of the curfew till 8 p.m. on Saturday.

“Curfew has been clamped due to apprehension of serious deterioration in law and order in Shillong and adjoining areas,” East Khasi Hills Deputy Commissioner M. War Nongbri said.

Tension gripped the district after a meeting on the citizenship law and inner-line permit organised by the KSU in the Shella area went wrong. The police said differences between the KSU leaders and the non-tribal people of the area led to a clash in which a KSU member sustained critical injuries.

He died at a health centre in Sohra, or Cherrapunjee, later in the evening.

Officials said the curfew and ban on mobile Internet services have been imposed to prevent misuse of social media for fanning communal hatred.

“Service providers have been asked to limit the messaging service to five SMSes per day,” the State's Home (Police) Department Secretary C.V.D. Diengdoh said.

Friday passed off peacefully in Aligarh, after one person was hit by a bullet and several others were injured during clashes between anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protesters and police last Sunday. However, Internet services remained suspended.

Senior Superintendent of Police Muni Raj G. told The Hindu that a Special Investigation Team has been constituted to look into the February 23 violence. “All 12 FIRs registered in different police stations in the city, including the firing incident in the Kotwali area near Jama Masjid, will be investigated by the SIT,” he said, adding CCTV footage is being looked into. “A ballistic team will soon come up with the details of the gunshot injury,” he said.

Two protests on

Two anti-CAA protests are currently on in Aligarh. “One in the Shahjamal area has been allowed by the district administration but the one in Jeevangarh area near Anoopshahr road is illegal as it is blocking the Bulandshahr road. We are in talks with the protesters,” the SSP said.

Six AMU students have also been mentioned in the FIR for instigating the protesters. “Our local intelligence has confirmed the involvement of some AMU students.

292,2020/02/29,What was the urgency in bringing CAA: Kamal,"Is there an ongoing war or an influx of refugees, asks M.P. CM

Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath on Friday assailed the BJP government at the Centre for the recent clashes in Delhi and questioned it on the urgency to bring in the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, over which protests have raged across the country.

Speaking to reporters in Indore after launching works worth ₹900 crore, Mr. Nath asked, “Is there an ongoing war or an influx of refugees that the Modi government had to enact the CAA? What was its need? Has any disaster hit us?”

He added that though surveys had been conducted in the past too, “misconceptions” were being spread now causing fear among people about losing their citizenship.

On Tuesday, four ASHA workers carrying questionnaires to identify tuberculosis patients were threatened and driven away from a slum in Indore when locals suspected them to be undertaking the National Population Register update exercise.

Mr. Nath said the clashes were “a matter of grief and concern” as the country’s culture promoted “connection of hearts”.

‘JD(U) is right’

As for the Bihar Vidhan Sabha passing a resolution against the proposed National Register of Citizens, Mr. Nath said, “Those in the government there are with the BJP, and they’re openly making such statements on citizenship.

As Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan announced the completion of two lakh houses in the State under the Livelihood, Inclusion, Financial Empowerment (LIFE) housing scheme on Saturday, Kozhikode too rejoiced in its share towards the number. Mayor Thottathil Raveendran announced the completion of 1,164 houses under the scheme in Kozhikode Corporation limits in the first phase of the project.

“We have had several housing schemes in the past. But, none of them had the desired effect due to several reasons,” said Mr. Raveendran, adding that financial constraints were a major reason.

“We had constructed one lakh houses under the Laksham Veedu scheme. But none of the houses lasted long. The scheme was more of an eyewash,” he added, pointing out that the houses built under the LIFE scheme are of high quality.

Corporation Secretary Binu Francis said the houses were registered in the name of the oldest female member of the family and that they suited the requirements of each family. The families were provided ₹4 lakh by the government while they had to source the rest of the amount required to build the houses.

The first phase of the scheme was for people who had land, but did not have enough money to complete their houses. Out of the 2,233 beneficiaries in the first phase, 1,164 had already completed their houses and moved in, while the rest of the houses would be completed soon, said Deputy Mayor Meera Darshak.

The Mayor later said that people who did not have land would be considered in the next phase of the scheme. They would be provided homes modelled like the Kalluthankadavu apartments. So far, 3,640 people had requested to be included in the second phase, he added.

The beneficiaries of the scheme on Saturday turned up to watch the announcement by the Chief Minister at Thiruvananthapuram, which was screened at the venue in Kozhikode.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/1164-houses-completed-under-life-scheme-in-kozhikode-city/article30953170.ece
294,2020/02/29,Scientific temper to the fore at Malabar Innovation Festival,"Regional Science Centre’s hub training youngsters

It was by accident that Atham from Thondayad in Kozhikode stumbled upon Bernoulli’s principle in his brother Aishbal’s Class 7 textbook. The brothers had a thorough discussion on how passing air through a small hole could eventually cool it and it led to the development of a natural house cooling system, which is far less expensive compared to air conditioners. Their innovative idea is one of the major attractions at the third Malabar Innovation Festival that has been under way at the Regional Science Centre in Kozhikode since Friday.

Like 14-year-old Atham, several young minds were trained to come up with innovative ideas and implement them at the Innovation Hub of the science centre, the fruits of which are on display at the expo organised as part of the innovation festival.

A group of final year students of Government Polytechnic College, Meenangadi, Wayanad, came up with technology to charge mobile phones by using power generated by a burning candle and a pitcher full of water. “The technology will come in handy during floods” said a student. The ‘path finder’ developed by Liam Abdulla from Keezhuparamba and Ahmed Irfan from Mankavu could be of help to visually challenged persons as it helps them cross busy roads without hassles.

‘Mr. Water’, a product of first year students of Government Polytechnic College, Meenangadi, Wayanad, has already caught the eye of electronic product manufacturers. The equipment makes water from atmosphere, forcing vapour to cool down and thus produce clean drinking water.

The innovation festival also features various competitions for children. There are also brainstorming sessions and robotics.

A robot made of e-waste displayed at the lobby of the science centre is another attraction at the festival that concludes on Sunday.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/a9u2h5/article30953138.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29KIMALABARFEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/scientific-temper-to-the-fore-at-malabar-innovation-festival/article30953139.ece

296,2020/02/29,State taking credit for Centre’s housing scheme: Surendran,"BJP State president K. Surenedran has accused the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government of hoodwinking the people in the name of completion of 2 lakh houses under the LIFE Mission.

He told the media here on Saturday that the government had cleverly taken credit for the scheme after utilising the funds released by the Union government under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana for urban and rural residents.

Mr. Surendran claimed that the Centre had released ₹1.5 lakh for each beneficiary under the scheme. The State government’s contribution was just ₹50,000 while local self-government institutions had to contribute ₹2 lakh from their plan fund. “In the BJP-ruled Palakkad municipality, budget for the housing scheme was ₹50 crore, of which the Centre gave around ₹15 crore. The municipality provided ₹12 crore, while the government gave around ₹5 crore. A sum of ₹18 crore was taken as loan from the Housing and Urban Development Corporation,” Mr. Surendran said.

The BJP leader alleged that the State government, however, was falsely propagating that the Centre was neglecting Kerala. “We will soon release the list of houses constructed under the PMAY in Kerala,” he said.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/state-taking-credit-for-centres-housing-scheme-surendran/article30952407.ece

298,2020/02/29,"KIIFB examining master plan for MCH, General Hospital","16 slice CT scanner, electricity sub-station opened at GH

A master plan for the development of the Government Medical College Hospital (MCH), Kozhikode, is under the consideration of the Kerala Infrastructure and Investment Fund Board funding (KIIFB), Health Minister K.K. Shylaja has said.

She was here on Saturday to open new facilities including a pump house for a sewage treatment plant, out-patient ticket counters, 16 slice CT scanner and ortho intensive care unit at various units of the medical college hospital.

The Minister claimed that the government was developing primary health centres, district hospitals, and medical colleges as centres offering primary, secondary and tertiary healthcare. Efforts would be made to develop five medical colleges as centres of excellence. The conversion of PHCs as community health centres had brought about radical changes in the health sector.

Ms. Shylaja opened a CT scanner and a 500 KVA sub-station at the Government General Hospital. She said that the master plan for hospital development was awaiting KIIFB clearance.

Opening the Kozhikode Corporation-level launch of Arogya Jagratha 2020-21, Ms. Shylaja said that Arogya Sena should be formed for every 20 houses in each ward. It should be led by the ward member. Four among its members should be trained in eradication of infectious diseases. All the 20 houses should be visited at least once in a week to check the possibility of spread of diseases.

A similar exercise could be carried out focussing on shops too, Ms. Shylaja said.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/kiifb-examining-master-plan-for-mch-general-hospital/article30952375.ece

302,2020/02/29,Need to change patriarchal mindset,"Stressing the importance of gender sensitisation, Madras High Court Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi said that there was a need to change the patriarchal mindset in the society. It cannot be said that we have fully overcome such mindset, he said here on Saturday.

He inaugurated a two-day training programme on ‘Prevention, prohibition and redressal of sexual harassment of women at workplace’ organised by the Gender Sensitisation and Internal Complaints Committee of the High Court Bench at the Judicial Academy.

Despite improvement in status of women who have made great strides in various sectors, people gathered to discuss sensitisation and it showed that the issue needed to be addressed and awareness created, he said.

Expressing satisfaction over the fact that judges, advocates and the police had come together to discuss various topics on sensitisation, he said the programme would bring out new ideas and help people to deal with the issue. Two other areas that also needed discussion were plight of transgenders and sensitisation to defence lawyers in cross examination of victims. Programmes on these two topics need to be organised, he said.

Madras High Court Judge J. Nisha Banu and Chairperson of GSICC-II said women had taken up the fight for equality and one needs to walk through history to understand the struggle for liberation. She said that there would be more discussions on gender sensitisation.

Former Madras High Court Judge S. Vimala discussed the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 and important judgements on the subject in the first session.

303,2020/02/29,Two tonnes of fish destroyed,"Tests indicate presence of formalin in fish sold at Karimedu market

Food Safety Department officials destroyed around two tonnes of fish, crab and prawn which tested positive for formalin, a chemical used illegally to preserve fish, at the fish market here on Friday.

A team of 15 officials went to Karimedu to check if fish laced with formalin were sold in the market. The exercise, which began at 10.30 p.m. on Friday, continued till the early hours of Saturday.

Formalin is used in the fishing industry to increase shelf-life of fish.

Designated Officer for Food Safety S. Somasundaram said that two boxes of fish were randomly lifted as samples from each of 56 shops in the market to check the presence of formalin. “The test results revealed that all species of fish including freshwater species like ‘katla,’ ‘tilapia’ and marine species like ‘paarai’ and ‘oodagam’ crab and prawn were contaminated with formalin. The results indicate that fish laced with formalin are sold throughout the market,” he said.

Ice and salt supplied by units near the market also tested positive for formalin.

The test was conducted by a team of technicians from Enviro Care India, a laboratory for testing quality of food and water, accredited by National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories.

Karimedu market receives fish from Karnataka, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh, which are transported to Theni, Kumuli, Palani, Tiruchi and Dindigul later.

“The problem starts right from the time the fish is caught from the water and is immediately dipped into formalin solution. Agents in the fishing industry use formalin at various stages to avoid decay of fish,” he said.

He said that officials would continuously monitor the situation to ensure that such fish were not sold in Madurai.

Consumption of fish laced with formalin for a long period can increase the risk of cancer, said president of Indian Medical Association (Madurai) and toxicology specialist V. N. Alagavenkatesan. “It can cause abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. In the long run, consumption of such fish can cause gastrointestinal problem,” he said.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/two-tonnes-of-fish-destroyed/article30951981.ece
304,2020/02/29,TNTJ organises massive anti-CAA protests in Tirunelveli,"Muslims stage dharnas at seven places in the district

A few thousand Tamil Nadu Thowheed Jamaath (TNTJ) cadre staged dharnas at seven places in the district on Saturday against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Register of Citizenship (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR).

In a dharna organised at Shandy Corner in Melapalayam, over 5,000 Muslims participated to register their opposition to CAA, NRC and NPR and raised slogans against these moves being pushed by the Union Government.

The protestors also wanted the State Government to pass resolutions against the CAA, NRC and NPR following the footsteps of the Legislative Assemblies of West Bengal, Punjab, Bihar, Telengana, Puducherry, Rajasthan, Kerala and Madhya Pradesh.

“By adopting resolutions against the CAA, NRC and NPR, these States have made it clear that they would never sacrifice the rights of their citizens. Hence, the Tamil Nadu Government should also give such an assurance to its people,” said the protestors.

Speaking at the protest venue, B. Abdul Rahman, state vice-president of TNTJ, said anyone who could not produce proof for place of birth of his grandfather, his father’s and his would be forcibly moved to the detention camp and treated as refugee.

“When it was introduced in Assam, the Centre then clarified that it was necessary to identify the refugees who had sneaked into the north-eastern State from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan. However, the BJP-led Union Government is pushing the CAA, NRC and NPR across the country while the Sri Lankan refugees who are living in Tamil Nadu for more than 30 years have been denied citizenship. Its highly condemnable,” Mr. Abdul Rahman said.

He informed that their party would organise ‘fill-the-jail’ protest on March 18.

Similar protests were also organised at Palayamkottai, Pettai, Pattamadai, Paapaakudi, Ambasamudram and Ervadi.

305,2020/02/29,MSU finally decides to file police complaint against faculty,"The Manonmaniam Sundaranar University has finally decided to file a police complaint against one of its former Assistant Professors Vinod Vincent Rajesh of Department of History, facing sexual harassment charges levelled by a few girl students in 2015.

This decision has been taken after the affected girl students approached the Madurai Bench of Madras High Court which directed the MSU recently to file complaint with the police against the faculty within three weeks of its direction.

Though a good number of girl students charged that the faculty sexually harassed them in 2015, the administration did not take any punitive measure against him, forcing the students to stage protets on the University premises. As the protests went out of control, the MSU was forced to constitute an internal inquiry committee to probe the sexual harassment charges.

After the committee formed by the MSU comprising R. Kala of Department of Mathematics, P. Madhava Somasundaram of Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice and a few others inquired the affected students and witnesses, the committee recorded in its report that Vinod had used “unprofessional statements” in the classroom.

The committee recorded statements from 16 first year MA students, two second year MA students, four M.Phil students (2014 – 2015 batch), four faculty members, two research scholars and a non-teaching staff.

Though Vinodh Vincent Rajesh was suspended, he was reinstated and allowed to work in its constituent college at Nagalapuram. Meanwhile, the committee, which should have forwarded a complaint to the jurisdictional police even after prima facie case existed, did not fulfil the legal obligation forcing the students to approach the court that has directed the MSU to file police complaint.

307,2020/02/29,Stop abattoir work at Kudroli: Basavaraj,"Citing complaints and problems with the proposed modernisation of the abattoir at Kudroli, Urban Development Minister Byrathi Basavaraj on Saturday asked Mangaluru Smart City Limited to stop the work and take it up only after relocating to another place.

Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) activists the and Vishwa Hindu Parishad had been opposing MSCL’s proposed construction of the abattoir at Kudroli at a cost of ₹15 crore. The work was proposed by U.T. Khader, district in-charge Minister and Mangaluru MLA.

During a meeting to review works of MSCL and Mangaluru City Corporation, Mr. Basavaraj said he has received complaints about the proposed work at Kudroli.

“There will be problems if we proceed ahead with it. Stop the work first. The abattoir should be shifted to another location where the construction can be taken up,” he said, and added, “Do not go ahead with this work till I visit the (new) place and clear it.”

Denying any political motive behind the move, the Minister told reporters later that the decision to stop the ongoing works at Kudroli was taken in the best interest of citizens.

“The city needs a good abattoir and it can be done only if this abattoir is moved out. We cannot modernise the abattoir in the limited space available in Kudroli and stop water pollution,” he said. Process was on to find alternative land for the abattoir, he said.

308,2020/02/29,Urban Development Dept. clears proposal to construct transport hub: Minister,"MSCL Managing Director Mohammed Nazir said the parking for 400 vehicles was proposed on 1.55 acres of government land.

The Urban Development Department has cleared a proposal by Mangaluru Smart City Limited (MSCL) to develop the integrated transport hub [bus terminal project] at Pumpwell here and the same is awaiting the Cabinet’s nod, said Urban Development Minister Byrathi Basavaraj here on Saturday.

During a review of works of MSCL and the Mangaluru City Corporation, Mr. Basavaraj said the proposal to construct the transport hub on seven acres in Pumpwell was cleared by him a few days ago. The hub will be constructed on a public-private partnership (PPP) mode at estimated cost of ₹500 crore. MSCL Managing Director Mohammed Nazir said tenders will be floated after the Cabinet approval.

MSCL dropped its move of developing an integrated transport hub at Padil and instead proposed to build it opposite Karnataka Bank headquarters, as was proposed initially.

Councillor Premanand Shetty said that the construction of a multi-level car parking near Central Market was among the projects of MSCL, under the PPP model, that are getting delayed.

Mr. Nazeer said the parking for 400 vehicles was proposed on 1.55 acres of government land. As there was no response to tenders that were floated twice, it is now being done for the third time and two agencies have come forward, he said.

When Mr. Nazeer pointed that MSCL will deposit ₹25 crore to Railways for the latter to take up the construction of a road underbridge at Mahakalipadpu, the Minister asked the former to consider taking up the work on a 50:50 cost sharing basis.

“Several RUB works (in my constituency) in Bengaluru were taken up on a 50:50 basis. It saves money. Make use of our [Minister of State for Railways] Minister Suresh Angadi to get necessary the clearances,” he said.

While asking Deputy Commissioner Sindhu B. Rupesh to ensure the speedy completion of works taken up under the Smart City scheme, the Minister told Mr. Nazeer the works, namely waterfront development and other ‘smart’ initiatives, should be completed at the earliest.

309,2020/02/29,Manipal gets vaccination record-keeping platform,"Speaking on the occasion, Dr. Bhat said that many parents from migrant communities (55 %-75 %) lost their child’s vaccination card and were unaware of the complete 20 vaccinations schedule.

H. Vinod Bhat, Vice-Chancellor of Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE), launched “HealthGate Passport”, a vaccination record-keeping platform, here on Friday.

Speaking on the occasion, Dr. Bhat said that many parents from migrant communities (55 %-75 %) lost their child’s vaccination card and were unaware of the complete 20 vaccinations schedule. Thus, only 25 % of migrant children got complete vaccination hindering the country’s progress to reduce child mortality from vaccination preventable deaths.

To solve this problem, the Innovation Centre at MAHE, the Community Medicine Department, Kasturba Medical College (KMC) and the Manipal Institute of Technology (MIT) had developed a novel digital and visual platform to record vaccination. This included a mobile app for smart phones, where healthcare workers entered vaccination data.

The data is backed up on a secure Cloud server and also stored on a NFC smart card and provided to mothers along with a “HealthGate Passport” documenting vaccination dates. This entire package costs less than ₹ 200 per child, while it recorded the child’s entire vaccination history.

“During our feasibility study, we found this vaccination records technology has been enthusiastically accepted by our frontline health workers and mothers in five of our clinics, and the Dr. T.M.A. Pai Rotary Hospital in Karkala,” he said.

“The technology is easy to use as it saves our health workers at lot of time,” Suma Nair, Head, Department of Community Medicine, KMC, said. “Data entry on the smart phone is accurate and I can get quick reports on the number of vaccination that we have provided at the different clinics,” Chythra Rao, faculty, Department of Community Medicine, said.

“Using this technology, our migrant populations will be benefited as they can go to any clinic and their child’s vaccination records will be easily available to the doctors there,” according to Arun Shanbhag, Chief Innovation Officer, MAHE and Principal Investigator of the project funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Grand Challenges Explorer Awards.

314,2020/02/29,China February factory activity shrinks at record pace as virus bites,"Analysts predict low growth, or even a contraction, in the first quarter

Factory activity in China contracted at the fastest pace ever in February, even worse than during the global financial crisis, highlighting the colossal damage from the coronavirus outbreak on the world’s second-largest economy.

Also read | Qatar confirms first coronavirus case

China’s official Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) fell to a record low of 35.7 in February from 50.0 in January, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Saturday, well below the 50-point mark that separates monthly growth from contraction.

The sombre readings provide the first official snapshot of the Chinese economy’s state since the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic which has killed almost 3,000 people in mainland China and infected about 80,000.

Economic paralysis

The data foreshadows that the economic disruption from the virus will likely extend to the whole first quarter of 2020 since the disease outbreak has caused widespread transport curbs and required tough public health measures that have paralysed economic activity.

“We expect year-on-year growth in all activity data to be negative in January-February as China’s economy has been severely constrained since January 23,” said analysts at Nomura in a note after the data release, citing the extended Lunar New Year holiday and the slow resumption of businesses.

Nomura now expects first-quarter growth to be 2% year-on-year while Capital Economics estimates China’s economy would contract outright in year-on-year terms this quarter, the first time since at least the 1990s.

315,2020/02/29,TTK Prestige readies ₹500-cr. war chest for acquisition,"Company targets ₹1,000 cr. revenue from B2B markets; ropes in 30 NBFCs for last-mile reach

TTK Prestige is exploring the possibility of making two acquisitions, one in India and the other in the U.S. or Europe, as part of its market expansion strategy for which it has set aside ₹500 crore.

The company has decided to foray into B2B markets for products such as fans, water heaters, air-conditioners and other appliances. It is currently in talks with five appliance manufacturers in India and abroad.

TTK Prestige chairman, T.T. Jagannathan told The Hindu that, “We are acquiring, to get into new markets and product segments. For instance, we are not yet in fans, water heaters, air-conditioners or something like that. All these products are classified under B2B, and a very small number of these are sold to homes. There are big guys in this market, we are a home-ware firm and we can’t organically venture into B2B. That’s why we are out to shop.’’

As per Mr. Jagannathan, TTK is targeting a revenue of ₹1,000 crore from the B2B space in the next five years. TTK Prestige also has a mandate to hit ₹5,000 crore in revenue by 2025.

Commenting on TTK Prestige’s rural drive, he said the company had already roped in 30 NBFCs across India to ensure last-mile reach for its home and kitchen products.

“A year ago, we realised NBFCs were the best route to reach far-flung markets. Now, we have tied up with 30 of them. The idea is to set up godowns at taluk level and ship products from there to self-help groups or directly to customers. NBFCs will work out the financing and collection models,’’ he explained.

TTK Prestige had already sold products worth ₹140 crore in fiscal 2018-19 through an NBFC.

However, the collaboration was discontinued once the financing firm merged with a bank.

”Last year, we had a windfall revenue of ₹140 crore from rural markets. The NBFC earned 15% of its revenue from selling/financing our products. Our fresh NBFC collaborations have just started working and we are expecting a ₹40 crore revenue this year. From next year, rural growth will kick in big time and we will be able to fully remove the base effect and catch up in growth pace,’’ he added.

Innovation continues to be the key thrust area for Mr. Jagannan. The company has been launching 100 new home/kitchen products every year in the last 15 years. It currently has over 14,000 product SKUs.

``We try to understand pain points of each customer. As we introduce 100 new products a year, we might drop some of them. For instance, if there is a 40,000 drop in a particular product that we normally sell around 4 lakh units a year, that gives us an indication and we may pull that off the market.’’

TTK Prestige’s 30 member design and innovation team uses SOLIDWORKS’ 3D, CAD & CAM solutions, its own prototyping machines and home tools to design and develop products.

The home-ware brand has recently started using artificial intelligence to read, analyse and understand customer data.

“Unfortunately, we started collecting customer data only in the last five years. But what we so far captured is 10 times more than what we could have collected right from our inception. The basic data reveals the address, age, financial background, the products he brought while data mining gives you better customer insights. It helps us big way in ad too, there’s no need of carpet bombing anymore,’’ responded Mr Jagannathan, who has Master’s in Computer Science from Honolulu University.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/z0gywk/article30952600.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH01BUTTJAGANNATHAN,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/ttk-prestige-readies-500-cr-war-chest-for-acquisition/article30952601.ece

SBI Cards and Payment Services has raised nearly ₹2,800 crore — ₹2,769 crore to be precise — by allotting shares to anchor investors that include marquee names like Government of Singapore, Monetary Authority of Singapore, Nomura, Kuwait Investment Authority, BNP Paribas, Goldman Sachs, BlackRock and Fidelity, along with a host of mutual fund entities.

According to a statement by the company, the shares were allotted to a total of 74 anchor investors, including 12 mutual funds, through 48 schemes, at the upper end of the price band at ₹755.

Some of the largest allottees in the anchor allocation were Government of Singapore (5.44%), HDFC Mutual Fund (5.6%), Government Pension Fund Global (5.42%), Birla Mutual Fund (5.42%), Axis Mutual Fund (5.42%), Pioneer Investment Fund (5.06%), ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund (5.06%), Kotak Mutual Fund (4.08%) and Nomura Funds Ireland Public Limited Company — Nomura Funds Ireland — India Equity Fund (3.97%) among others.

IPO on March 2

The initial public offer of the card company will open on March 2. The issue will close for subscription on March 5 and the last day has been reserved for bids from retail and high networth individuals.

The public offering with a size of over ₹10,000 crore would see existing shareholders State Bank of India (SBI) and private equity major Carlyle diluting their stakes in the company.

SBI, which has a stake of 74% in the card company, would be offloading 4% stake by way of the offer, while private equity major Carlyle will be diluting its stake by 10% (it currently holds 26% stake).

SBI Cards is the second-largest credit card issuer in the country with a market share of 18% on the back of almost 10 million cards.

Its number of cards has grown three times over the last five years, while the spend has registered a sixfold rise in the period.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/uxc8u3/article29620715.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH09BUSBI,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/sbi-cards-allots-2800-cr-in-shares-to-anchor-investors/article30952548.ece

318,2020/02/29,State lethargy amidst cough syrup poisoning,"A national recall of Coldbest-PC, the medicine behind the death of 12 children in Jammu, is needed

A few days ago, we learnt that 12 children died in Udhampur district of Jammu due to poisoned cough syrup (Coldbest-PC). More are fighting for their life in a hospital. A team of doctors at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education & Research, Chandigarh, attributed the deaths to the presence of diethylene glycol in the cough syrup which was consumed by all the dead children. Diethylene glycol is an anti-freezing agent that causes acute renal failure in the human body followed by paralysis, breathing difficulties and ultimately death.

This is the fourth mass glycol poisoning event in India that has been caused due to a pharmaceutical drug. In 1973, there was a similar incident at the Children’s Hospital, Egmore in Chennai that caused the deaths of 14 children. In 1986, similar poisoning at Mumbai’s J.J. Hospital caused the deaths of 14 patients who were otherwise on the path to recovery. In 1998, 33 children died in two hospitals located in New Delhi due to similar poisoning. In all three cases, the manufacturer of the suspect cough syrup, due to negligence or human error, failed to detect and contain the level of diethylene glycol in the syrup, thereby causing poisoning of the patients who consumed it.

Tracking the sold bottles

There will be plenty of time later to ascertain the cause and prosecute the guilty but the immediate concern for doctors, pharmacists and the drug regulators should be to prevent any more deaths. The only way to do so is to account for each and every bottle of the poisoned syrup that has ever been sold in the Indian market and stop patients from consuming this drug any further. Any patient who has consumed even a spoon of the syrup should then immediately be referred to a hospital for treatment.

According to the information available on the website of the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA), in 1937, when the United States faced a similar situation with glycol poisoning, its entire field force of 239 inspectors and chemists were assigned to the task of tracking down every single bottle of the drug. Even if a patient claimed to have thrown out the bottle, the investigators scoured the street until they found the discarded bottle. This effort was accompanied by a publicity blitz over radio and television.

We do not see such public health measures being undertaken here; authorities are simply not communicating the seriousness of the issue to the general public. At most, the authorities in Himachal Pradesh (H.P.), who are responsible for oversight of the manufacturer of this syrup, have made general statements that they have ordered the withdrawal of the drug from all the other States where it was marketed. However, there is no transparency in the recall process and information about recalls and batch numbers is not being communicated through authoritative channels. There is no public announcement by the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI), which is responsible for overall regulation of the entire Indian market. The suspect product, although manufactured in H.P., has been sold across the country. The website of the DCGI, which is supposed to communicate drug alerts and product recalls, has no mention of Coldbest-PC as being dangerous as of this writing.

Need for a recall policy

One of the key reasons why the DCGI and state drug authorities have been so sloppy is because unlike other countries, India has not notified any binding guidelines or rules on recalling dangerous drugs from the market. The 59th report of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health as well as the World Health Organization (in its national regulatory assessment) had warned the DCGI on the lack of a national recall framework in India. A set of recall guidelines was drafted in 2012 but never notified into law. In 2016, in a report submitted by me to the Ministry of Health suggesting measures to reform the drug regulatory framework, I had pointed out to the Ministry that a national drug recall framework was in urgent need. In a pending case before the Delhi High Court, I have also sought for the notification of a national recall mechanism. The government is yet to file its response.

While a national recall of this adulterated medicine is the immediate need, the administration also needs to quickly identify which other pharmaceutical companies have received the spurious ingredient that was supplied to the manufacturer in H.P. from a trader in Chennai. It is very likely that the trader in question marketed the same ingredient to other pharmaceutical companies, who, like the manufacturer at the centre of the present scandal, may have failed to test it for its identity and purity. It is important for regulatory enforcement to raid and seize the records of the trader in Chennai and verify its sales. As of today, we have little to no information on whether any of this is happening. The lackadaisical response of drug regulators in India is not surprising. It is the result of a larger lethargy and arrogance that is emblematic of the babudom which is responsible for keeping us safe from unethical practices of pharmaceutical companies.

319,2020/02/29,Minimum government: On breakdown of governance in Delhi,"The Centre faces a trust deficit as it seeks to restore public order in riot-hit Delhi

The communal violence that has claimed 42 lives since Sunday has been subdued but tensions continue to simmer in Delhi. Stories of human courage and camaraderie that shone through amid orchestrated mayhem offer hope, but what rankles is the complete breakdown of governance from top to bottom in the national capital. Several credible accounts of horrendous acts of omission and commission by the Delhi Police have emerged. Instead of taking the police to task and wringing them into action, the Central government and the Delhi Lieutenant-Governor have fielded the Solicitor-General to shield them from judicial scrutiny. The Centre’s position in the court that action cannot be taken against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders who made incendiary speeches until the police had perused all such speeches is analogous to arguing that one criminal cannot be probed unless all others are also probed — a bizarre logic. The Delhi High Court, which took up the matter with the urgency that the situation demands on Wednesday, incapacitated itself a day later as a different bench headed by the Chief Justice D.N. Patel put the case off to April 13. Meanwhile, Kapil Mishra, one of the BJP leaders against whom police action was sought, called for a rally on Saturday, purportedly for peace but clearly intended to stoke the fire. The arguments of the country’s law officer were a public admission of the government’s refusal to act against members of the BJP. With such blatant partisanship and abdication of responsibility, the government cannot be expected to stop violence and restore communal peace.

Meanwhile, the Delhi police have acted swiftly against Tahir Hussain, an Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Councillor accused of involvement in murder and keeping sticks, stones and petrol bombs on the terrace of his house that was surrounded by a mob. The AAP has since suspended him from membership, and endorsed the police action against him. While the protests against the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act took a communal turn in several places, a counter-mobilisation also on communal lines has pushed the city to the brink in recent weeks. Right to assemble and protest is a fundamental right, but its exercise has to be in accordance with requirements of public order. It is the duty of the police to ensure that constitutional guarantees are upheld on the one hand, while, on the other, life and work goes on normally for the general population. The Central and Delhi governments, the police, and the judiciary have come up short against these markers of the rule of law. They are all facing a severe deficit of trust among the citizens. Peace and normalcy can be achieved only through restoration of the majesty and impartiality of the government. Unfortunately, there is no effort visible in that direction.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/minimum-government-the-hindu-editorial-on-breakdown-of-governance-in-delhi/article30945538.ece
320,2020/02/29,Regional bonding: On Ranil Wickremesinghe’s prescription for peace,"India needs to engage with its neighbours for the realisation of its global ambitions

At a time when India has more or less shut down all conversations on the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and walked away from the ASEAN-led Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), former Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe’s push for regional economic integration and for India-Pakistan dialogue should be studied carefully by New Delhi. Speaking at The Hindu’s Huddle conclave last week, Mr. Wickremesinghe set out a number of suggestions. He blamed India-Pakistan tensions for bringing economic integration within the SAARC region to a “standstill”, explaining that the original purpose of the South Asian group was to build a platform where bilateral issues could be set aside in the interest of regional growth. Decrying the lack of economic integration in South Asia, and the failure of SAARC, as well as BIMSTEC (which includes Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Thailand), to engender more intra-regional trade, Mr. Wickremesinghe suggested an even smaller sub-grouping of four countries with complementary economies: India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Thailand, to begin the process of reducing tariffs and demolishing non-tariff barrier regimes. When it comes to the intra-regional share of total trade, SAARC and BIMSTEC languish behind groupings such as ASEAN, EU and MERCOSUR. The Sri Lankan leader also suggested that with India’s leadership, a more integrated South Asian region would be better equipped to negotiate for better terms with RCEP so as not to be cut out of the “productivity network” in Asia, and envisioned an Economic Integration Road Map to speed up the process.

Given the current policy trajectory of the Modi government, it is unlikely that any of the suggestions will be welcomed. The government has made it clear that talks with Pakistan are strictly off the table, and that a SAARC summit, which has not been held since 2014, is unlikely to be convened anytime soon. Second, the government, which has taken a protectionist turn on multilateral trade pacts, is relying more on direct bilateral deals with countries rather than overarching ones that might expose Indian markets to flooding by Chinese goods. For any regional sub-grouping in South Asia to flourish, it is India that will have to make the most concessions given the vast trade deficits India’s neighbours have at present, which it may not wish to do. However, the overall projection that India’s global reach will be severely constrained unless it is integrated with its neighbours, and tensions with Pakistan are resolved, cannot be refuted. India needs to be more accommodative for the realisation of its ambitions.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/regional-bonding-the-hindu-editorial-on-ranil-wickremesinghes-prescription-for-india-pakistan-peace/article30945565.ece

322,2020/02/29,‘Current dispensation does not want any opposition’,"Activists and student organisations label BBMP’s resolution to ban protests at Town Hall as undemocratic

For decades, people and organisations who wanted their voices to be heard would gather outside the Town Hall to stage dharnas and protests. However, if the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) council has its way, this may soon end.

In a move that activists and several prominent citizens have labelled as “undemocratic”, council members on Saturday passed a resolution to ban protests in front of the Town Hall.

Critics of the resolution cited the symbolic value of Town Hall as a venue of protest and said this was an attempt to silence protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

Freedom fighter H.S. Doreswamy, who recently defied the authorities and staged a protest at Town Hall, believes that the resolution is part of a hidden agenda to suppress dissent in a phased manner.

Recently, the Bengaluru police announced that organisers have to sign indemnity bonds of up to ₹10 lakh as a precondition for permission to stage protests.

“The current dispensation does not want any opposition. They do not like to even acknowledge opposition, let alone accept it. In such times, what more can be expected,” he said, and added that such unethical and undemocratic restrictions should be opposed.

Over the last few months, the Town Hall has seen several organisations stage protests against the CAA and violence in other parts of the country. Historian Ramachandra Guha, who was one among many to be forcefully removed from the venue by the police during an anti-CAA protest, expressed hope that the Karnataka High Court would overturn the resolution should it come into effect. “A shocking and shameful resolution. It is designed to suppress the voice of the citizens,” he said.

Students, too, are unhappy with the BBMP’s decision.

Sithara H.M., a student activist, said, “The Town Hall is a landmark where people come to express not only their dissent but also their grievances. Banning people from doing it is as good as asking people not to express their problems at all.”

Space for dissent shrinking?

Over the years, spaces to stage protests have been shrinking, say activists.

“During the freedom movement and even much later, there were a lot of places to protest. People could freely and peacefully assemble and protest at Dharmambudhi lake, Chiklalbagh (close to Majestic), Bannappa Park, Freedom Park, to name a few places,” said freedom fighter H.S. Doreswamy.

Activist Vinay Sreenivasa said that democracy demands that people question the government, hold them accountable, and protests are a way to do that. “Ten years back, they stopped allowing protests on M.G. Road, near Gandhi statue. Now this. We cannot accept this curtailing of rights,” he added.

Gandhian and theatre personality Prasanna Heggodu said, “Vidhana Soudha, Vikasa Soudha, and politicians are inaccessible. Even newspaper offices have become increasingly inaccessible.”",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/dlxjco/article30951976.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01BGPROTESTATTOWNHALL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/current-dispensation-does-not-want-any-opposition/article30952654.ece

324,2020/02/29,BBMP to bar protests outside Town Hall,"Opposition claims resolution was passed in an undemocratic manner

Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) councillors on Saturday resolved to impose a ban on protests outside the iconic Sir Puttanna Chetty Town Hall on J.C. Road. Since December last year, Town Hall has been the site of multiple protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (Act). The decision was taken through a resolution at a BBMP council meeting.

The resolution was passed towards the end of the council meeting along with other decisions. Members of the opposition alleged that it was not part of the agenda.

“We were not even aware of it. There was no discussion before this. Soon after the resolution was passed, the council was adjourned,” former mayor Gangambike Mallikarjun told The Hindu.

Nineteen resolutions were passed on Saturday, and the one banning protests was number 16 on the list.

Defending the move, Mayor Gautham Kumar said that frequent protests in front of Town Hall were causing inconvenience to the general public as well as for organisers of programmes inside Town Hall. “As a result of these protests, people were not coming forward to book the Town Hall,. This has impacted the revenue of the civic body,” he said.

He also cited traffic jams, congestion and snarls around Town Hall as reasons for this decision. “There are many important roads near Town Hall. To keep the sanctity of the place, we have decided to ban any kind of protest or demonstration or rally in front of Town Hall,” he said, adding that he had also spoken to the Police Commissioner regarding the issue.

The Mayor said that protesters can use Freedom Park or Maurya Circle, and that facilities would be made available for them. “The parking lot at Freedom Park will be completed in three months. It will have the capacity for 560 vehicles,” he added.

‘We will protest against this at Town Hall itself’

Leader of Opposition in the BBMP, Abdul Wajid, said that the resolution was passed in an undemocratic manner. He concurred with Ms. Mallikarjun’s account of the events during the council meeting.

“It was a monthly meeting for zero hour issues. We are going to take up the issue in the upcoming meeting, and will protest against it at Town Hall itself,” he said. “This is unlawful. Who are they to say that people cannot protest at a place where protests have been taking place for decades? The BJP has resorted to an undemocratic way of passing it.”

The resolution will be forwarded to the State government for approval.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/dlxjco/article30951976.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01BGPROTESTATTOWNHALL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bbmp-to-bar-protests-outside-town-hall/article30951977.ece
325,2020/02/29,COVID-19: International schools urge students and families not to travel to affected countries,"Those returning from these countries may face a 14-day quarantine

Many international schools have sent advisories to their students and parents asking that the management be alerted if any family member recently visited countries where cases of COVID-19 are prevalent. This includes China, South Korea, Italy, Japan and Iran.

Some schools have also asked students to not travel to these countries. The Canadian International School (CIS), for instance, sent a circular on Friday stating that all families must be discouraged to travel to affected countries during the spring break in April. The circular stated those returning from these countries may face a 14-day quarantine.

This means that Grade 10 and 12 students may have to miss out on their IGCSE and IB examinations that begin in May. According to the circular, there will be no alternative arrangement to appear for the exams, and students may not receive a final grade for the IGCSE exams.

“Any family that does travel and return from Korea, Iran or Italy over the break, we ask that you voluntarily inform us of your travel. We need to ensure the safety of all our students, teachers and families. We also urge families to seriously consider not travelling to Japan, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia and Taiwan,” said the school management in a statement.

Shweta Sastri, Managing Director, CIS, said, “In a situation where various countries are closing their borders, we want to be safe and mindful of not making any non-essential travel to countries that have a large outbreak of COVID-19.”

Inventure Academy, too, has started taking similar steps as a safety precaution. Nooraine Fazal, Chief Executive Officer at Inventure Academy, said that they have held a series of awareness programmes in the school and have also sent an advisory. “We have asked parents to inform us of their travel plans and also are vigilant on hygiene, and are conducting awareness sessions for our students,” she said.

Aloysius D'Mello, principal of Greenwood High, said that they are not allowing their students from Thailand, Malaysia and Korea to go home for their spring break. “We have even told families that they need to alert us if any member travels to any of these countries. If students have a cough and cold, we are telling them not to come for classes,” he said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/covid-19-international-schools-urge-students-and-families-not-to-travel-to-affected-countries/article30951881.ece
326,2020/02/29,Lack of STPs: ‘Don’t disconnect power supply as of now’,"HC directs KSPCB to pass final orders based on showcause notices only after giving a hearing to the petitioner-associations

In a temporary relief to hundreds of residents and owners of flats in some of the apartment complexes located in Mahadevapura, Bellandur and Marathahalli, the Karnataka High Court has directed the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) not to resort to disconnection of power supply for a certain period for failing to either install sewage treatment plants (STPs) or treating sewage as per specified norms.

A division bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Hemant Chandangoudar passed the interim order on a batch of petitions filed by Sherwood Residents’ Welfare Association, Marathahalli and 12 other apartment owners’ associations.

The KSPCB had issued showcause notices to the petitioner-associations asking why the Board should not issue directions to the Bangalore Electricity Supply Company Limited to cut power supply for failing to install STPs as per the directions of the National Green Tribunal or adhering to norms in treating the sewage in STPs installed in the apartments.

The bench did not interfere in KSPCB’s action of issuing showcause notices but directed the Board to pass final orders based on showcause notices only after giving an opportunity of hearing to the petitioner-associations.

However, the bench said that even if the Board passes a final order to disconnect power supply for not complying with environmental norms, such orders for disconnection of power supply should not be implemented for a period of 15 days from the date on which the final orders were served on the petitioner-associations. This interim order was passed considering the peculiar fact that each apartment complex comprises hundreds of residential units.

328,2020/02/29,New single-window clearance system for buildings,"BBMP officials promise clearances within 45 days

Citizens and real estate developers will soon be able to get approval for building and house plans with ease. The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), on Friday, launched a beta version of its single-window digital platform that people can access online to apply for construction permits and building plan approvals.

Civic officials promise that with this new system – which will bring about transparency and accountability – plans will be verified and approved within 45 days. The platform has integrated all the government agencies and departments that issue No Objection Certificates (NoC). Sanction plans will be given within 18 days, the commencement certificate within nine days and, if all documents are approved, the occupancy certificate will be issued within 18 days.

In the current system, a majority of the processes are manual. Home-owners and builders have to go through 54 different processes to get all the clearances.

“All of them have been reduced to 10 procedures now,” said BBMP Commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar.

Trial period

The new Online Building Plan Approval System developed under the Ease of Doing Business (EoDB) went live on Friday. Mr. Kumar said that the new system will be available before April 1. “We are in a trial period now. Based on the experience and practical aspects, we will fine-tune it and launch the platform within a month,” he said.

In the new system, structures will be classified into five risk categories depending on the number of storeys, space, and other factors. The platform will allow for empanelled architects to approve plans. The BBMP will also be training interested engineers and architects in the rules and regulations.

The new system aims to make the process hassle-free as possible as it will introduce single payment of fees to all agencies.

Mayor M. Goutham Kumar said that senior BBMP officials and elected representatives had visited the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to study how the system works in Mumbai. “These reforms will attract more investors to the city, give the economy a boost and increase employment opportunities in Bengaluru,” he said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/41gx34/article30946065.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29BgBuildingcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/new-single-window-clearance-system-for-buildings/article30946066.ece

Tamil Nadu Thowheed Jamath (TNTJ) organised a protest opposing the implementation of Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and here on Saturday. More than 300 men and women participated in the day long protest organised near Mandi Street in Vellore.

A similar protest was organised at the entrance of Thandarampattu taluk office, where more than 300 women gathered and raised slogans against the CAA and National Population Register (NPR). Organisers of the event said the protest was in solidarity with those whose citizenship would be affected through the CAA.

333,2020/02/29,Special Deputy Collector caught for taking bribe,"₹76.64 lakh of alleged bribe money was recovered from his house

The Directorate of Vigilance and Anti Corruption (DVAC) officials caught a Special Deputy Collector (Stamps), who received a bribe of ₹50,000 from M. Ranjithkumar of Irumbuli village, Tiruvannamalai, for stamp duty evaluation of land registration.

Sources said S. Dhinakaran was caught red-handed near Sathuvachari, Vellore on Friday night with a large amount of cash including that received from Ranjithkumar .

Based on this incidence, the DVAC conducted a raid on his house in Thangal near Thiruvalam in Katpadi area, where ₹76.64 lakh, alleged bribe money accumulated by Dhinakaran over the years, was recovered.

Ranjithkumar had registered his ancestral land of 1.47 acre in August last year. The property was found to be undervalued by the Registrar and the case was referred to Deputy Collector (Stamps) for stamp duty evaluation. Dhinakaran asked Ranjithkumar, through his associate, to pay him ₹50,000 for the evaluation. DVAC sources said, Dhinakaran demanded that the amount be paid immediately, as he was transferred a couple of days ago.

Ranjithkumar agreed to pay the bribe, asking Dhinakaran to wait near an ATM near Vellore Collectorate on Friday night. Meanwhile, he informed the DVAC about the demand. Officials laid a trap and gave Ranjithkumar chemical-coated currency notes and waited near the spot for Dhinakaran, who was returning from Gudiyatham.

Dhinakaran came in a private vehicle driven by his confidant, Rameshkumar, picked up Ranjithkumar and received the money. Ranjithkumar was dropped off near Vellore bus stand. The DVAC team, which included inspectors S. Vijay, M. Rajinikanth, S. Mythili and S. Vijayalakshmi, chased the car, driving towards Sathuvachari, for about two kilometres before cornering it. The officials recovered ₹2.40 lakh unaccounted cash from the car.

Dhinakaran was produced before a court in Vellore on Saturday, which remanded him to judicial custody, DVAC sources said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/3wdeiy/article30952991.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH29DINAKARANRAID,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/special-deputy-collector-caught-for-taking-bribe/article30952992.ece

336,2020/02/29,With an eye to preserving instruments of a bygone era,"The Elliot’s Museum with its ophthalmological wonders reopens after renovation

The 100-year-old Elliot’s Museum at the bicentenary Regional Institute of Ophthalmology and Government Ophthalmic Hospital (RIO - GOH) in Egmore was reopened recently following an extensive renovation exercise. It features instruments and equipments that are obsolete now. They are being preserved for posterity.

“The museum has been acclaimed as one of the best in the world by distinguished ophthalmologists visiting the hospital. The ophthalmological community would find it fascinating to learn how the instruments from a bygone era were made and how they functioned. The collection includes instruments meant for diagnosis as well as treatment. Among them is an instrument called “giant magnet stand” which is used in the treatment of injuries caused by welding. Using this instrument, the iron particles that are set deep in eyes would be removed. Although the patient would not regain his vision, he would be relieved of pain,” says Prof. Dr. M.V.S. Prakash, Deputy Superintendent, RIO - GOH.

Further, the museum has paintings of a few patients that seek to present certain diseased conditions. Besides, a good number of hand-written case sheets along with diagrams since 1867 are preserved as manuscripts in glass cases.

“We wonder why our predecessors took the effort of having paintings of patients. And then, the handwritten case sheets are quite legible. It shows the quality of paper and ink of those days. They have clearly withstood the test of time,” says Prakash.

There are models of eyeballs made of porcelain with the features of tropical diseases engraved in them and the labels etched in French.

The museum will be opened to medical fraternity.

337,2020/02/29,"Finally, permanent median at key road","From wooden logs to concrete slabs, the stretch had seen many makeshift arrangements in the past

Finally, permanent medians are being constructed between Collector Nagar traffic signal and Officers’ Colony tri-junction on Ambattur Industrial Estate Main Road. This has been a long-pending request of Mogappair residents after the stretch started witnessing frequent accidents, especially at the ‘U’ turn.

A few years ago, the State Highways officials placed discarded wooden logs and concrete slabs as median along the stretch to prevent motorists from jumping on the opposite lane before the traffic signal. But the attempt was unsuccessful as many motorists pushed these logs and took ‘U’ turn before the traffic signal to reach the opposite lane.

Police was also helpless as they could not monitor all motorists on the stretch especially youngsters who drive at a high speed. Many young motorists would rush through the gaps on the crowded stretch, said a police person.

As the policemen were busy regulating the traffic and also clearing vehicular rush at key intersections other traffic points on the stretch were left unguarded.

“The entire median work will be completed in the next few weeks,” said a State Highways official.

The 60-feet Ambattur Industrial Estate Road is the main gateway for more than two dozen streetsto reach Anna Nagar, Thirumangalam, Padi, Kolathur and the Poonamallee High (PH) Road via the Ambattur Estate Road.

The stretch also connects a number of neighbourhoods like Nolambur, Mogappair, Padi, Thirumangalam with the busy Jawaharlal Nehru (J.N)Main Road.

“Construction of permanent median was our long standing demand to prevent accidents. We are happy that median is being constructed. We request authorities to install other safety features like reflectors and zebra markings along the new median,” said V.

338,2020/02/29,Navalur Panchayat asked to restore the second pond,"Residents of Olympia Panache in Navalur are happy that the Navalur Panchayat has restored one waterbody near their community, and are hoping another nearby would receive the same treatment

Two ponds nestle close to Olympia Panache, a sprawling community in Navalur, that is set in a villa-based horizontal development format.

While the pond on the northern side has been restored by the Navalur Panchayat, the one on the southern side is a picture of neglect, with a carpet of green settling over it and unruly vegetation including typha surrounding it.

Treated sewage is being let into the pond by commercial entities found nearby.

When Sekhar Raghavan of The Rain Centre visited our community to help us with rainwater harvesting strategies, there are two things he pointed out: That we had to build recharge wells within the community to protect the freshwater table in our area. Besides that, he pointed out how invaluable the ponds would be in rainwater harvesting. The rainwater runoffs could be directed to these ponds.

However, the inflow of impure water into the pond on the southern side has to be checked first.

The Navalur Panchayat could not restore this pond around the time the one on the northern side was restored, due to certain practical difficulties.

We request the Panchayat to take steps to stop the inflows into the pond, and also take up its restoration at the earliest date possible.

339,2020/02/29,"At Avvai Shanmugam Salai stop, two-wheelers occupy the space meant for buses and commuters","At Avvai Shanmugam Salai stop, two-wheelers occupy the space meant for buses and commuters

Waiting for buses at Avvai Shanmugam Salai (Lloyds Road) in Royapettah is tantamount to being part of an obstacle race. A row of two-wheelers parked at the bus bay prevent MTC bus drivers from stopping at the spot designated for commuters; they stop a few metres away. Every time a bus arrives, one can see hapless commuters running behind the vehicles.

The bus stop is located a few hundred metres away from where the stretch intersects with Gowdiaamutt Road in Royapettah.

“Due to parking of two-wheelers on the bus bay, some commuters including senior citizens wait away from the bus stop,” said K. Shivakumar, a commuter from Thousand Lights.

As many automobile workshops are located near the bus stop, two-wheelers that come for repairs are also seen near the bus bay. During evening hours, commuters find it risky to board buses from the bus stop as they are unable to negotiate these vehicles. Anti-socials also loiter on the stretch especially in the evening hours. Halting of buses away from the bus stop results in traffic chaos on the narrow stretch (Avvai Shanmugam Salai) near its intersection with Gowdiamutt Road.

At present, motorists from all directions including from Masilamani Street try to cross the opposite side of the junction. The junction does not have a proper roundabout to allow motorists to use it to reach the opposite side of the junction. During rush hour, every one wants to cross the junction at the same time resulting in accidents. Adding to these existing traffic woes, motorists said that halting of buses away from the bus stop on the stretch also pose risk to all road users including commuters and motorists.

“Steps will be taken to remove illegal parking of bikes at the bus stop soon,” said a Corporation official.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/4usgnk/article30950402.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01DCMYPRBUSSHELTER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/at-avvai-shanmugam-salai-stop-two-wheelers-occupy-the-space-meant-for-buses-and-commuters/article30950404.ece
340,2020/02/29,How 5th street got a makeover in six months,"This is one of the achievements by the revived Luz Avenue West Residents Association

For a long time, I have been trying to get the bin at the corner of Luz Avenue 5th street moved out or cleared. Last year, in July, a new resident to the area met me with three of her neighbours about the eyesore at our street. We talked and decided to do something about issues around us, before that we wanted to revive the defunct association.

Luz Avenue West Residents Association (LAWRA) was actually started in the 80s with a subscription of ₹5 per month, but within a few years it died out. Some residents tried to revive it, but met with the same result.

Around the same time when we were talking about doing something for the area, a Greater Chennai Corporation employee had come with pamphlets to create awareness on waste segregation. This got me thinking about getting the bin removed from the corner of our street. We met, discussed our plan and started talking to the conservancy inspector about door-to-door collection of garbage.

We slowly started discussing other issues such as conservation of water and the need for rainwater harvesting wells on the street. Another residents association had installed several of these units.

This motivated us to try and do the same as the small street, turning off from ours used to get flooded. With all the garbage and stench from urine, it was impossible to walk through the stretch and it got worse during rains.

With signatures of consent from residents, we met MLA R.Natraj and requested for constructing RWH wells and removal of bins. Meanwhile we got handouts ready and went door-to-door explaining about RWH and also requesting contributions. We started a WhatsApp group for the Association in August. Today, we have 33 members and counting.

The MLA’s personal assistant, Suresh, came with a contractor to install RWH wells. This was of great help as TANGEDCO, Metrowater and MMWSSB had to help us choose spots. We installed three and the MLA contributed towards installing one for the Association.

These two initiatives set the ball rolling for many other concerns we wanted addressed. The corporation school wall was broken by a bulldozer that was clearing out garbage. With the contribution by a sponsor we got the broken school wall restored with metallic sheets, had it painted and placed some plants. This caught the attention of residents and they were more enthusiastic and supportive.

Conservancy inspector Jaikumar rallied with us to start door-to-door collection of waste. I had seen the work done by NGO Karam Korpom, so we roped them to spruce up a garbage black spot in the street that was used for parking vans. With subscription amount and some donation we got both walls painted. Now this street is a pleasant walk through. Trees have been trimmed and the lights shone bright. We recently got pavements re-laid, again with contribution from residents.

The MLA’s office, AE and CI have been extremely helpful. Mylapore Resident Welfare Association secretary Viswanathan has been guiding us.

Our Pongal get-together had dance, rangoli, tea and snacks.

We are yet to form a committee but our focus is on taking up more improvements.

341,2020/02/29,Why COVID-19 may affect Chennai Metro’s phase I extension deadline,"Officials of Chennai Metro Rail Limited said many parts and electrical equipment were usually purchased from China, but offices there are shut due to the epidemic

Chennai Metro Rail’s phase I extension project that links the northern part of the city to the centre, has hit a new problem now because of COVID-19. Many components that are required for the project need to come from China, and contractors are now looking for alternatives as many offices in China have been shut because of the epidemic.

According to officials of Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL), many parts for platform screen doors, some parts needed for civil work, electrical equipments and lifts are usually purchased from China by various contractors. Some of the contractors have already communicated to CMRL on the possible impact and delays this is likely to cause the project, sources said.

“Though most of the materials for this project have already reached the city, we are yet to procure some items. We have now instructed the contractors to look for alternatives from other countries or within India itself. For instance, for platform screen doors -- that were installed in underground stations as a safeguard to bar commuters from entering the tracks -- we have told contractors to look for glass or steel from other locations. Similarly for the civil work too, contractors are finding options in other cities. The reason they usually choose China is it is relatively cheap,” an official said.

When asked if this will have a major impact on the project, officials said there may be some effect but they will make up for it and finish the project on time. “We are hoping to get all the components soon. The work is already on in full swing, and when we receive the remaining parts for some of the work, it should be finished as well. We will ensure this doesn’t delay the project,” another official said.

342,2020/02/29,A page out of an initiative,"With near-professional systems in place and activities built around reading, a library at a gated-community on OMR has become a social hub for residents

In any metro, gated communities-based libraries are bound to be as numerous as the pages of The Complete Miss Marple – for those unaware of it, this tome lumps together the Miss Marple novels and stories by Agatha Christe and runs to a whopping 4,032 pages.

These libraries may be thick on the ground, but the ones that go beyond a dilettante style of functioning are only as numerous as the words in Ernest Hemingway’s six-word short story.

Usually run with time volunteered by enthusiasts in the community, these libraries can get desultory, and when the initial enthusiasm is spent, it is just a matter of time before they start functioning fitfully, or be shut down.

Hooked On Books — a library at The Central Park South (TCPS), a gated community in Sholinganallur — is among a handful of such libraries in and around Chennai that seem to be bucking the trend.

It seems to have got a basic fact right — books need not necessarily draw children to reading, but activities centred around books surely will.

The library has become a hub of reading-related activities since September 2019.

Sumitha Iyer, a resident of TCPS and one of the key members of the Federation of OMR Residents Associations, and Rakesh Ohri, president of TCPS residents’ association, attribute the changes to the volunteering work at the library by two new residents of TCPS — Supriya Santhanam and Aruna Venkateswaran.

Reading challenges

Supriya begins, “As we wanted to make reading sustained, and the visits more regular, we first started a 30 books in 30 days challenge. As this was a steep challenge for those from certain age groups, we then launched a winter-reading programme, from November 15 to December 29, with varying reading targets for different categories. Wee readers ( six years and under) – 45 books in 45 days; Book Buddies (ages 7 to 12) – 30 books; The Bookaholics (ages 13 to 19) – 15 books; and The Wise Owls (20 + years) – six books.” There are rewards for children, but not adults. The children who complete a challenge successfully get a star in their membership card, and also get to borrow one book more than their stipulated weekly quota. They will be part of the golden club.”

The participants are given their reading logs, where they can colour in the titles that they have to read.

“As reading challenges come with an end time, and therefore exert pressure on the readers, we also started the ‘Reading Bingo’ programme that children can follow at their leisure. It offers them fun choices such as these: “Read with a hat on”, “Read to a friend”, and “Read Out Loud”. It is based on some of the popular reading challenges, and primarily aimed at infusing fun into reading,” says Supriya.

Early on, the volunteers realised that getting the entire family involved is essential to keeping the reading initiative and library going at a regular and steady pace.

Story time

“We have story-times at the library, and these are becoming popular. Budding Bookworms Storytime takes place twice a month, on alternate Thursdays, and has parents of the children in the community telling stories to the little ones. Grandma/ Grandpa Storytime is on alternate Fridays, and has grandparents telling stories to the little ones. Besides, we have started Storytime By Kids, again twice a month, where kids tell stories for other kids,” explains Supriya.

Another striking feature of the library is the clear-cut systems: There are book boxes and racks with books segregated on the basis of reading levels.

“Each member of a family can have a membership card, but a parent can take only books that pertain to their age group/ level. They can’t borrow a children's book on their card for their children,” says Supriya.

Another carefully-followed system is the “Author of The Month” section and “New Arrivals”, with one featuring books of a particular author and the other displaying books added to the library recently.

Currently, the author of the month, Ruskin Bond looks on cheerfully from a displayed photograph, with some of his books standing proudly by.

“Second-hand books bought from the recent book fair and those received from the recent Book Swap event by FOMRRA are in the new-arrivals boxes,” says Supriya.

Upcycling discards

The furniture and the book racks and other related paraphernalia have “reuse philosophy” written all over them.

Drawers of discarded shelves have been turned into book boxes. TMT steel rods have been put together to create newspaper stands. Car rims have been repurposed into seats.

The volunteers feel the necessity of more volunteering and are giving the finishing touches to a plan to start what they call “Library Helper Squad”.

“This squad will consist of children, with each little volunteer placed in charge of the maintenance of one rack,” says Aruna. “ I learnt everything about the kind of books children would need at every stage by just observing my 10-year-old daughter, Varshita.”

Supriya says the same thing, and sees her 10-year-old daughter Mithra as the guiding light.

“The highlight of the initiative is that it is entirely free. The residents are not charged, and everything that you find in the library came as a result of a donation from residents. Even the talent to make the place what it is and also run it, is sourced in-house, and for free,” says Rakesh.

As one enters the library, a wall stares at you with a panorama of images from Jungle Book, presented in oil paint, and they have come from the brushes of two residents: Anita Sivakumar and Padmini Rambhatla.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/uu2ot6/article30950183.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01dcadyrDowComTCPSlibrary1jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/a-page-out-of-an-initiative/article30950188.ece
343,2020/02/29,World Wildlife Day | When was the last time you spotted this mammal?,"A howl-out for the golden jackal, safe for the time being but suffering from habitat fragmentation and loss around Chennai

There is that kind of loss where one has an acute sense of something fading away. There is the other, more dangerous kind where the loss is slow, the result of an insidious process, and is hardly noticed. In the latter case, usually, when the realisation dawns, the moment of redemption is well past.

Let us hope that the latter is not happening to the golden jackal, currently considered safe. The mammal ticks the “least concern” box of the IUCN species status grid, suggesting that there is no cause for concern.

The golden jackal is an open-habitat creature; and found in grasslands, scrub and on the periphery of wetlands. Naturalists focussing on tracts in and around Chennai say that there are some stable golden jackal populations in some pockets. It however can’t be denied that the mammal is beating a retreat, around the urban environment, due to factors such as habitat fragmentation and loss.

“There is a stable population at the Guindy National Park. During 2016 and 2017, when I was working on a project to document birds and butterflies at GNP, along with birder Rama Neelamegam, during every visit we would have a golden jackal sighting,” points out Vikas Madhav, a member of Madras Naturalists’ Society (MNS).

“There is a pair of golden jackals on the Madras Christian College campus,” he adds.

It is likely the same pair reported by a faculty member of the college a few years ago — the report of the sighting even appeared in the pages of The Hindu.

However, anthropogenic activities may be arrayed against the golden jackal. There are also cases of human-animal conflict involving the golden jackal in and around Chennai.

“In villages in the Kancheepuram-Chengalpattu region, I have encountered cases of golden jackal poisoning. Once in a while, golden jackals would attack goats and chicken and residents would place poison in the intestines of a dead chicken to lure and kill the golden jackals. Eating them, golden jackals have died,” says M. Yuvan, an MNS member.

T. Murugavel, also an MNS member, points out that golden jackals are not seen in the Adyar estuary as often as before.

“Around a decade or so ago, seeing a golden jackal cross the estuary at low tide would not be rare. There used to be islands in the estuary with prosopis juliflora trees. These jackals would be resting under the shade of these trees when it would be very hot. The prosopis trees, which are an alien species, were removed without any new native trees being planted in their place. It just illustrates that when an alien plant species is being removed, the exercise has to be carried out in a phased manner, with alternative native plants planted in a section where the alien species has been cleared, and only then move to the next section. Now, due to the lack of cover, the golden jackals could have moved into the Theosophical Society region or the Adyar Poonga,” says Murugavel.

“Fifteen years ago, around the Adyar estuary, golden jackals could be sighted frequently. Besides, at the adjacent Theosophical Society campus in Adyar-Besant Nagar, they would be a common occurrence. Now, on the Besant Nagar side of TS, golden-jackal sighting has become close to none for the last eight years or so. Across TS itself, the number has dwindled. The Ennore-pulicat bio region supports golden jackals. On the pulicat side, there is still a healthy population. However, in the Ennore region, they are hardly seen, due to habitat loss,” says Yuvan.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/ptgxsq/article30950173.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01dcgoldenjackal2jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/when-was-the-last-time-you-spotted-this-mammal/article30950175.ece
344,2020/02/29,Raising the banner of sustainability,"An installation-painting involving an old stitched-up vinyl banner promotes the wisdom behind ‘reuse philosophy’, at DakshinaChitra

At DakshinaChitra, a squat, low and functional table is parked in a corner. Draped in a cloth, it is overlaid with discarded items. Each discard is named and its “longevity” numbered, on sheets placed next to them. The presentation shows that most of these discards hold on to their dear life, surviving for a considerably long time, continuing all the while as a thorn in the flesh of planet earth.

So, picking out a few from the table, there are the plastic bottles, the plastic bags, and a styrofoam block, which are marked as taking a few hundreds of years, or considerably more to decompose.

It is a striking visual message: That non-biodegradable waste can clog the earth and can ultimately choke it, and that it takes the 3R philosophy of “Reduce, Recycle and Reuse” to deal with them effectively.

One more display is now buttressing this message: It is a 12 feet by 12 feet reused vinyl banner.

When this writer saw this banner, a few days ahead of DAM (Design Art and Music) fest, this banner was propped up against a wall, not too far from the table with its visual reminders.

Presenting unfurled flowers, the water-colour painting is aligned with a theme, “Bloom”.

Kaustav Sengupta explains, “ ‘Bloom’ is about restarting and starting afresh, and taking the right course: It is about trying to restart our planet through sustainable living.”

DAM fest is organised and curated by academicians and founders of InkLink Trust Kaustav Sengupta and Shaswati Sengupta, in collaboration with DakshinaChitra.

The two curators want this installation to serve as a symbol of sustainability. Sharath Nambiar, director of DakshinaChitra, says, “Even after the DAM fest, this old, repainted vinyl banner will be kept at DakshinaChitra as an installation art that presents a sustainability message.”

At the time of this article going to print, the two-day DAM fest (February 29 and March 1) will be under way and this reused vinyl banner will form the frontispiece of an exercise to demonstrate how to deal with such environmental-unfriendly discards.

“Given the grade of plastic that has gone into the making of this vinyl banner, it will take a few hundred years to decompose. So, the best way of getting rid of such old banners that are still around is to continually reuse them and not go in for new ones, and thereby prevent them from damaging the environment,” says Kaustav.

The 12 by 12 feet banner was birthed out of four old banners that were stitched together, a fact that becomes evident when one looks behind it. They display details of events from the past.

What are the alternatives to vinyl banners that artists can try out?

“There are paper and fabric banners, among others. While switching to eco-friendly alternatives, the reality of existing old vinyl banners has to be also dealt with.

Any exercise to reuse such banners is complete and meaningful only if it is accompanied by an exhortation to reuse such banners,” says Kaustav.

He continues, “It is absolutely necessary to wean ourselves off these old vinyl banners too, by using them sparingly and wisely — so, for the main display, say on the stage, an old vinyl banner could be reworked and re-used. The rest of the displays should involve eco-friendly alternatives.”

Kaustav points out there are various strands to sustainability, including the social strand which covers livelihoods.

“I am always sad that artisans and artists who used to paint banners have lost their jobs due to technological advances in the printing industry... Now we print everything via offset printing,” he explains. “So, if we can get the artisanal skills back... they can earn their living again. So, the sustainability initiative here looks at sustainability, environmentally as well as socially.”

The process of reusing and painting the banner was carried out with the help of a group of specially-trained students from NIFT under the guidance of Kaustav and Shaswati.

Kaustav believes the “Reuse” philosophy has to be promoted to counter our mindless consumption patterns.

“Reusing banners is linked to a larger philosophy of life. It keeps us humble. Remember, in the earlier days, brothers would wear the same shirt, one after the another. No shame; no splurge.”",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/7733me/article30950163.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01DCADYRVINYLBANNERREUSING1JPG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/raising-the-banner-of-sustainability/article30950168.ece
345,2020/02/29,Lessons for Chennai from Indore’s vegetable markets,"On-site composting units, thela banks and on-the-spot fines were among factors that turned them into clean shopping areas

Indore has bagged the clean-city tag in Swachh Survekshanan four times, and one has to only look at how the Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC) has transformed its vegetable markets into clean shopping areas to know what got the city up there.

The IMC worked on a four-pronged strategy: Creative Awareness, Continual Training, Sustained Engagement and Regular Enforcement.

Non governmental organisations empanelled by the IMC to drive the campaign, especially the source-segregation part of it, in the markets and commercial areas say that the campaign was extremely successful in that it got vendors to have a sense of ownership about the place they were conducting their businesses from.

One of the first things these agencies did towards winning the confidence of vendors was to ensure they got a clean place every day when they returned to do business.

IMC has more than 80 commercial areas, with eight to 10 vegetable markets. All the shop owners, which included pushcart vendors, had to compulsorily invest in a bin. The capacity of the bin ranged from 12 litres onwards, depending on the waste the shop generated. No outlet in the vicinity was allowed to sell polythene bags.

Fighting plastic pollution

“Thela banks (shops selling cloth bags) were set up at three to four markets where shoppers who were not carrying their own bags can buy them. Sometimes we would bring a women’s self-help group to sit with a stitching machine at these shops and people could upcycle their old torn clothes into shopping bags,” says Captain Sunpreet, director Human Matrix, a solid waste management firm working with IMC.

The next major emphasis was on ensuring waste from the market was cleared periodically by sanitary workers. IMC invested in on-site composting facilities at smaller markets where waste could be disposed of easily and quickly.

“At the biggest wholesale market, a 20 tonne bio-methanation plant was set up to convert waste into gas, which could then be used as fuel.

Garbage would not be allowed to accumulate, and every three hours it was cleared from this market,” says Shrigopal Jagtap, head, solid waste management and sanitation, Basix Municipal Waste Ventures.

Spot fine

A strict enforcement system made it clear to the shop keepers that they either toed the line or paid a hefty fine. Enforcement teams would descend on the markets with loud speakers, and through street theatre and other art forms remind shopkeepers that they have to segregate waste and keep their premises clean.

“In the first year, we did not fine shops as our focus was on creating awareness, establishing certain systems and also work based on the feedback we received. We would often remind them that if their market was clean then more people would shop there, and this approach helping bring about a change in people’s mindset,” says Jagtap.

From the second year, he says, a fine starting from ₹ 250 onwards was levied.

Repeat offenders were not allowed to run their businesses. Enforcement in the form of fines played a big role as it was also publicised by the media.

In all of these things, those who were working on the ground faced many challenges. Setting up composting units at a few markets was a challenge as space was a constraint.

Vendors would often blame shoppers for not throwing the waste in the bins. “We had trained volunteers who would watch customer behaviour at markets and advise them to be more responsible,” says Sunpreet, adding that continual monitoring helped.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/teewp2/article30950157.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01dcglocaljpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/lessons-for-chennai-from-indores-vegetable-markets/article30950161.ece

It is more than three months since the Greater Chennai Corporation began widening of stormwater drain (SWD) near South Usman Road flyover (towards Kodabakkam) in T. Nagar. The work is progressing at a slow pace and residents say that they have been enduring the chaos on the stretch for quite sometime. Flash lights, signboards and reflectors meant to caution the passers-by are not in place.

“Motorists find it risky to negotiating on the road as it is narrow. Safety measures should be taken to prevent passers-by from falling into the trench,” says S. Naresh, a resident of T. Nagar. Pedestrians also have a tough time. They have to walk on the carriageway as the entire footpath and a portion of the road has been taken up for the SWD work.

347,2020/02/29,Separate lane created to ease congestion at Porur toll plaza,"“Intersection of Samayapuram Main Road and Chennai Bypass Road should be made safer”

There is now a strong reason to expect traffic congestion at Porur toll plaza on Chennai Bypass Road to ease — the State Highways Department has created a separate lane, a few hundred metres ahead of the toll plaza, for motorists from Maduravoyal to reach Porur junction via Samayapuram Main Road.

Earlier, on Chennai Bypass Road, motorists coming from Maduravoyal would take a left turn at the intersection of Samayapuram Main Road and Chennai Bypass Road, and in the process block the movement of other motorists heading towards the toll plaza, located around 100 metres from the intersection.

Insufficient illumination around the intersection and the toll plaza, thanks to less-than-efficient street lights, would make accidents a frequent occurrence on this section. Motorists would come from all directions and commuters, including those boarding mofussil buses at the toll plaza, would cross Chennai Bypass Road at the intersection.

Traffic police personnel stationed at the toll plaza found it very difficult to regulate traffic at the intersection. As a result, a separate lane from the Chennai Bypass Road was created a few weeks ago to let motorists who have to go to Porur junction below the toll plaza, to proceed without clogging up this section.

“Separate entry (lane) to Samayapuram Main Road from Chennai Bypass Road is convienent and safe for motorists, especially motorcyclists, in reaching the Porur junction. Additional safety measures like deployment of more traffic police personnel, at least during the evening rush hour, will be more helpful,” says K. Raman, a motorist from Porur.

Motorists say that at present, many goods-carrying vans are parked near the newly-established entry-lane on the service lane of Chennai Bypass Road blocking easy movement of vehicles from the stretch to Samayapuram Main Road.

Further, traffic violations, including wrong-way driving, on Samayapuram Main Road puts other road users at risk for accidents, especially those coming from Chennai Bypass Road.

These traffic problems should be addressed to ensure the safety of motorists and pedestrians on Chennai Bypass Road and the Samayapuram Main Road, as they are on their way to Porur and adjoining areas.

Unlike in Maduravoyal where the flyover on Chennai Bypass Road helps motorists reach the stretch below the Bypass through a series of ramps, there are no ramps at Porur.

Instead, Samayapuram Main Road serves as a connecting link between Chennai Bypass Road and Mount-Poonamalle Main Road, which is elow the Bypass at Porur.

“Steps will be taken to prevent such parking of vehicles on the service lane of the Chennai Bypass Road soon,” says a State Highways official.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/jxoki0/article30950130.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01dctngrPorurTollPlazaJPG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/separate-lane-created-to-ease-congestion-at-porur-toll-plaza/article30950131.ece
348,2020/02/29,Footpath on Arunachalam Road fenced,"It goes against the interests of pedestrians, say residents

The Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) has fenced a 100-metre stretch of the footpath along Arunachalam Road in Saligramam.

It is remarkable that the Office of the Assistant Engineer of Zone 10 is located nearby, and according to the GCC sources, the officials resorted to this measure, as regular seizure of vehicles parked on the footpath had gone little towards checking the menace.

It is said that most of these vehicles belong to studios found in that locality.

The fenced portion of the footpath is now being maintained well by conservancy workers, who sweep it twice every day.

However, residents are quick to point out that fencing the footpath is not an ideal measure to check unauthorised parking.

With pedestrians now being prevented from using the footpath, this is a clear case of “cutting of the nose to spite the face”.

Moreover, except for its fenced section, the footpath is still taken over by illegally-parked vehicles.

Arunachalam Road witnesses heavy traffic movement as it connects to Arcot Road.

349,2020/02/29,Riding high: Tamil Nadu’s police’s first equestrian team wins medals at All-India meet,"The team, led by deputy commissioner Shekhar Deshmukh, also has a woman police constable as one of its members

Wearing breeches, a spotless white shirt and a riding helmet, police constable P. Suganya shifts slightly on her saddle. Taking the cue, her eight-year-old horse, Grand Celebrations, begins trotting. This is part of her daily practice routine at the premises of the Chennai police Mounted Branch in Pudupet, during which she and the animal perform various moves.

Ms. Suganya is the lone woman member of the first equestrian team of the Tamil Nadu police, formed a year ago. The eight- member team also includes police personnel -- constables Venkatesan, R. Manikandan, S. Mageswaran, S. Velu, R. Sultan Jalaludeen and G. Thathappa Bhaskar -- and is headed by Shekhar Deshmukh, deputy commissioner of police.

The team took part in the 38th All India Police Equestrian Championship and Mounted Police Duty Meet held in Haryana in February for the first time, and won three medals. While Mr. Deshmukh won gold, Suganya bagged silver and the team got a bronze medal.

“I joined the Mounted Branch directly 10 years ago. Earlier, our exposure was only to beach patrolling during which we have nabbed some criminals. But equestrian training is completely different. We have never done jumps earlier, but now we are practising them. The handling of the horse itself is different,” explains Ms. Suganya, who says the team considers the horses their good friends.

Every morning the team feeds the horses and practises for close to an hour. “The police meet was intimidating and this is the first time the Tamil Nadu police is participating in such an event. But I am sure from next year we will fetch more medals,” she says.

The team was created by Mr. Shekhar Deshmukh when he came to Chennai as aide-de-camp to the Governor. “I started riding during my police academy days. When I came here, I went and requested city police commissioner A.K. Viswanathan if I could started a equestrian team here as the Mounted Branch has been in operation in the city since the British period. He immediately agreed,” he says.

Mr. Deshmukh then selected the best of riders from the Mounted Branch and started training them. “Initially we trained ourselves, and then we started getting trainers from the Indo-Tibetan Border Police and the National Police Academy. We also started taking part in championships within the State,” he adds.

Mr. Deshmukh explains that Ms. Suganya was the only woman to take part in the one-day eventing category (comprising events such as dressage, show jumping and cross country) in the All India Police Equestrian Championship.

“Our team was appreciated as we put up a good show despite competing for the first time.

351,2020/02/29,Chennai Metro takes steps to smoothen inter-modal connectivity at Egmore,"A fence is soon to be removed in order to enable commuters to walk from the Egmore Metro Rail Station to the suburban rail platform

Chennai Metro plans to soon remove the fencing between Egmore Metro Rail station and the suburban platform so that commuters can quickly walk across in order to change their mode of transport and travel.

According to officials of Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL), at present, if people exit the station premises they then have to cross the parking lot, climb the foot over-bridge and then get to the suburban platform of Egmore Railway station. “If we remove the iron fencing, they can reach the suburban platform immediately. We didn’t earlier foresee that commuters would have to take a circuitous route to reach that platform. The idea of providing inter-modal connectivity is that commuters should never feel the strain of switching from one mode of transport to another. In the coming weeks, we will remove the fencing and put up signage as well,” an official said.

Now, Chennai Metro Rail has also connected the concourse level of Egmore Metro Rail station to the foot over-bridge that will take commuters to the suburban platform of Egmore Railway station. There is a pathway from the concourse level that will lead commuters to the lift and it will take them to the foot over-bridge, officials said. They have installed signage at various places to guide passengers as well.

Egmore Metro Rail station is an important station, as thousands of passengers head to the railway station to take outbound trains from Chennai. Sources said, there should also be signage at the Egmore Railway station at important locations, telling passengers the way to the Egmore Metro Rail station and they should put up Metro Rail timings as well.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/pdc4it/article30949466.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29FEBTH--EGMORE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/chennai-metro-takes-steps-to-smoothen-inter-modal-connectivity-at-egmore/article30949467.ece

An eight-month-old baby girl, Rajeshwari, who was kidnapped from Besant Nagar on Thursday night, was rescued by police in K. K. Nagar on Saturday afternoon.

“We viewed CCTV footage from the area and we found that three women and a man took the child and walked for some distance after the abduction, and then took an autorickshaw. After travelling for some distance, they got down and took another autorickshaw. We tracked down the vehicle,” a police officer said.

The police team finally found that the gang had given the child to a woman in K.K. Nagar. “We have rescued the child and have sent her to the hospital for a check-up. We will nab the gang soon,” said P Pagalavan, Deputy Commissioner of Police, Adyar

On Friday, Shastri Nagar police had started a search for the kidnappers and the baby, following a complaint from the baby’s mother.

Police said Rajeshwari was the daughter Basha (25) and Sneha (22), a couple residing in Swamimalai, Kumbakonam, and belonging to the gypsy community. Recently the couple had quarrelled and in a fit of anger, Sneha had walked out of the house and had come to Chennai.

On Thursday night Sneha came to the Velankanni church in Besant Nagar, and in the night she and her daughter slept near the on the pavement on the Besant Nagar promenade. When she woke up on Friday morning, the child was missing. After searching everywhere, she had lodged a complaint with the Shastri Nagar police station.

Chennai Metrowater has assured residents of Sulerikattukuppam village, along the East Coast Road, that they would be provided with facilities to improve their livelihood.

At a stakeholders’ meeting on Thursday for the construction of a desalination plant, with a capacity to treat 150 million litres a day of seawater in Nemmeli, residents raised concerns about their livelihoods being affected by the project.

About 250 residents of Sulerikattukuppam, a fishing village located about a kilometre away from the Nemmeli plant, presented petitions regarding livelihood issues, including condition of roads, water supply and compensation during fishing ban season.

Metrowater’s executive director T. Prabhushankar assured them that basic amenities would be provided in the village to enhance their livelihood.

Monthly compensation

According to a press release, seawater will be treated, and 24-hour drinking water supply will be provided through an overhead tank. Artificial reefs will be created near Kovalam to enhance fish production and provide livelihood support to fishermen.

Moreover, steps will be taken to give a monthly compensation of ₹5,000 during the fishing ban.

Besides enhancing the quality of schools in the village, Metrowater will take steps to provide scholarships to students. Measures will be taken to provide pattas to all houses in the villages, he said.

Mr. Prabhushankar said that youngsters would be given jobs during the construction phase and the operation of the upcoming plant.

355,2020/02/29,MTC seeks higher compensation for land,"The Metropolitan Transport Corporation on Friday expressed its reservations over accepting a compensation of ₹11,055 a sq. ft., fixed by the Commissioner of Land Administration, for transferring the ownership of 0.57 acres of its land, situated adjacent to the Madras High Court campus, for the use of the court administration.

When a related case was heard by a full Bench of Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi, Justice C.V. Karthikeyan and Justice Subramonium Prasad, the counsel for the corporation, Rita Chandrasekaran, told the court that ₹11,055 a sq. ft. had been fixed as per the guideline value of the property and that it was too low an amount.

She said that the government should come forward to pay the corporation at least ₹15,000 a sq. ft.

Advocate General Vijay Narayan suggested that the transport corporation could be ordered to transfer ownership of the land on payment of the compensation being offered now and without prejudice to its right to claim more compensation.

Accepting the suggestion, the judges directed the corporation to put in writing the amount that it expected for giving away the land. In the meantime, they ordered that steps required for transferring the land to the High Court administration should be taken, since the corporation had already expressed its willingness to give away the land, subject to payment of compensation.

When the transfer fructifies, the Madras High Court would have got a full complement of 1.83 acres, of which 1.25 acres were already acquired by the High Court in 2003, situated next to the Tamil Nadu State Legal Services Authority building.

The 2003 land acquisition was primarily done for the purpose of constructing a building for the exclusive use of law officers from Puducherry. However, since the Puducherry government had not allotted funds for the construction, the land remained unused till date. In the meantime, the court had desired to acquire the rest of the 0.57 acres too from MTC.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/mtc-seeks-higher-compensation-for-land/article30946738.ece

357,2020/02/29,‘NPR in current form an assault on federalism’,"If the Centre presses ahead with the exercise, a confrontation between some States and the Centre is likely, says N. Ram

If the Centre presses ahead with the implementation of the National Population Register (NPR) exercise in its current form, a confrontation between the States and the Centre is likely and it will involve an assault on federalism itself, N. Ram, chairman, THG Publishing Pvt Ltd, said.

“If they go ahead with NPR, as contemplated and notified, if they press ahead with this, there will be a confrontation between several States and the Centre. It will involve an assault on federalism itself, because the Centre is not the supreme authority. It has a certain preferential place in the Constitution, but the understanding is that the States are sovereign in their realm,” he said.

“Federalism or quasi-federalism will also be under threat if the Centre decides to pursue the matter aggressively. They have not thought this through and did not expect this kind of a mass upsurge for such a long duration,” Mr. Ram said.

Speaking at a discussion on ‘Protecting Constitutional Rights, Challenges and Responses’, organised by The Constitution Protection Forum, Mr. Ram said that NPR was the first step of a process for the construction of the National Register of Citizens (NRC). He exhorted actor Rajinikanth and others “to inform themselves better more deeply by studying this matter”.

“NPR-NRC cannot be separated. They are joined at the hip,” he said. NRC in Assam was a dismal failure, a calamitous exercise and it had always been on the BJP’s agenda since 1989, he said.

“This is a demand that has come only from the BJP. They announced it in their manifestos in 1989, 1991, 1998, 1999, 2004. In 2014, they were very careful and only said that they would address the issues of infiltration, illegal immigration in the northeast, eastern States. In the last elections, they said they were committed to the enactment of the CAA and would actively consider extension of the NRC to other States,” Mr. Ram said.

Referring to Mr. Rajinikanth’s statement on the NRC and the Prime Minister saying that the NRC has not been discussed since 2014, Mr. Ram said it was not true. “The Home Ministry report also says that and the President’s address made it very clear that they are planning to do a countrywide NRC,” he added.

Senior advocate R. Vaigai said the situations unfolding in the country was a kind of unofficial emergency. “Though there is no formal proclamation of emergency today, the governments behave in a manner as if we do not enjoy our fundamental rights anymore. A lot of unofficial actions are happening,” she said.

She said that anything said against the government’s policies, and the ruling party’s policies constituted sedition and such actions were being taken in order to send a chilling effect and to muzzle dissent by the people who have their independent opinions about what the government was doing.

Ms. Vaigai said that everyone needed to remember their rights and needed to remind those in power and in the government that “we are not their subjects, that we have given them the power to govern for a particular period of time according to the Constitution.”

359,2020/02/29,‘Health must not take a back seat during exams’,"Students can be a little anxious, not stressed: expert

The board examinations are here. At a time when academics gain top priority, food and sleep should not take the back seat. Healthy eating and adequate sleep are must to sail through the board exams, say doctors and nutritionists.

Exam time could be strenuous for many, but it is important to be stress-free. If a student or parent needs help, the State Health Department’s round-the-clock helpline — 104 — can be contacted. Counsellors will help with information on how to prepare for exams, manage fear and anxiety, and parental support, officials said.

“Students should realise that examinations are only a step in one’s life and not the entire life. You can be a little anxious but do not be stressed. Do not start thinking about results as the performance will come down. Stay calm and revise what you have studied,” said Lakshmi Vijayakumar, psychiatrist and founder of Sneha. Ensure sleep for six to seven hours, and do not try to study anything new at the last moment.

Parents, she said, should understand that children are already anxious. “Do not add your expectations on them, do not increase the level of anxiety,” she added.

Eating healthy is crucial. “The brain needs fuel. So, never skip breakfast or go to the exam hall in an empty stomach. You can keep it simple with banana, a glass of milk and nuts, or eat idli with sambar. Chapati roll or multigrain sandwich are other choices,” said Meenakshi Bajaj, dietician, Tamil Nadu Government Multi Super Speciality Hospital.

With viral infectious causing fever, cold and cough this season, she said that students could choose anti-oxidants and immunonutrients, food rich in vitamins, omega 3 fatty acids and zinc to build immunity during exams.

Eating out is also a complete no during exams, and avoiding non-vegetarian food, except eggs at home, is advisable as if not cooked thoroughly they pose a risk of infections. “There is a risk of developing typhoid or acute gastroenteritis,” she said. Choose fruits and vegetables, and nuts and stay well-hydrated, she noted.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/s165cy/article30946691.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH29Citycol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/health-must-not-take-a-back-seat-during-exams/article30946692.ece
360,2020/02/29,Tamil Nadu rolls out system to prevent use of fake documents in land deals,"Pre-mutation scrutiny of land records to be introduced on pilot basis

To prevent registration of landed property with fake documents and to reduce the burden on land buyers, the Tamil Nadu government has introduced the pre-mutation scrutiny of land records before registration of landed properties which do not have “online pattas”.

The pre-mutation scrutiny of land records would be introduced on a pilot basis in two taluks each in Krishnagiri district (Hosur and Soolagiri taluks) and Perambalur districts (Perambalur and Alathur taluks). However, a Government Order issued in this regard clarified: “Pre-mutation of land records may be made optional for those who have already obtained online pattas.”

“Earlier, the system was complex and the onus was on the land/apartment buyer to do the procedure, now it is for the seller to do this procedure. There were some cases where OSR area was illegally sold to buyers. Now, that can’t happen,” a senior official said.

Once the new system is implemented, a large piece of land divided into 20 sites with an intention of being sold, the specifics of each piece of land would have to be sketched, so that every buyer knows exactly what he was buying, he said.

As per the new system, before registering land, landowners in rural areas who have not obtained online pattas, must apply online for obtaining pre-mutation sketch for their proposed sale of land or transaction. After a payment of fee for pre-mutation sketch — ₹1,000 for an acre in rural areas and up to 2,400 sq. ft. in urban areas — the applications will be processed and sketch handed over within 30 days.

The surveyors will conduct field inspection, verify the records, prepare pre-mutation sketch and forward them to the Land Records Draftsman, which will be sent to Deputy Inspector of Survey for verification next.

Once the tahsildar approves the pre-mutation sketch with his/her digital signature, the sketch will be made available to applicants and the sub-registrar office concerned through e-service.

“After getting pre-mutation sketch, the applicant can register the sale of land, based on the particulars of land recorded in the pre-mutation records,” the G.O. said. The sketch can be obtained within 10 days under “priority category”, for a fee of ₹2,000 and could be obtained within 10 days.

362,2020/02/29,Tamil Nadu government notifies draft rules for land pooling scheme,"Objective is to make acquisition process easy

More than one-and-a-half years after enacting a law on land pooling area development scheme, the State government has notified draft rules. People can submit objections or suggestions within four weeks through egovdtcp@tn.gov.in to the Directorate of Town and Country Planning (DTCP) and the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA). The draft rules are available on the websites of the DTCP (https://www.tn.gov.in/tcp/) and the CMDA (http://www.cmdachennai. gov.in/index.html).

Although the assent of Governor Banwarilal Purohit was obtained in July, 2018 for the amendment to the Town and Country Planning Act, the government had not announced the date of implementation. The plan is to notify the amendment and the rules simultaneously, an official of the DTCP said. The concept of land pooling was formulated keeping in mind problems in land acquisition. In Gujarat, making use of the idea, a highway was built.

Land pooling can be done either for a housing project or an industrial project. Creation of public amenities like roads, water supply and bus stands is an important objective of the concept. Planning authorities such as the DTCP or the CMDA will implement the schemes and on completion, the facilities will be handed over to local bodies concerned.

On average, the size of each parcel of land so pooled will be in the range of 100 to 400 acres. As much as 40% of land developed will be returned to owners, a feature not available in other States where it is being implemented. The official said, unlike in Tamil Nadu, others have not prescribed a quantum of developed land to be given back to owners.

15% of the remaining portion will be sold through auction after earmarking a certain part for roads, parks, playgrounds, garden, open space reservation and housing for economically weaker sections.

Each scheme will have to get the approval of the State government. Ordinarily, the process of approval should not exceed two years.

Those who do not want the land returned have the option of transfer of development rights by which they can have higher floor space index in places of their choice, the official said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/tamil-nadu-government-notifies-draft-rules-for-land-pooling-scheme/article30946669.ece

366,2020/02/29,Picnic spot to come up along Buckingham Canal,"Two-km strip of land near Tidel Park to be landscaped

Work on developing a picnic spot along the Buckingham Canal, near the Tidel Park, will begin next month.

The picnic spot, to be developed on a 2-km strip of land measuring around 25 acres, is expected to get modern play equipment and landscaped space for cultural events, attracting a children.

The project was announced by the government last year. A meeting of civic officials was held on Friday after preparation of the detailed project report.

“The picnic spot will have a food area. People will be permitted to bring their own food. Shops will not be permitted in the area,” said an official.

The eastern side of the canal will get a dense forest of indigenous trees, said the official. Work is expected to be completed in a year. “The picnic spot will have various features for the safety of children. Brainstorming sessions with engineers have been held to ensure that the space is safe for children and senior citizens,” said the official.

The space will have features that differentiate it from the pedestrian plaza in T. Nagar. “The space will celebrate biodiversity. Its landscaping will be unique, restoring the canal to its original condition,” he said.

Canal clean-up

Currently, the space for cultural events on the pedestrian plaza in T. Nagar has not been used for events, owing to congestion in the area. This area is expected to host more events relating to culture, attracting tourists.

All sewage outfalls on the stretch of the canal will be plugged shortly. Engineers are exploring options to prevent pollution of the canal before resettling residents along it. “Water in the canal should be clean after the launch of the project.

367,2020/02/29,"Scripting an audacity of hope, the Sanders way","The rise of the Vermont Senator as a frontrunner has upended many myths, and opened up several possibilities

The emergence of Bernie Sanders as the frontrunner in the Democratic Party primaries has stunned the world. But it shouldn’t have. The U.S. is merely joining in the wave of electoral insurrections that are upending the political order across the world. Underneath it are two fundamental drivers. First, the phenomenal growth in inequality, both of income and wealth. After a period of four decades, from the 1930s through the 1970s, in which the gap between the rich and poor actually narrowed, economic inequality today is back to the levels not seen for 100 years.

But it isn’t just that the rich have got richer. It is also that the standard of working class living has actually declined in many ways. Wages have stagnated for 40 years, and to maintain their income, families have had to work longer and longer hours. As a result, health indicators among the poor have declined as overwork, exhaustion, and anxiety have become epidemic. Several recent studies report not only dramatic increases in psychological stress among Americans, but also that its main cause is job insecurity and overwork — economic factors. All this while the U.S. is the only industrial country without a national healthcare plan. Hence, the physical and psychological breakdown goes untreated — and we have the hitherto unimaginable fact that life expectancy among adult males has actually decreased in recent years, for the first time in over a century — and that too, among white males, the section of the population pilloried by the left as “privileged”. In the richest country in the world, the lifespan of working-class men is now getting shorter.

Also Read Sanders roughed up, hits back in feisty Democratic debate

This collapse in living standards has been overseen by both political parties in the U.S.’s two-party system. This is the second driver. The Democratic Party was once seen as the party of the working class. And while this description was always a bit of an exaggeration, the unions and advocacy groups representing working Americans did have some influence within it. Because of that, the Democratic Party was behind the two waves of expansion of the welfare state — first the New Deal under Franklin D. Roosevelt, and then Lyndon B. Johnson’s Great Society programmes in the late 1960s. But, by the 1980s, this connection was severed. Under Bill Clinton, the Democrats became Republican-lite — committed to the same neoliberal economic principles. As Gore Vidal brilliantly described it: “There is only one Party in the United States, the Property Party... and it has two right wings: Republican and Democrat.”

Rebellion against the elites

What is unfolding now is something akin to a rebellion against this order, with Mr. Sanders at its helm. The Vermont Senator has never been a Democrat. He has always run as an Independent, eschewing any connection with either Party. But once he decided to run for President, he knew that it would be suicide to try it outside the Democratic Party. This was Ralph Nader’s great error in 2000, because in a winner-takes-all system, small third-party campaigns are inevitably viewed as spoilers. They not only lose, but end up draining votes from their closest ideological competitor — in this case, it would be the Democrats. Mr. Nader lost, and then was vilified for supposedly draining votes away from Mr. Gore. So, Mr. Sanders registered in the Party and ran under its umbrella, first in 2016 and then again in this cycle.

But make no mistake, Mr. Sanders is also running against the Democratic Party. And the Party’s leadership understands that, which is why it is trying its best to defeat him. The last time anyone ran on a platform as progressive as Mr. Sanders’s was in 1984, when Jesse Jackson took on the emerging right wing in the Party with his ‘Rainbow Coalition’. Mr. Jackson’s campaign was in many ways very similar to Mr. Sanders’s. It proposed national healthcare, a raise in the minimum wage, extending the social safety net and also a shift in foreign policy. Nobody expected it to succeed, and yet he made a serious run for the Party nomination — so much so, that a panicked Party had to take desperate measures to prevent its success, including shutting down polling booths in many cities where Mr. Jackson was gaining momentum. But Mr. Sanders’s campaign is more radical, if only because the forces it is taking on are so much more entrenched after 40 years of neoliberal turn. Mr. Jackson ran when unions and civic organisations still had some weight inside the Party, and he could garner some support from them. Mr. Sanders stands virtually alone, having only the forces he built up, or has helped build up since 2016, as his support base.

Also Read Trump should promote environment not arms sales in India, says Sanders

Mr. Sanders’s success has upended several myths about the American electorate, which the two parties have used to justify their neoliberal policies. The first is that the reason America does not have a robust welfare state is that the public is uniquely suspicious of “big government”. In other words, when politicians refuse to even consider social insurance policies, they are merely reflecting American values. But in fact, public opinion polls have shown for decades that, when the question is posed appropriately, Americans have expressed the same desire for social insurance as publics everywhere else. It is not that they are suspicious of big government, but that they have given up hoping that the state will ever do anything for them. Mr. Sanders is the first political figure in almost two generations to break through the embargo, and it has caught fire.

The second myth is that the only way to win is by veering toward the ‘centre’, which makes a Sanders platform suicidal because centrist voters are hostile to the policies it espouses. This has been the most common justification for eschewing progressive policies for decades, and it is a variant of the first myth. Once again, politicians are supposedly just following what the public wants. But what is not mentioned is that only about half of the American electorate participates in presidential elections — and it is the wealthier half. Poorer voters have given up on the system precisely because the system is not only indifferent, but hostile to them. They choose not to vote. So the ‘centre’ of the voting population is much to the left of the part that typically votes. It is to this section, shunted aside and ignored, to which Mr. Sanders is making his appeals, and it is working.

Welfare of minorities

The final myth is that Mr. Sanders is proposing “white” policies that ignore issues of race and ethnicity. This is the most toxic of the shibboleths. It supposes that economic issues — of wages, healthcare, education, etc. — do not attract black and brown voters. And yet, Mr. Sanders has built up the biggest following of all the candidates among non-white voters. He is the most trusted and most loved by minorities of any politician in America. In Nevada, Mr. Sanders garnered a staggering 70% of the Latino vote and was a close second to Joe Biden among the Blacks. The reason is obvious — because minorities are the most economically desperate section of the American population. They are the natural constituency for a campaign centering on economic justice.

Mr. Sanders is succeeding because he is attracting voters who are either ignored or actively discouraged from voting by his Party. And with every victory, his campaign is gaining exponentially in strength. After five decades of neglect and abuse, working-class Americans had given up on the system. Their cynicism and sense of hopelessness was not only accepted by the two Parties, but encouraged by them. Up to this past weekend, the message on the airwaves was, “he cannot win”. The idea is for every household to feel that even if they feel attracted to his programme, they are alone in their sentiments — that that the mythical ‘centre’, will reject him.

But with every win, every success, the brute facts have become impossible to ignore. Iowa showed that he had a real base; New Hampshire confirmed that it was not a fluke; Nevada has shown that he is not only able to attract minority voters, but that he is by far the most popular candidate among them. Mr. Sanders got more votes in Nevada than the next three candidates combined. The Party is in full-blown panic and, over the next months, will do everything it can to stop him.

But its power is limited. The fact is that the American Parties have very little control over who can and cannot run on their tickets. Anyone is free to enter a primary, and if they can attract enough votes, it is very hard to stop them. And the Party leadership’s helplessness is becoming palpable. The last weapon they had was their fear mongering, and now that too has become ineffective.

368,2020/02/29,"Letters to the Editor — February 29, 2020","Following ‘raj dharma’

The Congress delegation’s petition to the President seeking the sacking of Home Minister Amit Shah for his allegedly inept handling of the Delhi riots is a futile exercise (“Congress urges President to remove Amit Shah,” Feb. 28). The virtual ‘No. 2’ in the Cabinet, Mr. Shah has already received a pat on the back from his party. The BJP, being a party with a difference, has never believed in taking any kind of action against any of its members, irrespective of their position, and this has been the trend ever since it came to power at the Centre in 2014. When acts of commission indulged in by its motor-mouths hardly earns them even a mild rebuke, one can well imagine how acts of omission are likely to be dealt with. The President can hardly be expected to advise the government to follow raj dharma either, as the limitations of his office might come in the way of his proffering any kind of advice to the government, especially one that enjoys a brute majority. Every time the Opposition parties point a finger at the NDA government, holding it responsible for not reining in the rioters, the standard response of the BJP is to remind the Congress of the riots in 1984, unmindful of the fact that two wrongs can never make a right.

It is high time the government introspects on its inefficiency in curbing violence and avoiding loss of lives. The Delhi violence was preceded by hate and provocative speeches of certain leaders. Either those leaders should have been detained or the police should have been alerted appropriately to deal with those who have indulged in clashes. The general public sees a similarity between the Delhi clashes and the riots that erupted after Indira Gandhi’s assassination as well as the Gujarat riots. The transfer Justice S. Muralidhar, who was hearing the petition related to this case, further adds to doubts on the administration’s intentions. It is also time for the government to clear the doubts on the CAA and the NRC through categorical declarations, instead of attempting to quell the protests.

Who is to blame?

The rioters and the instigators of rioting alike are to blame for the orgy of communal violence in Delhi. The former actualised the calls of the latter for murdering the ‘traitors’. The riots followed the hate speeches that inflamed religious tensions. The human cost of the riots underlines their futility. It is inhuman, sinful and ungodly to kill innocents in defence of religion. By shielding and indulging hate-mongers and refusing to act against them, the BJP is normalising religious violence.

Muslim families sheltered and protected by Hindu families and protection of temples in Muslim-dominated areas temples are indeed positive news; these acts can inspire rapprochement between the two communities, but they cannot diminish or downplay the horrors of insane communal violence. Delhi police brought ignominy on itself by its acts of commission and omission to please its political masters. It failed even to provide safe passage to ambulances to carry the wounded to hospitals in some riot-hit areas despite repeated pleas.

How did this state of events come to a pass? The answer lies in the rise of Hindu extremism. The secular ideal, an important legacy bequeathed by the freedom movement and a basic feature of the Constitution, is at risk from Hindu revivalists. The scourge of communalism saps India’s energy and will and puts a spoke in our wheel for nation-building. Communal peace is of utmost importance in our country; it is a precondition for nearly 1.3 billion people to realise their full potential.

The immediate concern must be to ease tension and bring normalcy in Delhi. In the long term, the reversal of the resurgence of virulent religious nationalism and an end to demonisation and persecution of Muslims must happen if we are to prevent the country’s descent into dark days.

Transfer of a Justice

The sudden transfer of the judge who was handling the very sensitive and important case of ongoing Delhi riots in unearthly hours is unfair and untimely. The government’s statement that it was a routine exercise will have few takers. He had not kept his anger secret against the ineptitude of Delhi police in containing the situation from becoming worse and earned the wrath of the authorities. The idea that a Central government should play a non-partisan role in such a situation has taken a beating with this sudden transfer. If Delhi police can wait for some weeks of time to register FIRs against those who made incendiary speeches, why could the government not have waited for some time to effect the transfer and allow the judicial process uninterrupted?

Dr. D.V.G. Sankararao,

Vizianagaram, Andhra Pradesh

This refers to the report, “War of words over HC judge’s transfer” (Feb. 28). Even if the government’s argument that the transfer was routine, approved by the President earlier this month, is taken at face value routine, effecting the Justice’s transfer using a late-night Centre’s notification is completely unacceptable because Justice S. Muralidhar was in the midst of a hearing and there was no urgency that required that he should be relieved of his duties in Delhi High Court. This reinforces the suspicion that the judge’s sharp condemnation of both the government and the police for failure to contain the riots and his assertion that police should fire within a day FIRs against the four BJP leaders who have given hate speeches, hastened his transfer on the same day. The timing of the decision does raise apprehensions of bias; amounting to “obstruction of justice”. The purpose seems to be to bypass the orders passed by him in the riots case.

Peaceful assertions

The women of Shaheen Bagh have not only thwarted insidious attempts to malign and rubbish their protests, but asserted their independence of thought and action by not yielding to the wishes of Maulvis and Imams to end their protest. If only the government gives them a firm commitment that the National Register of Citizens would not be implemented, they may be persuaded to give up their protests and leave the issue of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act to be decided by the Supreme court. Whichever way the curtain finally comes down on the protests, they will for long be remembered as a renaissance movement of Muslim women who came out on the streets, showed physical endurance, grit and determination to stand up for their rights (Editorial page, “Hope, belief and the candles of Shaheen Bagh,” Feb. 28).

No protests for better services

The anti-government stand that has exemplified the mass opposition to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) across the country in the course of the last few days indicates that when it comes to their rights, people of this great republic do not shy away from exhibiting their resentment in public. People are congregating in large numbers and expressing their anguish over the insensitive ways of a government that came to power riding on their hopes and aspirations, and with assurances of better days ahead for the country. That there are reports of massive demonstrations in many parts of the country, are proof enough of the fact that pieces of legislation that affect the people’s rights and privileges will be fought tooth and nail by the masses, even if it means coming out in large numbers onto the streets to press their demands. Hence, it comes as a big surprise that when it comes to utility services and other civic amenities, the public is conspicuous by its ‘mute’ protests against the failing standards which have become a matter of serious concern! The miserable condition of roads, frequent power outages, restricted water supply, shortage of cooking gas, faulty telephones, unstable Internet connections and a host of other services which should otherwise have been faultlessly provided to the aam janata as a matter of their rights elicits no adverse response from the public. Other than generating gossip material, the deteriorating services have hardly bothered the members of the public.

A virus’s spread

The spread of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in South Korea through a mass gathering of a cult group, whose members do not disclose their affiliation, should be considered as a special case in specific circumstances (Editorial, “Virus marches on”, Feb. 28). The tragic consequences of this cult gathering cannot be generalised to apply as a principle to find fault with the shutting down of Wuhan and other cities in China. Though the initial secrecy had cost China dearly, the expeditious actions taken by it subsequently have helped the country to contain the virus to a large extent. The rapid spread of the dreaded virus outside China in countries such as Iran, Italy, etc. in the last one week is probably due to the lax screening and isolation methods followed by these countries. India, especially Kerala, has followed the systems of screening, isolation, tracing and follow up rigorously and prevented the spread of the virus. The countries where the virus is spreading fast should strictly follow the guidelines issued by the World Health Organization (WHO) at least now, to prevent further spread of virus and possible death toll. It is a blessing that the SARS-CoV-2, unlike some of the earlier viruses, does not cause widespread deaths, but spreads surreptitiously by lying dormant in a person without even showing any outward symptoms. As such, the world should be extra cautious in dealing with the latest dread.

Human application of Aadhaar

The author seeks to extrapolate Aadhaar’s inadequacy to plug leakages in Jharkhand Public Distribution System as a sweeping indictment of the technological platform’s total failure. Statistical robustness demands the replication of the study in at least half of the States before the conclusions can be confirmed. True, technological glitches have caused a denial of welfare to needy citizens. Such instances are caused by a mindless application of rules. Technology should be viewed and utilised as a tool that should adapt to human needs and standards, instead of asking the beneficiaries of social welfare to pay the price for its failures and arbitrary rules. The officials should be allowed a margin of discretion to apply a dose of humaneness when technologies fail to deliver the objectives. To discredit Aadhaar is to overlook its effectiveness in plugging leakages in fuel subsidy and eliminating duplicate income tax Permanent Account Numbers (PANs).

Depleting forest cover

Forests are one of the most dependable and economical natural sinks for anthropogenic carbon emissions. With the increasing global warming induced by accumulating carbon emissions, the need to protect forests cannot be overemphasised. Given the vast coastlines and huge population, India’s vulnerability to climate change-induced catastrophes are well known. Being the world’s third-largest emitter of carbon-dioxide, India cannot shy away from the responsibility of fighting climate change by protecting forests. In this context, it is distressing to know we are losing forest cover in the Eastern Ghats to an extent (Editorial, “A browning east,” Feb. 28). With the possibility of climate change acting as a stress multiplier to flora and fauna in the forests are looming large, this is the right time to take positive and proactive measures.

It is disheartening to note that many unemployed engineers are queuing up to accept the least-paid job of parking attendant in the Chennai city (“Unemployed engineers queue up for parking attendant jobs”, Feb. 28), thanks to the institutions of higher learning churning out more engineers than actual demands of the industries and corporates, resulting in many taking up non-technical job for a pittance or remain unsaleable in the job market. The downhill trend in engineering is owing to the mushroom-like growth of engineering colleges with their glamorous and luring advertisements, less-sought after courses, misconstrued notion that engineering and medicine are the only lucrative careers, age-old curricula which encourage rote-learning method, leave alone the absence of quality-cum-qualified faculty on roll. Come what may, if this dismal trend continues, engineering graduates would be ready to take up posts of peon, assistant or any job in the unorganised sector that would make the society mock their academic credentials.

Humour in Parliament

Considering that parliamentary proceedings these days are interspersed with disruptions and disturbances, it is heartening to read that 50 years ago, Rajya Sabha was witness to lighter and humorous moments, with members involving themselves in questions like, “which part of life is the most romantic?”.

369,2020/02/29,'Forensic' movie review: Tovino Thomas' film lacks subtlety and finesse,"The only thing that keeps our interest even mildly alive, is the way the forensic expert works out some of the clues leading to the killer

Some opening sequences provide one a pretty accurate picture of the tone and tenor of the whole movie. Forensic opens with a rather loud, in-your-face sequence that could have become a chapter titled 'Childhood of a serial killer'.

A young boy is at a chicken shop, peering intently at the flesh being cut into pieces. The setting and the background music tells you that this is no look of curiosity, but one with a touch of evil. The following scene which shows his collection of severed chicken heads, frogs and other insects kept in glass jars in his room seals it. This lack of subtlety is something which pops its head often in the narrative.

Forensic, directed by Akhil Paul and Anas Khan, follows the mysterious disappearances of young girls from a city. Police officer Rithika Xavier (Mamta Mohandas) gets entrusted with the investigation. Medico-legal advisor Samuel John Kattukaran (Tovino Thomas), with whom she shares some uncomfortable history, joins her in the pursuit.

Forensic Direction: Akhil Paul and Anas Khan

Starring: Tovino Thomas, Mamta Mohandas

Storyline: Young girls mysteriously disappear from a city. A police officer and a medico-legal advisor are in pursuit of the culprit

Run time: 134 minutes

The writers invest much of their effort in misleading us about the true identity of the serial killer, throwing at us one red herring after another. When close to the interval, the identity is provided to us on a platter, one can easily see through the game of setting up the whole thing to make the end reveal a seemingly inconsequential character. These attempts at surprising the audience get tiring after a point that one does not feel much when the final reveal happens.

Though a lack of motive is certainly a kind of mandatory requirement for serial killers, the incidents that work as a trigger for the person to go on a killing spree hardly appear convincing here. The only thing that keeps our interest even mildly alive till then is the way the forensic expert works out some of the clues leading to the killer. The downplaying of the heroic elements and the care taken in not slipping in a needless romantic track are to the credit of the writers.

Some of the violence, especially those inflicted on children, are quite disturbing. One wished the makers were a little more sensitive in such cases, for thrills and chills can be created without actually showing that much amount of gore involving minors. The same has to be said about the relentless background score, which forces one to shield the ears at more than one point.

370,2020/02/29,Nitya Gurukula of Coimbatore launches Prana suicide prevention lifeline,"Nitya Gurukula of Coimbatore has launched Prana - a suicide prevention lifeline

“Tamil Nadu has the highest suicide rates, especially among the youth in the age group of 15 to 29,” says Sashi Chandran. She is CEO of Nitya Gurukula, that is into psychological counselling and conducts workshops on emotional well-being, transactional analysis, and Tai Chi. And this gave her insight into mental health and the serious consequences of not addressing the very real problem.

The alarming numbers of young people taking their own lives prompted Sashi to form Prana, a suicide prevention lifeline. Prana was set up by NG Chandran Charities, an NGO established in July 2019, with the International Association of Suicide Prevention (IASP), under the World Health Organization (WHO).

In most cases, it is ‘frustrated intolerance’ that drives young people to take the extreme step, says Sashi. “It could be anything from disappointment in love, inability to achieve grades in academics, not getting admission into a premier institution or failure to land a job...” Sashi says a lot of it has to do with the blame game we indulge in. “The way we communicate with our children has to change,” she says.

Info you can use The ‘Prana’ lifeline, 1800-121-203040, can be accessed from anywhere in India. It is available from 10.00 am to 3.00 pm on all days except Sunday.

The calls will be attended by trained counsellors and volunteers supervised by Nitya Gurukula. Counsellors speak in English and Tamil as of now. There is a move to bring on board multilingual volunteers.

Prana went live on February 19 and already it has received over 70 calls.

“Most callers sought help on relationship issues,” says Sudha Sundaram, COO of Nitya Gurukula that trains the counsellors. “Besides parts of Tamil Nadu, we also got calls from Mumbai, Bengaluru, and parts of Jammu & Kashmir. Some wanted help in coping with a break-up; some of the callers who were staying away from family on account of their jobs, wanted help with stress; then there were those suffering mid-life crises or loneliness in their old age. Prana is not just a mere helpline but a lifeline where we listen to their problems and guide them with positive psychology. It builds hope and motivates those seeking help stay optimistic. It makes them resilient and confident too.”",fitness,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fitness/7xv43z/article30950098.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NITYAGURUKULAM,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fitness/nitya-gurukula-of-coimbatore-launches-prana-suicide-prevention-lifeline/article30950100.ece

372,2020/02/29,Pardeshi stresses on public transport to curb pollution,"Challenge of space is being tackled by building in sea, like coastal road, says civic chief

The rapid increase in private vehicle ownership has directly impacted the air pollution levels in Mumbai, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) Commissioner Praveen Pardeshi said on Friday.

Speaking at a session as part of the Dasra Philanthropy Week, he said the city has a high green cover but it is still among the most polluted mega cities. “Take London for example. Why is it so clean? It is because most people travel in public transport.”

The BMC Commissioner also walked the audience through initiatives to clear roads by imposing heavy fines for parking and encouraging people to take public transport. “We reduced the minimum BEST ticket fare from ₹10 to ₹5 and within five months, the number of BEST bus commuters has jumped to 34 lakh from 22 lakh,” he said, adding the buses are fitted with GPS, and they have tied up with Google to better the commuter experience and ease the travel.

According to Mr. Pardeshi, Mumbai is a challenging city to plan for. “Almost two-thirds of the city is not for development,” he said, adding this leaves only one-third of the city where infrastructure can be developed. When left to themselves, he said, people have built homes in areas which are not to be developed.

“We often contest, how to provide homes to everyone. One of the things we are working on is in situ accommodation. If we try to shift them somewhere else, it doesn’t work. In situ development works because workplaces of people are close by,” he said.

Talking about the challenge of space in the city, Mr. Pardeshi said they have opted for something that most countries have already done, which is building in the sea. “That’s what coastal road is about. But the latest petition against it is that we are building it too fast,” he said, adding if all goes smoothly, coastal road will be ready by 2022.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/pardeshi-stresses-on-public-transport-to-curb-pollution/article30946866.ece
373,2020/02/29,Former BJP MLA booked for rape,"Ex-corporator from Mira Bhayander records video describing alleged abuse; accused absconding

The Mira Road police on Friday registered a case of rape and casteist harassment against former Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA Narendra Mehta after a former corporator from the Mira Bhayander Municipal Corporation accused him of sustained exploitation, both on video and in writing.

Mr. Mehta, who resigned from the BJP three days ago, has been booked for rape under the Indian Penal Code along with sections of the Atrocities Act. The victim submitted an application to the Inspector General of Police (Konkan range) on Wednesday and came to the police station to record her statement on Thursday.

“The victim, in her statement, has said that she separated from her husband in 1999 and started working as a marketing executive at a private club, of which Mr. Mehta was the managing director. They grew close and in June 2001, they got married at a temple in Bhayander. However, Mr. Mehta said he preferred to keep their marriage a secret for the time being, as they were from different castes,” an officer with the Mira Road police said.

The officer said while the victim initially refused to have physical relations with him till their marriage was made public, he convinced her to sleep with him, saying he would reveal their marriage “when the time was right.” He allegedly did the same repeatedly, giving different excuses every time, including the fact that he was entering politics and needed to protect his image.

In 2002, the victim became pregnant and asked him to accept her and their child publicly. However, Mr. Mehta allegedly said that he was contesting the municipal elections and his sister was yet to be married, and that such a development would be detrimental for him. Even though he kept promising to make their marriage public, he married his current wife in January 2003, and the victim gave birth to a son in May 2003.

“The victim has said that after her son was born, Mr. Mehta started forcibly having intercourse with her, threatening to kill her son if she did not comply. On several occasions, he would emotionally blackmail her into submission. He also made her quit her job so that she could help him full time in his political career and he went on to get elected as corporator twice before becoming an MLA in 2014. As his clout grew, so did his threats, and the exploitation continued till July 2019,” the officer said.

The victim, according to the police, has named several locations in Mumbai, Delhi, and Nagpur where Mr. Mehta allegedly forced himself on her. The victim, after submitting her application on Wednesday, recorded a video of herself describing the alleged abuse, which went viral on social media.

“We have also booked Mr. Mehta’s associate Sanjay Tarkar who threatened and intimidated the victim on Mr. Mehta’s behalf. Both the accused are absconding and efforts are under way to apprehend them,” the officer said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/br4rgm/article30946844.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29bm-BJP-MLA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/former-bjp-mla-booked-for-rape/article30946827.ece

The upcoming Metro Line 7 and Metro Line 2A will be identified with red and yellow once they are commissioned. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) on Friday unveiled its designs for signages on all Metro corridors.

R.A. Rajeev, metropolitan commissioner, MMRDA, said having colours is important as it makes it language agnostic and hence more accessible to people. “We have chosen to have a black background across stations for signages. We have chosen black as it is the colour of fashion and Bollywood, and Mumbai is the fashion capital.”

The signage designs have been created by Systra and is based on the designs incorporated at four stations — Metro de Paris, French National Railway Station SCNF, Metro De Marseille, and Algier Metro.

The signage has incorporated different colours for entry and exits, and will have multiple colours at stations where two or more lines converge. “The work on putting up news signs will start at Bandongri station on Metro Line 7 in two-three weeks,” Mr. Rajeev said.

The Metro Line 7 being built between Dahisar (East) and Andheri (East) and the Metro Line 2A being constructed between Dahisar and D.N. Nagar are expected to be operational by December. The MMRDA has also planned to have a unique colour for all its upcoming and under-construction Metro lines in the city.

According to sources, Tata Projects, NCC, and J Kumar Infrastructure were the three companies who had bid and were technically eligible. “Their bids will be scrutinised and then the financial bids will be opened next week,” an MMRDA official said.

The MMRDA had floated the tender for the balance work on January 30, after it had cancelled the contract of Simplex Infrastructure Ltd. due to slow progress of work. Officials said in many cases companies are wary of taking up half-finished work of other contractors as they have apprehensions on the quality of work and logistical issues such as material procurement.

The MMRDA expects the balance work to be completed by August. The total cost of constructing the entire 16.5-km corridor was ₹960 crore. Simplex Infrastructure was awarded a contract to execute the 5.5-km stretch between Andheri and Goregaon in April 2016 for ₹348 crore, of which it had managed to complete only 75%.

The tender floated on January 30 included the part design and construction of balance work of the viaduct, and the pending work of the four elevated stations on that stretch.

MMRDA officials said the overall civil work of Metro Line 7 was nearly complete barring the portions awarded to Simplex Infrastructure.

376,2020/02/29,"Heart of democracy lies in dissent, discussion, deliberation: ex-judge","‘Freedom of speech should not amount to incitement of hatred’

“An atmosphere of fear has been created but you can still be critical of the government. You can gather and talk about it; the act itself is not punishable despite several penal provisions,” S.C. Dharmadhikari, retired judge of the Bombay High Court, said on Friday.

Speaking at the fifth Dr. TK Tope’s memorial lecture, Free Speech and Sedition, Mr. Dharmadhikari said, “Even if we have elected a government that is in majority, the heart of democracy lies in dissent, discussion and deliberation.”

“The essence of democracy is that the government in power needs to work for those who voted for it, voted against it, and those who chose none of the above,” he told law students.

Mr. Dharmadhikari, who demitted office on February 14, said, “Students need not fear; students of law need not fear at all. So long as you protest by lawful means you have nothing to fear. You can be critical of the government. That is not an offence. But your freedom of speech should not amount to incitement of hatred. Law strikes and aims to protect harmony.” He also said, “There cannot be unreasonable restriction of freedom of speech because the Constitution empowers individuals.”

He referred to the case of a cartoonist, Aseem Trivedi, who was arrested on September 8, 2012, on sedition charge. He read out what then Division Bench of the Bombay High Court had ruled on October 16, 2015: “A citizen has a right to say or write whatever he likes about the government, or its measures, by way of criticism or comment, so long as he does not incite people to commit violence against the government established by law or with the intention of creating public disorder. Section 124A (sedition) of the Indian Penal Code aims at rendering penal only such activities as would be intended or have a tendency, to create disorder or disturbance of public peace by resort to violence.”

He also said at that time the Maharashtra government had issued certain guidelines to be followed by the police while invoking Section 124A of the IPC. “The guidelines assured that the section will not be used to curb freedom of speech and expression.”

Mr. Dharmadhikari highlighted Section 196 (1) (prosecution for offences against the State and for criminal conspiracy to commit an offence) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. It says, “No court shall take cognisance of offences punishable under Sections 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on ground of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language etc.), 295A (deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs), and 505 (statements conducing public mischief) of the IPC without the sanction of the Central or State government.”

The 60-year-old said a judge cannot commit an error in convicting a person under sedition. “There has to be material to frame a charge against the accused. Evidence has to be brought in front of him, which stands the test of cross-examination in the trial followed by a verdict.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/cscxz5/article30946763.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29BMDHARMADHIKARI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/heart-of-democracy-lies-in-dissent-discussion-deliberation-ex-judge/article30946756.ece

378,2020/02/29,That bus might actually be a science expo on wheels,"Gaurav Arora, vice president, Salaam Bombay Foundation, said all the exhibits were developed by students from Class VII to IX from various municipal schools.

If you see a luxury bus parked at a municipal school over the next one week, chances are that it is actually carrying a science exhibition on wheels. Two buses with exhibits created by municipal schools from Mumbai and Pune were flagged off by Nawab Malik, Skill Development and Entrepreneurship Minister on Friday.

The buses will be visiting 17 schools run by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) for a week. Called HiTech Express, the project, is an initiative of Salaam Bombay Foundation.

“Events like these change the prevailing mindset of society. Given the government’s emphasis on skill development, preparing for 21st century careers requires training in new age technologies. The workforce needs to be skilled and efficient, and we also need to think more about how we can use artificial intelligence in bridging the gap where there is a lack of manpower,” Mr. Malik said.

Gaurav Arora, vice president, Salaam Bombay Foundation, said all the exhibits were developed by students from Class VII to IX from various municipal schools.

“The best projects from a total of five schools from Mumbai and Pune were selected for this project. Today we are focusing on new age technologies as part of our skill development programmes. In the next week we plan to reach at least 3,000 children spread over 17 BMC schools to inspire them. The buses will also visit the Nehru Science Centre and Bhabha Atomic Research Centre,” Mr. Arora said.

Among the exhibits on display was a hospital robot created by Rashmi Saini and Shruti Mahapatra, students of Maratha Mandir school in Worli.

“The robot has two sensors which move 90 degrees and operates on a DC motor and a battery. The robot can be very helpful at times when epidemics like coronavirus break out across nations. The patients can get what they need with the help of this robot without any other human being being exposed to the virus,” Ms. Saini said.

Other projects on the buses included Toro, a robot which could speak in 10 Indian languages and five foreign languages, a water dispenser that, with the help of ultrasonic sensors, helps save water by dispensing only as much water as required, a 3D printer, and a smart glove for visually impaired.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/asr7io/article30946743.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29bm-hi-tech,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/that-bus-might-actually-be-a-science-expo-on-wheels/article30946733.ece
379,2020/02/29,‘Kochhar’s plea needs judicial intervention’,"Counsel makes argument in HC

The senior counsel appearing for Chanda Kochhar, the former managing director (MD) and chief executive officer (CEO) of ICICI Bank, told the Bombay High Court on Friday that her plea requires judicial intervention and concluded arguments on the maintainability of her petition.

A Division Bench of Justices Nitin Jamdar and M.S. Karnik was hearing a petition filed by Ms. Kochhar on November 20, 2019, challenging her termination by ICICI Bank and denying her the agreed remuneration as MD and CEO without prior approval of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

Ms. Kochhar alleged that this was a breach of statutory obligation under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, and it occurred after her request for early retirement had been accepted by the Board of the Directors of ICICI Bank.

Senior counsel Vikram Nankani, representing Ms Kochhar, argued that her termination was a violation of the Act. He read out Supreme Court judgments on how there has been a statutory violation in her termination which requires judicial intervention.

Rebuking the argument of ICICI Bank’s counsel, Darius Khambata, that the plea lacks application of mind, Mr. Nankani said the bank required the approval of the RBI before issuing a termination letter. He had earlier said the petition had been filed to address the infringement and breach of legal rights of the petitioner.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/8a4ty8/article30946715.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29BMCHANDAKOCHHAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/kochhars-plea-needs-judicial-intervention/article30946716.ece
380,2020/02/29,Effects of climate change on Mumbai could affect India’s economy: Cannon,"Effects of climate change on Mumbai could have far-reaching consequences for the country’s economy owing to its status as a banking centre of the country, Donal Cannon, head of European Investment Bank, South Asia, said on Friday.

“Banking is very time sensitive. If people can’t get access to their money within hours, generally there can be a run on the bank. Hence prolonged outages in Mumbai can have a very severe impact not just on people working in the city but even on India’s economy and beyond,” he said.

Mr. Cannon was speaking at a session on enabling climate adaptation through finance and policies on the second day of a conference titled, Climate Crisis: Action for Tropical Coastal Cities. The session also featured talks by Naman Gupta, climate change advisor, Environment Department, Maharashtra government, Anirban Ghosh, chief sustainability officer, Mahindra and Mahindra, and Manu Prakash, CEO of Taru Leading Edge.

“Prevention is not only better than cure, it is also cheaper than cure,” Mr. Cannon said, adding governments and agencies should look at blended financing for sustainability projects which is partly financed by public grants and partly by long-term loans of multilateral development banks.

Ms. Gupta said the State government has started talking to the private sector on how to develop business models or projects that could be scaled up in the climate adaptation area. “The private sector has been quite active in the mitigation sector but in the adaptation side, we have tried to tie up with some big companies.”

Mr. Ghosh said the resilience of Mumbai or any city was only seen after a disaster, and that there weren’t too many examples of anticipating and preventing them.

Mr. Prakash said the effects of climate change had a direct impact on public health and that health systems had to be enhanced and that Mumbai needed to have a special climate fund to the tune of $10-12 billion to address climate change. “It needs a dedicated and co-ordinated institution at the city level to address policy and programme requirements and needs to act fast. We have just about 10-12 years to adapt and mitigate, otherwise things will get out of hand.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/co8j3m/article30946719.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29bm-Climate,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/effects-of-climate-change-on-mumbai-could-affect-indias-economy-cannon/article30946700.ece
381,2020/02/29,Fixing cities remains a challenge: experts,"Shrikant Vishwanathan said, “We have been very slow in recognising the gravity of the problem.”

Fixing our cities is one of the most complex challenges of the 21st century, said experts gathered at the Dasra Philanthropy Week on Friday to discuss India’s urban crisis.

Shrikant Vishwanathan, chief executive of Janaagraha Centre for Citizenship and Democracy, said a city is a unit of life and therefore a unit of governance and of the economy, much like the State or the country as a whole. “Therefore a political and an administrative system are needed to govern the city, like you have one for the State or the Centre. But today we do not have a system of political leadership or a system of administrative leadership for a city. So we do not treat a city as a unit of governance or the economy.”

Mr. Vishwanathan said this lies at the heart of India’s urban challenges. “It’s a problem with the system’s thinking. You are not thinking of the city as a system and as a place but as an aggregation of sectors,” he said, adding, “We have been very slow in recognising the gravity of the problem.”

K. Padmanabhaiah of Administrative Staff College of India said the city administrations are in a mess. “It gets worse if the municipal corporation is run by a party, which is not the ruling party.”

He said a municipality essentially has three main functions — regulation, big project development, and proving services like clean water and waste disposal. “Unfortunately, all the focus is on the first two functions because they involve more power. Very little attention is given to services,” he said, suggesting the services arm be separated with a special focus.

383,2020/02/29,"State will be free of single-use plastic by May 1, says Minister","84,000 kg banned items seized; ₹4 cr. recovered in penalties

The Maha Vikas Aghadi government will make Maharashtra free of single-use plastic items by May 1, Environment Minister Aaditya Thackeray told the Legislative Council on Friday.

Mr. Thackeray was responding to a question posed by Anant Gadgil (Congress) on single-use disposable plastic items such as carry bags, straws, cups and plates being freely available in markets despite a State-wide ban on them.

In 2018, the previous State government had imposed a ban on manufacturing, use, sale, distribution and storage of plastic materials such as one-time-use bags, spoons and plates.

Mr. Gadgil’s question read, “Is it true that despite the ban, plastic is freely available in markets in Mumbai? Is it true that the municipal corporation has not been able to implement the ban effectively? What action is the government taking?”

In his written answer, Mr. Thackeray informed the House that between June 2018 and February 1, 2020, a total of 84,210 kg of banned plastic items had been confiscated and ₹4 crore was recovered in penalties. Mr. Thackeray said, “I have instructed divisional commissioners, collectors and urban local bodies to make Maharashtra free of single-use plastic from May 1.”

Responding to various questions, Mr. Thackeray mentioned that there are arguments over the efficiency of glass bottles, the large amounts of water required to clean these bottles and whether plastic bottles should be called single-use. The Minister said plastic bottles of soft drinks are exempt from the ban as of now.

Responding to a member’s question to allow thicker plastic bags, Mr. Thackeray said even large plastic bags are harmful as they choke nullahs. He said a detailed discussion will have to take place on banning ‘plaster of Paris’.

He added that the government has fixed ₹15 per kg as the rate under the buyback policy of plastic items from conservancy workers.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/25y5dl/article30946561.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29BMAADITYA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/state-will-be-free-of-single-use-plastic-by-may-1-says-minister/article30946565.ece

Ahead of polls in the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC), opposition leader Vijay Chaughule has claimed to have received an extortion letter.

In his complaint filed on Wednesday with the Rabale police, Mr. Chaughule said a worker from Sunil Chaughule Sports Club informed him that an envelope addressed to him was found on the club’s premises on Tuesday afternoon.

The envelope contained a letter and a photo of Mr. Chaughule posing with three women. The letter mentioned that Mr. Chaughule’s reputation would be tarnished by making the photo viral if he did not pay up ₹50 lakh. Mr. Chaughule in his complaint said the photo seemed to be from a political programme and he knew the women in it. He said the letter mentioned about a contract to kill him and defame him and his son.

A police officer from Rabale police station said, “The letter had no stamp or address. It was thrown at the spot by someone and not posted. The envelope just mentioned Mr. Chaughule’s name. The letter was found to be printed and not handwritten. The spot from where the envelope was found had no CCTV cameras. We are still investigating the matter and are yet to make any arrests.”

385,2020/02/29,In theatres today: short film on reporting sexual harassment,"1.54-minute movie is part of #MeraFarzHai campaign

A short film highlighting the importance of reporting sexual harassment will be screened in theatres across Thane from Saturday. The joint initiative by Viviana Mall and the Thane police is aimed at encouraging people to raise their voice against sexual harassment faced by women irrespective of the onlooker’s gender.

The film is part of a campaign called #MeraFarzHai and will be screened in 150 theatres across the city. The 1.54-minute film, made by Swagat Bhattacharya, showcases different instances of harassment that women face in settings like workplaces, buses and restaurants. In all the settings, while most of the onlookers stay silent, one person intervenes and confronts the harasser.

‘A huge responsibility’

Mr. Bhattacharya said the film is a way of doing his bit to change society. He said, “It is a huge responsibility. Even if one person who witnesses a woman go through something uncomfortable takes a stand, I will consider this film a success.”

The film ends with Joint Commissioner of Police Suresh Kumar Mekala, Thane City, appealing to citizens to take action by saying that ensuring the safety of women is everyone’s duty.

Rima Kirtikar, chief marketing officer, Viviana Mall, said there is a need to create awareness among citizens to come out and report incidents of crimes against women. She said, “When we reached out to the police, we were informed that a lot of cases of harassment go unreported. Sometimes witnesses do not report or intervene due to fear of what might happen to them. One of the objectives behind this film is to make people aware of the 103 emergency helpline.”

Ms. Kirtikar said the subject might not be a new one, but they are trying to approach it from a different perspective. She said, “The Thane police have been instrumental in reaching out to theatres and other institutions to help with the initiative. As of now, the short film will be screened for a month in 40 theatres in Thane, Dombivli, Ulhasnagar and Kalyan. We have also planned workshops for schoolchildren from June and aim to bring this campaign to Mumbai as well.”

Viviana Mall aims to hold a self-defence workshops on its premises and felicitate women achievers on March 7, the eve of Women’s Day.

386,2020/02/29,‘Win-win approach to redevelopment better than zero-sum one’,"Adequate street network, increasing floor space are crucial, says urban planner Dr. Bimal Patel

The redevelopment of Mumbai Port Trust (MbPT) land on the city’s eastern waterfront (EWF) provides the opportunity to repurpose it in such a way that it unlocks land value and rejuvenates the city. And with this in mind, a designer and urban planner’s challenge is to make it a win-win for all the parties involved, said architect, urban designer, planner and academic Dr. Bimal Patel.

Dr. Patel was speaking at a public lecture in the city on Friday organised by the Urban Design Research Institute. The lecture focused on the sustainable redevelopment of the largely derelict and underutilised land. “A lot of MbPT land can be put to better use,” said Dr. Patel, “There is an opportunity to repurpose it.”

To begin with, said Mr. Patel, additional streets could be aligned with the existing network to improve East-West connectivity. Not enough land is allocated to streets in India, he said. In Mumbai, for instance, 11% of the city is covered by public streets whereas Ahmedabad has 18% of public streets and New York has 33% .

“Space for streets has to be allocated at the outset, it’s difficult to do so once everything is built. Once you have a grid of streets, you can build a highly productive, efficient city,” said Dr. Patel.

The challenge that most planners quote — appropriating land for streets — is an excuse, Dr. Patel said, as there are places in India where an orderly expansion of peripheral areas is taking place.

With an adequate street network in place, infrastructure can be laid out incrementally, he said. “Nowhere in the world is it built in one go. A city-building process is messy, uncoordinated and incremental,” said Dr. Patel.

He also stressed the importance of adding floor space. “Limiting the supply of floor space without limiting people densities creates scarcities. It only results in higher prices,” Mr. Patel said.

Better land use is just as critical, he said. “The character of a city depends on the nature of the public domain: its streets and open spaces.” In Lower Parel, for instance, streets occupied just 12% and there was no open space at all.

Dr. Patel said his vision for redevelopment of the area was “underpinned by urban form”. The plan is different from “text-based” by-laws made by bureaucrats, not architects, he said. Form-based laws, on the other hand, create blocks in the region designed to be sold whole or in parts, as well as “permissible building envelopes” that indicate how much land is available to build.

Citizens who attended Dr. Patel’s lecture raised issues about reclamation of 93 hectares for a public garden in the Development Plan to create public space, the heritage structures in the area, the resettlement of migrants and housing for the working class population in the area.

Dr. Patel reiterated that on all these issues, a win-win approach would have to be adopted.

“This is the last piece of land in the public domain, it’s at 62%. There’s scarcity of land elsewhere in the city because there is so much land available here,” he said. “If you want all the land to be in the public domain, you will probably get nothing.”

He cited the example of the Sabarmati Riverfront Project which he oversaw, wherein 14% of land was monetised to create housing for 11,000 low-income families who lived on the river banks. He said, “Monetising this was considered blasphemous by NGOs, but it allowed the project to happen.”

The EWF project, he said, will open up the waterfront: create large parks, opportunities for new developments that might add to jobs and productivity.

‘It can be fixed’

Port development, he said, is like a peripheral expansion of the island city. “Indian cities have to expand into the periphery. What do we do with the mess that’s already created? For urban planners, that is the bigger challenge,” and it can be fixed, he said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/vzt6wj/article30946469.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29BMBIMALPATEL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/win-win-approach-to-redevelopment-better-than-zero-sum-one/article30946470.ece

389,2020/02/29,P. Sathyavathi wins Sahitya Akademi Award for her Telugu translation of 'Unarvum Uruvamum',"A space of her own

P SUJATHA VARMA

“It was a mixed feeling, part happy that my work has been recognised and part disappointed for a fleeting moment that I did not get the award for my original short stories,” says P. Sathyavathi about her ambivalent reaction when received a phone call from the secretary of the Kendra Sahitya Akademi K. Srinivasa Rao congratulating her on winning the literary award for her translation work Nijam Cheptunna: Oka Hijra Atmakatha, an autobiography of transwoman A Revathi. .

Revathi, who belongs to a transgender community in Tamil Nadu, wrote her autobiography Unarvum Uruvamum in 2004. She describes her journey from her birth as ‘Doraisamy’ in Namakkal district to her final transition into a transwoman. Her experience at home, in school and in society form the crux of the book. Revathi today is a role model for many of her ilk who are trying to make a living by finding small jobs.

In 2010, feminist writer V. Geetha, translated the book into English and called it The Truth About Me: A Hijra Life Story. Sathyavathi translated it for Telugu readers in 2016. “Geetha sent me the book and asked me if I could translate it. I was so moved by the first hand account of Revathi’s sufferings that I immediately agreed,” she recalls. “That the third gender is not treated well by the society is a known fact but Revathi’s book is a vivid depiction of the intensity of the suffering of the community.”

Of all the congratulatory calls that came flooding in, Sathyavathi says the one that made her really happy was from Revathi. “She can speak neither Telugu nor English and so we managed somehow in Hindi, a language neither of us knows too well ,” she chuckles.

A post-graduate in English literature, the 80-year-old also taught English in a local college. She started writing in 1970 but in the last 50 years, she has written only 50 short stories and admits, “I am not a prolific writer and I write at my own pace for my own satisfaction.” She says she took two months to translate Revathi’s autobiography.

Sathyavathi’s stories explore the lives of mostly middle class women engaged in a battle for economic independence, space and identity. Her Illalakagaane (1995) is about a woman’s quest for identity. It portrays the alienation women face in the institution of family. The protagonist in the story has given herself so completely to her family that she forgets her own name.

Her story Super Mom Syndrome (2003) was well received by women from various walks of life who told her that they related to what she had written in it. “We women are constantly trying to accomplish everything possible in a perfect manner, while striving to be a perfect worker, mother, wife, friend and other roles. Women set high , unrealistic goals, which are usually unattainable and many a time, fall prey to health problems or even die in the attempt to excel.” She draws attention to how women are conferred with the status of a ‘Super Mom’ while all she really has been reduced to is a well-oiled machine. .

Growing up at Kolakanuru, a small village in Guntur district, Sathyavathi was the eldest child in the family. She recalls how her mother’s dependence on her father for money made her uncomfortable. “My father was very progressive in his thought and took good care of my mother. But I did not like her asking him for money for every small need.” After completing her tenth standard, she went to college in Hyderabad and then returned home and got married. For two years, she worked as a journalist for a Telugu newspaper and discontinued after the birth of her first child. But she continued writing for magazines. “I would write at night after everybody slept.” She stayed home for 10 years in order to take care of her three children and family, wondering all along if she was doing the right thing with her life. She enrolled for an MA in English and joined as a lecturer in Syed Appalaswamy Degree College where she taught till her retirement.

Translations that began as an activity to keep herself occupied started when she read Adivasi activist C.K. Janu’s autobiography Mother Forest. So inspired was she by the book that she called the publisher and asked if she could translate it into Telugu. And that is how Adavi Thalli happened. There was no looking back after this and Sathyavathi became a name to reckon with in translations.

Sathyavathi’s notions of feminism are very clear. “It is all about inclusivity, humanity and democratic thinking. An inclusive society is the need of the hour.” She feels more needs to be written about women from economically weaker sections of society, and that is what she plans to do.",author,https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/z2wkfl/article30951788.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BZ29SATHYAVATHI6,https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/a-space-of-her-own/article30951789.ece
390,2020/02/29,"Work with govt. on people’s issues, CM tells Opposition","Pinarayi criticises UDF for staying away from the function for the declaration of LIFE housing scheme achieving milestone

The Opposition should consider working with the government on issues concerning the people and on larger issues concerning the protection of secularism and the Constitution, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said.

Pointing out that at least two invitees — Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala and Shashi Tharoor, MP — were absent from the function for the declaration of the LIFE housing scheme’s 2 lakh milestone, he said there was no meaning in being social workers if there cannot be unity on such matters.

“I don’t understand why they are boycotting this event. Is their protest against these poor people who have got houses? The Opposition has followed this attitude on issues concerning the State as a whole. When we formed the Loka Kerala Sabha for the Non-resident Keralites who contribute much to the State, they shifted their position after initial cooperation. When the unprecedented floods happened in 2018 and 2019, they did not cooperate in the fund-raising for rebuilding. Most recently, they also stayed away from the ASCENT 2020 investors’ meet. But still we got an investment promise of ₹1 lakh crore, which proves that such negative stands do not affect society,” Mr. Vijayan said.

On UDF claim

On Mr. Chennithala’s claim that the Left Democratic Front government is merely completing what the previous United Democratic Front (UDF) government had started off, he said the first phase of the LIFE project was meant for completing houses that remained incomplete since 2001 onwards due to insufficient funds. Funds of up to ₹4 lakh were provided for the completion of 52,050 incomplete houses.

“If you want to take the credit for this first phase, we are only happy to share the same. But, we need to think whether the beneficiaries will agree to it. Have you done anything to complete these houses when you were in power? Was there enough fund for them,” he asked.

Appeal to Opposition

Later, striking a conciliatory tone, he appealed to the Opposition for unity on larger issues.

“I request you for unity on issues concerning the protection of Constitution, as it is still not too late to change. We do have plenty of issues to debate and we can have these debates. But we need to be united for the protection of secularism and Constitution,” he said.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/voexke/article30953648.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01TVTVLIFEPROJECT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/life-cm-criticises-opposition-for-staying-away/article30952095.ece

The Ernakulam Regional Cooperative Milk Producers’ Union had urged the federation to raise milk prices by ₹6. But the meeting of top officials of the federation and the three regional milk producers’ unions on Saturday concluded that a hike might not be possible at this juncture.

It is understood that the State government is averse to a hike, especially with the local body elections scheduled to be held this year. Moreover, milk prices were last hiked in September last year.

“For now, we have decided to approach the government for incentives for dairy farmers. They are facing multiple problems including hike in the price of cattle feed and shortage of fodder grass. Milk yield also comes down during the dry summer months,” Milma chairman P.A. Balan said.

According to him, daily procurement by Milma now swings between 11.5 lakh litres to 12.5 lakh litres. The demand hovers around the 13.5 lakh litre-mark, according to him. “We also need 1.5 lakh litres for milk-based products. So there is a gap of two to 2.5 lakh litres at the moment,” he added.

Milma is making efforts to meet the shortage through purchases from the Tamil Nadu Cooperative Milk Producers’ Federation Limited (Aavin) and the Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF). Aavin is ready to supply up to 1.5 lakh litres, but Milma is not too happy about the price. Milma has approached KMF for 50,000 litres in addition to the current supply of 95,000 litres.

Additionally, Milma also hopes to source 25,000 to 50,000 litres of condensed milk from milk cooperatives in Maharashtra. However, a decision in this regard is yet to be finalised.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/no-milk-price-hike-for-now/article30951522.ece
392,2020/02/29,Three multipurpose shelters before monsoon,"Shelters at Muttathara in capital, Kasaba in Kozhikode besides 14 already coming up

Three of the 14 multipurpose shelters being constructed by the Kerala State Disaster Management Authority (KSDMA) for people affected by natural calamities in seven districts are expected to be completed before the onset of the southwest monsoon in June.

Each of the shelters can hold 600 to 1,000 people. Once completed, the three-storey buildings will take the burden off the schools and government buildings that now double up as makeshift relief centres during natural calamities such as floods and coastal erosion. The multi-purpose shelters are coming up under the National Cyclone Risk Mitigation Project (NCRMP), the KSDMA says.

Construction is under way at Thazhava (Kollam), Cheruthana and Mararikulam (Alappuzha), Pallipuram and Thuruthipuram (Ernakulam), Kadapuram and Azhikode (Thrissur), Vettam and Palapetti (Malappuram), Kathiroor and Chelad (Kannur), Kudlu, Pullur and Madhur (Kasaragod).

Two more shelters are being planned at Muttathara in Thiruvananthapuram and Kasaba in Kozhikode, KSDMA member secretary Sekhar L. Kuriakose says.

Facilities

Coming up on government land and school premises within 10 km from the coast, the buildings offers separate accommodation spaces for men, women and the differently abled. The KSDMA is equipping the facilities with generators and permanent kitchens. “Additional amenities should be provided by the local bodies concerned,” Mr. Kuriakose says.

During non-emergency periods, the buildings can serve as classrooms, indoor sport arenas, Kudumbashree cafetaria or women’s gymnasiums as may be decided by the respective shelter management committees. However, they cannot be diverted permanently for such purposes.

“The District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) concerned will be the custodian of the buildings. Non-emergency-time use will be determined by the shelter management committees chaired by the head of the local body,” Mr. Kuriakose says.

Emergency response teams comprising local residents are being formed with the help of the National Disaster Response Force and the Kerala Fire and Rescue Services. Four separate groups are being formed for shelter management, warning, search and rescue and first aid.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/2kh7bg/article30951273.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20200228-WA0015,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/multi-purpose-shelters-coming-up-in-seven-districts/article30951153.ece

394,2020/02/29,LIFE: Corpn. holds distinction for maximum houses built,"4,836 out of 9,161 have built dwelling place in second phase

As Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan makes the declaration of the State government’s Livelihood, Inclusion, Financial Empowerment (LIFE) housing scheme touching the 2 lakh milestone, the Thiruvananthapuram city Corporation holds the distinction of constructing houses for the most number of beneficiaries in the first as well as the second phase of the project.

In the first phase of the LIFE project meant for houses which have remained incomplete from previous housing schemes, 3,672 beneficiaries were able to complete their houses. In the second phase, to construct houses for those who own land, funds were provided to 9,161 beneficiaries under the Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana (PMAY)-LIFE project. Out of this, 4,836 have already completed their houses.

As part of PMAY-LIFE in urban areas, the centre provides ₹1.5 lakh, the State Government provides ₹50,000 and the civic body provides ₹1 lakh, bringing it to a total of ₹4 lakh to the beneficiaries. The requirement in the original PMAY scheme for a beneficiary share was done away with. In addition, an amount of ₹24,390 is also provided as part of the Ayyankali housing scheme.

Funds for beneficiaries

In addition, the Corporation has also provided funds for 800 beneficiaries since 2016 to purchase land for the construction of houses. An amount of ₹6 lakh is provided for Scheduled Caste community families, while an amount of ₹5.25 lakh is provided to families belonging to the general category.

For the third phase of the LIFE project, to provide flats to the landless, a total of 18,018 beneficiaries have already been selected. A 50 cent plot of land in Karimadom colony has been handed over to the Centre of Science and Technology For Rural Development (COSTFORD) for construction of flats. In addition, steps have been taken to construct flats in Kalladimukham and Poonkulam. The Corporation aims to begin construction by March, and to complete within six months.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/99eznm/article30946520.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TV29LIFEJJJ,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/life-corpn-holds-distinction-for-maximum-houses-built/article30946515.ece
395,2020/02/29,KIIDC to get bottled water project,"7,200-litre-per-hour project to be handed over to the corpn. on seven-year lease

Notwithstanding the opposition of employees’ unions in the Kerala Water Authority (KWA), the State government has decided to go ahead with the decision to hand over KWA’s bottled drinking water facility at Aruvikkara to the Kerala Irrigation Infrastructure Development Corporation (KIIDC).

Orders were issued on Friday making it clear that the 7,200-litre-per-hour project “shall stand transferred to the KIIDC upon execution of an agreement approved by the government.”

For seven years

The facility is to be leased out to the KIIDC for seven years initially with all attendant assets and liabilities. The KIIDC will be responsible for operating the facility as well marketing the packaged water. KWA and KIIDC managing directors have been directed to execute an agreement within a month so that the facility can commence operations.

Last year, the KWA had decided to call its bottled water brand ‘Thelineer.’

The government observed that it would be unwise to divert KWA personnel and resources to a ‘niche market like bottled water’ when the utility is responsible for carrying out water supply projects worth ₹9,000 crore under Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board, NABARD, Jal Jeevan Mission and the State plan. Also, there lingered the possibility of a drought. “In view of the possible drought likely to visit the State in 2020-21, the KWA needs to focus on drought relief,” the order said adding that at the same time, it is essential that the bottled water plant is operationalised on a war footing as its establishment has already cost the State ₹16 crore.

Pointing out that the KIIDC is a fully owned company under the Water Resources Department, the government has entrusted it the job of procuring the clearances required for the project from the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS).

The order observed that the KIIDC, which markets the Hilly Aqua bottled water brand, has the necessary expertise to correct the design defects reported in the plant. Also, “the expertise of the KIIDC in obtaining the withheld regulatory clearances and floating a cost-effective marketing campaign is found to be far superior from the one to be organised afresh by the KWA or any other agency hired for the purpose,”' the order noted.

KWA unions criticise

Although the government had earlier decided in principle to hand over the plant to KIIDC, the move had drawn criticism from the KWA employees’ unions.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/kiidc-to-get-bottled-water-project/article30946355.ece

About 35 start-ups have already come up in the space sector, three of them focussed on designing of rockets, 14 in designing satellites and the rest in drone-based applications and the service sector.

“These start-ups have often approached the ISRO with their prototypes for testing and evaluation. I can’t predict if they are going to be successful in terms of making rockets and launching them. But I wish them success,” Mr. Somnath said.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/35-start-ups-in-space-sector/article30946321.ece
397,2020/02/29,Punching system in Corpn. from March 2,"10 biometric punching devices installed at main office, one each at 11 zonal offices

Employees of the city Corporation who have a habit of coming late or taking extra long breaks from work will now have to be careful with the introduction of a biometric punching system and camera surveillance in the Corporation office.

Tourism Minister Kadakampally Surendran will inaugurate the punching system on March 2.

Announcing the launch of the punching system at a press conference here on Friday, Corporation Mayor K.Sreekumar said that 10 biometric punching devices have been installed in the Corporation main office. Eight of these have been fixed at the building's entry point, while two are at the back exit. In addition, one punching device each has been fixed at the 15 health circle offices and 11 zonal offices of the Corporation.

The trails of the punching system has already begun at the main office. Out of the total of 430 employees, 437 have already been included in the system. The biometric details of three employees could not be collected due to health reasons. Steps have been taken to put in place an alternate arrangement for the three of them. The biometric punching system has been installed at a cost of ₹56.72 lakh.

With an aim to bring further transparency into the functioning of the city Corporation, 140 surveillance cameras will be installed in the main office and 52 cameras in the circle and zonal offices. CCTV cameras will be fixed inside the office rooms, in the corridors and in the office surroundings.

399,2020/02/29,TNCSC rejects farmers’ charges,"The Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation (TNCSC) has denied allegations that traders are selling their paddy at direct purchase centres in Tiruvarur district.

At the farmers grievance meeting, chaired by Collector T. Anand here on Thursday, TNCSC Regional Manager (in-charge) G. Chirtarasu said paddy was being procured from farmers only if they produced copies of patta and adangal certificate asserting that the produce was harvested from the agriculture land bearing the survey number mentioned in the certificate in that particular village.

Further, the bill for procurement would get generated only if the details were fed into the system and the bill amount got credited to the farmer’s bank account through electronic clearing system.

Hence, ‘incidents’ of traders selling their paddy at DPCs could not happen unless some farmers willingly lent their support. At the same time, 32 DPC staff had been placed under suspension for various ‘mistakes’ committed by them during procurement, he said.

Masilamani of Tiruvarur and other farmers defended their statement claiming that DPC staff misused their documents and other details in favour of the traders.

Prabhakaran of Melapalayur in Kudavasal taluk said farmers of Thirukudi near Melapalayur said one or two paddy bags stacked in the open by farmers on the local DPC campus were found missing regularly though a night watchman had been posted at the centre.

On Mannargudi MLA’s T.R.B. Raja’s mention of measurement of paddy in excess of the permitted limit of 580 gm per 40 kg of paddy bag, the Collector responded by pointing out that ‘extra’ quantity of grains was measured to offset the loss in weight to be incurred by the corporation subsequently. Even this ‘extra’ quantity was accounted by the Corporation in the records.

The Collector expressed confidence that the procurement target of 5 lakh tonnes of paddy for the season could be achieved. So far 3.59 lakh tonnes of paddy had been procured through 463 DPCs and a sum of ₹623 crore had been disbursed to farmers through ECS.

A farmer, however, said: “Everyone is aware that Gall Midge and other diseases had affected samba and thaladi cultivation in certain areas of the district and the yield had dropped by 50%. Such being the case, boasting about procurement may affect the chances of farmers getting compensation from insurance companies.”",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/tncsc-rejects-farmers-charges/article30952523.ece

401,2020/02/29,NHAI calls for fresh tenders for highway work,"After years of delay, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has finally called for tenders for strengthening of Nagapattinam-Thanjavur section of National Highway 67.

The move comes after a delegation from delta region recently met with Union Minister of Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari in New Delhi.

Led by Nagapattinam MP M. Selvaraj, the team comprising representatives of Tiruvarur Development Advisory Council called on Mr. Gadkari to brief him on the hardships faced by road users and tourists due to the pathetic condition of the road.

The incomplete road widening works on the section has been a major grievance for residents of Nagapattinam, Tiruvarur and Thanjavur districts and visitors to the region. The condition of the road at several stretches make for back-breaking ride for thousands of commuters.

The project was originally sanctioned at an estimated cost of ₹396 crore to strengthen 78.53 km of the road as a two-way highway with paved shoulders. The work should have been completed by 2017. But it remains incomplete for several years now after the concessionaire abandoned it.

Following the representation to the Minister, NHAI issued notice on February 27 inviting bids to carry out improvements to the two-lane highway with paved shoulders for a distance of 65.37 km through engineering, procurement and construction contract.

The project is estimated to cost ₹340.63 crore and it is expected to be completed within two years. The bids received are scheduled to be opened on April 14.

However, NHAI has not conceded the Council demand for widening of the road as a four-lane highway. With the stretch dotted with curves and criss-crossing watercourses, widening of the road is considered vital to improving road safety and checking accidents.

The project was originally conceived as a four-lane project and even lands were acquired by NHAI about eight years ago, the Council pointed out. But the proposal was subsequently modified to extended two-lane road with paved shoulders.

“We are happy that the tenders have been called for the project and we are grateful to the Minister and the MP,” Council secretary P. Senthil told The Hindu.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/nhai-calls-for-fresh-tenders-for-highway-work/article30951361.ece

The remaining 623 shops would be allotted to traders and merchants of vegetables, fruits and flowers. Open auctioning method would be followed for the allocation. Registered traders and exporters from Tiruchi and other parts of the State could take part in the auction. Based on their requirements, shops could be modified. A new GO to that effect would be issued soon.

The officials visited factories in Tiruchi, Lalgudi, Vaiyampatti, Musiri, Manikandam, Thiruverumbur, Thottiam, Mannachanallur and other parts of the district and checked whether the companies had licences and no-objection certificates (NOCs) from authorities concerned for tapping ground water.

The drive was carried out in a smooth manner. Anticipating punitive action following the HC order, most of the companies had shut down operations.

Companies, who faced punitive action, were asked to apply for licences. If the applications were genuine and complied with the norms of the State government, they would be given permission to renew operation.

Meanwhile, packaged drinking water producers in the district began indefinite strike demanding early disposal of applications seeking licence.

The Tamil Nadu Rice Research Institute in collaboration with the Chennai-based Sun Agro Biotech Research Centre, conducted a field demonstration at Aduthurai on Wednesday to give a hands-on experience to farmers to mitigate problems faced by them due to yellow stem borer pest attack on their crop.

V.Ambethgar, director, TNRRI, who inaugurated the programme, said that this field day was part of an on-going collaboration between the two institutions to supplement the initiatives of Tamil Nadu Agricultural University in promoting more sustainable rice cultivation by adopting such environment-friendly technologies as part of integrated pest management approach.

The programme included awareness creation among rice farmers on the benefit and method of using pheromone traps to trap insects as a future alternative to chemical insecticide for more sustainably managing the yellow stem borer pest attack on paddy crop. He explained the use of pheromone traps in monitoring and trapping of pests.

407,2020/02/29,New lizard spotted in Puliancholai,"A pilot study on biodiversity of lizards by a field biologist in the foothills of Kollimalai has resulted in spotting of a lacertid-snake-eye-lizard at Puliancholai near Thuraiyur in this district.

A species of lacertid lizard endemic to India and eastern Sri Lanka, it is known to exist in the forest areas of Salem and Coimbatore districts and near the banks of the Cauvery. Its presence has not been recorded in Puliancholai area so far, Q. Ashoka Chakkaravarthy, Conservation Field Biologist, Centre for Ecology and Conservation, Tiruchi, said.

Describing the features of the reptile, he said its transparent lower eyelids are completely or partially fused with the upper lids to form a cap over the eye.

It has 15 or 16 femoral pores (a part of a holocrine secretory gland found on the inside of the thighs of certain lizards which releases pheromones to attract mates or mark territory). This species bear an external similarity to Skink, but are different, he said.

Species of the genus of wall lizards of the family Lacertidae are distributed in southeast Europe, northeast Africa, to west Asia. Snake eye Lizard was named after Leschenault de la Tour, Jean B.C.T (1773 - 1826), a France Botanist, he said.

The steady flow of stream throughout the year amidst greenery and the presence of scores of tamarind trees foster the diversity of birds and reptiles in Puliancholai. But the spurt in tourism in the area, a home for fascinating butterflies, moths, birds, lizards and insects, does not augur well for the biodiversity, he said.

Diminishing availability of natural habitats has been pushing many reptiles to adapt to live in home gardens, plantations, and in degraded habitats.

As a result, these reptiles are presently over-exposed to predators such as domestic cats, poultry and birds, he explained.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/new-lizard-spotted-in-puliancholai/article30947053.ece

410,2020/02/29,Santos gets EB’s equaliser in the nick of time,"Churchill Brothers unable to hold on to early advantage

East Bengal equalised off a penalty in the final minute of injury-time to hold Churchill Brothers 1-1 in the I-League at the Salt Lake Stadium here on Saturday.

Jaime Santos found the leveller after Churchill had taken an early lead through Willis Plaza.

Attack mode

Looking to regain winning form after losing at home to current leader Mohun Bagan, Churchill got into attack mode right at the start.

With the hosts’ defence looking tentative, Churchill found the lead in the 10th minute.

Plaza, quite familiar with the conditions, having led the East Bengal attack for two seasons (2017 and 2018), made the most of it with a fine solo effort.

Collecting a long floater near the East Bengal box the Trinidadian international got the better of two defenders and found the net with a neat placement past goalkeeper Mirshad.

East Bengal regrouped quickly and almost found the equaliser in the 11th minute when Brandon Vanlelremdika was set up in the Churchill box by Santos.

However, the attempt missed the target from close.

East Bengal continued its quest for the equaliser after the break only to see its efforts falling flat in the striking zone.

With its strikers unable to put the desired finish on the many opportunities coming their way, a penalty in the 90+4th minute finally opened the goal route for East Bengal.

After substitute Ansumana Kromah was brought down by Churchill defender Suresh Meitei inside the box, Santos netted from the spot.

411,2020/02/29,Indian Super League | Chennaiyin stuns Goa with dazzling show,"Goian, Thapa, Sabia and Chhangte on target for the hosts; Gama nets the visitors’ consolation goal

Chennaiyin FC produced a delightful performance to register a sensational 4-1 win over FC Goa in the semifinal first leg of the Indian Super League here on Saturday.

It was a collective effort by the hosts, each department playing its role to perfection. Be it Rafael Crivellaro with his touches, or Nerijus Valskis and Andre Schembri prowling at the frontline or Lucian Goain & Co at the back or Jerry Lalrinzuala on the wings or Edwin Vanspaul in midfield, each player justified his position.

After a exciting goalless first half, CFC got into action rightaway in the second session. Crivellaro’s free kick was just at the right place with three defenders lurking around. As the visitor’s ‘keeper Mohammad Nawas jumped high, Goian leapt higher to slot it home.

Anirudh Thapa struck a peach of a goal. From around 15 yards, the 22-year-old unleashed a curving shot that went past the outstretched hands of the custodian.

As if that was not enough, CFC scored two more in the space of eight minutes through Eli Sabia and Lallianzuala Chhangte.

Valskis wonderful low cross from the left saw right-back Eli Sabia poke his right foot in time to convert.

Then, Thapa gave a wonderful assist for Chhangte to strike one home from close range.

Goa's substitute Saviour Gama’s late goal didn't make much of a difference in the end.

Certainly, CFC’s head coach Owen Coyle couldn’t have asked for a better result. His players deserve every applause that comes their way. This is CFC's first win over Goa in the last five matches. Now, Goa will have a mountain of a task in its home match in Fatorda on March 7.

FC Goa, however, was hampered by the absence of few important players: Hugo Boumous (indisposed), Brandon Fernandes (injured) and Edu Bedia, who had to fly back to Spain for personal reasons.

412,2020/02/29,BFC needs to put its best foot forward,"Will find it tough against ATK in the semifinal first leg

The first leg of the ISL semifinal against ATK comes at a tough time for Bengaluru FC. The reigning champion has had to endure a heart-breaking midweek defeat in the AFC Cup playoff, leaving the club without continental group stage action for the second straight season.

If the deflating loss was not enough, the club has been sweating over the fitness of its best player, Sunil Chhetri.

But on Sunday at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium it needs to somehow pick up the pieces and put its best foot forward.

“It doesn’t take a lot to get my players to be competitive,” coach Carles Cuadrat stressed on Saturday.

Ready for the game

“I think Sunil [Chhetri] is ready for the game and we are three games away from becoming champions. We need not punish ourselves for the things we did in the past. For the third season in a row we are fighting for the title while a lot of teams are already in their holidays.”

It will certainly help that the semifinal and final offer a clean break from everything that has transpired in the league thus far. It’s a mini-tournament in itself, with the winner guaranteed a 2021 AFC Cup playoff spot. Following an up-and-down season, it’s a reward that the club will be desperate to secure.

No pushover

But ATK will be no pushover. A two-time ISL champion, it has scored 33 times in 18 games, second only to FC Goa.

Unlike BFC, which has solely depended on Chhetri, Roy Krishna, Edu Garcia, David Williams and Michael Soosairaj have combined to score 27 goals. What’s striking is the combination play among these four, something BFC needs to be wary of.

At the same time, ATK has leaked a mere 16 goals, with only BFC stingier at the back (13).

“I think it will be a very competitive match because two organised teams will be playing [against each other],” said ATK coach Antonio Habas. “BFC is balanced and very competitive and one of the favourites. Until now, they are the champions and we have to respect them.”

413,2020/02/29,Gokulam Kerala holds Punjab FC,"A familiar theme played out for Gokulam Kerala on Saturday night. Fernando Santiago Valera’s boys threatened to score right from the beginning, conceded a goal against the run of the play and spent much of the reminder of the game playing catch up.

They shouldn’t be pleased at all with the 1-1 draw with Punjab FC. If their finishing was a bit sharper, they could have walked away with the three points they badly needed at this stage of the I-League.

But it would not be accurate though to attribute the result completely to the ineptitude of Gokulam’s strikers. Punjab’s goalkeeper Kiran Kumar Limbu could take credit for denying the host on several occasions.

One of the more spectacular of those came in the 25th minute, off a splendid shot from just outside the circle by Nathaniel Garcia. That was the time when Gokulam was pressing hard to draw first blood.

The trusted firm of captain Marcus Joseph and Henry Kisekka had forced a corner kick for the host as early as the second minute. The Punjab defence was indeed under constant pressure.

But it was the Gokulam defence that crumbled first. And it was rather a silly mistake too, as T.V. Mohammed Irshad allowed the dangerous Aser Dipanad Dicka to sprint into the box after a receiving a long ball from deep inside the Punjab half.

Goalkeeper C.K. Ubaid would not want to remember that moment, either. He had advanced too far and could only watch in despair Dicka score his 10th goal of the tournament. The Cameronian striker is now the sole top-scorer.

That goal separated the two sided at half-time. Gokulam was desperate to equalise in front of another good crowd.

Much to the relief of the team and the fans, the equaliser finally came, in the 63rd minute. For once, the hard-working Limbu was beaten under the bar. He could not stop the Garcia, who drove the ball neatly past the Punjab defence.

More chances in the host’s way, but this wasn’t the night for Gokulam to deviate from a familiar theme.

The result:

414,2020/02/29,Goosebumps in Goa: Review of Venita Coelho’s ‘Whisper in the Wind’,"This mystery is saccharine retro, but you give in to it with pleasure

The premise is simple and holds delicious, genre-bending potential. The scion of old money has put himself in self-imposed exile in a tiny Goan village in an India on the cusp of independence. This sabbatical, which he wrenched from his mother through a tantrum, is his last concerted effort to carve a writer out of himself. In the village stewing in its own toxic sameness, in a vast house echoing with unresolved memories and restless ghosts, a story finds him.

To anyone born to parents who grew up in the 60s or early 70s, Whisper in the Wind is comfort food. You wouldn’t immediately admit to this being your ‘favourite’ fare, even if the heart does seek its predictability and unpretentious flavour. The haveli is a fantastical childhood memory plucked straight out of the movie screen. The characters in the story are stereotypical — the ‘Babu’ from the city, a spirited village girl who can face down the perils of her everyday existence, but is afraid to love. The priest, the drunk, the madman, the villain, the lover, and the plaintive music.

There is a scene in the Hindi classic Madhumati starring Vyjayanthimala and Dilip Kumar, where in the big reveal the titular character reveals her true self. Thinking about it gives you gooseflesh. Whisper builds up to one such crescendo. We see it coming, and we don’t mind that we can.

Coelho’s approach to the supernatural is refreshing. It is neither a breathless amplification of the protagonist’s confusion and fear, nor is there any attempt to explain the why of it. It is matter of fact and quite in sync with the way our hero looks at the world.

The narrative is linear, the detailing sparse. Apart from some interesting experiments with feni and a smattering of Portuguese, the space time could have been anywhere. That a good number of characters are reduced to props by the end gives the story an underdeveloped feel. Still, the protagonists find closure. The mystery is solved. Love is requited, one way or another. That should do. Why expect virtuosity from comfort food.

415,2020/02/29,Fish in a net: Review of Sangeeta Bandyopadhyay’s ‘The Yogini’,"The philosophically weighty chunks are balanced out by the realism of the sketches

Seeing what isn’t there is thought to be one of the symptoms of insanity. In Sangeeta Bandyopadhyay’s The Yogini, the life of Homi, a 20-something television journalist, is upended when she is stalked by a mysterious sadhu whom only she can see.

One person’s insanity is another person’s spiritual awakening. Amidst the millions of unseeing eyes on the battlefield, Arjuna glimpses the universal form of god, a sight that utterly terrifies him.

Homi and Lalit are a young couple in their 20s, both professionals, of the ‘work hard, party harder’ generation, and seemingly very much in love. We first meet Homi when she is on the way to a restaurant to celebrate the first anniversary of their marriage. On that fateful night she sees the yogi for the first time, and her life begins to unravel.

In terms of linear action this is the tale of a young woman increasingly beset by visions, who slowly proceeds to explode her successful life from within. Is she undergoing a profound emotional breakdown?

But Bandyopadhyay structures the novel as a philosophical argument; in the prefatory note, she explains that the core of her novel stems from niyati or fate, a state “in which the individual is the under the illusion of being bound to a particular time and space, when in fact, they are not”.

These weighty chunks don’t slow down the pace, as Bandyopadhyay sketches the upper middle-class milieu with deft strokes, relating their travails — from the general unreliability of domestic helps to the importance of securing a club membership.

She brings to vivid life Homi’s extended dysfunctional family held together by “bonds of loathing”. Their machinations over property and status form a backdrop to Homi’s increasingly existential quest.

Homi’s desperate attempts to find meaning get increasingly wilder but without recompense. As she thrashes to break free like a fish out of a net, out of a endless cycle of desire and repulsion, Bandyopadhyay writes “she was seeking not love, wisdom or fulfilment — she sought to be exiled from the future, to be exiled from events”.

Motivational coaches assure us that we all have to “be yourself”. The greatest torment is sometimes just that, being who you are.

416,2020/02/29,‘Eliminating polio was a singular achievement for India’: Thomas Abraham,"Thomas Abraham on ‘Polio: The Odyssey of Eradication’, and why if there is political will, the country can achieve a lot in health

Thomas Abraham’s Polio: The Odyssey of Eradication, shortlisted for The Hindu Prize for Non-Fiction, is a gripping exploration of the complexities that lie in the way of the worldwide project to banish polio. And is it a goal within reach or is it an example of public health efforts having gone off track? An excerpt from an interview:

Given that health has been a relatively new area for you, how did you get interested in the subject and in polio? Was your experience in Hong Kong a catalyst?

I had no experience, or even great interest, in health, until SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) erupted in early 2003. I was at the time living in Hong Kong and was approached by a publisher to write a book about it. This was what got me interested in health and disease, and how human beings respond to threats to their health. At a deeper level, SARS as well as the coronavirus now demonstrate the power that microbes have over our lives. The relationship between man and microbe is fundamental to our

physical as well as social and cultural evolution. This is what I explore in this book on polio, where I look at the effort to drive the virus that causes polio into extinction in much the same way that humans have driven so many other living beings into extinction. Viruses of course have existed on earth a lot longer than humans have (and will probably continue to exist after we disappear) so whether we can drive the polio virus to extinction and stamp out polio is still an open question.

The year 2019 was a setback for polio elimination, especially in Pakistan. Did the extent to which a major health campaign to get rid of a crippling disease became a hostage of geopolitics surprise you?

The polio eradication campaign has faced setbacks for several years now, not just in 2019. Its last big success was the elimination of polio from India in 2011. Since then, polio caused by the wild, or natural polio virus has remained entrenched in Pakistan and Afghanistan, but more worryingly, cases of vaccine derived polio have surfaced in many countries that were previously thought to be polio-free. The polio campaign does not like to talk about vaccine derived polio, for fear that people will lose confidence in the vaccine. But this is a growing issue the polio campaign faces.

Regarding geopolitics, a fascinating story that I was able to explore in this book is how polio eradication became a victim in the U.S. hunt for Osama bin Laden in Pakistan. Polio eradication in Pakistan has always been enmeshed with the rise of the Taliban in Pakistan, and the larger triangular conflict between the Taliban, the Pakistan government and the U.S.

This is not particularly surprising. Pakistan is located in a geostrategically important space, and health cannot really be insulated from the larger political environment.

Would you agree that the polio eradication programme has been struggling? What is the spark needed?

The polio programme has been struggling, and largely because those who are managing it and running it often tend to think in very fixed ways and are reluctant to change. I think one of the biggest mistakes made was to not to move much sooner towards an inactivated polio vaccine rather than the current oral live polio vaccine. The oral polio vaccine is much cheaper, easier to administer, and in most parts of the world, extremely effective. But it has the disadvantage of requiring multiple doses, as well as the side effect of creating vaccine derived polio viruses. The inactivated vaccine does not have these problems, but is more expensive and requires trained personnel to administer. Had the polio campaign raised the funds for a vaccine switch five years or so ago, and made polio vaccination part of other childhood vaccinations, many problems might have been avoided.

While India’s polio campaign has been a public health triumph, there are grey areas about what has not been achieved, especially in other areas of public health. What are your views on the human response to disease?

Eliminating polio was a singular achievement for India, particularly given that two States with the poorest performing governments in the country, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, had the bulk of polio cases. The elimination of polio in India showed what the country is capable of achieving in the area of health if the political will exists. Unfortunately the same political push does not exist to achieve so many other health problems that cause much more death and disability than polio, ranging from eliminating malnutrition to controlling diseases like malaria, dengue and chikungunya. The government poured resources and political and administrative muscle into polio elimination because India’s inability to eliminate polio when so many other countries had was becoming a global embarrassment. Unfortunately, there is no similar international pressure to achieve other health targets.

In global health campaigns such as these, it may not be an exaggeration to say that donor funding plays a major role. Is there a danger then of picking only the low hanging fruit with the pressure of timelines and targets? Would this impact the next public health challenge?

Donor funding does play a major role in global health campaigns, but many of the existing global campaigns, particularly those required to achieve the sustainable development goals, are long-standing, deep-rooted problems. The health-related sustainable development goals include issues such as reducing the number of women who die in childbirth, the number of children who die in infancy, ending epidemics of diseases like malaria and so on. None of these is difficult to achieve; they do not require any sophisticated technology. All they require is for the government to invest more in our healthcare system, and also give to health the same importance that is placed on issues such as defence and foreign affairs.",books,https://www.thehindu.com/books/gzw3i8/article30940851.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23LRHinduprize,https://www.thehindu.com/books/eliminating-polio-was-a-singular-achievement-for-india-thomas-abraham/article30940853.ece
417,2020/02/29,"Here I am, the ace writer-player","I might have become a regular at fashionable literary events, says Manoranjan Byapari, rickshawalla turned award-winning author, but life will never really change for people like me. That is the impossible truth

I am a self-taught writer-player who lives by the sweat of his brow. You become a player by playing continuously; so by writing constantly, I have become a writer-player. Having written about 17 books over 40 years of toil, I have received quite a few awards including the West Bengal Sahitya Akademi, Rabindra Smriti Purashkar from Calcutta University, Suryadatta National Award, Gateway LitFest Writer of the Year, The Hindu Award for Non-fiction and others. As a result, influential people’s interest in me — some of it curiosity — has increased these days.

They now take me to different corners of the country to look at me, to hear me speak. Apparently, a common allegation levelled against festival organisers is that they invite writers only from the higher echelons of society. By making an example of me, they can now convey the message that they aren’t discriminating between bhadralok and chhotolok. That they are high-minded enough to give even a footpathwalla the same opportunities and recognition.

Know me by my gamchha

It might be a compulsion on their part but still, it is the truth — when all these days only highly educated people could sit on those hallowed platforms, I have got a seat there now. And I am getting the chance to speak. Although I do attend these festivals, I feel that I am a total misfit in these forums — like an illegal entrant. Not all of the invited guests talk freely with me. A natural distance remains. Even if I am the winner of the all-India Hindu Prize, in their eyes I am not a cuckoo but a crow. The crow that tries to sing like a cuckoo.

My dress, deportment, way of speaking are not suited for genteel society. They talk in the language of the educated — English — while I speak in Bengali or Hindi. They eat with spoon and fork, I take food to my mouth with my hand. They might not say it, but in their hearts they revere the tie; I drape around my neck the cheap cotton gamchha, like a pennant of the labouring class.

Many say, if you know that such platforms are not for people like you, why do you go there? To them I say: in the same way that they ‘use’ me, I too go there to put them to some ‘use’. Today thousands of people all over the country know about me, read my books. If I hadn’t been to those forums, would I have been able to reach these people? Which is why, whatever the reason may be, till the time they keep having me, I will keep going. It is profitable for both parties.

Half-empty stomach

At one point of time, during the disturbance caused by Partition, lakhs of people from East Bengal had to migrate to West Bengal. I am the son of such a suppressed, poor, government-aid deprived refugee family. Once on this side of the border, we had no means to support ourselves. At an age when children go to school with books under their arms, I, driven by need and hunger, went to rich households to graze their cattle. Washing glasses at cha stalls, washing dishes in hotels — my whole youth passed this way.

My feet would be constantly wet from standing in water while washing dishes — I got psoriasis between my toes. I wouldn’t be able to sleep whole nights with the pain. I get emotional when I think of those agonising days.

When I got a little older, I worked as a porter in railway stations, I drove cycle rickshaws, I worked as a sweeper, always on a half-empty stomach. This kind of life, it has no desires, no happiness. What remains is shame and the life-wrenching desire to stay alive. What remains is the indifference, the tortures and the insults of this inhuman nation, its society, its people.

Even before entering adulthood, I got a fair idea of how accursed poverty is. In this country, discrimination on the basis of birth prevails in all its horrors. I could feel that I was a criminal just by virtue of my birth. The lowly place accorded to me in the caste hierarchy of the great Hindu religion is, in the eyes of casteists, more ignominious than the position of a mangy dog: it’s a sub-human category. I am such an untouchable creature that it is believed my touch will defile a temple. I saw, I learnt, I understood that in this country and society, all the means of survival are beyond my grasp. Those who have hegemonised all knowledge way before my birth won’t share even a morsel of it with me. Anyone can downgrade and torture me for the most negligible of mistakes. Say, the rickshaw wheels accidentally go over somebody’s feet — for this alone they can smash up my face. The civilised, suave babudom will watch the spectacle from a distance, but nobody will come over to pull back the torturer and say, stop.

Having endured such torture, insults, persecution, I realised one day that it is of no use crying and pleading for mercy with the torturer. Only beating them back makes sense. But, of course, in doing so I realised that I instantly became an anti-social in the eyes of society, of law.

Will to live

Then came the 70s — across the country, a group of eternally oppressed, battered people resolved to instil fear in Fear itself and began raising their heads. Fired by the dream of reforming society to make it habitable for a child again, lakhs of people descended on the streets. They said, we want to create a society where nobody is high up, nobody is low down, but everybody is honourable. Where every individual will get food, clothes, education, shelter, medical help.

I too wanted such a utopian society. So I walked up to stand behind them. At that point, I had no other alternative. The life I was leading was as if I were alive simply because I did not want to die. The indomitable will to live — only that was keeping me alive.

The inevitable happened. An antagonistic political party got together with the police to catch, hack and shoot all those who were trying to change society.

Those who escaped the maws of death either had their limbs broken or were sent beaten nearly half-dead to the black hole of the prison. I was one among that last gang. Fate assigned me a dark cell in Alipore jail. Whether outside the jail or inside — the dance of death was everywhere.

Even inside that horrible prison, I found I could put my time to some use: I discovered something that would come handy later in life. With the help of another prisoner, I learnt the Bengali alphabet. I would scratch the letters on the floor of the prison with a stick. After 26 months of effort, I learnt enough to read a book. When I came out of jail, nothing remained of the Naxal movement. In the face of extreme police brutality, the tiniest hopes of the rebellion had been extinguished.

I went back to my old profession of driving a rickshaw. Although I was doing the work of horses and cattle, I hadn’t discarded the addiction to reading that I had picked up in jail. I would borrow books for reading. In one such book, I chanced upon a word — jijeebisha. Puzzling over its meaning, one day I asked my rickshaw passenger, a woman, what the word meant.

I didn’t know she was Mahasweta Devi. She was amazed to hear such a word from the mouth of a person like me, and by my eagerness to know its meaning. After learning about me, she asked, “I have a magazine called Bartika — will you write about yourself there?” That’s how she brought me to the world of writing. My journey as a writer-player started through a piece published in Bartika...

Still struggling

I have run an unbelievably long marathon. In this fight, I haven’t got the slightest help from anyone. In the way a mountaineer creates his next foothold by carving it out with a pickaxe, I too have worked very hard to progress step by step. I would labour through the day and then sit down with pen and paper at night. My body would droop with fatigue, my guts would twist like a burnt cobra in hunger, but I would keep writing, page after page, ignoring all the pain...

Now so many of my writings have been published, my fame has almost reached the sky, but in terms of social and economic position, I remain in the same place. When my first piece came out, I was a rickshaw driver. In the following years, I worked as sweeper, wood-seller, a helper in trucks, a night watchman, and today I earn my living by cooking in a school kitchen. No awards or fame has fetched me an easier job, which will allow me to write on a full stomach. In the past one year, I haven’t been able to work — and that means no salary. My family is struggling.

I will never get the help of anybody in this country — that is the impossible truth. I have to fight this battle on my own. Till the time I can keep up the struggle, I will stay afloat in the literary world. After that, I too will be lost in the rapid currents of time.

seeking asylum in a foreign land. Danny, the cleaner who walks around Sydney with his vacuum cleaner attached to his back, golden highlights glinting in his hair, is the bait. The time frame of the novel stretches into a day in the life of Danny, or Dhananjaya Rajaratnam, a Sri Lankan migrant from Batticaloa.

His job is to scrub the houses of the more established inhabitants. In the course of his day he comes upon the shocking news of a murder of one of his clients.

Radha Thomas, whose apartment Danny cleans once a week, is the epitome of a successful woman of Indian extraction who has married a white Australian and made the most of her privileged status, which includes having a macho Indian lover named Prakash Wadhwa. He sounds a bit like our Hrithik Roshan as he has eyes the colour of hazelnuts, but alas for our heroine, a nasty habit of playing “Pokies”, that is to say, gambling on the gaming machines. It’s a habit Radha Thomas also has.

The timeline is elastic. Adiga stretches it to include the four years that Danny has spent in Australia as a student. The narrative is not going to do much for those who are aspiring to one of Australia’s oft-touted educational programmes. The story also yo-yos back and forth between some of the other places and episodes in Danny’s life. There’s a wonderful evocation of Danny as a young lad swimming out into the lagoon in Batticaloa and waiting for the mermaids to emerge from the surf.

Adiga appears to have discovered nature during his Australia sojourn. Not only are there mentions of a jabiru, a black stork native to Australia that is reminiscent of the Jubjub bird from Lewis Carroll, but repeated references to fig trees, from which a white bird drops out like a hot stone, and yellow-crested cockatoos.

Surreal bond

Danny is prone to morphing into Adiga when he is not wielding his vacuum cleaner. There is, for instance, a flashback to an elephant he names Prabhakaran.

Danny feels a surreal bond when he comes across an old naval gun rusting in a park. Is it Danny or Adiga who tells us that the gun is a relic from the German warship Emden that had created panic in Chennai when it suddenly appeared on its waters during World War I, terrifying Tamils even in Sri Lanka? “A dragon over there, it had become a dodo over here and was destroyed; and now the last piece of the Emden, this gun, perhaps the same one that had set the waters of the Marina ablaze and lit nightmares in Chennai for two generations, was mounted on a park in Sydney.”

In another place, Sonja, Danny’s Vietnamese girlfriend, tells her mother that once Danny had watched “a brown man and a girl who were dancing to no music at all but the sunlight — wearing nothing except their glistening heat resistant skin” and suddenly realised that they were not Indian, not Sri Lankan, but Aborigines. Rumours of links between the tribals of South India, as also between the Veddas of Sri Lanka and Australian Aborigines, were once popular.

But as the geneticist A.K. Roychoudhary pointed out in a paper in 1984: “Despite the morphological similarity there is no genetic evidence to suggest that the Indian tribes and Australian Aborigines are biologically related.” Danny could be presumed to cater to popular fantasies of a Tamil presence in early Australia, but what could induce Adiga to repeat such canards?

Even as he prowls around Sydney on that fatal day, Danny’s greatest fear is that someone will see through him and dob him. To dob, the dictionary of slang will tell you, is Australian for a person who is morally obliged to rat on another person. Trying to evade the system is the catch 22 at the heart of Adiga’s narrative. There is an immutable element called the Law in Australia. It may be the white man’s concept of what constitutes right and wrong but inevitably, it becomes the brown man’s burden.

To freeze or to run — that is the question that frames Danny. Adiga provides the amnesty.

419,2020/02/29,‘Find the Radha within’: Namita Gokhale,"Namita Gokhale stresses that her latest book, ‘Jaipur Journals’, is a novel about writers rather than about the Jaipur Literature Festival

I got a chance to talk to Namita Gokhale on the penultimate day of the Jaipur Literature Festival (JLF) at her room in the Diggi Palace Hotel while the crowd roared outside in the Front Lawns, where a session with Sachin Pilot and Rajdeep Sardesai was in full swing.

Gokhale’s recent novel, Jaipur Journals, is set against the backdrop of the JLF, which she co-founded and has been co-directing for 13 years. In this freewheeling conversation, Gokhale talks about her novels, the Himalayas, where she is from, and the strong women who populate her work.

Jaipur Journals has the JLF as its context. Has such a novel been in the offing for a number of years?

No, I began two years ago: somebody suggested the idea to me and the idea took root in my mind. Of course, many of these stories have their backstories in things that have happened to me, but over these 13 years, I have been observing writers, talking to them, wondering about the writing process. This is not a novel about the JLF, but about writers and why they write. It could have been set anywhere.

A lot of your books are located in the Himalayas. Why do you keep going back to the mountains?

I grew up in Nainital: it’s a sort of a childhood romance that never left me. There’s something about the mountains that moves me more than anything else. Once the smell of the Himalayas gets into your blood, it will never leave you.

You have been writing mythological fiction long before it became the ‘in’ thing. How did it all start?

It started with In Search of Sita (2009), an anthology I had co-edited with Malashri Lal. Even before that, I had written The Book of Shiva, which was originally published in 1999. Then I wrote The Puffin Mahabharata for young readers — which was the most transformative piece of writing I had ever done. I realised that every story in the world is contained in the Mahabharata in some form or the other. The most important lesson I learnt from this epic is that everything changes. Time or kaal is the real ruler of the Mahabharata and I have felt this wisdom keenly, even tried to apply it to the way I have programmed this festival.

There are so many women in our epics and lores, but they hardly have a story. I am compelled to fill in those gaps. I used to seethe at the injustice done to Sita. Then I realised Ram’s compulsions, Sita’s strength — Sita is perhaps the strongest of all the women in our epics. In Search of Sita led to a lot of novels on Sita, by Amish, Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni, for example, and they acknowledged that they were inspired by our anthology.

From Sita I have now turned to Radha; I think we Indian women should find the Radha within ourselves. If religion can celebrate the wondrous leela of Radha and Krishna, why can’t every woman channel their inner Radha?

You have written books for adults and children. Is the process of writing different in each case?

You write to the child within or you write to the world without. It’s not different. The only difference is in the vocabulary — I never talk down in my children’s books but I try to keep the vocabulary simpler.

Your novels are known for their strong women. As a female novelist, do you do that consciously?

I come from Kumaon, from a family of strong women. The women of Kumaon/ Uttarakhand are among the strongest I have ever encountered anywhere. I think it’s a combination of a very tough life, the beauty of the surroundings and the fact that they are always confronting the basics that gives them this strength.

When I am writing about strong women, I am writing from the memory of those women I have known, and I don’t really write to validate any theory: it’s just that I haven’t known any other kind of women.

You have become synonymous with the JLF; do you think this has helped you as an author?

It works against me as an author. I am much more famous as the co-founder and co-director of the JLF than as a writer because that gets more press than anything else. I don’t think it has helped me as an author but it has helped me in another way: it has broadened my vision, my understanding of literature.",books,https://www.thehindu.com/books/kpq0gi/article30941112.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01LRNAMITA1,https://www.thehindu.com/books/find-the-radha-within-namita-gokhale/article30941113.ece
420,2020/02/29,Tiny tales from Juggernaut,"With podcasts on the rise, it was only a matter of time before kids got their own celebrity storyteller: Soha Ali Khan

How do you raise a reader during the age of the iPad? As children’s attention spans get smaller, how does one convince their child of the idyllic joys of reading and storytelling? Juggernaut Publications, along with Soha Ali Khan, may have arrived at the perfect solution — the podcast.

Story time with Soha Ali Khan, an eight episode podcast released this week, has Khan reading out a new children’s story every Friday. “As a mum myself, this is quite exciting for me,” she says, adding, “New parents have a lot of struggles, and keeping their kids entertained and busy is a big one.” Juggernaut has collaborated with Hubhopper, an Indian podcast distribution platform, and the stories chosen are uniformly short to retain the child’s attention. Juggernaut has also collaborated with six other Indian children’s books publishers, including Rupa Publications, Harper Collins India, Pratham Books and Karadi Tales for a selection of titles that are as diverse as they are engaging. There is The Rumour by Anushka Ravishankar and Night of the Doberman by Lavanya Karthik, to name a few. The first episode, which came out yesterday, is about 16 minutes long and has Soha reading The Watermelon God by Neha Singh in a slow and deliberate monotone, probably in a bid to ensure that bedtime goes as planned.

Audio streaming advantage

Audiences for audio content, specifically podcasts, are at an all-time high. Over 40 million users in India were consuming podcasts in 2019 and the number has only been growing, thanks to a combination of long commutes and slower data speeds that don’t allow for quick video streaming. The difference between podcasts and written content, says Khan, is that the former are “easy to consume”. “You can listen to audio content while driving, cleaning the house, cooking,” she says. “As for this podcast — it is special to me because I know how important and difficult it is to find good content for your kids.”

Chiki Sarkar, co-founder of Juggernaut, believes that the success of podcasts lies in the fact that they’re “essentially lazy reading”. “You get the book,” she says, “but with less effort.” Sarkar is confident about the market for audio books in India. “We’ll soon audio enable the entire app and materials there,” she says, referring to the Juggernaut app platform. “That’s our first priority and we are looking to convert our text into audio.”

Beyond print

More than 40% of new internet users globally in 2018 were children, according to a PwC report from last year, resulting in an estimated 62 million children, if the proportions are applied to Indian audiences. “Print is no longer the only way to reach readers,” agrees Tina Narang of HarperCollins, adding, “We need to find new and evolving formats to get children hooked to stories and storytelling and the podcast is an interesting way forward.“ Khan is confident that children will find it a good substitute to video. “It brings back the magic of oral storytelling,” she says. ”That is special and irreplaceable.”",books,https://www.thehindu.com/books/xi7ylp/article30948784.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29wksohajpg,https://www.thehindu.com/books/tiny-tales-from-juggernaut/article30948787.ece
421,2020/02/29,‘The Cultural Economy of Land’ review: Beyond dates and numbers,"Tracing the agrarian past of a ravaged Bengal district from colonial to nationalist times

The book under consideration substantiates the fact that agrarian history is an inalienable part of the economic history of India, especially of the colonial period. Indeed, as the ‘Introduction’ states, the tradition of recording agrarian history existed since the days of the East India Company. In the 20th century it acquired a new dimension even as nationalist reformulations of the Indian past placed emphasis on peasant protests and land-based movements, augmenting economic data with studies of living standards and of patterns of exploitation and protest.

Land and the people

Sinha Roy’s volume, while situating itself in the latter tradition of broad-based historiography, aims to improve upon the politically inflected parent model by bringing out the “ways in which communities inhabit the agrarian space”. Adopting a methodology modelled on Walter Benjamin’s Small History of Photography, it aims to throw light on the “nature of relationships (land-based) livelihoods generate between land and people,” on the material culture of an agrarian community, and on the political and gender structures that emerge in a society defined by land-centric power or the lack of it. The naturally and politically ravaged district of Birbhum from the time of ‘high colonialism’ to ‘incipient nationalism’ provides the author with just the right setting for delineating such an enmeshed “cultural economy of power based on land.”

One particular example of the contingent historiography the book advances is the depiction of a particular custom prevalent among the lower-caste Baghdis of Bengal whereby a high-borne man has to share a meal with the family of the Baghdi woman whom he has taken sexually: food here becomes a symbolic marker of a temporary shift in the social relations of power.

Diverse strands

This ‘small history’ of colonial Birbhum is spread over five chapters. The first deals with the socio-economic impact of the Permanent Settlement while the second dwells on the creation of rural knowledge from the late 18th to the early 20th centuries. The third chapter traces the trajectory of political resistance in colonial Birbhum, notably depicting the agitational politics of Santal resistance, and the clash between the Communist protesters on the one hand and the dissident Ganavani group led by Soumendranath Tagore on the other. The fourth chapter thrashes out issues of conformity, defiance and difference in everyday rural social life, and the final chapter is devoted to appreciating the literary ethnography of Birbhum offered by the works of novelist Tarashankar Bandyopadhyaya, ‘the chronicler par excellence of Birbhum.’

The language of the book could perhaps have been a little more fluid: the sentences could have been unpacked a bit, so to say, in the theory parts. That said, this reviewer has no hesitation in hailing The Cultural Economy of Land as a worthy contribution to agrarian historiography in general and the colonial history of Birbhum in particular. That such a conventionally male-dominated sub-field of the social sciences has started to bear prominent marks of female intellectual labour is rather heartening. The editor’s dedication of her mother’s book to women academics whose tireless work often goes unrecognised is a fitting tribute to the author and to women’s scholarship at the same time.

422,2020/02/29,‘Return to Sri Lanka: Travels in a Paradoxical Island’ review: Mirror to a thousand realities,"Narratives about ethnic mixing, religious syncretism and the innate goodness of the people lift a writer’s rather bleak outlook about Sri Lanka

Sri Lanka is smaller than many South Asian countries but it has a highly diverse society. Despite the vexatious ethnic question, it has a fairly large section of minorities who have recorded remarkable progress in the fields of education, public affairs, economy, art, culture and sport. Besides India, Sri Lanka is the only country in the region that has successfully passed the test of a true democracy for the last 70 plus years, given its track record of having witnessed peaceful regime changes over the years.

There is another side to the story of Sri Lanka. Mindless violence, both in thought and deed, discriminatory public policies and a deep-rooted complacency in work culture have characterised the island.

These paradoxes of Sri Lanka have been captured well by economist Razeen Sally in his insightful book, Return to Sri Lanka. The work is a blend of autobiographical and historical accounts, apart from being a travelogue.

Middle path

Sally’s style of narration, in the early part of the book, is quite fascinating, as it intercuts two parallel accounts — one pertaining to historical events and another relating to the author’s family story, on lines similar to John Fowles’ 1969 book, The French Lieutenant’s Woman.

The book covers a whole range of topics from Theravada Buddhism to Sinhala Buddhist nationalism, influence of Hinduism on the Sinhalese, the role of the Senanayakes and the Bandaranaikes in politics, the Tamil question, the plight of hill country Tamils, a much neglected section of Sri Lankan society, to the virus of fundamentalist Islam and the genesis of the 2019 Easter blasts.

His basic approach to the subject has been dispassionate, even though he does not betray his aversion to former Prime Ministers, S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike and his wife Sirimavo.

However, he has described their daughter and former President, Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, as one who was “much less chauvinist” than her parents and her two UNP predecessors.

But, the Rajapaksas symbolised “big-man politics and illiberal democracy,” even though the author has recorded that the beautification of Colombo, a city which Sally loves, was carried out during the previous regime of the Rajapaksas with “un-Sri Lankan speed.”

The author, with both Sri Lankan and British roots, has also done well in echoing the opinions of moderates among Tamils and Muslims, while being critical of extreme elements in the two communities.

Accord issues

At the same time, his recall of certain aspects of contemporary history is not completely accurate. On events preceding the July 1987 Indo-Lanka Accord, Sally says, the then Prime Minister of India, Rajiv Gandhi, had “threatened to invade” the north of the island. In fact, when Indian planes, in early June, airdropped 25 tonnes of food and medicine over Jaffna, Sri Lanka reacted strongly, accusing India of having “violated its territorial integrity.” Besides, it is not correct on the author’s part to say that President J.R. Jayawardene had announced the Accord “without consulting his Cabinet.” Discussions within and outside the Cabinet went on for two weeks and the then High Commissioner of India, J.N. Dixit, had briefed the Sri Lankan Cabinet twice of features of the Accord, an uncommon sight.

The book, which was launched a few weeks before the return of the Rajapaksas to power in November 2019, does discuss the possibility of the victory of the clan. Notwithstanding the author’s not-so-optimistic outlook about Sri Lanka, the prevalence of ethnic mixing, religious syncretism and multi-racial character, all of which have found frequent mention in the book, is a matter of comfort about a country, which consists essentially of people, whose innate goodness will not go unnoticed even to a first-time visitor.

423,2020/02/29,A lifetime in pursuit of Gandhism,"Devaki Jain’s books cover more than five decades of building ideas through an engagement with feminist questions, women’s movements, and global politics of development

Reviewing these books for me has been as much a trip down memory lane of ideas, concepts, struggles and theories as it must have been for Devaki Jain when she curated them. Generations of Women’s Studies and Development Studies students have learnt a great deal from her writings. Our understanding of looking at census data of workers with suspicion, census definitions of ‘work’ and ‘worker’ critically, and unpacking the production and reproduction relations of women’s labour came from scholars of that period, prominent among whom was Devaki Jain.

Gender sensitivity

Using a gender-sensitive lens to study women’s work and their everyday struggles to deal with issues of poverty and contributions to their households, Devaki Jain not only highlights that this is an issue pertinent to be addressed at the national level through knowledge building, policies and programmes but an issue that provides a vantage point to question the mindset that resource-intensive, consumption-oriented, market-led capitalist development is true ‘development’. This perspective was articulated by DAWN (Development Alternatives with Women for a New Era), a platform and perspective by Southern Feminists of which Jain is one of the founding members.

Both the books by Devaki Jain have about 14 and 15 chapters each and are dense with narratives of the author’s explorations of more than five decades of building empirical and theoretical ideas through her engagement with feminist questions, women’s movements, and global politics of development discourses within northern and southern countries. Jain’s research papers and talks given amidst outstanding gatherings in India and to global leaders and delegates in international fora, from 1989 till 2016, not only cover her rich experience but stand testimony to an amazing engagement of a woman activist-scholar with a post-independent nation’s trouble with discourses of development at each of the phases of India’s development. The early phase at the intersections of Gandhian ideals and Nehruvian aspirations; followed by the socialist phase within a legacy of feudalism, poverty and massive unemployment; which was ushered into the era of globalisation dictated by global capital and market forces. Jain’s personal and political trajectory within these economic and political contexts provides interesting insights into her early experience of Gandhism and a lifetime pursuit of the same.

Questioning stereotypes

Through each of the chapters in the two books, Jain shares several important reflections, which questioned development thinking and development practice fairly at an early stage of India’s development efforts. She unpacks the fallacy of terminologies and concepts in development thinking that undermine the livelihoods and rights of a large majority of people within planning and policymaking. For example, the term ‘informal’ sector versus the mainstream ‘formal’ sector undermines the fact that the majority of workers is indeed in the informal sector in India. Similarly, the produce that is collected, foraged and gathered in a sustainable manner by tribals is called ‘minor forest produce’ as opposed to felling of timber which is referred to as ‘major forest produce’. This narrow mindset of what is understood as contributing to productivity also undermines women’s work and unpaid labour.

Jain had meticulously built evidences to question enumeration biases that do not net the majority of the women as workers. Through her experience of important institutions like the South Commission, Jain shares her disappointment with colonised minds of leaders in independent countries. Jain cautions feminists through the two books, to contextualise struggles for gender equality and justice within the contradictions of development thinking, discourses and financial architecture that continue to produce social and economic inequalities, global climate change crises and political conflicts.

These books are a must-read for all Women’s Studies, Development Studies, International Development students, scholars and gender practitioners, particularly looking for more relevant ways of thinking about responses to global climate change.

424,2020/02/29,‘Journey of a Civilization: Indus to Vaigai’ review: The route from Harappa to Keezhadi,"A researcher explains what happened to the culture and language of the Indus Valley Civilisation after it started disintegrating around 1900 BCE

Journey of a Civilization: Indus to Vaigai grapples with a little-understood period in Indian history — the centuries that followed the decline of the Indus Valley Civilisation. And it comes up with a wealth of new insights that are fascinating in themselves, but in addition, also answer a question that has vexed historians for long: what happened to the culture and language of the Indus Valley Civilisation after it started disintegrating around 1900 BCE?

The author of this remarkable book that is weighty both in the literal and figurative sense is R. Balakrishnan, who has published many research papers on this subject before, even while he was working as a highly-regarded senior IAS officer in Odisha. That this has been a long-term labour of love is evident from the way the book has been written, with impressive attention to detail and a profusion of charts, tables, illustrations and maps that make it easier for one to follow the story. Balakrishnan, a postgraduate in Tamil Literature, had worked closely with the late, well-known epigraphist and author Iravatham Mahadevan, and was Honorary Consultant to the Indus Research Centre in Chennai after Mahadevan stepped down from that position in 2011.

Population genetics

What makes the book very timely is that in the last couple of years, a relatively new discipline called population genetics has been answering critical questions about Indian population formation, including who the Indus Valley people were, where they moved and whom they mixed with after their civilisation went down. For example, we know from recent genetic research that people of the Indus Valley were a mixed population of First Indians (the earliest direct ancestors of modern humans in the subcontinent who arrived here around 65,000 years ago as part of the original Out of Africa migrations that populated the whole world), and a population related to the earliest agriculturists of Iran.

We also know that when their civilisation began declining, they moved east, towards North India, and south, towards South India. Again, we know from genetic research that in the following centuries, between 2000 BCE and 1500 BCE, there were large-scale migrations from the central Asian Steppe, areas today known as Kazakhstan that brought Indo-Aryan language speakers to India who called themselves Arya. Over centuries, these highly mobile pastoralist groups with mastery over horse came to dominate the northern parts of India, enough to cause a language shift from the pre-Arya languages of the Indus Valley people to the Indo-Aryan languages of the new migrants.

Remnants of a civilisation

This sequence of events leaves one with a simple question, a question that Balakrishnan zeroes in on: if the Indus Valley civilisation people spread all over the subcontinent around 1900 BCE, but their language and, to some extent, culture, was overlain by those of the new migrants from the Central Asian Steppe in northern India, shouldn’t it be possible to trace the remnants and continuities of the Indus Valley Civilisation in the rest of the subcontinent, especially southern and eastern India? In search of answers to this question, Balakrishnan travels all across the country, looking for clues in as wide a range of areas as pottery culture, place names, ancient literature and local customs. And what he finds are facts that leap out at you, grab you by the collar and force you to see things from a new perspective.

This review can only give a very small glimpse of these gems, and the one that most captured this writer’s attention was the argument that the early Sangam literature, which goes back many centuries before the Common Era, contains carried-forward memories of northwestern India. In other words, once upon a time, ‘Tamilakam’ or Tamil land could have had a very different geography than what it has now, thus suggesting a migration of language, culture and people — or as the title of the book says, Journey of a Civilisation — from northwestern India to southern India.

The camel story

To give one of the numerous examples, Sangam literature has many descriptions of camels and one of these works (Akananuru 245) describes a ‘tough-legged camel’ in a vast stony expanse, desperate from hunger, eating white bones scattered on the ground. Writes Balakrishnan, “In this poem, the bone-eating camel is noted to be a draught animal, a beast of burden used by the merchants to carry their mercantile. The camel being used as a draught animal is a scene unfamiliar to peninsular India. Such deserts have never been part of the known Tamil linguistic and political boundaries of the Sangam Age... It can then be reasonably postulated that this description could only have come to the Sangam texts through a long distance memory which probably belonged to a remote past involving the prehistory of the ancestors of Sangam Tamils in the desert areas of western India, particularly in Gujarat.” In another Sangam text, the poet compares drift wood on the sea shore to a sleeping camel — not a natural comparison for any poet in south India to make, as opposed to, say, a poet in coastal Gujarat.

Clues in the wind

Sangam Literature is conscious of its geographical settings (‘tinai’) to a far greater extent than other literatures and, in fact, different ‘tinai’ demand different kinds of poetry. Using this distinctive attention to climatic and geographic detail, Balakrishnan studied the mentions of ‘winds’ — northwind, southwind, eastwind, etc. — in the literature and came to an interesting observation. The number of times the literature mentions ‘chill wind’ from the north and ‘hot wind’ from the west dwarf the mentions of the ‘southern breeze’ and the ‘Monsoon wind’ from the east. But these descriptions and weightages of different winds do not fit the current landscape of Tamilakam, while they do fit the Gujarat landscape — as is evident from the mentions of the average windspeeds and direction at Ahmedabad and Chennai that the book carries!

So Balakrishnan makes the case that as the earliest urban, secular literature of the subcontinent, the Sangam texts reflect the ethos and material culture of the Indus Valley Civilisation far better than any other literature in India, including the Vedic corpus. He also shows that while there is noticeable continuity in the pottery culture from northwestern India to southern India and eastern India, there is a perceptible discontinuity in northern India, probably due to the arrival of later migrants from central Asia. One of the unique aspects of the book is its use of onomastics — or the study of the history and origin of proper names. Onomastics helps Balakrishnan show how the place names that are common in Tamilakam (and southern India in general), find strong echoes in northwestern India even today and how often these also match names mentioned in the Sangam literature.

Journey of a Civilization is an essential, necessary read for anyone interested in India’s history, especially its cultural history. It is also a must for anyone who wants to grasp the significance of the discoveries being made at the Keezhadi archaeological site on the banks of the Vaigai in Tamil Nadu. By going into areas that other researchers have not explored deeply enough — subcontinental pottery culture, onomastics and also the link between the Sangam literature and the archaeologically-understood culture of the Indus Valley — Balakrishnan has brought new light to a period of Indian history that is critical to our understanding of how we came to be, as India. The book makes intensive use of data to establish connections and patterns and still offers a stimulating and fascinating journey to both the general reader and the academic reader.

425,2020/02/29,‘But You Don’t Look Like a Muslim’ review: The long shadow of Partition,"Rakhshanda Jalil on the stereotyping of a religion and why every Muslim has to prove her Indianness on a daily basis

Chaman mein ikhtilat-e-rang-o-bu se baat banti hai/Hum hi hum hain to kya hum hain tum hi tum ho to kya tum ho (It is the inter-mingling of colours and fragrances that make a garden/ If there is only us there can be no us and there can be no you if there is only you.) This Urdu couplet by Sarshar Sailani quoted by Rakhshanda Jalil in the beginning of her book sets the tone for the essays that follow, on identity politics, the composite cultural traditions of India and its literary history. The 40 essays make up four sections, The Politics of Identity, The Matrix of Culture, The Mosaic of Literature and The Rubric of Religion.

Questioning an identity

In the introduction, ‘Oh, But You Don’t Look Like a Muslim’, she talks about the stereotyping of Muslims in India, associating them with a certain set of characteristics, and portraying them in a bad light. It also adds that the common preconceived notions about Muslims being violent, aggressive and regressive have not only been propagated by right-wing organisations but also in popular literature and cinema.

In the opening essay, ‘My Father Didn’t Take the Train to Pakistan’, the author shares her experience of growing up in the India of the 1970s and how she was taunted by her classmates for her Muslim identity. It is more or less the story of every Indian Muslim — irrespective of his or her social class — where his or her Indianness has to be proved almost on a daily basis. ‘You are a Muslim first or an Indian first?’ is a question which is thrown at Indian Muslims quite often. In response to this question, the author clearly spells out that both the identities are important and emphasises that “Islam doesn’t deter a Muslim from believing in his or her Indian identity.”

In another essay, ‘Living in Jamia, Coping with Ghettoization’, she talks about the challenges of living in Jamia Nagar, a congested part of Delhi, which gets step-brotherly treatment from the civic authorities and the government just for being a Muslim-majority area. These two pieces give readers a fair idea about the challenges and anxieties of Muslims in post-Babri India.

In another essay, the author busts the myth of “the monotonous monochromatic” Muslim, telling readers that the community is as diverse as any other Indian religious community, linguistically, culturally or otherwise.

Syncretic India

Besides the theme of identity, the anthology has many essays which reflect how the idea of India is based on shared heritage. For example, the author tells us about Hasrat Mohani’s love for lord Krishna and Allama Iqbal’s poem on lord Rama whom the poet calls Imam-e-Hind or the spiritual leader of India. There is also an interesting article about the transformation of a sweet-sounding greeting of ‘Jai Siya Ram’ into an aggressive political slogan and battle cry of ‘Jai Shri Ram’: an ostensible simple change of word in a slogan has changed the entire political discourse of the country. The insightful essays make us think about the way communal and divisive forces are trying to tear apart the social fabric of diverse India. It’s a timely book worth everyone’s attention.

426,2020/02/29,Corporation Middle School at Masakalipalayam in Coimbatore showcases cheerful artwork on its walls,"There is a special buzz in the Corporation Middle School in Masakalipalayam, and it is not just because of the cheerful artwork on its walls

A red, blue and grey train chugs its way across a wall at the Corporation Middle School campus in Masakalipalayam. It is the outer wall of the kindergarten classroom. At a distance is another colourful wall. “It’s the birthday wall. We celebrate birthdays of our students right here,” smiles K Mythily, head mistress of the school. All these paintings are done by a team from Cognizant as part of the company’s employee-led volunteering programme called Cognizant Outreach. The school campus is cool and green from all the trees inside. A small sandpit and play area for the kindergarten occupies one part of it.

The colourful walls outside and inside the classrooms add to the buzz. From multiplication tables to Thiruvalluvar’s couplets, almost every inch of the walls teach the students something valuable. A classroom on the first floor doubles up as a library. P. Sakthivel, who teaches at the school says the library has 4000 books, collected through a social media initiative. “All the books came as donation. We have developed a library software now to keep track of out books.” The paintings in this room are themed around books and reading with portraits of Bharathiar, Buddha, and Thiruvalluvar along with some of his couplets. Popular Tamil books are painted on to another wall and it appears as a huge book shelf with the tomes.

It is not just paintings on the walls. All classrooms also have computers and wifi. “Most lessons in the syllabus are replicated as audio-visual presentations. A barcode key enables students to get updated information on the topics they are studying,” explains Sakthivel. Students also learn parai, a traditional musical instrument. “We have over 18 extra-curricular activities covering a number of topics from silambam and karate to chess, yoga, origami, and robotics to keep the students engaged,” says Mythily who believes this improved the attendance of students from 70 percent to 92 per cent. “They don’t miss their classes now,” she says. To encourage performance, one student is picked as the star of the month and his or her performance is lauded with a photograph displayed on an artwork on the wall near the entrance to the classroom.

Art on the wall The team Cognizant Outreach has transformed classroom walls as learning material with their creative work. While the spaces on corridor walls display paintings of mathematical tables, the ones inside the classrooms carry textbook lessons. P. Sakthivel joins us as we enter the Std I classroom. A snaking caterpillar bears Tamil alphabets on its back. Cheerful paintings of vegetables sit pretty on the wall with many colourful smileys

At another classroom, there is a pictorial display of parts of a tree, and paintings that explain the Tamil calendar months. There are drawings teaching good manners. In the higher classes, the walls bear information on the cultures of India, modes of transport, and so on. In standard IV, the solar system sits proudly on the wall

Ever since Mythily took over the school in 2017, she has worked to create a bright environment for the students. “The teachers pooled in money for a a new coat of paint for the walls. Our student strength has grown now.” In the space of three years, the admissions have gone up from 100 to 320. She beams with pride as she reveals that there have been fresh admissions. “More than 100 new admissions in the previous year were of students who have shifted from a private school.” The school mainly caters to students from the lower economic strata of nearby localities like Sowripalayam, Uppilipalayam, and Singanallur. “More than 50 per cent of students come from a background where parents are daily wage earners with no education.”

Mythily is all praise for the social media. The school has been able to reach out for help and receive it. For example, an alumni of the school who lives in the US read up about them on Facebook and he now sponsors the robotics classes. She firmly believes that children will excel if they have the right environment. “But, this requires time. Our students today are regulars in quiz programmes and handwriting competitions. They always come back with prizes.”",life & style,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/2eoare/article30950603.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27CBJESSCHOOL,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/corporation-middle-school-at-masakalipalayam-in-coimbatore-showcases-cheerful-artwork-on-its-walls/article30950607.ece
427,2020/02/29,Vertical gardening: Owner’s pride,"Vertical gardening thrives in the city with its innovative and practical solutions

Srinath Pilarsetty home has become a selfie zone thanks to two ‘green walls.’ They stand near the entrance of his independent house at Tirumala Hills near Moosarambagh. “Our house has become popular and people in our locality have started taking selfies at the entrance,” says the amused advocate, adding that vertical gardening near the staircase leading to this building has brightened up the space.

Meanwhile though Pista House’s new restaurant, in Moosarambagh, is yet to launch, its lively green wall is already drawing passers-by, who pause to admire it. This surge of unexpected urban greenery also done by Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA) now found on the pillars under most city flyovers, the Khairatabad flyover (‘I Love Hyderabad’), apartment complexes (Hill County) and hostels (Vajram Aster homes, Gopanapalli) are welcome, vertical oases in the city.

As they get more popular, residents are also learning how to create small vertical gardens in their homes and apartments. MSN Rao and his wife, who are both teachers, are city dwellers with green thumbs. After they moved into an apartment, they converted their balcony into a small patch of green filled with semi-shade plants, which include syngonium, spider (chlorophytum comosum) and money plants. Rao, who sought expertise from Myro Farms in Hyderguda, explains why they chose this method, saying, “Vertical gardening is the way forward as it brings greenery with even little space.”

Though Mohammad Ali has had a tiring day, he perks up when he walks towards the vertical garden at Apollo Hospital, Jubilee Hills. “We forget exhaustion when we look at the plants,” he says. Ali owns Green Life Nursery, which has been instrumental in creating some significant vertical landscapes completed The Apollo Hospital wall, using 12,000 plants about three weeks ago.

His team has done about 80 projects in the city over six years including the recent ‘I Love Hyderabad’ signage with more than 16,000 plants at Khairatabad Flyover. With a Ph.D in English, Ali used to teach in Oman and returned to Hyderabad to take care of his ailing mother. In Hyderabad, he shifted gears to start a nursery. His venture Green Life is in partnership with his lecturer wife. “Greenery is not taken seriously and we do not realise the importance of these plants in curbing pollution and creating a better environment.” He adds that this age of rapid urbanisation, this green cover spreading vertically brings cheer to the city dwellers. “Having a small patch of green is economically viable too,” he says.

Nurseries across the city are now cashing in on the growing demand for innovative green practices. At Myro Farms, vertical panels come with a set of three plastic pots and panel fabrication is done with metal pipes. Afzal Ali patiently explains how to set up a garden. ? “Depending on space and sunshine, we advise on the indoor, semi-shade or outdoor plants. Air purifying plants, are popular among semi-shade plants.” A former chef, Afzal began growing herbs to be used in his cooking. Later, he co-founded Myro with his physiotherapist wife Dr Zareena Anjum. Three factors significant in having a good vertical garden are: Choosing a right plant and the area, installation and irrigation. “Red soil is heavy and doesn’t irrigate properly. So most of the vertical gardens have very little or no water and have a manure with cocopeat so that it is lighter and holds water but for outdoor plants we recommend some amount of red soil.” There is another reason to have greenery around; As part of its Clean Air study in 1989, NASA checked several plants in a controlled environment and they found 20 plants filtering the air. Adds Afzal, “It’s indeed proven how these plants clear some toxins in the air.”

Mohammad Ali reveals the design of irrigation system. “Water is needed everyday but irrigation system is designed to save water,” he says, adding that customers can opt for manual watering or drip irrigation. “The pipeline connected to the source releases water as droplets. Plants dry fast in summer hence needs to be watered everyday. Each plant takes about a tea cup of water,” he adds.",life & style,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/37b7v2/article30948985.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYM26VERTICAL2,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/vertical-gardening-is-a-hit-with-its-innovative-and-practical-solutions/article30948991.ece
428,2020/02/29,Getting ready for Mr Universe,"What Chacko Tharakan does to get a lean, mean body for the Mr Universe competition

Beef steak and sweet potatoes for breakfast. Chappati, boiled chicken and vegetables for lunch. Grilled chicken for dinner. Until June, this will be Chacko Tharakan’s meal plan. That’s not all. Chacko is also putting in two hours of weight training twice a day and workouts: hybrid kalari, a mix of yoga, kalari, ju jitsu, karate and callisthenics in the morning and afternoon. Acrobatics on Cherai beach helps break the monotony.

Wondering what all this is about? This is Chacko’s preparation for the Mr Universe pageant to be held in Bangkok in June.

Last year two events propelled Chacko towards his goal of winning the title. One was participating and getting to know the ropes of the

competition in June at Seoul and the other was winning Mr Asia Pacific title in Beach Body Category in December at Bengaluru.

“I dreamt of representing India in sport, of raising the tricolour and bringing it home, but could not do so while in school,” says Chacko studied at St Joseph’s in Coonoor. Later he worked in a pharma company in Chennai before relocating to his hometown Kochi.

Training in a gym was a habit he developed in school, he says, adding that he had wanted a good physique even as a youngster. His trainer MS Arvind suggested he participate in competitions to become “serious” about body building. Chacko took the plunge in 2017 and won his first district competition, Mr Ernakulam that year and the next. A disciplined routine that combined fitness , training and diet helped. “There were no cheat meals.” In 2018 he came fourth in the Mr Kerala competition. “Body building is not like football; when a goal is scored you win. Here the judges have discretionary power,” he says. The competition results led to controversy and he changed his federation.

As a result he could not participate in the National championships that year but, in 2018, he entered Mr India competition and won the title in the Beach Body category. This was followed by two more titles that allowed him to represent India at Mr. Universe title in South Korea. “Though I finished 10th, it taught me many lessons.”

His entry earned him a Pro Card, a license to represent India in the professional league for Mr Universe making him the first from Kerala to get a Pro Card.

One of the lessons he learnt was about body proportion. Being six foot tall, he was better off entering the competition in the Beach Body Model category. “A Beach Body model has a leaner physique with big shoulders and comparatively smaller arms. It is a V-shaped torso. At the competition, I realised the areas in which I should improve . I am concentrating on bulking up and, as I go forward, I will cut down on fat to get leaner,” says the 29-year-old.

Kalari has helped change his body language. “It gives confidence, even confidence to dance,” says Chacko who is also trying to find a foothold in the film industry.

“There’s a lot of sacrifice to do. Body building has taught me patience. One of the side effects of a sugar-free diet is mood swings but Body Building has made me Zen. I am peaceful,” says Chacko, dreaming once again of holding the tricolour on the podium at Bangkok.",life & style,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/chacko-tharakan-prepares-for-mr-universe-at-bangkok-in-june-2020/article30948910.ece
429,2020/02/29,Presence of colistin-resistant bacteria of food origin in the gut is cause for worry,"Colistin is the last-resort antibiotic used to treat highly drug-resistant bacterial infections

A small study involving 65 stool samples taken from patients from a single hospital in Chennai found 51% of them harbour colistin-resistant bacteria. This reflects the presence of such bacteria in the gut as stool samples represent gut colonisation. This is the first study from India which has found indirect evidence of colistin-resistant bacteria in the gut and was published in the journal Diagnostic Microbiology & Infectious Disease.

Colistin is the last-resort antibiotic used to treat highly drug-resistant bacterial infections.

Colistin-resistant bacteria can be of hospital origin or food origin. Colistin-resistant bacteria of hospital origin do not respond to any of the antibiotics, including carbapenem while colistin-resistant bacteria of food origin will respond to carbapenem.

Stool samples

Of the 65 stool samples studied, 33 samples were found to have colistin-resistant bacteria, the team led by Dr. Abdul Ghafur, consultant in infectious diseases at Chennai’s Apollo Cancer Institute found. And of the 33 samples that had bacteria resistant to colistin, 77% were found to be food-acquired and the remaining 23% had an antibiotics resistance pattern suggestive of hospital origin.

In a paper published in the Journal of Global Antimicrobial Resistance in 2018, Dr. Ghafur and his team found that colistin-resistant Klebsiella bacteria were widely present in poultry and raw vegetables. The main cause of colistin resistance in food is due to the rampant use of colistin in poultry. Since poultry litter is used as manure to grow vegetables, colistin-resistant bacteria are found in vegetables as well.

Usage in poultry

“Most of the colistin-resistant Klebsiella bacteria in the gut is from food and not hospital-acquired,” says Dr. Ghafur. “Colistin usage in poultry plays a bigger role than its usage in hospitals for the bacteria to develop widespread colistin resistance.”

Dr. Ghafur adds: “So even if hospital usage of colistin is rationale and scientific that will hardly make any difference in the generation of colistin resistance. The only way out is to control the use of colistin in poultry.”

How resistance is conferred

In clinical practice, it is the mutation in the mgrB gene or other chromosomal genes that confers colistin resistance to Klebsiella bacteria. In their 2018 study, the authors found mgrB gene mutation in food Klebsiella bacteria.

Till date, there is no evidence to suggest that the mgrB gene mutation spreads from food to human Klebsiella bacteria. The only colistin resistance mechanism that is known to spread from food to human Klebsiella bacteria is through mcr gene transfer.

However, only a minority (less than 3%) of colistin-resistant Klebsiella bacterial infections in humans is contributed by the mcr gene. “Majority of infections by colistin-resistant Klebsiella in humans are due to mutations in the mgrB gene or other chromosomal genes,” Dr. Ghafur says.

The gene and its mutation

The mcr gene is located in the plasmid and so can spread quickly to other bacteria. The mgrB gene mutation too can spread quickly but through insertion sequences.

The cause of colistin resistance in majority of bacteria of food origin in human gut is due to mgrB gene mutation.

“Our study provides additional evidence to the hypothesis that colistin resistance due to mgrB mutation in food Klebsiella has the potential to spread to human Klebsiella in the gut and hence may contribute colistin-resistant infections in humans,” he says.

In light of that, the finding that a large number of individuals carry colistin-resistant bacteria of food origin in the gut is therefore worrying.",health,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/jdh08k/article30951584.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01TH-SCIPOULTRY,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/presence-of-colistin-resistant-bacteria-of-food-origin-in-the-gut-is-cause-for-worry/article30951585.ece
430,2020/02/29,Shanghai lab that first sequenced coronavirus genome shut down,"It was not clear whether the closure was related to the publishing of the sequencing data before the authorities

A Shanghai-based lab — Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health — at Fudan University which was the first to sequence the whole genome of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and publicly share the data on January 11 was shut down on January 12 for “rectification”.

“The centre was not given any specific reasons why the laboratory was closed for rectification. [We have submitted] four reports [asking for permission] to reopen but we have not received any replies,” a source with the Shanghai lab told the South China Morning Post.

It was not clear whether the closure was related to the publishing of the sequencing data before the authorities, adds the newspaper.

Isolating the virus

In the first week of January, Yong-Zhen Zhang’s team from the Shanghai lab in collaboration with handful of institutions isolated the virus from a 41-year-old worker in the seafood market in Wuhan. He was admitted to Wuhan Central Hospital on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.

The genome sequence was posted on an open-access site, virological.org on January 11 and also deposited on GenBank. In a brief note accompanying the genome sequence data, the consortium said that other researchers were “free to download, share, use, and analyse the data”.

First test kits

It was based on this genome sequence data that researchers developed the first test kits to diagnose the virus. On February 3, the collaboration led by Prof. Zhang’s published the findings in a paper in Nature.

According to the newspaper, China’s National Health Commission announced hours after the release by Prof. Zhang’s team that it would share the genome sequence with WHO.

According to the South China Morning Post, the Shanghai centre reported its discovery to the National Health Commission on January 5. The Centre also recommended “relevant prevention and control measures” be taken since the patient from whom the sample was collected had suffered very severe symptoms and the virus resembled the ones previously seen in bats.

The newspaper says that the researchers publicly shared the genome data on January 11 after they realised that the “authorities had taken no obvious action to warn the public about the coronavirus”.

Lack of transparency

Scientists and others worried about China’s lack of transparency after the outbreak started in December 8 were relieved when the genome data was shared. On January 11, Director of Wellcome Trust Jeremy Farrar tweeted saying: “Potentially really important moment in global public health - must be celebrated, everyone involved in Wuhan, in China & beyond acknowledged, thanked & get all the credit. Sharing of data good for public health, great for those who did the work. Just needs those incentives & trust.”",health,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/hch5ob/article30951568.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01TH-SCICHINA,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/shanghai-lab-that-first-sequenced-coronavirus-genome-shut-down/article30951570.ece

432,2020/02/29,Narain’s testing plans take a hit,"The coronavirus epidemic has wrecked havoc on global events across the world including sporting events and India’s first F1 driver Narain Karthikeyan has also been affected by it.

The 43-year-old Indian’s plans for the 2020 season has been hit as pre-season testing events across the world has been affected. Narain has been racing in Japan for the last few years and was racing in the Japanese Super GT Championship last year.

In his debut season in sportscar racing, the Indian was impressive winning the Super GT×DTM Dream Race in addition to a podium. But earlier in January, Narain announced he was pulling out of the championship and is yet to finalise his plans and the recent events have not helped.

Speaking at an event to launch the Usha fans’ new product Racer Chrome fan on Saturday, Narain said, “I am just waiting for options right now whether it is Europe or Japan. For me, Japan is the best. Since coming out of Formula One, I have made a good career there. It suits me really well, I know the format. There are a lot of big manufacturers and the series gets a huge crowd. As the virus is spreading to various countries, a lot of practices are getting cancelled and races are postponed. Let’s see what happens.”

Narain also added that he has some plans to work at the grassroot level to help the next crop of young Indian drivers especially at the go-karting level. “I am hoping to nurture some young talents.

433,2020/02/29,NCBS method to detect virus associated with a rare skin cancer,"Team adapts gene editing tool to detect the presence of Merkel cell polyoma virus in the tumours

A team from National Centre for Biological Sciences, Bengaluru, has developed a diagnostic system to detect the presence of Merkel cell polyomavirus in Merkel cell carcinoma tumours. Merkel cell carcinoma is a rare and aggressive type of skin cancer. The researchers have developed a test using the CRISPR-CAS12 technology that can identify the virus in the tumour and give off a fluorescence to indicate the presence of the virus. This is an important development, both, from the point of view of diagnostics and giving a prognosis for the condition.

Merkel cell carcinoma is associated with old age, excessive exposure to ultraviolet light and a weak immune system.

Crucial association

A virus that is part of the normal skin flora – the Merkel cell polyomavirus – can get integrated in the human genome and undergo a mutation which causes it to promote the cancer. In studies, in about 60-80% of Merkel cell carcinoma patients, the tumours were found to test positive for the virus. It is important to know this from the point of view of targeting treatment as well as for giving a prognosis. Earlier studies have shown that the Merkel cell carcinoma caused by the virus is less aggressive and progresses slower than that caused by excessive exposure to ultraviolet light.

“Our test, though presently in initial stages, combines the exciting new CRISPR technology with diagnostics and viral detection and holds promise for use in clinics [sometime] in the future” says Reety Arora from NCBS in an email to The Hindu. She is the corresponding author of a paper on the work published in Frontiers in Molecular Biosciences.

DETECTR system

The team adapted a system named DETECTR (DNA endonuclease-targeted CRISPR trans reporter) to help them in this endeavour. The system consists of three components: identifier, switch and reporter. The identifier is a “guide RNA” which can recognise and bind to a section of the Merkel cell polyoma virus. The switch is a DNA-cutting enzyme known as Cas-12a which gets attached to the guide RNA after it finds its target DNA. The reporter consists of a single stranded DNA tagged with a fluorescent molecule.

When the guide RNA attaches itself to the viral DNA segment, the attached Cas-12a enzymes get activated and start cutting the “target” virus DNA. They also are enabled to cut up the single-stranded DNA tagged with fluorescent molecule.

This then causes the fluorescent molecules to glow, which can be detected. Also, the strength of the glow depends on the number of activated Cas-12a molecules, which in turn depends on the number of virus DNA copies recognised in the tumour DNA. This therefore gives a measure of the number of viruses in the tumour.

“We tested the amount of MCV DNA that can be detected by our system. And we find that if MCV is present at even femto-moles (10 to the power of minus fifteen moles) we can detect MCV DNA [and thereby diagnose],” says Dr Arora.

“Our future plans include developing this as a diagnostic test and hopefully in a colourimetric format,” she says. A colourimetric test would use an indicator that is visible to the naked eye, hence, it will eliminate the need for a fluorescence reader to see the test results.

“This way, we won’t need any special equipment or training to perform the test and the test will be easy to use in clinics,” she adds.",science,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/ncbs-method-to-detect-virus-associated-with-a-rare-skin-cancer/article30951591.ece
434,2020/02/29,Health outcomes of displaying art in hospitals,"Art creates an atmosphere where patients feel safe, socialise, connect with the world outside

Many hospitals, particularly private and corporate ones, hang attractive pictures and art pieces in their entrance halls and patient waiting rooms. Most people, in fact even some of the owners themselves, think this is just to drum-beat their “class.” In contrast, most if not all, public or government hospitals do nothing of this kind and leave their walls blank or fill them with notices. Their rooms and corridors are hideous. This is true of even prestigious institutes of medical sciences across the country. Given this, it may come as a surprise (even to some of the owners of these hospitals) that displaying art in hospitals, patient waiting rooms and wards is good for patients, doctors, nurses and other caregivers.

A highly cited research report published three years ago by a group of Danish researches (Nielson et al, “How do patients actually experience and use art in hospitals? The significance of interaction: a user-oriented experimental case study”; International Journal of Qualitative Studies on Health and Well-being 2017:12(1) 1267343 shows how patients experience an overall feeling of approachability and care. .

They studied patients confined for a period of several weeks in a common care hall. During the first week, the walls of the hall were bare and blank. Each patient was immersed in his own medical condition, not talking to the others in the hall. On the eighth day, a series of artwork- paintings, pictures and photographs were displayed on the walls of the common care hall. Most of the patients began looking at and studied them, diverted their attention from earlier self-absorption, began analysing and interpreting these exhibits in his own way, started talking to others in the hall and made friends, moving on to non-clinical topics, exchanged critiques and socialised more. They listened to the nurses, doctors and other caregivers with greater attention, and their cure improved!

Safe environment

The researchers conclude that art creates an environment and atmosphere where the patient can feel safe, socialise, maintain connection with the world outside the confines of the hospital and supports their identity. The presence of visual art in hospital contributes to health outcomes. One would expect that this would be particularly true of patients confined to intensive care units where medical instruments are cluttered around.

Now, this study has been done in a European society. Will this work in a place like India and in public and government hospitals? There is no reason why it cannot, but the planning and strategy will have to suit local conditions. People are people: they like to interact, need attention, not just for medical attention, but as persons, sociologically as well.

Towards this, designers, sociologists, and sensitive artists need to get together with the doctors in the hospitals, choose the kind of art display, and the space available. The conditions and the overburdening patient space, the over- worked doctors and caregivers, the local culture and other factors, will have to be budgeted in, but it can be done. And it should be done since, as mentioned above, visual art in a hospital contributes to health outcomes as an extended from of health care.

Helps caregivers

Now, does art in hospitals help the doctors and nurses there? What can they learn from looking at art? Does this help them become better professionals? Indeed so, the book by Ann Sloan Devlin: “Transforming the Doctor’s office: Principles from Evidence- Based Design” offers some clues, and the article by Dr Robert Glatter: “Can studying art help medical students become better doctors?” makes convincing arguments for introducing art as a course for medical students, apart from the usual ones and beyond Gray’s Anatomy. Indeed, this has been introduced in some medical schools and young students have appreciated it and find that it broadens their diagnostic still. One of them remarked: “I have been looking so far at the center of the picture as the main part, but I came to realize that there is a wealth of data on the sides too!”

Given this, our medical colleges can try this and bring a practising artist periodically to come, explain and discuss his/her art work , and invite responses from the students. Such periodic get-togethers, even if not part of the curriculum, will help broaden the minds and help in the skill of how to interpret and get more out of the images from scans obtained from machines. One private medical institute in Hyderabad has put this in practice for its clinical and research fellows and doctors. It has placed paintings and other art pieces in its patient waiting rooms, walls on each floor, children’s care centre, low-vision aid clinics, thus practising and anticipating what the Danish group above has suggested in 2017. It has also set apart a major area of an entire floor dedicated as an art gallery, and invites artists, musicians, writers, NGOs, and similar scholars for lectures and interaction with its doctors and scientists, but also with the interested citizens attending the events.

The tiny freshwater zebrafish, a favourite in aquariums, has now helped researchers understand the neural mechanism involved in fast movement. The fish needs to swim to battle the drift of the streams and the question of how they do this intrigued the researchers from the National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS), Bengaluru.

Speed control

The team, consisting of Urvashi Jha and Vatsala Thirumalai studied a reflexive behaviour called optomotor response in freely swimming zebrafish larvae. They were able to pinpoint how speed was controlled during this behaviour at the level of single nerve cells.

The team evoked the optomotor response in the laboratory by moving black and white bars on a little screen placed under the fish. When fish were placed in normal water, they swam to keep up with the moving bars. However, when drugs that activate dopamine receptors were added to the water, the fish swam much faster and even got ahead of the moving bars. They noticed that the fish swam faster by bending the tail more from side to side. The results were published in Current Biology.

Tail movement is caused by motor neurons sending electrical impulses to the muscle. By recording the electrical activity of single motor neurons, they showed that the increased tail bending was due to dopamine’s direct actions on motor neurons. These results are exciting because they show that motor neurons, which are thought to mostly only relay the command coming to them, are capable of altering the behavioural output.

Ideal model organism

Ms. Jha, the first author of the paper, explains that zebrafish served an ideal model organism as it allowed in-depth studies from the level of behaviour to single neuronal levels. “We have currently studied only the motor neurons, and it would be interesting to see if dopamine affects the properties of other neurons in the spinal cord too. Another follow up study can be to investigate what exact information dopamine is encoding,” she adds.

“We have shown that there is a lot of plasticity within the spinal cord. We now know that even after the brain has issued the command for a movement, changing the properties of motor neurons can alter the final behavioural outcome,” says Prof. Thirumalai.",science,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/w3xpkd/article30951520.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01TH-SCIZEBRAFISH,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/zebrafish-reveal-how-to-run-faster/article30951521.ece
