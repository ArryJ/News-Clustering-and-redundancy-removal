4,['8/02/2020'],A celebration of plurality through music,"The air was electric at the lawns of the Madras Race Club, last weekend. Sufi connoisseurs were not only treated to the likes of Mir Mukhtiyar Ali Madan Gopal Singh and Qawwali legends Warsi Brothers , but were also opened up to Iranian and West African traditional music at the Ruhaniyat music festival.While oud (Arab instrument) met the notes of sarod in Madan Gopal Singh’s piece with Iranian musicians (Mehdi Emami and Saeid Mohammadi), West African musician N’Faly Kouyate’s kora (African string instrument) became one with Mir Mukhtiyar Ali’s Sufiyana. We caught up with the stalwarts backstage in a free-flowing chat about fusion, tradition and the relevance of music in divisive times.We have been part of Ruhaniyat for many years now. There is a kind of celebration of a plurality, which is very singular and a singularity, which is very plural in the festival.I have been associated with Ruhaniyat for the past 10 years and would have collaborated with nearly 10,000 musicians in the process. The crème de la crème among audiences give folk artistes like us much joy to perform.We began the night with Kabir’s composition Anand. The poem is about the arrival of spring and the poet warning the followers to never give up the questioning spirit, which is endangered today. The other song is the Ode To Cosmos, which pays homage to Baba Guru Nanak. The song is about the time he went about travelling the world and began singing at the temple of Puri even without going inside. He was prevented from entering the temple because he was accompanied by a Muslim rubab player. It is a very secular ode. It does not speak about religion, but about the wonderment of the universe.I am a Kabir specialist. And at festivals like these, I get to collaborate with international artistes. There is no difference in the quality of our music or the lyrics. There is no difference in the ragas, too. After listening to the different forms of music, we look for a common thread or a tune and work on the fusion pieces.In Guinea, my country in West Africa, we use music in different parts of our lives. We use the music for spirituality and also use it to bring people together. My songs will tell people to use resources to do good for people.Our music in the festival is a form of our collective resolve to creatively underline the fact that we are singular in a diverse way. One of the other things we underline is the integrated autonomy of instrumentation. That was the larger hallmark of sufism. The interesting thing is our percussionist is Muslim, our sarod player is Hindu, our guitar player is a Christian and I have a turban on my head. This reflects the diversity I was talking about.When I began playing music, the times were different. I would say that it is easy and challenging to be musicians today. You need to be really thoughtful and be in tune with the happenings of the world to be a musician today. Since we travel as musicians, we are affected by the socio-political scenarios in the country today.It is an exciting time. I come from a family of musicians and music, to me, is very personal. But today, the people of the world need to listen to what I call ‘advice music’ because the world is chaotic. We face a lot of problems rising out of both war and people. My intention is to bring the temperature down a little bit with my music.Audiences might not understand the poem that we perform, but they connect to the beats of the music. The music of Iran is very similar to the Indian traditional music as both forms of music has the same scales and moods.Fusion is extremely important. The opportunity to collaborate with international artistes is just unbelievable today. We get to learn about different instruments and voices.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74008016,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1606167/74008016.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/music/a-celebration-of-plurality-through-music/articleshow/74008016.cms

6,['8/02/2020'],Shraddha Kapoor: Things every girl must try from her man’s wardrobe,"The past decade saw several Bollywood divas ditch the girly stuff in their wardrobe and don outfits and accessories inspired by men’s closet. Be it Deepika Padukone or Kareena Kapoor Khan; Kangana Ranaut or Kriti Sanon — all these leading ladies have made a bold style statement with their not-so-girly attires. So, if you’re bored of squeezing yourself into body-hugging dresses and miniskirts or stepping into strappy stilettos, do not fret. There is a lot that you can steal from a man’s wardrobe. Don those comfortably loose denims, sexy waistcoats, belts and bow ties if you want to give a stylish makeover to your closet.Fashion designer Ritu Kumar says, “Nowadays, women are more practical when it comes to selecting stuff for their wardrobe. And the difference between men’s and women’s clothing is, thus, getting blurred. Men’s shirts, for example, are being worn as dresses with belts. It’s all about how you carry it off. Women can choose to wear what they like as long as it goes with their body type and personality.”Adding to it, designer Siddartha Tytler says, “Oversized jackets or blazers cut to a man’s size looks extremely sexy on women. It is trending and looks very cool. For example, a woman wearing a corset with pleated pants and a boyfriend jacket would look very sexy. Boyfriend jeans, too, look cool, especially when paired with a white shirt and a blazer. Women wearing men’s watches also look sexy, as it stands out on their wrist. In fact, men are running out of ideas, while women are having all the fun experimenting with their wardrobes.”Here are a few tips for all the fashionable women out there, who love to experiment with their look...What’s better than pantsuits if you want to give a shot at power dressing.

Glam up your outfit like Shraddha Kapoor with a waistcoat or bow tie.How about flaunting your slender frame with a leather belt that goes perfectly with those fitted trousers or loose denims? Look for trendy buckles to add a feminine touch. Take cue from Kriti Sanon.Pick up a formal shirt (stripes or checks) from the men’s section. Wear it like a shirt dress and pair it with a belt or glam it up with a tie. Add some accessories to look stunning.You can pair sporty shoes with boyfriend jeans, dresses, shorts, saris or even a kurta-pyjama for a flattering look. Take inspiration from Kannada actress Ragini Dwivedi to nail the look.Steal a vest from your man’s wardrobe. Like, Deepika Padukone, tie a knot and pair your vest with shorts or denims.

7,['8/02/2020'],I stayed away from all controversy in the house: Kuri Prathap,"When comedian Kuri Prathap went to participate on Bigg Boss Kannada , audiences were assured of a fun watch, given his famed quick wit. The Mysuru-based actor did not disappoint, his sense of humour and funny repartees being a highlight of the season. Prathap was a fan-favourite of the show, who eventually ended up being the first runner-up. Back home with his family for a short break, amid frequent trips to Bengaluru for interviews about his stint on the show, we caught up with the funny man for a quick chat.“I participated in Bigg Boss Kannada this season because of the confidence my father, Sundresh, instilled in me. In fact, he wanted me to win the show, but I ended up being the runner-up. All credit goes to the fans who voted for me and allowed me to make it to the finale,” says Prathap.‘I did not want anything to tarnish my image’“Once I decided to be a part of the show, I told myself that no matter what, I should not tarnish my image because of something I say or do in the house. I am already a known name as a comedian, so, it was important that I don’t get involved in any controversy. I had made up mind not to pick fights with anyone in the house. In fact, Swetha Chengappa, who was with me on Majaa Talkies, told me to just be myself on the show, which helped me go a long way. Of course, there were moments when I lost my temper in the heat of the moment during the tasks. On the whole, though, I am very happy with what I have achieved from the show,” says Prathap.‘We had so little to eat that all of us were angry’The first few days in the house, though, were not very easy for the comic. “On the show, you need to spend time with contestants, all of who have different mind sets and hail from varied social backgrounds. Adjusting to this atmosphere was not easy, but after a few weeks, I got used to it. The problem, I think, is also that most contestants got angry easily because all of us were on rations and had very little to eat during the stay in the house,” adds Prathap.‘I found a best friend in Priyanka’“Priyanka is a nice girl. I first met her in the house. We used to spend most of the time together. She used to give her food to me, as the ration we got was not enough for all of us. Also, she was the most straight-forward contestant, who would say whatever she felt openly. Raju Talikote was also a big support on the show. I have known him for a decade and his encouragement really helped me push myself during the tasks,” he says.‘I lost 15 kilos on the show’“It is not unusual for contestants on Bigg Boss Kannada to lose weight, given how little we are allowed to eat at some stages of the show. When I entered the house, I weighed 95 kilos and after 100 days on the show, I am 15 kilos lighter. I am a big-time foodie and not being able to eat to my satisfaction was a big issue on the show,” says Prathap.‘It’s back to movies now’“I have few pending film projects, like Yuvarathnaa, Bhajrangi 2, Mysore Sandal and Pogaru, which I will complete now. I will continue to act as a comedian, which is my forte,” he sums up.",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74009476,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1016320/74009476.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/kannada/i-stayed-away-from-all-controversy-in-the-house-kuri-prathap/articleshow/74009476.cms

Yes, Gautham has rapped for Takkar , starring Siddharth in the lead, and the song will also feature Sid Sriram’s vocals.Gautham tells us that he was sceptical about pulling off the number. “I just kept asking the team if they were sure they wanted me to do it. It’s a lovely song and my portion comes in the middle. It’s a nice breakaway from Sid’s voice. The lines were interesting but it took me some time to work my way around the lyrics,” he says. Karthik G Krish (of Kappal fame), who’s directing the film, says, “It was Nivas’s (composer Nivas K Prasanna) idea to rope in GVM sir. He heard all the songs in our album first and said they were very energetic. And then, Nivas rapped the portion he wanted Gautham to rap. The song is called Nira and the rap portions go — Nodigal thavi odum mutkalodu sandai ittu… Ku Karthik has penned the lyrics. Avaru romba pudichu paadinaru. In fact, he first sang it for us, and then, practised the lyrics and recorded it. He’s also given the voice over, which will appear in the song’s video.”Though Gautham admits he enjoys singing, he says it’s never easy. “I like singing, but never when a way better singer like Sid is there,” he says with a laugh.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74008066,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-884714/74008066.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/music/gautham-menon-raps-for-siddharths-film/articleshow/74008066.cms

12,['8/02/2020'],Ahmedabad court issues arrest warrant against Hardik Patel,"This story is from February 8, 2020

Hardik Patel

AHMEDABAD: A city sessions court once again issued an arrest warrant against Congress leader and former convenor of the Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS) Hardik Patel for skipping court proceeding in a sedition case on Friday.

The court issued the non-bailable warrant for the second occasion in 20 days with the observation that the court had granted bail upon arrest on the issuance of such an arrest warrant on January 18 on condition that Patel must not skip court proceedings.

Hardik has continued to remain absent and therefore he cannot get any legal protection, the court said while issuing a warrant against him and rejecting his application seeking exemption from appearance in the court on Friday.

Before issuance of the warrant, Patel’s advocate had tendered an application for exemption from remaining present in the court saying that Patel is fearing an arrest in a 2015 case for violence that took place at the GMDC ground.

The police intend to harass him and if he comes to attend a court proceeding, he might get arrested. His application for anticipatory bail is pending in the Gujarat high court, which is to hear it on February 12.

Public prosecutor Sudhir Brahmbhatt vehemently opposed Patel’s request and submitted that he has been violating the bail condition frequently. He was taken in judicial custody last month for his continued absence during the trial and was released upon his assurance that he would not seek any adjournment and exemption in future.

Earlier, a city sessions court refused to grant pre-arrest bail to Patel in connection with the FIR about the GMDC ground violence, which took place on August 25, 2015 evening.

14,['8/02/2020'],Chilly treats for Delhi: Ice cream sales go up by 40% this winter,"On a chilly, foggy winter morning, one would assume that Delhiites would prefer a piping hot cup of tea or coffee. But, believe it or not, ice cream seems to be quite popular too. While traditionally seen as a summer favourite, ice creams have always sold moderately well during the Delhi winters. This winter, however, as the mercury plummeted to record lows – giving the capital its coldest winter in decades – the sales of ice cream across vendors and shops in Delhi reached record highs. At India Gate, over two dozen ice cream vendors set up shop every day. Mukesh, who parks his cart near the Rajpath crossing, tells us, “Usually our sales are lowest during peak winters in December and January. But this year, they were higher than the months before them. Kuch din toh raat hone se pehle hi stocks khatm ho jaa rahe thay.” Most vendors say that in December and January, their sales increased by 40-50%, and on some days, it was even double compared to the same time last year. The increased sales, on days, even approach the peak sales of summers.“Summer sales are much higher than winter sales, but this season, on some days, the demand was as high as in May-June. We were surprised at the demand of ice cream, particularly on the coldest days. There was high demand even on foggy days. Last year, the sales were half of this even though it wasn’t as cold,” says Arun Sharma, a vendor in Noida.When it comes to their favourite winter ice cream, sellers tell us that Delhi prefers both cones and cups in equal measures. However, milk-based ice creams tend to sell more than the ice lollies in winters. Ratnesh, a vendor at India Gate, says, “Summers are usually more about ice candies while winters see maximum sale of the milk-based ice creams. Chocolate is a favourite year round.”An interesting thing vendors say is the change in Delhiites’ ice creams choices based on the season. Qasim, who sets up shop in Chanakyapuri, says, “People buy costlier flavours and are willing to try newer things in winters. In the summers, most people usually prefer orange bars or chocolate ice creams only. It’s only families that go for the more expensive ones. But in winters, even youngsters try newer things.”Delhiites say that ice cream serves as a comfort food for them and the weather does not play a role in their choice. We meet Ankit Kumar and his family at India Gate on a particularly chilly January evening, and he tells us, “People have hot snacks in the summers too. So why can’t one have ice cream in winters? In fact, when it is really cold, there is nothing better than ice cream.” Some say that because of the cold, they prefer buying ice cream and taking it home instead of standing by the cart and having it, but they do not give up on having ice cream. Others have more practical reasons for eating ice creams during peak winters. Geetika Singh, a south Delhi resident, tells us, “I actually prefer eating ice cream in winters as compared to summers. It doesn’t melt as quickly first of all and I once read a research that it is safer to have cold food in winters because the temperature difference is not so much.”A group of youngsters enjoys ice cream on a cold winter day at India Gate",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74006687,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-354680/74006687.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/chilly-treats-for-delhi-ice-cream-sales-go-up-by-40-this-winter/articleshow/74006687.cms

What popular singer Arijit Singh does with this poignant love song is remarkable as he takes it to another level.The ease with which he works the pitch, navigates the tune and vocalise the words is effortless. Pritam has used his biggest asset, the singer, in the best possible way in this song, apart from making the most of the slow rock vibe that he has created for this.Irshad’s simple words, ‘Jo tum na ho, rahenge hum nahi, na chahiye kuch tunse jyada tumse kam nahi’, add to the beauty of this love song.A decade back’s release, 'Twist', co-composed by Pritam and Style Bhai, and sung fabulously by Neeraj Sridhar , seems to have been the inspiration for the next song. 'Haan Main Galat' is a new track that has its own character and personality, though it does have traces of the earlier hit.

While his fans rave about his acting talent, the actor rarely misses a chance to display his impeccable sense of style and fashion. His social media timeline in 2019 evidences that. When we met him recently, we asked him who his fashion inspirations are. And, Rajkummar replied, “I admire Satyajit Ray for his simplicity and aura. I’ve been an ardent follower of his work and a huge fan. Shah Rukh Khan comes a close second. Everyone loves him, but I can bet that I love him more than anyone else. I admire everything he does and the way he does it. If I had to look abroad, then I’d say Ryan Gosling .

18,['8/02/2020'],#UpcycleYourVehicle: A moving exhibition in Greater Noida,"Ain’t this cool? Artists say that they have organised this exhibition to encourage people across NCR to upcycle their old cars





The ongoing Auto Expo in Greater Noida is attracting not just automobile lovers, but eco-conscious Delhiites and art connoisseurs, too, who are going gaga over painted cars and items created from upcycled car parts. The exhibition titled ‘It Used To Be My Car’ is organised by Cartist , a group of artists who give makeover to vehicles. The artists say that they’ve organised this exhibition to encourage people across NCR to upcycle their old cars. While the concept of creating furniture with old car parts isn’t new, it’s the first time when artists have put up this exhibition at the Auto Expo. Himanshu Jangid from Cartist told us, “We have been promoting art through automobiles for years, but this is the first time when we have put up our exhibition on the sustainable theme. We want to tell Delhiites that change starts with you. All they need is some sense of design, and they can do it at home, plus we’re here to help.”Most of the furniture and decor items are created with seats, tyres and shocker springs of old cars. For lamps, wheel disc and connecting rod of a car engine have been used. Sneha Sivakumar, a visitor at the expo, said, “I would love to paint my father’s old car, but restoration is burdensome and maintenance becomes an issue. After discussing with artists, I realised that it’s a better idea to turn your car into a pool table or office desk than just dumping it someday.”",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74007977,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-340713/74007977.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/events/noida/upcycleyourvehicle-a-moving-exhibition-in-greater-noida/articleshow/74007904.cms
19,['8/02/2020'],"Swap, rent, borrow: Use books wisely, be a sustainable reader","With global average of paper consumption reaching 55kg of paper per person per year, it is high time we start asking each other ‘How are you reading?’ instead of ‘What are you reading?’. Be it sharing your books with a friend or switching to e-books, there are a number of ways how you can practice sustainability even in your reading habits.An avid reader can boast of an overstuffed bookshelf, in which many books may not have been read. However, if you aim to be a sustainable reader, don’t shy away from borrowing a book that you want to read or share the ones you have already read. “I avoid buying new books and discourage my kids as well. I spread a word among my neighbours if my son wants to read a particular book. If someone has it, I borrow from them and return,” says Neha Puri, a clinical hypnotherapist from Delhi who practices sustainability in her daily life. Neha adds that she has a collection of comics and children’s books which she shares with others. “I have over 20 storytelling books as old as 10 years old which my children have outgrown. Instead of giving away to the kabaadiwala, I spread the word in my neighbourhood if anyone wanted them, and there have been a lot of takers,” she says.From Daryaganj’s Sunday book market to a local book stall, second-hand books are readily available in the city, for a reader to read while being sustainable. “I always buy second-hand books. After reading, we can give the book back and buy a new one. The bookseller charges Rs150 for the book for the first time. If we return it and get a new one, he only charges `100, encouraging people to use and return the book,” says Vasvi Sateja, a 22-year-old resident of Sector 14, Gurgaon.You could also barter and exchange a book in return for a book you want to read. Gurgaon resident Upasna Mahtani Luthra, who runs the Gurgaon Moms Book Club which has 4,500 members, says, “All members meet once a month to discuss their latest reads. During this time, many members also exchange their books with others so as to promote sustainable reading.” Another way to swap or exchange books is by forming a group or chain of readers, using one book for many readers. “I am part of this chain of 11 people, where we all buy just one book, which we all share in turns. Each person has to complete the book within seven days and pass it on to the next person in the chain,” says Abhinav Malhotra, a Preet Vihar resident. While the good ol’ library visits may seem like a thing of the past, a book lover can be sustainable by joining their local library. However, not all residential areas have libraries, and in such cases, residents have started their own library to provide people with books. Says Gurgaon resident Rachna Gupta, a homemaker, “I started my library, Kitaabon Se Rishta, in 2018. I began with my childrens’ old books, and soon, friends and people from my condominium donated their old books. My library caters to children of upto 16 years.”Noida resident Neha Gupta, a doctor, runs an online library portal from where people can rent and return children’s storybooks. “Through the portal, you can rent a book and it will be delivered at your doorstep. After you are done, it can be returned through the same channel,” she says. Social worker Radhika Gulati is a member of the Delhi Gymkhana Club and often borrows books from the library there. “I love books, but also make sure to practice sustainability. I avoid buying new books and go to the library instead. The books can be re-issued online, so the process is hassle-free,” says Radhika, who lives in Noida.Did you know that an e-book can displace the purchase of 22.5 physical books? This could help avoid deforestation, as according to a report, 30 million trees are cut down annually for books sold in the US. “Since the past five years, I have stopped buying newspapers. I access news online as newspapers are only usable for a day and then end up in the trash,” says Upasna Sahney, who lives in Noida. Noida resident Supriya Sardana shares, “I avoid buying physical books, and it has been years since I switched to e-books as it was more sustainable. My daughter, too, refers to an online platform to read books where one can browse different genres of unpublished books as well.” Reading a book that has already been read by someone else brings a sense of comfort to many book enthusiasts, and adding on to this is Mayur Vihar resident Shruti Sharma, who founded Books On The Delhi Metro three years ago. “We leave books at various stations of the Delhi Metro and post about it. People are free to pick up these books and take them home. Some people return these books, while some keep them. This way, our books, which are either second-hand or received through donations, are read many times,” she tells us.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74008253,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-307292/74008253.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/books/features/swap-rent-borrow-use-books-wisely-be-a-sustainable-reader/articleshow/74008150.cms

29,['8/02/2020'],Terence Lewis: Excited to be back as a judge as I want to see what the millennials have to offer,"For someone like Terence Lewis , who once was a regular face on dance reality shows, an eight-year hiatus seems like a long time. “It was a long time, but since I was doing a lot of work outside India, these eight years passed by quickly,” says the choreographer, who will be back as a judge in India’s Best Dancer.The choreographer and dance reality show judge prefers calling his eight-year break from reality shows a “much-required sabbatical”. He says, “I think everyone reaches a saturation point when they keep doing the same thing for a long time. I just needed a break from what I was doing. My eyes were tired of watching the same thing over and over again. Also, I wasn’t coming across anything fresh or new. I am extremely excited to be back after eight years because I really want to see what millennials have to offer and how much has dance evolved.”Terence adds that he was also looking to make a comeback with a show that focuses on dance and not entertainment. “I am very clear that this time I am looking forward to seeing dance forms and not acrobatics. There are formats (and shows) that look for a performer, but I think in a dance reality show, I should get to see beyond just purely entertaining performances, I need to see dancing talent as well. Even eight years ago this is what I was focused on. I am so happy to see that contestants who came from dance reality shows are doing such great work. Kruti Mahesh , who won the National Award for Ghoomar , got a platform from dance reality shows. There are so many other successful names like Raghav Juyal Punit Pathak . It is so good to see the kind of work they are doing and how they didn’t just earn a name and fame, but also created their identities after being part of reality shows,” he says proudly.One change that he really hopes to see in dance reality shows? “I do not want to hear any more sob stories. I really don’t want to have more stories about ‘ maa ka sapna’, and ‘ main kitni gareebi se aaya hu’. I am definitely sensitive and can listen to their stories and cry with them, but if someone thinks that he/she would be rated above a genuinely talented person on the basis of their background, that’s not going to happen. If one happens to come from a certain background and is also talented as a dancer, works hard to improve his skills, that person should definitely not be judged as a lesser deserving contestant than others on the show.”",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74004915,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-50025/74004915.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/hindi/terence-lewis-excited-to-be-back-as-a-judge-as-i-want-to-see-what-the-millennials-have-to-offer/articleshow/74004826.cms
30,['8/02/2020'],Poonam Pandey files criminal case against Raj Kundra & associates,"Over the past six months, life has become a nightmare for Poonam Pandey . The actress alleges that she has been inundated with calls — at odd hours — from across India and even Karachi, requesting her to strip. It all began in June last year, says Poonam, when her number, along with the tagline, ‘Call me, I will strip for you’, was leaked on her app. According to the actress, her app was managed by Raj Kundra ’s company, as she had entered in an agreement with them in March 2019. However, Poonam claims that she terminated it a month later. She has now accused them of continuing with the app, in spite of her terminating the contract, and also releasing her personal number on it, which has resulted in her being hounded with numerous calls. Poonam has now moved Bombay High Court to file a criminal case against Kundra and his associates, who collaborated with her for the app. However, Kundra told BT that he had exited the company (which managed the app) in December 2019.When BT spoke to Poonam on this matter, she said, “I collaborated with the company for an app named after me in March 2019. We had agreed upon a certain percentage of the revenue generated by the app to be given to me. However, I realised certain discrepancies in revenue sharing and hence, decided to terminate the contract. I also informed them about the same via an email. All hell has broken loose since. They continue to post my pictures and videos on the app. To my horror, they also leaked my personal mobile number along with messages like ‘Call me now as I am free to talk’ and ‘Call me now. Let us talk and I will strip for you’ on the app. After that, I started receiving calls from all over, not in dozens but thousands, at odd hours, asking me for explicit services. People started sending me pornographic images and videos. I even left the country for three months hoping that the situation will become normal on its own. However, as soon as I landed back, I started receiving calls and obscene messages all over again. Sometimes, I would get calls where I could only hear heavy breathing from the other side. These callers claim to know my address, too. I changed my number, but after I messaged Saurabh Kushwah (one of the associates of the app company, who is one of the accused) from my new number, asking him to refrain from uploading my pictures and videos on the app, I started receiving calls and messages on that number, too.”The actress said that she approached the police in December 2019. “My statement was recorded on December 7, 2019, at Bandra police station. Since they refused to lodge an FIR against Raj Kundra and his team, I had no option, but to move Bombay High Court. I have filed a writ petition — a criminal case — against Raj Kundra, his associate Saurabh Kushwah and my former manager Sonu Lakhwani. I will approach the cyber-crime cell, too. I am going through this nightmare just because I refused to work with them. I am living under constant threats of abduction, rape, murder and acid attack. My right to live and privacy has been affected. Just because I am Poonam Pandey, you can’t subject me to this treatment. I am what I am in my world. People can call me controversy’s favourite. I don't have a problem with that, but you can’t disrespect me and threaten my existence,” she said.Poonam's lawyer Anand S Jondhale said, “The police didn’t cooperate with her. So, around a month ago, we moved court and filed a petition for registration of an FIR against them and for due compensation for the mental agony caused. We have also served the notice to the accused through the court.”Meanwhile, Saurabh Kushwah has filed a statement at Bandra police station, stating that the breach was in fact from Poonam’s side and the company wasn’t too pleased with the content uploaded by her on the app, as they were obscene, erotic and objectionable. They have also claimed that it was their decision to terminate the contract. They have denied all allegations levelled against them by Poonam, including that of leaking her number on the app.When contacted, Saurabh said, “These allegations are false and baseless. We have not yet received any legal notice or petition from the court, so we will not be able to comment on it. We have cooperated with the authorities concerned and provided all required details. We will follow the due process of law and take steps accordingly.”Raj Kundra said, “I had invested in a company called Armsprime Media last year, which makes apps for celebrities. I am not aware of the petition as I exited the venture in December 2019 with a sale to the current shareholders.”Lawyer Thakur Arjun Singh, who represents Armsprime Media, stated, “We have just learnt that Poonam has filed a petition in Bombay High Court. We haven’t been served a copy of it, yet. The matter has neither been listed nor heard. We will deal with it once we receive a copy of the petition. As far as her allegations are concerned, there is no substance in them. She has been paid in excess — an amount of `60 lakh — as per the agreement in accordance of the revenue share. Just because Raj is an investor in Armsprine, she is trying to extort money by misusing criminal law. She has a civil remedy available if she feels there is a discrepancy in payments but dragging everyone in a criminal case is malicious and mischievous.”",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74012222,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-73079/74012222.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/poonam-pandey-files-criminal-case-against-raj-kundra-associates/articleshow/74012151.cms

A group of youngsters enjoys ice cream on a cold winter day at India Gate

On a chilly, foggy winter morning, one would assume that Delhiites would prefer a piping hot cup of tea or coffee. But, believe it or not, ice cream seems to be quite popular too. While traditionally seen as a summer favourite, ice creams have always sold moderately well during the Delhi winters . This winter, however, as the mercury plummeted to record lows – giving the capital its coldest winter in decades – the sales of ice cream across vendors and shops in Delhi reached record highs.At India Gate, over two dozen ice cream vendors set up shop every day. Mukesh, who parks his cart near the Rajpath crossing, tells us, “Usually our sales are lowest during peak winters in December and January. But this year, they were higher than the months before them.stocks.” Most vendors say that in December and January, their sales increased by 40-50%, and on some days, it was even double compared to the same time last year. The increased sales, on days, even approach the peak sales of summers .“Summer sales are much higher than winter sales, but this season, on some days, the demand was as high as in May-June. We were surprised at the demand of ice cream, particularly on the coldest days. There was high demand even on foggy days. Last year, the sales were half of this even though it wasn’t as cold,” says Arun Sharma, a vendor in Noida.When it comes to their favourite winter ice cream, sellers tell us that Delhi prefers both cones and cups in equal measures. However, milk-based ice creams tend to sell more than the ice lollies in winters. Ratnesh, a vendor at India Gate, says, “Summers are usually more about ice candies while winters see maximum sale of the milk-based ice creams. Chocolate is a favourite year round.” An interesting thing vendors say is the change in Delhiites’ ice creams choices based on the season. Qasim, who sets up shop in Chanakyapuri, says, “People buy costlier flavours and are willing to try newer things in winters. In the summers, most people usually prefer orange bars or chocolate ice creams only. It’s only families that go for the more expensive ones. But in winters, even youngsters try newer things.”Delhiites say that ice cream serves as a comfort food for them and the weather does not play a role in their choice. We meet Ankit Kumar and his family at India Gate on a particularly chilly January evening, and he tells us, “People have hot snacks in the summers too. So why can’t one have ice cream in winters? In fact, when it is really cold, there is nothing better than ice cream.” Some say that because of the cold, they prefer buying ice cream and taking it home instead of standing by the cart and having it, but they do not give up on having ice cream. Others have more practical reasons for eating ice creams during peak winters. Geetika Singh, a south Delhi resident, tells us, “I actually prefer eating ice cream in winters as compared to summers. It doesn’t melt as quickly first of all and I once read a research that it is safer to have cold food in winters because the temperature difference is not so much.”",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74007604,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-354680,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/chilly-treats-for-delhi-ice-cream-sales-go-up-by-40-this-winter/articleshow/74007399.cms

INDORE: The high court of Bombay at Goa has upheld the life imprisonment and fines of two accused, who were convicted by the Goa Children’s Court, for kidnapping and abusing an 11-year-old boy with learning disabilities and demanding a ransom of Rs 20 lakhs in 2011.

The court found that the boy’s testimony with details of the events that transpired inspired confidence and was sufficient to bring home the charges against the two.

The prosecution lead by additional public prosecutor Pravin Faldessai proved the case beyond a reasonable doubt, the court noted.

The two accused were sentenced to life imprisonment and fined Rs 1 lakh each in 2017. They appealed against the conviction to the high court in 2018.

The two men entered into a conspiracy and kidnapped the minor boy with learning difficulties at 1.15pm outside the gate of the school and made phone calls to his father and uncle demanding ransom of Rs 20 lakh failing which they threatened to kill the boy. They drove the boy in a van before he was rescued around 6.30pm by the police.

JAIPUR: A 17-year-old Kashmiri boy, who worked at a catering firm in Jaipur, died after allegedly being beaten by his colleague over a petty issue, police said on Friday. An investigation into the incident was launched and the accused arrested, the police said.

Basit, a resident of Jammu and Kashmir's Kupwara, was thrashed by the accused, Aditya (24), while they were returning home from a wedding in a pick-up van on Wednesday night, said Jaipur Police Commissioner Anand Srivastava .

An argument broke out between the two after Aditya stopped Basit from tapping the windowpane of the vehicle. Aditya then thrashed Basit but other employees intervened and the two returned to their seats, the officer said.

Basit reached his rented accommodation and complained of vomiting and his friends took him to SMS hospital in the morning, the commissioner said.

Doctors performed surgery to treat Basit, but he showed no signs of improvement and died on Thursday night, the officer said.

The body was handed over to family members after a post-mortem and they have left for Kashmir, he said.",jaipur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74017267,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-102729,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/kashmiri-boy-beaten-to-death-by-colleague-in-jaipur/articleshow/74017252.cms

File photo

LONDON: Former billionaire Anil Ambani , once the sixth richest man in the world, declared to a UK court on Friday his “net worth was zero” and that he was bankrupt.

Three Chinese banks — Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd (ICBC), China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of China — are suing Ambani in the high court here for more than $700 million (over Rs 5,000 crore) , including interest, for defaulting on a loan they gave Reliance Communications (RCom) — now in insolvency proceedings — in February 2012, which RCom defaulted on. The banks claim Ambani provided a personal guarantee for the loan, but Ambani disputes this.

Ambani narrowly avoided a summary judgment against him in December 2019 when Justice Waksman said his evidence was “inexplicably incomplete, implausible and highly unlikely”.

At Friday’s hearing, at which Ambani’s son Anmol was present, the banks asked the court to make a conditional order requiring him to pay into court $656 million (about Rs 4,690 crore) ahead of the trial. But the judge decided that he must pay $100 million (Rs 715 crore) into court.

Justice Waksman heavily criticised Ambani’s statements, saying they were packed with “falsehoods” and that Ambani had “clearly lied”. He said Ambani had put a misleading spin on his brother’s role in bailing him out last year and also spoke of “irregular corporate activities” within the Reliance group.

“He clearly has more assets or income than he is letting on. The family members can and will in my view assist and bearing in mind what they can afford, $100 million must be paid into court,” Waksman said. “It would be absurd if Mukesh said he could not afford to lend the money given the size of his fortune. This is an extremely wealthy family who have helped each other in the past. I don’t accept his own available assets are as limited as he says.”

Ambani told the commercial court he would be “unable to raise any finance from external sources” to comply with any conditional order, despite being the brother of Mukesh Ambani, the richest man in Asia, who the court heard had wealth estimated at $55 billion to $57 billion (Rs 3,93,000 crore to Rs 4,07,000 crore). He claimed that because of the loss of his telecom empire, he was completely broke and insolvent.

Justice Waksman said: “On your case he is bankrupt. Has he filed for bankruptcy in India? Has anyone done a search? I would expect someone to have done so. I want to find out what is going on.”

To which Robert Howe QC, representing Ambani, alongside Harish Salve QC, replied: “No, he has not. They have just recently introduced bankruptcy laws in India. It is unhelpful to give expert evidence at this point as there is Union law and provincial law in India.”

The court heard that a change in government policy in 2012 “led to the exit of all major players in the market and a new entry to industry which others found difficult to compete with”. This led to RCom closing down in 2017.

Ambani claimed he had a personal deficit of $305 million (Rs 2,181 crore) and that his net worth had collapsed from more than $7 billion (about Rs 50,000 crore) in March 2012 to zero in December 2019.

In a witness statement Ambani told the court: “The current value of my shareholdings is down to approximately $82.4 million (approximately Rs 589 crore) and my net worth is zero after taking into account my liabilities. In summary, I do not hold any meaningful assets which can be liquidated.”

Bankim Thanki QC, representing the banks, pointed out there was “a dichotomy” between Ambani’s claims of poverty and his lavish lifestyle consisting of a $3 million (Rs 21.4 crore) fleet of luxury cars, a luxury yacht named Tian now worth $56 million (Rs 400 crore) which he had gifted his wife, a Bombardier private jet and helicopter.

“One is bound to ask why he can’t arrange for his companies to sell those assets and use the funds to pay the courts,” Waksman said.

Thanki said Ambani was living on two floors of Seawind, the 17-storey property in Cuffe Parade, Mumbai, “that is thought to be wholly owned by the Ambani family, albeit via investment entities and/or shell companies”.

Thanki argued that Ambani’s brother Mukesh, mother Kokila, wife Tina and sons Anshul and Anmol were all extremely wealthy, that his business interests were closely interwoven with the Ambani business empire, and that they were all in a position to give him financial assistance.

Ambani’s statement of net worth submitted to the court showed he had received substantial personal loans, totalling $113.88 million (Rs 814 crore), from his mother Kokila and son Anmol. Thanki said there was evidence of Mukesh coming to his brother’s rescue last year when Ambani faced three months’ imprisonment for contempt of court in proceedings against RCom by Ericsson in the Supreme Court of India. But Ambani argued it was a “corporate transaction” which Waksman determined was a “misleading spin”.

“It remains unclear how he is funding his $700,000 (approximately Rs 5 crore) legal fees in these proceedings,” Thanki also said.

Ambani, in his evidence, said that his cars, jet and helicopter and yacht were held by corporate entities rather than him personally and that he paid his legal fees “out of his current year income”.

Thanki criticised Ambani’s statement in which he had repeatedly said, in respect of different family members: “Enquiries made but no loan can be availed from there.”

Thanki said: “This is obviously deliberately vague. Who asked, whom did they ask and what was the nature of the enquiry and what was the response. Repetition of language ‘no loan can be availed’ is not the same as ‘they can’t provide assistance with the conditional payment the court wants’.”

Howe responded: “It is an Indian providing this document and the use of English in India is different.” He added, “His lifestyle doesn’t share evidential light on whether he has ready access to hundreds of millions of dollars. There is no giant pot of gold he can pull $1 million from, let alone $10 million. The sums involved are very large. You can’t expect a friend or relative to do this.”

NEW DELHI: A total of 138 Indians — 132 crew members and six passengers — are among the 3,700 odd passengers and crew members onboard Japanese cruise liner Diamond Princess that is quarantined at Yokohama, Japan , for the past few days due to the coronavirus fear. So far 63 people on board — none of them Indians — have tested positive for coronavirus and have been moved to hospitals.Princess Cruises, the operator of this cruise ship, said Diamond Princess went out to sea at 9am (Japan time) Saturday, “to perform normal marine operations, including the production of fresh water. The ship will be at sea for about 24 hours.Public health authorities have approved the ship’s protocol to service rooms, (which) will take place while guests are outside their staterooms for scheduled fresh air periods. During these scheduled periods, two crew members will conduct a thorough cleaning of the staterooms, including fresh linens and towels.”The Japanese health ministry of Health “has been the lead public health authority defining the testing protocols for all guests and crew on Diamond Princess. Questions on the timeline, test results and reporting protocols should be directed to them. The quarantine end date remains at February 19, unless there are any unforeseen developments,” the cruise operator added.This ship is currently believed to be the largest known cluster of coronavirus infection outside China. “We are very appreciative of the Japanese government for moving proactively to provide the ship additional medical professionals and 7,000 protective face masks. Those resources include 16 doctors plus 12 additional personnel which includes teams of nurses and clerks,” the Princess Cruises statement added.An 80-year-old person disembarked from this ship after spending five days in it, in Hong Kong on January 25 and had tested positive for coronavirus later. The ship was quarantined when it returned to Yokohama port this Monday.First 20 people on board tested positive, followed by 41 more later. Passengers have been given thermometers and asked to alert crew if temperature rises beyond 99.6 degrees Fahrenheit.Public spaces on the ship have been shut down and people onbard have to spend their time mainly in their cabins. Princess Cruises says there were 2,666 guests and 1,045 crew currently onboard covering a range of nationalities, and almost half the guests onboard are Japanese.“During the remainder of the time onboard, guests will continue to be provided complimentary internet and telephone service to stay in contact with their family and loved ones. In addition, we have added additional live TV channels and a large selection of in-room movies available in multiple languages. The cruise activities staff is packaging games, puzzles and trivia and delivering them to guest staterooms,” the cruise operator said on Friday.The people onboard Diamond Princess aren’t the only ones left in virtually floating-infected prisons in Asia. A cruise ship, World Dream, is in quarantine in Hong King since Wednesday after eight passengers tested positive. And another ship, Westerdam, is struggling to find a place to port after being refused docking by both Taiwan and Japan.channels and a large selection of in-room movies available in multiple languages.

NEW DELHI: It is criminally sinful to execute the condemned convicts when the law permits them to live, a Delhi court said on Friday while dismissing a plea of the Tihar Jail authorities for a new date and time of hanging for the four death-row convicts in the Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case.In the light of Delhi high court’s direction granting the convicts a week’s time to exhaust their remaining legal remedies, the court called Tihar’s plea “premature”. “Admittedly, Delhi high court, by an order on February 5, 2020, permitted the convicts in the interest of justice to exercise their legal remedies within a week of the order,” said additional sessions judge Dharmender Rana.Finding substance in the submissions of amicus curiae Vrinda Grover and Soutik Banerjee appearing for convict Mukesh Singh, the court noted that the date for execution couldn’t be fixed merely on the basis of surmises and conjectures. The application “is premature and, therefore, deserves to be dismissed. However, the state is at liberty to move an appropriate application as and when required”, it held.Grover argued the high court had allowed not one but all four convicts to resort to their available legal remedies. Special prosecutor Irfan Ahmed, appearing for the jail authorities, earlier claimed there was no legal impediment to a new date.Appearing for the victim’s family, advocates Jitender Kumar Jha and Seema Kushwaha supported the prosecutor’s submissions and said not fixing a date would unjustifiably delay the hanging.Appearing for the other convicts, Pawan Gupta, Akshay Thakur and Vinay Sharma, advocate A P Singh stressed they deserved protection under Article 21 of the Constitution till their last breath. The Supreme Court has neither stayed nor passed any direction over the trial court’s order postponing the hanging, he added.While dismissing the Centre’s plea challenging the order, the high court had said all of them would have to be executed together.In Video: Nirbhaya case: All convicts will be hanged together, says Delhi HC",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74017711,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-102688,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/criminally-sinful-to-hang-convicts-at-this-point-court/articleshow/74016774.cms
41,['8/02/2020'],Won’t allow outsiders to settle in Assam: PM Modi,"This story is from February 8, 2020

KOKRAJHAR: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday sought to mollify Assam’s worry that changes in the Citizenship Act will result in an influx of more outsiders to the state, and cautioned people against “certain sections” trying to mislead them.

“Certain sections of society are trying to mislead the people of Assam and north-east over the Act. Rumours are being spread that outsiders will be allowed to settle in Assam, but this is not correct. I am here to assure all that anti-As sam and anti-national mentality won’t be tolerated and no outsider will be allowed to settle in the region,” the PM said on his first visit to Assam after passage of the Citizens hip Amendment Act ( CAA ). Modi had to twice abort his plan to visit Assam because of the anti-CAA stir.

Protesters feared that the new citizenship law would facilitate the entry of more outsiders into the state which has seen its demography transformed because of illegal infiltration from Bangladesh. PM Modi also promised that his government would take measures to safeguard the language, identity and culture of Assam’s indigenous people. “The government is now trying to implement Clause 6 of the Assam Accord. I promise that after the committee submits its report, the Centre will act on it swiftly,” he added.

Modi was addressing a big rally to mark the signing of the Bodo Accord, which resulted in all the militant Bodo groups dropping the demand for creation of a separate state of Bodoland by hiving off Bodo-dominated districts of Assam.

The visit, however, acquired significance because of the Centre’s anxiety to wean away anti-CAA protesters in the state from the larger agitation playing out in the rest of the country. Promises made by Modi were part of the efforts that have so far seen the Centre reaching out to people of the state by declaring Assamese to be the sole official language and getting the Bodos to recognise the state’s territorial integrity. The outreach has helped soften the intensity of the resistance. The All Assam Students Union, which has been spearheading protests against CAA and had declared the state off limits for the PM, did not issue a bandh call when he arrived on Friday.

Aasu general secretary Lurinjyoti Gogoi termed the decision a goodwill gesture. “The PM is coming for their (Bodos) celebration. The sentiments and emotions of the Bodo people are attached to this and we do not think we should destroy our society and strong bond of brotherhood by protesting,” he said.

The Oboro Surakha Samity, a non-Bodo organisation opposing the accord, also withdrew its bandh call following assurance of a meeting with the PM. Modi met their representatives at Guwahati airport and promised them that the Centre would hold discussions with them later this month. Hailing the Bodo Accord that ended one of the biggest separatist campaigns in the country, Modi said, “Insurgency in the Northeast had been on for decades and thousands of lives were lost. But past governments were reluctant to address the problems. The Northeast is no longer ‘algao’ (separatist), it is now ‘lagao’ (dedication).”

He added, “Lakhs of people in the Northeast did not know what development meant. This is because political parties understood their problems but used to ignore revolts, blockades and violent protests. They just contained them but never tried to solve them. This approach had pushed the people of the region so far that they had stopped believing in democracy and the Constitution.”

NEW DELHI: Battle lines have been drawn for an interesting contest that will not only give a new government to the national capital but also decide the political fortunes of the three key players. About 1.5 crore eligible voters will on Saturday get the opportunity to elect representatives for the 70-member Delhi assembly from 672 candidates – 593 men and 79 women – who, in the past two weeks, campaigned extensively.AAP had got a record mandate in the 2015 assembly polls, when it won 67 of 70 seats.

The party has not won a single election anywhere in India since that resounding victory in 2015, curtailing its dream to expand in other parts of the country.In 2015, AAP polled over 54.3% votes while BJP got 32.2% and Congress 9.7%. On the other hand, BJP has not won a single assembly election in Delhi after 1993 and its resolve to form a government this time was evident in its high-decibel campaign which highlighted what it sees as a threat to national security. BJP invoked major decisions taken by its government — amending the citizenship law, abrogation of Articles 370 and 35A, and surgical strikes on Pakistan — to seek votes, besides highlighting what it claims to be AAP’s failure to ensure supply of clean water, installation of CCTV cameras and giving free Wi-Fi in Delhi.

NEW DELHI: The Lok Sabha witnessed unruly scenes on Friday with Congress and BJP members nearly coming to blows when health minister Harsh Vardhan read out astatement condemning Rahul Gandhi ’s “danda” remarks against PM Modi .Congress members rushed to the well of the House the moment Vardhan started reading out a statement criticising Rahul instead of responding to his question relating to the establishment of a medical college in his constituency Wayanad during question hour.Congress MP from Tamil Nadu B Manickam Tagore reached the treasury benches and attempted to approach Vardhan, who was reading out from a piece of paper. Tagore was countered by BJP’s Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, who held his arm.Amid interruptions, he said, “I am surprised that Rahul Gandhi’s own father was Prime Minister of India and I do not think that in the worst of cases, our party leaders made such outlandish personal remarks against him.”Several MPs from both sides and ministers as well, including Smriti Irani , prevented them from coming to blows. Though rattled by the commotion, Vardhan continued reading his statement. While criticising Modi over unemployment during an election rally in the capital on Wednesday, Rahul had said, “The PM won’t be able to come out of his home. The youth of India will beat him up with a danda (stick) and make him understand that the country can’t progress without providing jobs to youth.”The ruckus saw two ad journments before proceedings were called off for the day. When the House first adjourned till 1pm, Vardhan and other BJP members were heard demanding an apology from Rahul for his remark.“When I condemned Rahul Gandhi for his remarks against the Prime Minister, Congress MPs came to my seat, tried to attack me and snatched papers from me,” Vardhan told reporters outside Parliament. Tagore, however, alleged that BJP members had manhandled him.He wrote to Speaker Om Birla , requesting him to check the CCTV footage and take action against those who manhandled him. Reacting to the episode, Rahul tweeted: “The youth of India can clearly see that the PM has no clue about how to tackle the unemployment crisis. To protect him, BJP will keep disrupting Parliament, preventing debate,” he said.In Video: Watch: Lok Sabha witnesses scuffle, adjournments over Rahul's remarks against PM",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74017996,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-238711,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/danda-drama-bjp-congress-mps-nearly-come-to-blows-in-lok-sabha/articleshow/74017997.cms

LUCKNOW: A 15-year-old boy spent 42 days in jail in connection with the December 19 anti-CAA violence in Lucknow after police told him “ umar badha ke batao (add years to your actual age)”, forcing him to say he was 18 “out of fear”, his lawyer alleged.

The minor’s advocate, Yashab Husain Rizvi, said when he was assembling documents to prepare a reply to a recovery notice served to the minor by the government seeking compensation for damages allegedly caused by him, his Aadhaar card revealed his age as 15 years.

Advocate Yashab Husain Rizvi filed a complaint with the Lucknow police commissioner, seeking to know why the teenager had not been tried under the Juvenile Justice Act and was kept in a jail instead of a juvenile home. It also sought that Hazratganj police be tried for “illegal action”.

The minor, a resident of Malda district in West Bengal , had 15 charges slapped on him, including attempt to murder and rioting with deadly weapon. He told TOI on Friday,“They took me to the police station and told me ‘umar bada ke batao.’ So, out of fear, I told them I was 18.” “It is not our prerogative to enquire about the person’s age . It is for the court to determine the age ,” said inspector of Hazratganj police station, Dhirendra Kushwaha.

AYODHYA: More than 24km from ground zero of the Ayodhya movement, where the Babri mosque once stood, Dhannipur village is a just speck of green on the map of the erstwhile Faizabad district. Suddenly, this obscure sleepy hamlet that’s also home to a famous Sufi shrine is basking in its new-found glory after UP government allotted the court-mandated five-acre alternative plot for building a mosque here.

And while the Sunni Waqf Board may be still iffy about accepting land, Dhannipur is already celebrating. And majority Muslims of the village are unanimous about one thing — the mosque should not be named after Babar.

“Mughal emperor Babar was not a representative of Indian Muslims. Sufis like Hazrat Nizamuddin , Khwaja Moinuddin Chisti and ulemas who sacrificed their lives for independence represent the Indian Muslim ethos. We want the mosque to called ‘Aman Masjid’ or mosque of peace,” said Mohammad Faheem Khan, whose views were echoed across Dhannipur village.

The land allocated for the mosque is adjacent to a 18th century Sufi shrine of Shahgada Baba, who’s believed to be a mureed (disciple) of a Sufi saint, Syed Makhdum Ashraf Jahangir, whose mausoleum is located at Kichaucha in Ambedkarnagar district. The village bathes in the celebration of spring during the Urs of its presiding saint, when pilgrims from various districts throng to the shrine in the last week of April. Most devotees are Hindus, which give credence to the syncretic fabric of Dhannipur.

Resident Sohrab Khan said, “If a grand temple will be constructed in Ayodhya, we too need majestic mosque here. Five acre isn’t enough. The government must allot at least 25 acre, which is easily available here”.

Another villager Faheem Khan emphasised that the mosque should be a symbol of aman (peace). The village has 1,600 voters in its rolls, of which 700 are Muslims and rest Hindus, mostly Yadavs and Dalits.

BHOPAL: A decision by Kamal Nath government in MP to give four more years to Anil Ambani ’s Sasan Power Project to repay dues of Rs 450 crore in instalments has triggered a political row, with BJP accusing it of using public money for the “convenience of industrialists”, and Congress pointing out that the breather is part of industrial policy framed by the erstwhile BJP government.

PCC media department chief Shobha Oza said, “These dues had accumulated during BJP government’s tenure. The Congress government is only trying to recover the money owed by Reliance Power Limited.”

“Knowing the circumstances of the economy and the firm concerned, the Nath government’s aim is to recover dues, which is why four years’ time has been given,” Oza argued.

Leader of opposition Gopal Bhargava said, “The Congress government has decided to exempt recovery of Rs 450cr dues from Ambani in four years. This proves that it’s a government of industrialists and capitalists. The CM himself is an industrialist. He is worried more about increasing capital of industrialists”.

The Kerala government on Friday triggered a row by using artist Tom Vattakuzhy’s painting ‘Death of Gandhi’ for the cover of the state budget. Finance minister T M Thomas Isaacattacked BJP over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and NRC and said, “The message is, yes, we remember that Mahatma was murdered. Murdered by Hindu communalists who are today revered by the ruling party and the central government. We just want to say that we will remember it, people will not forget it.”

“These are very different times that we live in. For the Centre, NRC is the greatest and the most urgent reform that needs to be implemented. It is a divisive attempt to mobilise population on communal lines. This has to be countered at every level,” Isaac said. Leader of the opposition Ramesh Chennithala (Congress) felt the picture could have been avoided. “I don’t think this is an appropriate gesture for the budget,” he said.

Meanwhile, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to rectify his state ment that “maligns” the anti-CAA protests in Kerala. “It is unbefitting for a PM to be a part of those who are disappointed with the fact that Kerala is leading the struggle against the communalism of both RSS and SDPI”, he said reacting to Modi’s Rajya Sabha speech on Thursday in which he quoted Vijayan as criticising SDPI for infiltrating anti-CAA protests and engaging in violence. In New Delhi, BJP defended Modi.

“The Prime Minister just stated what Vijayan had said earlier this week in the state assembly where he referred to SDPI — a close ally of the Congressled UDF in Kerala — as an extremist group plotting to stoke violence in anti-CAA protests in Kerala,” said BJP spokesperson GVL Narsimha Rao .

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court complex, built on 17 acres in 1958 to serve as India’s top court, is bursting at its seams with a huge spurt in litigation, 50 times increase in the number of lawyers and a five-fold rise in the number of judges.

Attorney general K K Venugopal, 89, who shifted his practice from Madras high court to a sparsely crowded SC 40 years ago, has been complaining about his daily jostle through crowds of lawyers and litigants in the corridors and the courtrooms to reach the front rows to address judges.

“I fear getting run over by the crowd,” he often said. An unusually crowded Chief Justice of India’s courtroom got his goat on Friday. “It is a shame. I have to push my way through the crowd daily to address the court,” the AG told a bench of CJI S A Bobde and Justices B R Gavai and Surya Kant during hearing on a plea for live streaming of court proceedings.

When the Supreme Court started functioning from its present building, inaugurated on August 4, 1958, there were seven courtrooms, which have now gone up to 16. Lawyers have increased from a few hundred to nearly 3,000. More and more litigants throng the court daily. Judges’ strength has increased from seven to 34.

Number of cases till 1960 were in the hundreds. Now, over 50,000 cases are pending and 16 benches hear around 1,000 cases each Monday and Friday, the two days when it becomes more crowded than a weekly market. When the CJI acknowledged the problem, senior advocate Indira Jaising suggested, “If a new Parliament can be built, why not a new Supreme Court building?” The CJI was quick to accept the suggestion and said, “Tell that to the AG. They have to give land and money.”

Turning to the AG, the CJI said, “We have no problem if a new SC building is constructed.” Married to tra ditions, the AG found it difficult to imagine a new structure replacing the existing SC building, every inch of which he has walked in the last four decades. “Can the facade of the building be changed? The Supreme Court judgment on live streaming can be implemented to ease pressure on courtrooms, ” he said.

The CJI said the courtrooms need to be bigger to accommodate the growing crowd of lawyers and litigants. “We have to have another building,” he said.

However, no one appeared to agree on relocating some courtrooms to the new, state-ofthe-art annexe complex of the Supreme Court across the road. The CJI further said that the Supreme Court was consulting a architecture firm which specialised in crowd circulation in public buildings.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday stayed a Bombay high court order directing setting up of a three-member panel to supervise sale of assets of HDIL promoters Rakesh Wadhawan and his son Sarang to recover money due to investors in the PMC Bank scam.

Senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi, appearing for the RBI, argued against the high court order directing the RBI to hand over documents relating to HDIL assets. A bench headed by CJI S A Bobde ordered complete stay on the high court’s January 15 decision.

It had on January 16 stayed the HC’s order for conditional release of the fatherson duo to help facilitate sale of their assets to recover investors’ money. The Wadhawans are accused of fraudulently getting Rs 4,355 crore loan from PMC Bank.

The PMC Bank scam came to light in September last year after RBI found that the bank had allegedly created fictitious accounts to hide over Rs 4,355 crore of loans extended to almost-bankrupt HDIL. According to RBI, PMC Bank had masked 44 problematic loan accounts, including those of HDIL, by tampering with its core banking system.

Aurangabad:Anna Wachva Samiti, a city-based NGO, has urged chief minister Uddhav Thackeray not to extend the subsidised food to people who waste food which is served under the government’s Shiv Thali scheme.

The NGO has been running a mission for free city.

The committee members made a round of the places where the food was being served under the government scheme for Rs 10.

“To our dismay, we found that people had wasted food in their thalis. Hence, we requested the chief minister to avoid wastage of food in this way,’’ said Anant Motale, a member of the organisation.

Speaking to the reporters on Friday, Motale hailed the state government’s decision to extend a helping hand to the people by announcing Shiv Thali. However, he said that the government needs to take precaution that the food which is served to the people should not go waste.

He said that everybody should eat everything in the thali. He suggested that if one wastes food, that person should be charged Rs 50. One should be paying for the wastage.

Citing global huger index, he said that in our country 50% of the cooked food worth Rs 244 crore is wasted daily. The government need to look at this factor too and ensure the avoidance of such wastage, especially in the government-run schemes. He also demanded the government to display boards asking people not to waste food, particularly at these places.

22 workers have been given jobs in the diamond factories recently

Surat: In a novel initiative , Surat diamantaires have launched a forum — Diamond Industry Career Foundation (DICF) — which aims to curb unemployment among workers in the industry.

These diamantaires not only to want to provide employment opportunities to retrenched workers, but also bridge the gap between diamond units and potential workers. A drive to register diamond factories as well as unemployed diamond workers has already begun.

Diamond exporter Nilesh Bodki, who founded DICF, told TOI: “The diamond industry is passing through a tough phase and many workers, mostly from small units, have lost their jobs. Still, there are many units in the industry which require workers, but owing to limited resources are unable to find good hands.”

Bodki added that in the last one month, the DICF has received requirement of 700 workers from various diamond factories. “About 22 workers have been given jobs in the diamond factories in the last few days,” he said.

According to Bodki, factory owners and diamond workers can fill up forms circulated by the DICF on WhatsApp and other social media platforms. DICF has also prepared a website where workers and factory owners can fill up these forms online.

Vipul Sachpara, a diamond unit owner and member of DICF said, “Surat’s diamond industry is decentralised and there is no database of its workers. There may be thousands of workers looking for jobs, but are not finding any medium to connect with the employers. We are providing an opportunity to the workers and the unit owners to connect.”

Last year, the diamond workers’ association had put the numbers of unemployed diamond workers at 13,000. Many had shifted to other jobs, while there are many more who are still searching for jobs.

Surat Diamond Association (SDA) president, Babu Kathiriya said, “The industry is slowly back on the after Christmas. The factories now require skilled workers. We have promised all our support to the diamantaires who have started the career foundation to help the workers get decent jobs.”

58,['8/02/2020'],Weavers oppose anti-dumping duty on nylon yarn,"This story is from February 8, 2020

Surat: While the central government has abolished anti-dumping duty purified terephthalic acid (PTA) – a key raw material for yarn production—the powerloom weavers are upset with the Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) which is in the process of imposing anti-dumping duty on the nylon filament yarn.

The DGTR has issued a disclosure statement on the anti-dumping investigation on the import of nylon filament yarn originating from China, Korea, Tiawan and Thailand and invited objections from the concerned parties for fixing the duty.

Industry sources said that the nylon yarn consumption per annum is pegged at 1.50 lakh tonnes and that it is mostly used in the wrap and knitting of the fabrics. The imposition of anti-dumping duty on nylon yarn will allow the yarn spinners to hike the yarn prices in the domestic market.

China and other countries are manufacturing new yarns to meet growing demand of the consumers. Imposing anti-dumping duty on such yarns keeps the powerloom weavers away from getting quality yarn, which ultimately leads to increased import of fabrics and garments in India, stated the weavers.

Leader of the powerloom industry, Mayur Golwala said, “The anti-dumping duty on nylon yarn will not give any direct benefit to the weavers, who were expecting the prices of yarn to come down by Rs 8 per kilogram.”

“We have convened a meeting of weavers on Saturday to decide on the further course of action,” he added.

Chairman of Federation of Indian Art Silk Weaving Industry (FIASWI), Bharat Gandhi said, “For few yarn spinners, government cannot disturb the weaving sector employing lakhs of workers. We have filed our objections in the DGTR and expect that the duty is not imposed on nylon yarn.”

Surat: Three persons involved in the killing of history-sheeter Wasim alias Billa Gulam Mohammad Sheikh, 30 , in Navsari on January 22 , were arrested by Navsari police from Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan on Thursday. Wasim, who was an original resident of Jhampa Bazar, Surat was shot dead from a point-blank range by two hired killers in Navsari when he was sitting in his car. Shooter Shakib Sajid Ali Rangrej, 29, a native of Uttar Pradesh, was arrested from Rajasthan along with Kutbiddin Asgarali. Mustan alias Ali Hussain Dodiya, a resident of Rustampura, Surat was arrested from Uttar Pradesh. The three criminals were produced in a court in Navsari, which remanded them in police custody for 10 days. Seven more accused, including Badri Laswala, the mastermind, are yet to be arrested. Laswala had hired the killers to get Wasim killed on a payment of Rs10 lakh.

Dodiya was confidant of Badri Laswala of Jampa Bazaar with whom Wasim had enmity. Dodiya had given ‘supari’ of Rs10 lakh to Rangrej with Rs2 lakh as advance on behalf of Laswala, who is on the run along with Rauf Pathan, Abbas Mithaiwala, Ali Ajgar, Baba Katpitiya, Akula and Hasim Siddiqui.

“We were keeping a close watch on Mustan. We tracked him to Uttar Pradesh where he was arrested. His interrogation revealed names of Shakib and Kutbiddin Aagarali, who were picked up from Rajasthan. Mastermind Laswala and other accused are yet to be arrested,” deputy superintendent of police BS Mori said.

Police said Laswala and others had an altercation with Wasim 18 months ago. When Wasim came out of jail in connection with a case, he was asked by the court to not enter the city for some time. Thus, he had been living in Navsari for the past one year.

Police said after Laswala gave ‘supari’ to Shakib to kill Wasim, two killers had taken a house on rent in Udhna area of the city and kept a watch on him in Navsari.

On January 22 when Wasim was returning from a gym in Navsari and had just entered his car, Shakib, who arrived there on a motorcycle with another accused, took out a country-made pistol and fired five rounds from a point-blank range at him.

The duo fled to Vedcha village and threw their motorcycle in a creek. They then took a train and got down at Vapi. They then headed towards Mumbai and spent four days there before going to Ahmedabad, Ajmer and Galiakot.

Kolkata: Forced to defer its expansion plans to the east following the coronavirus outbreak in China, IndiGo Airlines is set to start daily flights from Kolkata to Dubai from February 16. The airline is also evaluating other destinations in the Gulf, including Riyadh, Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, Jeddah and Dammam. It had also planned a daily flight to Doha from March 1, but that has been put on hold for now.

The IndiGo flight to Dubai will make it the second-best connected international destination from Kolkata after Bangkok. It is the third carrier to operate in the sector — Emirates currently operates 11 flights a week while Air India has four.

With IndiGo, the sector will now have 22 flights a week. On Sundays and Fridays, passengers have a choice of four flights. On four days, there are three flights and on Mondays, there are two flights in the sector.

IndiGo has suspended its flights to Guangzhou and Hong Kong from Kolkata and delayed plans to start services to Beijing and Shanghai following the coronavirus outbreak. “China was a major growth area, but given the current situation, we are looking at other geographies and will return to the east once the situation improves,” an official said.

Sources in the airline said the Gulf region apart, the airline was also exploring opportunities in Cambodia, where both capital Phnom Penh and heritage town Siem Reap were under consideration. At present, the airline flies to neighbouring Vietnam with connections to Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.

Travel Agents Federation of India chairman (east) Anil Punjabi said Dubai was a good sector for IndiGo as it could corner a big chunk of the labour traffic from the entire eastern region. “With fares expected to be 25%-30% lower than Emirates, it will make a big difference,” he said.

About a decade and a half ago, the only connection between Kolkata and Dubai was a Royal Brunei flight that operated twice a week. That was withdrawn in December 2004 as carriers worldwide moved from the model of hopping flights to hub and spoke.

AI flight from Surat to Bengaluru got delayed

Surat: Over two dozen passengers of Air India flight from Surat to Bengaluru approached police to complain against AI staff at Surat airport.

Air India’s AI-519 flight was scheduled to depart from Surat airport to Bengaluru at 11am on Thursday. Passengers were waiting at the airport and the AI staff kept on changing the flight schedule. The passengers were told in the evening that the flight was cancelled and that they will have to travel to Ahmedabad by road to board the flight or else board Delhi flight to get connecting flight to Bengaluru on Friday. When majority of passengers didn’t accept the offer, the AI staff stated that Bengaluru flight will depart on Friday morning at 8:30am.

Nitin Pradhan, an advocate from Vyara, said, “The AI staff at Surat promised that Bengaluru flight will depart at 8:30am on Friday. All the passengers arrived at the airport and again the staff told us that the flight was delayed and will depart at 12:45pm. When we asked them to give us in writing, one of the AI staff used abusive language against the passengers. It was only after we announced our plan to lodge a police complaint, the AI staff came under pressure and about 53 passengers were allowed to board Bengaluru flight at 2pm on Friday.”

Vishnu Jadia, an architect, said, “It was an ordeal for us. The flight was delayed for more than 36 hours and the AI staff behaved very irresponsibly and used abusive language. I had a five-day trip to Bengaluru for several meetings. Who is going to compensate for the big loss?”

Chetan Majethia, AI officer, told TOI, “The aircraft from Bhubaneshwar didn’t arrive at Surat on Thursday and so the flight was cancelled. The same flight was supposed to arrive at 8:30am on Friday, but it also got delayed. However, we made arrangements for sending 53 passengers to Bengaluru at 2pm on Friday.”

RN Patel, police inspector of Dumas police station, said, “The flight was cancelled on Thursday due to technical reasons and text messages were sent to passengers. The same flight was cancelled again on Friday, but the airline made arrangements to fly passengers to Bengaluru. We have not registered any case in this regard.”

Surat: The diamond city is all set to witness a unique petathlon-2020 event where the participants will be given seed-balls to spread the message, ‘grow more trees’.

More than 250 pet lovers from the city are expected to participate with their pet animals and birds at the Petathlon-2020 to be organized by Animal Friend, a non-government organization (NGO) on February 9.

The Petathlon will kick-start from Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology (SVNIT) and culminate at Kargil Chowk on Piplod where the pet lovers and the organizers will create an awareness on growing more trees by distributing about 2,020 seed balls to people.

The pet lovers, who will participate with their pet animals and birds such as horses, dogs, macau, African grey, lizards etc., will help the volunteers in spreading awareness on loving the animals and growing more trees.

Sudhir Shah, founder of Animal Friend, told TOI, “This is the first time that the seed-ball concept has been introduced in the city. The seed-balls are made by our volunteers. There are three types of native tree seeds including garmado, paras-pilal and billipatra.”

The native plant seeds are covered with clay, moss and coco peat to make small round balls. Since these seeds will grow as big trees, the residents wanting the seed-balls will be provided with a complete information on choosing the fertile land around their houses to develop the seeds into plants.

According to Shah, his NGO has been organizing the Petathlon event once in a year since 2014. The event is organized every year on different themes such as ‘beti bachao, beti padhao’, ‘say no to plastics’, ‘jal hai to kaal hai’, ‘save trees’ etc.

“The seed balls may be small in numbers, but they will add up to the green cover in the city. The people taking the seed-balls will have to take an oath to nourish the trees. After the success, we intend to come up with a huge event in the city ahead of the monsoon season where thousands of seed-balls will be distributed to the residents,” said Shah.

65,['8/02/2020'],Higher levies hit cos selling ortho knee implants,"This story is from February 8, 2020

Rupali.Mukherjee@timesgroup.com

Mumbai: Companies selling orthopaedic knee implants have been hit by a double whammy in the Budget this year. With the introduction of a 5% health cess and ‘social welfare’ surcharge of 10% on imported medical devices , costs have gone up substantially across the board for medical equipment firms, which will increase prices for patients.

While most companies that sell eyeware, hearing aids and critical care devices have decided to hike prices to negate the impact of higher costs, MNCs selling orthopaedic implants — including Johnson & Johnson, Zimmer and Stryker — are in a flux. Hit by higher levies, companies selling knee implants said they find it unviable as they will not be able to increase the MRP, with their prices capped by the government.

“We are asking the government for a roll-back of the incremental duty as the cost of doing business has increased,” Medical Technology Association of India ( MTaI ) director Kaustav Banerjee said. He added if that may not be possible, then “we plan to approach the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority ( NPPA ) to allow us a revision in prices”.

The Drugs Prices Control Order (DPCO), 2013 allows companies selling knee implants to increase prices annually up to 10% every August, with the last revision in August 2019. It was in August 2017 when the NPPA had reduced knee implant prices by nearly 70% to make them accessible.

On most medical devices, with the imposition of a 5% health cess, the effective rate of duty has increased approximately to 12.5%, and, combined with a social welfare surcharge of 10%, the total burden increases to nearly 14%. At present, medical devices are taxed at slabs of 0%, 5% and 7.5%. The cost for most devices will go up in the range of 5% to nearly 18%, industry experts said. Stryker India MD Meenakshi Nevatia said, “But in current scenario, with margins at each level fixed and MRP fixed, this isn’t viable.” Further, companies are also seeking clarity on whether knee implants are exempt from the 7.5% customs duty, as a certain section of the industry feels that it is ambiguous. In case they are exempt, the cost impact on knee implant firms will be over 5%. Besides, joint replacement instruments will also be levied a higher levy, increasing the burden for patients. EY India tax partner (life sciences) Hitesh Sharma said, “The health cess may put a damper for consumers as they may have to bear the brunt of increased prices.”

The over $5-billion industry is heavily import-dependent with about 70-80% imports, including imaging equipment (CT and MRI scanners), cardiac stents, orthopaedic implants, syringes, surgical gloves, and critical care equipment cornering a large share.

BENGALURU: WhatsApp will finally be able to roll out its payments services in a phased manner in India after it submitted a revised proposal regarding compliance in January, two sources aware of the matter said. The messaging application, owned by social networking giant Facebook, has over 400 million monthly active users in India.The move could see WhatsApp enter the payments battlefield to take on Google Pay, Walmart-backed PhonePe and Alibaba & SoftBank-backed Paytm. This, after being stuck in trial phase for two years where it was restricted to just 1 million users.The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), which manages the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) system that WhatsApp plans to develop its payments business on, had discussed the matter with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) earlier this week.“After clarification was sought from NPCI, WhatsApp India submitted a revised proposal to NPCI earlier in January. The same was sent to the RBI as well. There is a likelihood that WhatsApp will be gradually opened up to more consumers, instead of a full rollout in India,” the person aware of the matter said.The changes WhatsApp has made regarding compliance and details in its proposal could not be immediately ascertained. But the government has not given up its demand for traceability of messages, said a third source briefed on the matter. In the next week or so, there could be a final decision on the matter, he added.For almost two years, WhatsApp Pay has been testing its payments in beta mode with troubles around its data-localisation compliance along with the government’s demand for traceability of messages on the platform. Then, the Israeli spyware Pegasus’ hacking of WhatsApp users, including Indians, further delayed approval for the popular messaging platform last year.From a base of 1 million in the first phase, WhatsApp could be allowed to take its payments service to about 10 million, according to current options the NPCI has considered with the RBI. Even a phased rollout will impact rivals like Paytm, PhonePe and Google Pay, who have so far dominated UPI transaction volumes as WhatsApp has the deepest penetration, ease of use and engagement in India among major social applications.In November, following the Pegasus controversy, the RBI had told the SC that WhatsApp Pay is non-compliant with data-localisation and it will give permission only after full compliance. Talks of a phased rollout for WhatsApp Pay comes when the NPCI is looking to fire up growth on a high base of 1 billion monthly transactions, and WhatsApp’s large active consumer base could act as a catalyst.As reported in November by TOI, the RBI told the SC that the Menlo Park-based firm was still storing various payment data elements outside India, which include transaction IDs, expiry of collect request, and retrieval reference number.“When a customer raises a dispute, WhatsApp application (client) logs, query screenshots uploaded by a customer, and consumer email messages are shared with the support team located in Hyderabad and the US and are stored for a period of 90 days. Although the logs do not contain payments data as contented by auditor, screenshots uploaded by customers and customer email message may contain payments data,” the RBI had added in its response to the SC.This was owing to a petition by the Centre for Accountability and Systemic Change (CASC), a think-tank that challenged WhatsApp’s compliance standards and absence of local grievance officer in India. In April, WhatsApp had identified a third-party auditor for data compliance, the company had told the SC.A WhatsApp India spokesperson said it did not have any new comment to offer on the matter. An emailed query sent to the NPCI did not elicit any response. Sources close to WhatsApp India said the company had not yet received any communication from the central bank or the NPCI.It is not clear yet if WhatsApp has agreed to the government’s demand to allow it to trace messages that spread rumours or eventually create violence. “They (WhatsApp) have been working on suggestions made by the regulator. Based on that, it should now be able to go live to more people, gradually,” one of the people mentioned above added.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74022924,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-85658,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/whatsapp-may-get-to-roll-out-payments-service-in-phases/articleshow/74017382.cms
67,['8/02/2020'],Patna: Civic bodies to hire agencies for sanitation,"This story is from February 8, 2020

Huge garbage dump on road near Indira Bhawan in Patna

PATNA: A day after urban development and housing department (UDHD) threatened action against the permanent municipal workers for supporting the ongoing sanitation workers’ strike , Patna municipal commissioner Amit Kumar Pandey on Friday suspended 12 sanitary inspectors of Bankipore Circle for remaining absent from duty.

Pandey further instructed the PMC officials to lodge an FIR against absentee sanitary inspectors and initiate departmental proceeding against them. A day before, similar action was taken against three sanitary inspectors of Patna City Circle.

The UDHD has decided to take similar action against the agitating sanitation workers and directed the urban local bodies (ULBs) to suspend those permanent employees who are supporting the strike either directly or indirectly or abstaining from duty.

The UDHD has also instructed the ULBs facing sanitation workers’ strike to make alternative arrangements for removing garbage by roping in the agencies which supply manpower for such work.

The instructions were issued on Thursday evening after the meeting with the workers’ union leaders and UDHD minister and senior officials failed to end the strike of Group D daily wage labourers engaged in sanitation work. These workers have been on strike since Monday in protest against a UDHD letter to all the ULBs to stop taking their services from February 1 and instead outsource the sanitation work. However, soon after the strike, the UDHD extended the deadline to March 31 for removing the daily wage workers engaged in sanitation work.

Apart from suspending the permanent staff found involved in the strike, the UDHD has also asked the civic bodies to send their names to the department for further action. A letter in this regard was written by UDHD under-secretary Kumar Devendra Projjwal to all the district magistrates and municipal commissioners and executive officers of ULBs after videoconferencing with them earlier in the day.

“Through videoconferencing, information has come that few known and unknown people were creating hindrance in sanitation work and instigating the workers on strike. Hence named FIR should be lodged against such people and even against unknown people and department should be informed about them,” read a part of the letter.

In order to sort out the issue of lack of sanitation workers, UDHD had instructed them to rope in agencies which provide manpower to any of the government departments or the ULBs. Instruction has also been given to avail the services of those agencies which are providing manpower to the energy department. Similarly, district administrations which have earlier taken manpower through any agency, have been asked to avail of their services on their pre-determined rate.

In the letter, UDHD has asked the ULBs to immediately sign an agreement with the outsourcing agencies for a month and, if need be, extend it as per the need in future.

The DMs have also been asked to ensure sufficient police force with the teams engaged in cleanliness work for three days from the issue of the letter. Those ULBs which had not published tender for roping in outsourcing agency have been told to get it published on Thursday itself.

Striking sanitation workers demonstrating at PMC headquarter Mauryalok Complex in Patna on Friday

PATNA: Many urban areas in Bihar are facing sanitation crisis owing to the ongoing strike of workers associated with different urban local bodies (ULBs). Streets in Gaya, Chhapra, Begusarai and Ara among others are strewn with garbage and threatening health problems.

The main gate of Ara Municipal Corporation remained blocked for the fifth consecutive day on Friday as the sanitation workers continued with their dharna under the banner of ‘Bihar Rajya Sthaniye Nikaye Karmchari Mahasangh’. Ara municipal commissioner Dheerendra Paswan held a talk with them on Thursday but failed to break the deadlock. Union convener Gopal Prasad said the strike will continue until their demands are met.

Piles of garbage could be seen at Shishmahal Chowk, Shivganj Mor, D T Road, Syndicate Mor, near Jain School and Mahila College in the town. Ravi Kumar, an SSC aspirant, near the Syndicate Mor said: “It’s disgusting. I have to go out many times for my tuition and coaching. The foul smell emanating from the garbage is unbearable.”

The sanitation workers’ strike has badly affected at least 22 out of 45 municipal wards of Ara. The sanitation work is also affected in other wards where permanent staff are engaged, as the garbage carrying vehicles are unable to come out due to the blockade at the main gate of the corporation building.

In Gaya, the agitating sanitation workers disrupted road traffic near Circuit House and blocked entry points to the corporation store and its parking area on Friday. Police intervened to get the road blockade cleared but the corporation store remained closed. Gaya municipal commissioner Sawan Kumar said a section of employees wanted to resume duty but they were prevented by others. There are 1710 sanitation workers on the Gaya Municipal Corporation (GMC) payrolls, but only about 200 are regular while the rest are on contract.

Meanwhile, fear of epidemic grips the city as municipal waste is littered along the roads. The situation is worse in the wholesale market of grains and vegetables. Gaya DM Abhishek Singh had served an ultimatum to the employees to resume work or face action. But the employees remained on strike and the deadline ended on Thursday evening.

The ongoing strike has turned Begusarai town into a veritable hell. The situation is worse in Mungeriganj, Main Road, Tilak Nagar and near south gate of the collectorate. As the garbage dumped on roads have started decomposing, residents of neighbouring areas are facing much discomfort due to the stench. “There is a threat of an epidemic, especially amid the ongoing Intermediate examination,” said the father of an Intermediate examinee on Friday.

However, residents of Chhapra heaved a sigh of relief as the sanitation workers resumed duty on Friday. Saran DM Subrat Kumar Sen said on Friday that door- to-door garbage collection started from main roads. Police resorted to lathicharge on Thursday when some striking employees tried to prevent lifting of garbage in front of Saran collectorate. Municipal commissioner Sanjai Upadhyaya had appealed to the striking employees to return to their duties. “Stern action will be taken against the striking employees, if they failed to resume duty,” he said.

However, Bihar Local bodies Employees’ Federation president Siya Ram Singh said the strike would continue till their demands of absorption were not fulfilled.

Meanwhile, the strike of sanitation workers was called off in Darbhanga on Thursday while there was no strike in Bhagalpur, Buxar, Nalanda, West Champaran, East Champaran, Khagaria and Araria among several other municipal areas.

RAJKOT: Had she lost precious 45 minutes for fear or anxiety, this story would have gone down in history as another child marriage in Gujarat. But kudos to this gutsy 17-year-old girl’s grit, a distress call to 181 Abhayam helpline (women’s helpline) ended her ordeal before she was sacrificed at the ‘havan kund’!

“The girl from Gir Somnath district told us that she was a minor and did not want to get married. She said her marriage was scheduled on February 11 and requested us to come to the venue and stop the ceremony. We reached there as fast as we could and and helped the minor escape ,” said an official from the Abhayam helpline.

A team of the helpline officials sensitized the minor’s family members to the evil of child marriage and also told them they would all be liable for prosecution, if they went ahead with the ‘illegal’ marriage.

After counselling by the helpline officials, the family members of the minor could be convinced about the cancellation of the marriage. A grateful minor thanked the team profusely for helping to save her life.

Kolkata: Winter is still here and monsoon is far away. Yet the city markets have been flooded with hilsa. And the quality is better than the ones found during the peak season. At present, the hilsa found in the city markets are big-sized ones weighing anything between 1kg and 2.1kg, and they are affordable.

However, when supplies first started pouring in, about a fortnight ago, the prices were quite high. At retailers’ stands in Gariahat and Lake Market some 15 days ago, hilsas weighed 900g to 1.5kg each and sold for Rs 1,500 a kg — something buyers are used to during the monsoon. However, things changed for the better as more supplies came in, the size grew and prices witnessed a downward spiral.

A fish trader at Gariahat Market, Amar Das, said, “Even during hilsa season, we do not get to sell such fresh hilsa from the Padma. The size of the fish reaching our markets now is nothing short of eye-catching. Buyers are very happy and we are witnessing repeat purchases by regulars. Though there are some supplies coming in from cold storages, we aren’t really picking up those since there is a large amount of fresh supply is already at our disposal.”

Hilsa wholesale trader Suleman Khan , however, said, “The hilsa supply from Bangladesh is coming in via a roundabout route. Such supply may stop at any moment. However, if it continues, the volume will increase and prices will come down further.”

Fishermen’s Association secretary Bijon Maity said, “Now, Bangladeshi fishermen are being able to catch huge quantities of hilsa and are supplying a large quantity of their catch to our side. Thus, supply to city markets is bountiful. However, our fishermen are hardly catching any hilsa — some 60% of trawlers are returning without any hilsa from Kakdwip and Diamond Harbour.”

Joyeeta Mukherjee, a hilsa buyer at Gariahat Market, said, “We did not get good hilsa the last season. Even during Bhai Phonta last year, there was hardly any hilsa in the markets. But the fish now available in the markets is so fresh and tasty that one can’t help but buy in large quantities.”

71,['8/02/2020'],Perhaps I’ve been overruled: LIC chief,"LIC chairman M R Kumar (File photo)

MUMBAI: Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) of India will work on conducting a valuation of its business as a precursor to its initial public offering. Addressing the media on Friday, LIC chairman M R Kumar said that the Life Insurance Corporation of India Act would need to be amended for the public offering. Interestingly last year, Kumar had voiced his opinion that the time was not ripe for an IPO . When asked about those comments, he replied, “What can I say, perhaps I have been overruled.”The laws that would need to be changed include the ones on dividend distribution and creation of a separate fund. At present, LIC distributes 95% of its surplus to the policyholder and 5% to the government. The corporation also has a single controlled policy fund and there is no separate shareholders fund. LIC has been exempt from having a shareholder’s fund as all the policies it issues are guaranteed by the government. While most other listed companies have undertaken an exercise to calculate their embedded value (which is the present value of business that it has written), LIC is yet to do so.On LIC’s performance, Kumar said that its market share in terms of the first-year premium and the number of policies as of January end stood at 80% and 77.6% respectively. LIC’s total income rose 17.8% to Rs 2.9 lakh crore as of September 2019 from Rs 2.5 lakh crore a year ago. Total assets of the corporation increased by 7.9% to Rs 32.3 lakh crore as of September 2019 from Rs 29.8 crore, he added.Kumar said that the corporation has made a conscious decision to increase the share of individual regular premium policies, which has grown at the rate of 40%—the highest in recent years.Overall, individual new business premium grew 17.48%, while the number of new policies sold jumped 29.4% to Rs 45,199 crore, taking the total policies sold to 1.9 crore, the chairman said. To comply with new Irdai regulations, LIC has modified its existing products with new features such as revised surrender value and extension of revival period from two years to five years. During FY2018-19, LIC generated the highest valuation surplus of Rs 53,214 crore, registering a growth of around 9.9% over the previous year and paid a dividend of Rs 2,611 crore to the government, again the highest in history.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74024659,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-135650,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/perhaps-ive-been-overruled-lic-chief/articleshow/74017298.cms
72,['8/02/2020'],Godrej Cons misses FMCG rural growth target for 2020,"This story is from February 8, 2020

(Representative image)

MUMBAI: FMCG major Godrej Consumer Products ’ (GCPL’s) aim to increase rural sales to 37% of revenue by 2020 has taken a hit due to the economic slowdown. The owner of brands like Good Knight and Cinthol will now take another two-three years to grow its rural business to 37% from 31%.

GCPL CEO Sunil Kataria told TOI, “We never anticipated GST disruptions and the slowdown that we have seen in the last 12 months. We are also seeing a large disruption in terms of multiple ecosystems coming into play — like e-commerce.” Good Knight and Hit, which form the company’s home insecticide business, account for nearly half of total sales.

According to Kataria, the country’s Rs 6,200-crore home insecticide market is growing at 7-8%, which reflects a bit of a slowdown. The company, which is a market leader, has seen growth slightly ahead of the industry. It has increased its market share this year to 49%.

New product launches by GCPL have driven category growth, Kataria said. The company launched insect repellent incense sticks under the Good Knight brand last year to take on unorganised suppliers that used “illegal” chemicals. Kataria added that the “nascent” out-of-home category (fabric roll-on product) has done very well despite the slowdown. Kataria also said the FMCG industry, which has been under stress, may start seeing growth again by the second half of 2020. “The rural slowdown is sharper than urban. The macro indicators need to improve. This may take a couple of quarters more.”

The company this week also announced it had stopped manufacturing liquid vaporiser unit ‘Activ’, which was launched in 2006, as it seeks to replace it with the launch of an improved device at a similar price point. The business from that product and its refills is about Rs 1,200 crore, according to Kataria.

“We are offering the new product at Rs 4 more than Activ. The only way to make consumers spend in a slowdown is to give them better value for the same price,” Kataria said, while hoping 6 crore consumers would shift to the new product in 18 months.

Liquid vaporisers account for 56% of Good Knight’s sales. The Good Knight brand, in turn, makes up more than 40% of the company’s sales, which stood at Rs 2,801 crore in October-December 2019.

PATNA: Proceedings at the Patna High Court remained paralysed for the second day in a row with over 10,000 lawyers staying away from work on Friday to press for their demands, including restoration of the old system of listing of cases for hearing.

The chairman of the coordination committee of three advocates’ associations, Yogesh Chandra Verma , said, “The work at the high court was completely affected for the second consecutive day due to the agitation,” adding, “The next course of action will be decided at the coordination committee’s meeting on Monday.”

Verma said there was a possibility of reaching an amicable solution on the issues raised by the members, but added,“The meeting of the coordination committee will be held around 1.30 pm on Monday. So the work will remain affected on Monday as well.”

Apart from the restoration of old system of listing, the agitating lawyers also want the continuation of manual filing of cases till they and other staff members get tuned with online filing of cases. “We are not opposed to the use of technology in judiciary. We are of the view that the old system should continue till everybody gets acquainted,” Verma said.

He met Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and apprised him of the problems faced by lawyers, particularly the young ones, after the new system was introduced at the high court. “The new system is very complex and complicated. As a result, many cases got dismissed by the court for non-appearance of the advocates,” he said.

Though the advocates abstained from work for a few days in January as well, the stir was withdrawn following the death of retired Patna High Court judge Nagendra Rai . Rai was practicing at the Supreme Court after his superannuation from service.

Surat: A day after the farmers and cooperative leaders agitating for extra cash lanes and tax relief to the vehicle owners at Bhatia toll plaza, announced that the Southern Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SGCCI) is supporting them, the apex trade and industry body issued a statement on Saturday stating they are not supporting any agitation.

Leaders spearheading the campaign against the toll authorities at Bhatia toll plaza had met the SGCCI president, Ketan Desai, on Friday seeking the trade body’s support in favour of vehicle owners in the city and district. Soon after the meeting, they issued a statement announcing that the SGCCI has supported the agitation.

The agitating leaders have threatened to launch stir anew if the Bhatia toll plaza does not provide extra cash lane for easy passage to vehicles registered in the city and district.

Leaders stated that these vehicles have to wait for their turn in the long serpentine queue at the single cash lane to pay toll tax. Despite various representation, the authorities are yet to provide extra cash lanes for easy passage of these vehicles.

SGCCI president, Ketan Desai said, “The issue raised by the leaders is genuine and we promised them to represent it at the higher level. The leaders met me on Friday to discuss, but there was no announcement from our side supporting the agitation. SGCCI is standing with the trade and industry and we will take up the issue at the higher level.”

Member of Surat District Panchayat, Darshan Naik said, “We appreciate the decision of SGCCI of not supporting the agitation. We approached the chamber as it is the apex body of the trade and industry in south Gujarat. The issue is related to the entire city and district. Our demand is genuine and we will continue our agitation.”

Cops investigating at the site of the crime near Gondal on Friday

RAJKOT: In a brutal incident of lynching , a cook of a factory was dragged out of the kitchen by the owner and his staff and thrashed till he died in Bharudi village near Gondal on Thursday.

Three persons were arrested for the crime on Friday while two other accused, who are councillors in Gondal municipality, are yet to be nabbed.

Police said factory owner Vinod Darania (47), canteen contractor Akshay Chovatia (26), factory staffer Ashish Tilva (35), two Gondal municipality councillors — Ravi Kalaria and Shailesh Fauji — and Ashok Raiyani, beat the victim Shankarram (35) to death. Raiyani has the security contract of the factory.

“On Thursday morning when the factory opened, Darania spotted Shankarram sneaking into the factory office in the footage of the CCTV camera installed inside the office. Suspecting him of trying to commit theft from the office, Darania and his staff dragged Shankarram out of the kitchen and started thrashing him with bats,” said M N Rana, inspector with Rajkot rural local crime branch.

After Shankarram fell unconscious, two factory workers Bhawar Das and Khima Ram took him on a motorcycle to a local hospital. However, as Shankarram had died on the way, they got scared and dumped his body near the factory, and sped away.

After the police recovered Shankarram’s body on Thursday evening, the factory workers identified him and testified to the fact that he was subjected to severe beating by Darania and his staff.

“While Darania was nabbed from his factory, the other accused were arrested from their residences. Of the accused, Tilva, who had deleted the CCTV footage of the crime, has been booked for the destruction of the evidence,” said Rana.

KOLKATA: Direct flights between Kolkata and mainland China will be severed from next Monday following the withdrawal of China Eastern Airlines flights till February 29 because of the novel coronavirus outbreak and dip in passenger load, a senior official of the airline said on Friday. IndiGo had already announced cancellation of its direct flight from Kolkata to China from February 6 and, according to a senior official, flights to Guangzhou are cancelled till the middle of June.“Considering the current situation, the last flight to Kunming from Kolkata will reach on February 9 and we will fly out with passengers from Kolkata on February 10. For the next few weeks, we will suspend flight movement in this sector and will take stock of the situation after February 29,” said an official.TOI had reported on February 4 how airlines operating between Kolkata and different Chinese cities are either suspending flights or are rationalizing them because of a drop in passenger count over the nCoV outbreak.Both IndiGo and China Eastern Airlines operate daily direct flights between Kolkata and China. While IndiGo had last week announced the cancellation of the Kolkata-Guanghou services between February 6 and February 15, China Eastern Airlines had brought the number of flights down to four per week. With the Indian government issuing a notification asking its citizens not to fly to China and banning entry of all Chinese nationals to India, the passenger count has come down further this week. Such was the situation that China Eastern Airlines, that was already running a lower number of services, had to cancel Friday’s flight because of low passenger count, an airport official said.Earlier this week, officials of Cathay Pacific and Cathay Dragon, which operate flights between Hong Kong and Kolkata, had said they didn’t have any immediate plans to cancel or cut down flights. However, the current scenario has made them rationalize their flight movement and they have decided to fly between Kolkata and Hong Kong five days a week instead of six.“In view of the novel coronavirus outbreak and significant drop in market demand, we have announced capacity cuts across our network. There has been capacity rationalisation for our services from Kolkata to Hong Kong. From six flights per week, effective from February 9 until March 29, we will be operating five flights every week.

Altogether 300 handheld devices or electronic challan devices have been procured by the state transport department. With the help of advanced technology, district transport officers (DTOs) and motor vehicle inspectors (MVIs) will be able to issue challans on spot through the devices, which will further act as POS (point-of-sale) machines for accepting fines through credit or debit cards.

In April 2018, the e-challan system was launched in the state capital with at least 130 devices being handed over to the traffic police.

State transport secretary Sanjay Kumar Agarwal said, “The system will keep a track on the violator as well as the enforcement officer. Since, its the initial stage, the procured devices will be handed over to the DTOs and MVIs for issuing challan. Traffic cops will issue challan from the violators manually.”

Deliberating on the positive aspects of e-challan system, Agarwal said, ""The system was launched in the state capital on April 1 last year. Over 130 devices were handed over to different traffic cops, DTOs and MVIs present in all locations in Patna. Earlier, there were no evidences or record of violation of traffic norms. However, after handing over the e-challan devices to the officers, we have record of every violation.”

""Issuing fake challan in the city has completely stopped. Through the devices, we keep a track on the performance of enforcement officers also. Besides vehicles from other states cannot runaway as the data is uploaded directly to the National Informatics Centre (NIC) database. Thus officers in other states can also access the details of the vehicle driver.”

As per the state transport department data, altogether 46,000 e-challans have been issued from April to December last year in the state. “A penalty of around Rs7 crore has been collected from the violators. Besides, the maximum number of violators were caught near Bhattacharya Mor in Patna,” said an official from the transport department.

PATNA: Bihar State Road Development Corporation (BSRDCL) is to commence work on a four-lane road to link R Block- Digha Road with a rotary of the upcoming Ganga Path, commonly known as Ganga driveway. The link road will be constructed in the second phase of the R Block-Digha six-lane road under construction.

BSRDCL, an executing agency of state road construction department, is working on a war footing to complete the R Block- Digha Road by June this year. While vehicles are already plying on major section of the 6.3km-long road, bidding process has been initiated for construction of the link road.

BSRDCL’s managing director Sanjay Kumar Agarwal told TOI on Friday that a flyover and an underpass will be constructed in the second phase of the R Block-Digha road project . “Two firms have submitted bids for construction of the link road to Ganga Path rotary and the corresponding construction work will commence by the end of this month. The bidding process will be completed in 10 days to award work order to the selected firm,” Agarwal said.

Giving details of the second phase of the project, Agarwal said: “The first phase of R Block-Digha road culminates 300 metres before the Danapur-Bankipore Road. A 95-metre-long flyover will be constructed over Danapur-Bankipore Road and another 1.2km-long road thereafter to connect to the upcoming rotary of Ganga Path. The link road will pass behind the Food Corporation of India (FCI) a warehouse at Digha. The FCI has also agreed to transfer some land required for the construction of link road.”

Agarwal said while the link road will be ready by June, the first phase of R Block-Digha Road is targeted to be ready by March.

The R Block-Digha Road is passing through Hartali Mor, Punaichak, Shivpuri, Mahesh Nagar, New Patliputra Colony, Rajiv Nagar and Patliputra industrial area. Two lanes of service road are also being constructed on both sides.

Altogether four flyovers are also part of the project and BSRDCL officials said superstructure had been constructed at two places. “We have constructed the superstructure of the flyovers at Rajiv Nagar and Shivpuri, and their approach roads are being constructed at present. Works are underway for construction of the flyover at Hartali Mor, while another flyover over Danapur- Bankipore Road will be constructed in the second phase,” a BSRDCL official said.

GAYA: Maoists, suspected to be members of the armed squad of the CPI (Maoist) torched two vehicles, including a tractor used for carrying construction material under the Banke Bazar police station area in Gaya district late on Thursday evening. The tractor was returning after unloading cement bags at the nearby construction site. No harm was caused to the tractor driver.

The Maoists also left behind a hand note challenging the police. The fight against ‘police atrocity’ will continue, the hand note reads.

Confirming the incident, Gaya SSP Rajiv Mishra said, “No major damage happened during the incident. Raids are being held to nab the culprits,” he said.

Locals claimed that once considered as part of the ‘liberated zone’, Banke Bazar area has in recent years registered a distinct decline in acts of Maoists-led sabotage and subversion.

81,['8/02/2020'],Bihar: Panel to draft statute for teachers’ appointment,"This story is from February 8, 2020

Representative image

PATNA: The appointment of fresh teachers against more than 8,000 vacant sanctioned posts in the universities and colleges of Bihar is likely to commence soon with the constitution of a three-member committee by governor-cum-chancellor to draft a statute in this regard.

The committee consisting of the vice-chancellors of Magadh, Purnea and Munger universities would draft the statute in the light of the new UGC guidelines for appointment of assistant professors. Some new provisions, including academic pay instead of grade pay, would have to be introduced in the new statute. Moreover, the committee would also have to take into consideration the newly drafted statute relating to promotion of teachers under career advancement scheme (CAS). The CAS statute was drafted by a committee headed by Patna University VC Rash Bihari Prasad Singh.

Earlier, the statute for appointment of assistant professors in the universities of Bihar was drafted by a committee consisting of the vice-chancellors of Patna, Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur and Maulana Mazharul Haq Arabic and Persian universities and the same was assented to by the chancellor in 2014. The Bihar Public Service Commission (BPSC) appointed nearly 3,400 assistant professors in different subjects in all the universities of the state on the basis of this very statute.

Now as the newly constituted Bihar State University Service Commission is supposed to initiate the process of appointment of assistant professors, both the state government and the chancellor’s secretariat have felt the necessity of having a new statute for appointment in the light of the recommendations of the 7th pay revision committee of the UGC. The old statute would cease to exist as soon as the new one is assented to by the chancellor and comes into effect.

The state education department has already requisitioned the details of existing vacancies of assistant professors in different subjects from all the universities and the same would be advertised by the university service panel shortly, said sources.

With a view to addressing the issue of shortage of teaching faculty in higher education institutions, the UGC had in the month of June last year issued fresh guidelines for recruitment and also set a time frame of six months for completing the entire process. Unfortunately, Bihar failed to meet the deadline. The UGC guidelines state that the higher education institutions should follow the selection process as per their Acts and statutes and in accordance with the UGC (Minimum Qualifications for Appointment of Teachers and other Academic Staff in Universities and Colleges and other Measures for the Maintenance of Standards in Higher Education) Regulations, 2018.

82,['8/02/2020'],Young lion walks 60km with gang of 3 for quality time with lioness in Gujarat,"This story is from February 8, 2020

RAJKOT: How far would a lover go to meet his girlfriend? Those heads over heels in love may even go ‘saat samundar paar’ (across the seven seas).

But this cupid-struck young lion doesn’t need to cross the seven seas. He walks a distance of around 50-60 km from Rajula, along with this three friends, to meet a lioness near Savarkundla once a fortnight! This strange phenomenon has been observed by the lion trackers and locals living in villages of Rajula and Savarkundla talukas of Amreli for the past one year.

In fact, these four males, believed to be around 4-5 years old, have virtually established their supremacy over a massive area that includes parts of Bhavnagar district too. While they are constantly on the move, beginning from Dungar village near Rajula, after reaching Ambardi near Savarkundla, as the fourth stays back with a lioness there.

“Interestingly, the three others don't want to be 'kabab mein haddi' and allow their friend to spend some private moments with the lioness,” said a lion tracker in Amreli who has been with the forest department for several years.

Sandeep Kumar, deputy conservator of forest (DCF), Shetrunji range said, “It’s commonly observed that three or four lions bond well when they are in nomadic stage. They venture into new territories and move around in big areas. But it’s a temporary association. In this process, they also find female.""

The lions are originally from Patda in Dhari range of Gir (east), but they moved to Dungar near Rajula a year ago.

Forest department trackers confirmed the behaviour of these four and said such is their terror that other prides make a disappearing act seeing them approach close to their area. In fact, they have expanded their reign towards coastal area of Mahua in Bhavnagar district too.

Their ferocity has left many prides in the region petrified, preying on cattle at will and squatting on internal roads too.

“There is a pride in Vadal which quickly moves to safer locations on seeing them arrive,” said another tracker.

On Friday, the four lions were spotted near Dhareshwar village of Rajula, said sources. Himanshu Bhatt, of Savarkundla and part of the lion conservation programme said, “This is the first time we have observed a group of lions that’s moving over a 200 square km.”

Surat: The traffic situation in major parts of the city is likely to ease following Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC)’s decision to swoop down on the roadside vendors and hawkers operating in the ‘no encroachment zones’ across the city.

The civic body has come up with notices at the ‘no encroachment zones’ informing the hawkers and vendors that the carts and goods seized during the anti-encroachment operations will not be returned to them.

Official sources said that there are more than 40,000 hawkers and street vendors operating in the city. There are sizeable number of hawkers who are occupying the no-encroachment zones, which are marked at the main thoroughfares and important roads, creating traffic snarls.

An SMC official said, “There are more than 117 no encroachment zones across the city where the roadside hawking and vending is totally banned. Despite this, the hawkers have been occupying the no encroachment zones for selling their wares. We have pasted notices at all the zones informing the hawkers that the seized goods will not be returned by the civic body.”

He added, “The anti-encroachment department in all the municipal zones has been instructed to carry out regular inspections and drives to remove the hawkers from the no encroachment zones. This will ease the problem of traffic congestion on the main thoroughfares.”

Sources said that about 15% of the hawkers in the city have been doing their business at the no encroachment zones. Every time the municipal staff remove them from the zones and they return back after few days.

Deputy municipal commissioner Ketan Patel said, “The traffic situation on the main thoroughfares has deteriorated due to the presence of hawkers and street vendors. Despite the fact that these roads have been declared no encroachment zones, the hawkers continue to operate there. We have decided to swoop down on such illegal encroachers across the city.”

(From left) Deven Choksi, Vyas and Bakul Dholakia

Surat: Jay Narayan Vyas , former Gujarat minister and economist , said the Union Budget for 2020-21 was long on words and short on clarity coupled with lack of government commitments.

Vyas along with Bakul Dholakia, former director of IIM Ahmedabad, did an analysis of the Union Budget at a programme organized by Sarvajanik Education Society and Surat Realtors’ Association here on Friday.

Vyas said, “This country does not require income tax. Still, the government has disappointed the service class people by introducing various income slabs and standard deductions, which were not required. In the new income tax system, even a common person will directly come under the purview of tax slabs, which is very disappointing.”

Vyas added, “The budget has proposed to double the farmers’ income, which is not going to be achieved merely by minimum support price. In 1970, the average size of a farm was 2.6 hectares, which has come down to just one hectare now and will further decrease to 3,000 square metres by 2030. If there are no villages and farming drops, unemployment will increase by 60% in urban areas.”

According to Vyas, about 12,000 educated unemployed youths and 10,000 farmers committed suicides in 2018-19. The government has come out with a big package for education, but there are no provisions for skill development of students passing out of 12th standard.

Dholakia pointed out that the government has not taken any measures to control slowdown in economy. “It is very intriguing to note how the government is targeting 10% GDP in 2020-21 when the current GDP was around 4.5%. The economy of any country is dependent on demand, production and infrastructure. The country is not facing recession, but glut in the demand.”

86,['8/02/2020'],"Kolkata gets drizzles, Met predicts light rain today","This story is from February 8, 2020

KOLKATA: Despite an overcast sky and a drizzle or two, the city was more or less spared rain on Friday. But the Met office has not ruled out light rain on Saturday. Also, according to weathermen, the mercury is set to slide below the normal mark from Monday.

Thunder cells pushed up by two cyclonic circulations — one over Bihar and another over Vidarbha — reached Kolkata on Friday. The thunder cells, however, were not potent enough to trigger widespread rain. The sky will continue to be overcast on Saturday, too, with the possibility of light showers in and around the city.

“The cloud cover over Kolkata was medium to low on Friday. As a result, we did not get much rain. Most of the rainfall occurred in Odisha and parts of Bengal adjacent to Odisha,” said G K Das, director ( weather ) at Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC), Kolkata.

The same weather system is expected to push up more cloud formations and trigger a few spells of rain on Saturday. But the Met office said the intensity of the spells will be light.

As the chill-bearing dry northwesterly wind has stopped breezing into the city over the past few days, the minimum temperature has been climbing steadily. However, it has not crossed the normal mark yet. On Friday, at 16.3°C, it stayed on the normal mark. The clouds, though, pushed the maximum temperature five notches below normal to stand at 23.5°C. While the night temperature is likely to remain around 16°C, the maximum will continue to slip further.

“Because of the existing cloud cover, the day will continue to be pleasant on Saturday too. Once the sky gets clear of the clouds, the mercury will start falling again,” said Das.

The minimum temperature is expected to touch the 13°C mark by Monday morning and hover arou-nd 13°C-14°C for the next few days.

“It will not be chilly. But since the mercury will slip below the normal mark, and with this trend persisting for the next few days, the cold feeling will stay,” Das added.

Last month has been rainiest January since 2013 when the city experienced 42.5mm rain. These spells have managed to get the cold feeling to persist. The rain has brought the AQI down as well. Till last week, the AQI was either good or satisfactory on most days. Currently, it is moderate.

MUMBAI: Airtel chief information officer (India operations) Anjani Rathor has joined HDFC Bank as chief digital officer ( CDO ). He joins in place of Nitin Chugh , who has moved to Ujjivan Small Finance Bank as its CEO.

HDFC Bank has not had a CDO since May 2019, when Chugh had moved out. The CDO at HDFC Bank has become an important post in the wake of the mobile application being the primary channel for customers to transact with the lender.

According to the bank, 92% of customer transactions take place through its mobile app and internet banking. Also, a large chunk of its unsecured loans are approved through digital channels.

In Airtel, Rathor was responsible for digitisation initiatives across the organisation. This included digitisation of processes and building the social media platform. He had started his career with Citicorp and worked with Boeing before joining Airtel.

A Bharti spokesperson confirmed the development. An HDFC Bank spokesperson, however, did not comment. Rathor has had experience in the financial sector, having created and deployed Airtel Money and building up the network around it.

Meanwhile, HDFC Bank is using digital to go beyond traditional banking and provide customers a platform where they can do banking and other transactions. Last month. HDFC Bank launched myApps — a suit of white-label banking products, which could be used by urban local bodies, housing societies and local clubs to digitise all their transactions.

BENGALURU: Education technology company Byju’s has raised another $200 million at a valuation of close to $8 billion as part of its ongoing round of funding. This round may see the company raise a total of $500 million to $1 billion. The additional capital was infused by existing backer General Atlantic , coming on the heels of a $200-million infusion by Tiger Global last month.

The new capital continues the rapid increase in Byju’s valuation over the last 24 months, from about $1 billion in early 2018, cementing its position as the world’s most valuable education technology company as it undertakes global expansion.

“Today, over 65% of our students are from outside the top 10 cities. This is a validation of how technology can make high-quality learning content more accessible to students, irrespective of their geographies,” said founder Byju Raveendran in a statement.

The company, which informed it has 42 million registered users and 3 million paid subscribers, said it plans to roll out programmes in vernacular languages besides also launching online tutoring in coming months.

Byju’s had reported a 174% increase in revenues on a standalone basis to Rs 1,341 crore, while the company also turned a profit of little over Rs 20 crore in the financial year ending March 31, 2019.

89,['8/02/2020'],Daily wage Patna Municipal Corporation workers’ strike continues for 5th day,"This story is from February 8, 2020

Huge garbage on road near Boaring canal road in Patna on Friday.

PATNA: The strike of daily wage sanitation workers in Patna continued for the fifth day on Friday. Though urban development and housing department (UDHD) minister Suresh Kumar Sharma said the situation will improve in couple of days, foul smell from the trash lying on the road and near market areas has made life difficult for Patnaites.

“I hope they will resume their work soon or we will rope in private agencies for carrying out the work,” Sharma said.

Patna Municipal Corporation also took the service of some additional workers from two private firms on Friday, said PMC public relations officer Harshita. She said, “On Thursday, sweeping was done through machines, but now we will start lifting the garbage and dumping it to Ramachak Bairiya as we have hired drivers and workers.”

DM Kumar Ravi said the vehicles used for collecting the garbage and deflated by the agitators had also been repaired. Ravi said garbage had been picked up from Patna City circle and the team will work in full capacity in other areas.

However, one of the PMC officials said, “Over 4,000 daily wage sanitation workers are on strike and the number of those working is not even one-third of that strength. ”

Residents also complained about the partiality in carrying out sanitation work. “I have not seen anyone cleaning the road or picking garbage from my locality. May be only VIP area is the PMC’s priority. If garbage is not removed immediately, I will definitely have some disease,” said Bhanwar Pokhar resident Shofra Orooj.

Anil Kumar, who works in a stationary shop at Khazanchi Road, said there was no cleanliness work there.

Even agitating workers at Maurya Lok Complex did not seem to be in a mood of calling off their strike. “They will have to listen to us. It is not possible for any other person to do the kind of work which we do every day,” said Ranjeev Kumar, who drives JCB to pick garbage. His fellow agitator Nawal Kishore added, “Is it an easy job to clean the drain or pick the garbage? I have been doing such work for the past 15 years and all I want is to continue my work as daily wage worker, even if the government does not make us permanent soon.”

Workers further cited exploitation from outsource agency as one of the reasons behind their strike. “Government says we will get priority in jobs by private agencies, but everyone knows they much less than they say. Many of our fellow workers working for such agencies have not been paid for five months? We do not want to face such situation,” said Ram Thakur. He even alleged outsourcing will lead to corruption.

PMC mayor Sita Sahu said she was trying to convince the workers to resume their duty. “We will move to court and hope for positive result,” she said.

Daily wage workers went on strike on Monday after a letter was issued to all the urban local bodies to stop taking their services, and instead outsource the job. UDHD had cited an order of Lokayukta and malpractices in hiring daily wage labourers as the reason for that. However, after the strike on Monday, UDHD issued another letter in which it extended the deadline for keeping daily wage workers till March 31.

Representative image

KOLKATA: Automobile buyers will now get delivery of their vehicles from the dealers along with the high security registration plates (HSRP) that will have the registration mark embossed on them — without paying anything extra. The transport department has empowered the motor vehicle dealers to emboss the registration mark on the HSRPs.

The transport department has instructed all motor vehicle dealers to affix HSRPs without charging extra and henceforth, officials said, no new vehicle will be delivered without the plate.

Earlier, customers needed to visit RTOs and stand in queue to get the HSRPs attached to their vehicles. Temporary registration numbers used to be issued by dealers, which were later replaced by HSRPs. Now, dealers will just have to apply online for registration of a new vehicle on behalf of customers in the e-VAHAN online system and upload the necessary documents. After validation, the RTO will approve the registration online. The registration number will then be generated and the dealers can access it online.

According to a transport department official, this will make it easier for a dealer to emboss the registration mark on the HSRP, which will then be affixed to the vehicles and the unique code of the HSRP will be automatically uploaded in the e-VAHAN database through API/web service protocol.

However, this transition preceded a series of meetings with vehicle dealers and National Informatics Centre to ensure smooth integration of HSRP data in the VAHAN system. The transport department finally issued the order to implement this model of HSRP attachment with effect from February 1. The order was challenged in Calcutta HC, but the court upheld it.

“Those who opt for special numbers can also get the HSRPs from dealers after the allotment of a registration number of their choice,” the official said.

The one-year MCLR comes down to 7.85% per annum from 7.90% with effect from February 10. This is the ninth consecutive cut in MCLR in FY20.The rate revision is on account of a reduction in the cost of funds before the policy. “The impact of the recent RBI policy measures and reduction in deposit rates will be reflected in the next review of MCLR,” the bank said in a statement. The one-year MCLR is the benchmark used by SBI for loans before October 2019 and non-retail loans. New borrowers get their loans at rates linked to the repo rate. The MCLR reduction would mean that older customers stand to benefit.The bank also reduced its deposit rates by 10-50 bps citing surplus liquidity in the system. This lowered interest rate on retail term deposits (less than Rs 2 crore) and bulk term deposits (Rs 2 crore and above) with effect from February 10. The bank slashed term deposits rates by 10-50 bps in the retail segment and 25-50 bps in the bulk segment.On Friday, the RBI had left its repo rate unchanged at 5.15%, but said it would lend up to Rs 1 lakh crore to banks at the repo rate. This is lower than the cost of funds for most banks. Meanwhile, Bank of India cut its MCLR by 10 bps for maturities of up to 6 months. Additionally, the bank has reduced interest rates on housing loan, which will now be available from 8%.Oriental Bank of Commerce also cut its MCLR by up to 10 bps across various tenors with effect from February 10. The bank retained its one-year MCLR at 8.15%, but reduced one-month and overnight rates by 0.10% and 0.05%, respectively, it said.Canara Bank on Thursday had reduced its MCLR on loans and advances across all tenors. The bank has reduced interest rate by 25 bps for overnight, one month, three months and six months. And has reduced MCLR by 15 bps for one-year tenor with effect from February 7. As a result of the change, the interest rates charged for overnight and one-month loans would be 7.65%. For three-month tenor loans, the MCLR would be 7.95%; for six months 8.10% and one-year 8.20%.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74023699,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-643974,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sbi-3-others-cut-deposit-loan-rates/articleshow/74017360.cms

(Representative image)

CHENNAI: India Cements , south India’s largest cement maker by volume, on Friday said poor demand coupled with weak prices pushed its quarterly performance for the period ended December 2019 into red. The company reported a net loss of Rs 5.4 crore as against a net profit of Rs 3.1 crore a year ago.

“Demand momentum of the first quarter did not sustain. We were caught under pressure of falling prices, weak demand and temptation to sell at low prices,” said vice-chairman & managing director N Srinivasan.

He said Andhra Pradesh has stopped all infrastructure projects after the new government came to power and there was a slowdown in infrastructure spending by the Telangana government. Tamil Nadu and Karnataka were flat and that impacted the company’s performance. “Our cost control initiatives saved us,” he said. The company’s plants pumped out cement at just 69% of their rated capacity as against 76% a year ago.

Net Plant Realisation (price of cement after all expenses) dropped to Rs 3,342 a tonne from Rs 3,501 year-on-year.

During the quarter the company witnessed a 10% drop in cement and clinker production at 26.66 lakh tonnes.

“Since January, there has been a demand pick up and we hope this will sustain,” he said.

Aurangabad: The residents of Zone 6 stormed the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation’s (AMC) ward office on Friday demanding reduction in water and property taxes. They said that the cement roads constructed in the Cidco N-2 area are of poor quality.

Around 100 residents of the Cidco N-2 area, under the banner of Samajik Nyay Sangharsh Samiti, took out a protest march from Mukundwadi to Zone 6 ward office on the Jalgaon Road. The residents held banners and raised slogans to push for various demands.

They submitted a memorandum of demands to ward officer Mira Chavan. The memorandum stated that the Cidco N-2 area receives drinking water from the municipal corporation once in five days for about 50 minutes. The protesters said that due to the lack of enough space, they are unable to store water that can suffice for five days. Therefore, charging Rs 4,050 per year towards water tax is atrocious, said residents.

They also opposed the property tax rates in the area. The protesters said that while they were under the jurisdiction of Cidco, the houses were taxed Rs 10 to 12 a year. But today, they are compelled to pay property taxes up to Rs 5,000 a year. They stated that due to closure of industrial units in MIDC Chikalthana, many are facing livelihood crisis while the hike in property tax is adding to their woes.

The residents demanded reduction of up to Rs 1,800in water taxes and exemption of taxes for properties smaller than 600 sq ft.

Raising the issue of poor quality of road work in front of the Mukundwadi police station, the residents sought action against civic engineers and the contractor assigned with the task of constructing the road. The road was constructed three years ago through a private contractor. When asked, AMC junior engineer Santosh Gaikwad said that the road work in question has been repaired by the same agency who constructed it. “The agency is responsible for the maintenance of the road for a five-year period. There were some issues with the road surface which have been corrected now,” Gaikwad said.

Ward officer Mira Chavan said the issues raised by Cidco N-2 residents have been forwarded to the officials concerned.

Chennai: Early impact of the the Corona virus outbreak in China has resulted in a a 10% drop in gems and jewellery exports to the country in January, with a potential impact of 5%-10% drop for the fiscal. Colin Shah, vice chairman, Gems and Jewellery Exports Promotion Council, said that the export of polished diamonds were down by 10% last month, when the industry was looking at improving the business as it was the new year season in China - a season when demand picks up. “This is when the demand generally goes up for polished diamonds from India and we began to see brisk exports in the end of December and initial few days of January. Exports, however, fell 10%, much to our disappointment,” added Shah. The sector was already seeing a drop in exports to China and HongKong caused by the trade war in the former and widespread protests in the latter. Data from the Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council shows that April-December already saw a 51% drop in the fiscal until December for China, owing to subdued demand caused by the US-China trade war. China stands second in the import of polished diamonds from India, with 15% of the market share. Besides China, exports to Hong Kong also went down by close to 10% in January. “Majority of the polished diamond exports to China are done via Hongkong and this (virus outbreak) will dent the demand. We were expecting to do good business since the market started to recover from a break from the anti-government protests. April-December 2019 already saw a 8.5% fall with the business being hit by the protests. This may mean that the exports would further be dented,” added Shah.

Rajkot: One of the two GST inspectors booked for accepting bribe of Rs 75,000 was arrested along with his peon at GST office in Surendranagar on Friday.

According to the Rajkot anti-corruption bureau (ACB) officials, GST inspector Rajiv Yadav (32) was arrested after his peon Ravi Joshi identified him and also another GST inspector Gaurav Arora. Joshi was caught accepting the bribe on behalf of Yadav.

The accused had demanded the bribe from the complainant in order to waive off penalty of Rs 5 lakh. The accused pointed out to the complainant that the GST number on his factory’s signboard was not clearly visible which made him liable for penalty.

“The accused told the complainant that if he wanted the penalty to be waived off, he would have to cough up Rs 2.5 lakh. However later, they scaled down the amount to Rs 75,000. Meanwhile, the complainant approached us and we laid the trap, leading to the arrests of the accused. Another accused, Arora, could not be arrested as he was out of the office,” said H P Doshi, deputy superintendent of police, Rajkot ACB.

PATNA: Two farmers were killed by blue bulls in separate incidents in Siwan district since Thursday evening. A 55-year-old farmer, Ram Shankar Rai, was killed by a blue bull at Sohawan Hata village under Barharia police station early Friday morning when he had gone to answer nature’s call. In a similar incident, one Sitaram Prasad was killed by another blue bull at Mahuari village under Siwan Mufassil police station on Thursday evening.

Both the bodies were handed over to the respective families after postmortem. Siwan SDPO Jitendra Pandey said local police have received complaints about blue bulls menace in different parts of the district. “We have alerted the forest department officials,” he said.

In Supaul, 31-year-old Manjesh Yadav was shot dead by a group of armed men on the outskirts of Brahmapur village under Sadar police station around Thursday midnight. The deceased was a resident of Nauhatta Chowk in neighbouring Saharsa district. His elder brother Ranjeet Rai lodged an FIR against six people. Ranjeet told the police that Sunit Kumar along with his associates killed Manjesh following a dispute over a plot of land at Brahmapur.

Supaul Sadar SDPO Vidyasagar said Sunit’s motorbike was recovered from the site of occurrence on Friday morning. “Raids are on to nab the accused,” the SDPO said on Friday.

In Saran, the police recovered the body of six-year-old Shashi Kishan Kumar from Tara Amnaur village under Maker police station on Friday morning.

99,['8/02/2020'],Bihar: Bankers to hold special drive for farmers,"This story is from February 8, 2020

Representative image

PATNA: The bankers on Friday agreed with deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi to hold a special four-day drive in the state from February 12 to issue Kisan Credit Cards (KCCs) to farmers who have registered themselves for the benefits under PM Kisan Samman Yojana (PMKY) — that is, payment of Rs 6,000 in three equal instalments.

It is hoped that most of the registered farmers with the state government who don’t have KCCs would be covered during the special drive, which would end on February 15. Modi told the bankers that as many as 60 lakh farmers had registered under the PMKY, but only 32 lakh of them had been issued KCCs.

Modi gave his advisory to the bankers at the 71st meeting of the State Level Bankers’ Committee (SLBC) held here on Friday. Modi also suggested that the bankers should see that the lapsed KCCs of the farmers in general were also renewed, besides increasing the loan limit that is given to the KCC holders. Further, he said that the farmers should also be issued KCCs for conducting fishery and cattle rearing activities and, accordingly, they should also be given loans for such activities, as per the instructions of the Centre and the guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

At the SLBC meet, Modi expressed serious concern over the serial fall in the achievements made by the bankers in loan lending against the target fixed for loaning activities under the state’s Annual Credit Plan (ACP) that is prepared by National Bank of Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD). Loans have to be given under priority sector areas that include agriculture, micro small medium enterprises (MSMEs) and other heads.

Citing the figures for the last three years, Modi said the overall achievements made against the annual target fixed for loaning was 66.56% on December 31, 2017, followed by 57.40% at the end of December 2018, and 54.58% at the end of December 2019. Accordingly, Modi asked the bankers to achieve the target limit of 90% by the end of the 2019-20 fiscal, ending March 31 this year.

Modi pointed out that there were 10 districts in the state which showed lowest mark of achievements in percentage terms. The most glaring lowest figures pertained to Banka, Jehanabad, Nalanda and Madhubani districts. Modi advised the bankers to identify the banks which have been laggards as far as lending activities were concerned, and also take requisite steps at their own level to increase the loaning activities, so that comparatively high achievements were made by the banks concerned.

In the same vein, Modi also appealed to the farmers and others concerned to make timely repayment of loans, as bankers feared the mounting of non-performing assets (NPAs). He noted that the NPA in the state at the level of 11.5% was lower than the national average of 12%, while mentioning the extraordinary performance of the Self-Help Groups (SHGs) in whose case the loan repayment was to the tune of 98.5%. He said loan repayment was 100% in the case of non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), even as they charged high interest of 20% on the loans that they gave.

Expressing concern that the number of business correspondents (BCs) appointed by the bankers in the unbanked villages and areas to conduct the transactions had reduced by 942, Modi asked the bankers to present updated figures regarding new bank branches and ATMs opened, as well as new BCs appointed, at the next SLBC meet.

Meanwhile, State Bank of India (SBI) informed Modi that it would install 1,500 more ATMs in Patna Circle.

100,['8/02/2020'],2019 saw highest number of tourists in Bihar,"This story is from February 8, 2020

More than three crore tourists are coming to state annually

PATNA: At the beginning of this millennium, Bihar tourism was taking baby steps with about 61 lakh tourists, including foreigners, visiting the state in 2001. Two decades on, it has taken a giant leap with 3.5 crore footfall in 2019 — a nearly six-fold jump. In fact, 2019 saw the footfall in the past two decades.

In the same period, arrival of foreign tourists has seen a 12-fold increase from 85,673 in 2001 to 10.9 lakh in 2019, according to a state tourism department report.

“Till 2005, the number of tourists was in lakhs, but from 2006 onwards it crossed the one crore mark. More than three crore tourists are coming to state annually now. The number of foreign tourists visiting the state, which was hardly a lakh till 2006, has also increased to over 10 lakh,” Rishi said.

He added: “From providing hotels, to transport and most importantly security, the tourism department is providing every facility to tourists. We make sure that every tourist, especially foreigners, who are not very familiar with our culture, are treated with utmost respect and are given the best facilities.”

A senior Bihar State Tourism Development Corporation official said the two UNESCO world heritage sites in the state — the Mahabodhi temple in Bodhgaya and the Nalanda ruins —are two of the most sought after destinations. “Over 5 lakh foreigners visited Gaya and Bodhgaya last year. Besides, 1.8 lakh and 1.7 lakh foreign tourists came to Rajgir and Nalanda in 2019,” he said.

The official added: “Several tourism circuits, to provide a well-defined entry and exit points to prominent cities, have been created in order to provide a seamless travel experience to tourists. Some of the most sought-after tourism circuits in the state are Buddhist circuit and Sikh circuit.”

Arun Kumar Ojha, member of Bodh Gaya Hotelier Association, said, “Bodhgaya is the epicentre of global Buddhist pilgrimage. Despite both places not having any night life or amusement spots, tourists from Buddhist countries as well as Europe visit in large numbers.”

He added: “With the launch of direct flights from several countries, the footfall of foreign tourists has increased manifold. There are now direct flights to Gaya from Rangoon, Paro in Bhutan and Hanoi in Vietnam among other countries.”

Travel and hospitality experts in Patna said religious events and pilgrimage form the core of tourism sector in Bihar. “Be it Sonepur Mela in November or Shrawani Mela in August, people in lakhs visit the state. For foreign tourists, the Pitarpaksha Mela held in Punpun and Gaya remains a major attraction. Around 20,000 foreigners visited the state for the Pitarpaksha Mela organised in September, last year. The number was hardly 8,000 in 2018,"" a city-based travel expert said.

On the importance of the Sikh circuit in the state, M S Dhillon, secretary of Takhat Sri Harmandir Ji Prabandhak Committee said, “Earlier, people only knew that Guru Gobind Singh was born in Patna Sahib. They didn’t know much about Guru Nanak Dev's connection with Bihar. In 2017, when the 350th birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh was organised , people started knowing more about the state's connection with Sikhism. As of now, the number of pilgrims visiting the state has quadrupled.”

File photo

JAMMU: Expressing deep anguish and concern over slapping of Public Safety Act (PSA) on erstwhile J&K state former chief minister Omar Abdullah , National Conference on Friday described it as PSA on the entire mainstream political ideology of J&K.

The J&K Union territory administration had on Thursday slapped PSA on Omar Abdullah and ex-CM Mehbooba Mufti of People's Democratic Party (PDP). The stringent Act had already been invoked against Omar's father Farooq Abdullah - a five-time ex-CM and former Union minister - nearly six months ago.

In a joint statement issued from Sher-e-Kashmir Bhavan here after a meeting, senior NC leaders said the stringent Act against the senior party leadership was shocking, especially in view of their huge contribution to ensuring peace and harmony in J&K.

They recalled the fervent appeal made by Omar minutes before his detention on August 4 last year, urging people to maintain peace and calm at all costs. ""How could leaders with such vision and statesmanship be threat to peace? Especially those who have remained at the forefront to promote harmony and brotherhood,"" NC leaders asked while terming the latest move as imposition of PSA on the entire mainstream political ideology of J&K.

Referring to the slapping of PSA on Farooq, initially for three months which was later extended by another three months, the NC statement said his continued detention was sad and unfortunate, especially in view of his immense contribution towards nation-building and sustaining peace, harmony, democracy and progress in J&K during the most testing times.

This is to undermine his (Farooq's) huge contribution to nation-building by belittling his internationally acclaimed political stature. NC leaders recalled that former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had once described Farooq as a towering patriot. They also said Vajpayee had immense affection for Omar.

""The harsh move made last (Thursday) evening is the biggest setback to democratic polity...,"" the NC statement said. It urged the Centre to review the decision of PSA on mainstream leaders and release all those detained unconditionally.

103,['8/02/2020'],BMC official accused of killing son gets HC relief,"This story is from February 8, 2020

Aurangabad: The Aurangabad bench of Bombay high court has granted bail to a 57-year-old man accused of killing his 32-year-old son.

The court, while expressing displeasure over delayed police action, has also directed commissioner of police for “necessary enquiry into the matter and take further action”.

The accused, who works in Mumbai with the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), was arrested on October 9, 2019 while his son was killed in April 2018. According to police, the man killed his son as the latter was objecting to former’s illegal relationship.

An offence was registered with Pundalik Nagar police station under sections 302, 203 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Jadhav approached high court seeking bail in the case through lawyer Abhay K Bhosale pointing out that “there is no direct evidence and the motive sought to be attributive is fragile.’’

Bhosale argued that the applicant is being implicated on mere suspicion.

Justice Mangesh S Patil, while allowing the bail application, observed: “The deceased was found dead in his bed room on the upper floor of the house. During the autopsy in the month of April 2018, it was transpired that the cause of death of deceased was ligature strangulation. No offence was registered for a period of one-and-a-half year. It is only on October 9, 2019 that the offence was registered at the instance of that the officer who was carrying out enquiry in connection with the Accidental Death case No. 23/2018. The FIR mentions about the reasons for the delay, but no reasonable man can believe genuineness of the reasons.’’

He added, “It is indeed surprising that in spite of it being a case of ligature strangulation, the offence has not been registered for a period of one-and-a-half year. Needless to state that precious time was lost which must have adversely affected the investigation. One can easily comprehend that it is a failure of the police machinery to register the crime which must, in all probabilities, have resulted in material evidence being lost. Certainly, it is a matter to be enquired into and investigated.’’

AURANGABAD: The Aurangabad bench of Bombay High Court recently directed the divisional commissioner (Aurangabad) to consider the inquiry committee report on irregularity in the tendering process for the road works involving a sum of over Rs 9.5 crore even though the whole process was cancelled.

The court also directed the divisional commissioner “to ensure initiation of action against the erring officials or individuals and to see that the exercise initiated by him reaches to its logical end within reasonable period without there being any inordinate delay in the matter”.

Beed municipal councillor Amar Marutirao Naikwade (37) had moved court through lawyer Sayyed Tauseef Yaseen by filing public interest litigation in 2019 challenging the tender process and seeking stern action against erring officials and individuals involved in the wrongdoing.

In response to the notice, district collector through chief officer of Beed municipal council, Rohidas Atmaram Dorkulkar, filed an affidavit to the effect that the entire tender process has been cancelled.

The petitioner had also brought to the court’s notice that an inquiry committee, comprising assistant regional director, Group-B, Municipal Council Administration and Accounts Officer, Municipal Council Administration, both attached to the office of divisional commissioner, was also constituted.

While disposing of the PIL, justices Prasanna B Varale and R G Avacaht observed: “The inquiry committee submitted a detailed report referring to 10 issues and then also recorded observations on consideration of the material placed before the committee. Most of the observations referred to irregularities and report concludes with the statement that the submission of the report before the divisional commissioner for his perusal would be appropriate so that the divisional commissioner can take further steps.”

Yavatmal: Former Inspector General of Police Abdur Rehman, who resigned from the IPS to protest CAA , NRC and NPR, addressed a public meeting on Thursday evening at Kalamb Chowk. He extended his support to the agitation launched here by Muslim women on the lines of the Shaheen Bagh agitation underway in New Delhi.

On Friday, Speaker of state legislative assembly Nana Patole also visited the pandal of the agitators and interacted with the protesting women.

Rehman vehemently criticised the Modi government and said the NDA government is trying to divide the country on the basis of caste and religion. The CAA, NRC and NPR are intended to marginalize minority Muslims , he said, adding it is against the Constitution, and the secular fabric of India.

He questioned Modi’s calculated silence when women are forced to come on to the streets to protect their own existence, while he was vociferous while scrapping the triple talaq bill was passed in Parliament.

Rehman also trained his gun at UP chief minister Adityanath Yogi for his recent statements against the Muslim community.

“India is our motherland and no force in the world can snatch our right to live peacefully in this country,” Rehman said. He urged the gathering to continue their agitation on a peaceful path.

Rehman, who has earlier worked as SP of Yavatmal , also addressed women protesters at Pusad and Digras tehsils.

Gorakhpur: A police sub-inspector posted at Badharganj police station on Friday staged a sit-in in front of Dr BR Ambedkar’s statue in Gorakhpur demanding safety of his family in Jaunpur alleging harassment at the hands of land sharks.

Clad in uniform, sub-inspector Rahul Rao reached Ambedkar crossing and staged a protest holding a banner which read: “Yogi ji, bhu-mafia se mere ghar wale aur hamari zameen bachao. Police ka koi officer sun nahi raha hai. Main majboor hoon. (Yogi ji, please save my family and land from land grabbers. Police authorities are not paying heed to my complaint. I am helpless.).”

I am feeling helpless as my family’s safety is at stake. A court case is on and we have a stay order too but we are getting threats,” he said.

This is in line with the National Centre for Disease Control’s ( NCDC ) new guidelines on 2019-nCoV, which recommend tracking of “suspected coronavirus patients for 14-days.”The NCDC guideline states, “Kindly correlate the results with clinical findings. A negative result in a single upper respiratory tract sample does not rule out 2019-nCoV infection. Hence, in such cases, a repeat sample should be sent. Lower respiratory tract samples (sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL), endotracheal aspirate) are appropriate samples for 2019-nCoV testing, especially in severe and progressive lung disease.”NCDC policy of suspected cases states that the discharge of patients will be governed by his provisional /confirmed diagnosis and it is up to the treating physician to take a decision. Patients shall be monitored for 14 days after their discharge.The minister also said that the government was compiling a list of frequent travellers from Madhya Pradesh to China. They include people from business community and students. Silawat said that, I have been monitoring the issues on day to day basis.

NAGPUR: Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh claimed that phone calls of senior BJP members like Eknath Khadse were tapped during the previous Devendra Fadnavis-led government. Earlier, names of only Congress and NCP functionaries, including that of Sharad Pawar, had emerged in the phone tapping incident.“I’ve received many complaints that calls of even BJP leaders like Khadse were tapped. We will inquire about it through our two-member panel that was already constituted to probe the snooping on Congress, BJP and Shiv Sena leaders,” he told TOI adding that Khadse himself hasn’t made any complaint.The phone-tapping incident came to fore after the assembly polls in October where the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government charged the BJP government with snooping on its leaders along with human rights activists and lawyers, opposing the right wing agenda, using Israeli software ‘Pegasus’.“The issue is serious and therefore, we’ve decided to have two teams to reach the root of incident,” added Deshmukh.While categorically denying the charges, Fadnavis, now leader of the opposition, told TOI that when his government didn’t tap opposition leaders’ calls, there was no question of doing it for BJP leaders. “Without any concrete proof, the minister is making such irresponsible statements. While at the helm of such a responsible position, he shouldn’t be making any such claims without evidence,” he told TOI.Deshmukh also told TOI that the MVA government was contemplating to bring a new legislation where it would be made mandatory for all old and new buildings to have a CCTV cameras installed outside their premises. According to him, it would not only help the residents, but also the police to keep a tab on law and order situation.“It would be done in a phased manner starting with Mumbai and followed by Pune and Nagpur where CCTV cameras network is already available. Later, other cities would be covered. The cameras on all buildings would be connected with the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS) of city police. A place like Mumbai already has thousands of cameras and with the help of a CCTV network, the cops would be in a better position to monitor and track crime,” said Deshmukh.On Elgar Parishad case, the minister refused to share details of legal opinion on National Investigation Agency’s (NIA) move to take over its probe.Last month, Fadnavis had tweeted that “phone tapping of opposition leaders is not a tradition of Maharashtra”. “Our government never gave such an order. The present (Maha Vikas Aghadi’s) government is free to do any probe by any agency. Even Shiv Sena leaders were a part of home ministry then,” he had tweeted pointing out that former minister of state for home Deepak Kesarkar was from Sena.",nagpur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74020057,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-122278,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bjp-tapped-phones-of-own-netas-like-khadse-deshmukh/articleshow/74017199.cms

The boy reported extreme discomfort and after suggestions by local doctors, the parents brought him to Civil Hospital in Ahmedabad for diagnosis.Dr Rakesh Joshi , professor and head of paediatric surgery department at Civil Hospital, said that the condition is identified as emphysema where air under the skin causes bloating of face with chest wall and even around the heart. “After stabilization and preview of the x-ray and CT scan, we found the culprit — it was a half peanut which had got lodged in his windpipe ,” he said.Along with Dr Shakuntala Goswami, Dr Joshi performed bronchoscopy and located the peanut in the left bronchus (air passage). The piece was removed with optical forceps. “We believe that the boy might have accidentally inhaled the piece of peanut or it might have got lodged after the boy tried to swallow it. Due to his tender age, the piece caused damage to windpipe and the air that escaped from the pipe got lodged below the skin,” said Dr Joshi.The post-operative recovery was satisfactory and the boy was discharged on Thursday as the swelling disappeared and the windpipe condition improved. “If not treated in time, such an incident can cause irreparable damage to the internal organs. It’s a caution for the parents of toddlers not to allow them to play with tiny objects that they can swallow or inhale,” said Dr Joshi. “We can take an example of water accidentally entering the windpipe sometimes — it causes discomfort along with uncontrolled coughing and watering of eyes. Now imagine if a foreign object gets lodged in air passage, it causes difficulty in breathing, coughing and pain in chest.”",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74019696,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-116742,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/peanut-in-windpipe-caused-three-year-old-to-balloon/articleshow/74016374.cms

Dr Praveen Kumar, a homeopathy practitioner from Ashok Nagar, said, “Many walk-in patients have asked for the medicine, especially those who are frequent travellers,” adding, “The medicine has been known to prevent swine flu, dengue and has no side effects. One just needs four pills a day for five days.”However, allopathic doctors are sceptical about its efficacy.

BHOPAL: Delayed by almost a month, the Budget session of Madhya Pradesh Assembly is likely to be held from March 16, after Holi. Finance minister Tarun Bhanot is expected to present the budget on March 20.

Facing a severe financial crunch with state’s share in Centre being drastically slashed, the Kamal Nath government is in a fix to mop up additional revenue to funds its pet projects and welfare schemes. Still, the cash-strapped state government has announced not to impose new taxes on the public and decided to raise revenue through alternate finance mechanism (AFM).

The Budget session of the assembly is normally held during last week of February. MP government decided to come with the fiscal plan in March after thorough discussions and planning on alternative measures to generate revenue. “As the tradition is, the budget session will begin with the customary address of the Governor. The government provides 30 days after the notification to allow assembly secretariat to collect questions and proposals to be discussed during the session. We are waiting for government instructions on the same,” said principal secretary of Vidhan Sabha , AP Singh.

Sources in finance department disclosed that the budget is being prepared after discussions with the NABARD ( National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development), financial and banking experts. The government aims to continue with its flagship schemes like farm loan waiver, Swabhiman Yojana (stipend to unemployed youth), MNREGS, CM mass marriage scheme, Ladli Laxmi and destitute pension.

“The government has limited sources of revenue. GST regime has further narrowed its flexibility to mobilise resources or go for additional taxation and revenue receipts are largely dependent on state’s share from the Centre. Still, we have decided to impose no new tax. With efficient fiscal management and vision of chief minister Kamal Nath to promote industry and tourism, we will invite investors and come up with attractive plans for tourist destinations to generate revenue and jobs,” finance minister, Tarun Bhanot told TOI.

INDORE: As 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) continues to shock the world with over 600 deaths reported so far and sending researchers scrambling for a cure, Indian scientists are divided whether the new virus would die out in summer, on the lines of earlier strains like SARS and MERS.A section of scientists believes that the novel virus will die out as temperature soars, while others feel it is more aggressive form of coronavirus and yet to achieve its peak spread.Coronaviruses — like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) virus, noticed in Hong Kong in 2003 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) virus, first seen in Saudi Arabia in 2012 — are known to die out during summer season.Professor V Nagaraja, department of Microbiology and Cell Biology, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru said, “This pace of outbreak will slow down in next one or two months as weather turns warm. It happened with SARS and MERS. These viruses cannot handle warmer host body temperature.”“Novel coronavirus is serious but there were other fatal outbreaks also in the past,” said the professor, who was in Indore to attend a conference on bio-medical sciences.Some however feel that 2019 novel coronavirus is more aggressive. Padma Shri , Seyed E Hasnain, vice chancellor of Jamia Hamdard university, New Delhi and professor of biological sciences said, “Coronavirus is the worst thing to have happened in 2020 and many states unfortunately are embarking on the presumption that with onset of summer, the virus will be dead.”He said that it was just a hope that with rise in temperature, novel coronavirus would be contained and there was no scientific proof of this theory. “Viruses are susceptible to heat no doubt but there are viruses that survive. And coronavirus is not an ordinary virus, it is far more aggressive,” said Hasnain.He claimed that around 50 per cent confirmed coronavirus cases were asymptomatic, which meant they did not have systems and could not be diagnosed until tested. “If we have that problem (coronavirus) in India, it would be a disaster far more than an atom bomb being dropped on the country,” he added.The novel coronavirus, which was first detected in central Chinese city of Wuhan on December 13 last year, has till now killed more than 636 people in the country. As of Thursday, the total number of confirmed cases jumped by 3,143, pushing the total number of infections to 31,161.At least 25 countries have reported confirmed cases of the virus till now.",indore,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74023416,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-154924,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/indore/will-rising-temperature-take-sting-out-of-ncov/articleshow/74016245.cms

PUNE: A gunny sack godown near Balaji hotel at Pisoli was gutted in a blaze that started around 1.30am on Friday.

No one was injured in the incident. The cause of the fire has not been ascertained yet.

The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) fire brigade control room received a call from a hotelier that the godown was on fire and thick black fumes were emanating from the premises.

The control room referred the caller to the Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) fire brigade as the godown came under the Pisoli gram panchayat and not under the PMC limits. A PMRDA fire tender rushed to the spot. On ascertaining the magnitude of the fire, officials summoned seven fire tenders, including three from the PMRDA and four from the Pune Municipal Corporation.

PMRDA fire officer Vijay Mahajan told TOI, “We sprayed water on the godown, spread across three gunthas, and brought the fire under control within 45 minutes. We then uprooted the shutter and sprayed water on the gunny sacks and doused the fire in a span of over two hours.”

“The impact of the blaze was such that it gutted the godown completely,” he said.

“The firemen sprayed water on properties around the godown and prevented the flames from spreading. The fire tenders rushed to the spot in shortest possible time and started the fire fighting operation. The fire could have caused massive damage to neighbouring properties,” Mahajan said.

He said that the cause of the major fire could not be established immediately. Mukesh Thakkar, the godown owner, suspected that the fire could have been caused due to short circuit.

Hotelier Anna Kale said, “The godown is located near my hotel. It contained stacks of pulses and food grains. After I noticed thick black fumes emanating from the godown, I contacted the PMRDA’s fire brigade control room and rushed to the spot. The firemen took utmost care and ensured that the properties around the godown were not damaged.”

While those at Rajmohalla, Subhash Chowk , Maharana Pratap Nagar , Nagin Nagar, Sai Kripa, and Chhatribag also complained about poor supply pressure as tanks of their respective areas could not be filled to their full capacity.

“This has become a regular affair. Despite spending so much on maintenance, the corporation seems to have failed to ensure uninterrupted supply,” complained Mohit Yadav , a resident of Radio Colony.

The residents even complained that there was no alternative arrangement made by the corporation, and they have to arrange water on their own. “Every alternate week there is either an electric fault or leakage. If this is the case in winter, what would be the situation in summers?,” said Shewta Tiwari, a resident of Sarv Suvidha Nagar.

IMC’s Narmada project official said that there was no major shortage as supply in most-affected areas was ensured through tankers.

“There was a major short circuit at sub-station, and this affected the pumping work. The fault was rectified within seven hours after it came to the notice, and there should not be any problem from Saturday onwards,” said Narmda project’s executive engineer Sanjeev Shrivastava.

PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Food and Drug Administration officials seized milk products worth Rs 24.63 lakh on the suspicion of adulteration from a cold storage unit in Budhwar Peth on Thursday.

Suresh Deshmukh, joint commissioner, FDA, Pune division, said, “A total of 39 businessmen from Pune city and surrounding areas had purchased 7,519kg of paneer worth Rs 15.49 lakh from Karnataka, which was stored at a cold storage unit in Budhwar Peth. It was to be transported to the dairies of the businessmen according to their orders. Another six businessmen had purchased 4,754kg of ‘khava’ worth Rs 9.14 lakh from different parts of the state, which was also stored at the same cold storage.”

He said the FDA officials raided the cold storage after a tip-off stating that the milk products stored there were adulterated or of inferior quality. “Accordingly, we raided the cold storage and seized the products, Samples have been sent to the FDA laboratory in Pune for analysis,” Deshmukh said.

“Instead of preparing ‘khava’ from milk, some people use skimmed milk powder, sugar and dalda- hydrogenated vegetable oil as it is cheaper. The laboratory report is expected in 14 days. Appropriate action will be taken upon receiving the report,” said Deshmukh.

Environmentalist Jeeth Milan Roche gives details about green bins installed at Father Muller Medical College H... Read More

Mangaluru: Father Muller Medical College (FMMC) Hospital, with its six hostels located at Kankanady in the city, is all set to become the first zero-waste campus.

It has already set up three waste management units , of 6,000 litres capacity each, to convert nearly 1,200 kg of wet waste generated every day in their campus into manure. Meanwhile, the college has stopped handing over dry waste to Antony Waste Handling Cell (AWHC) Private Limited, the agency engaged in door-to-door garbage collection and transportation in Mangaluru. Instead, they have made arrangements to recycle the same through an agency, so that the medical college will soon be made a zero-waste campus.

Environmentalist Jeeth Milan Roche , who has been installing green bins in institutions and other buildings, said with the commissioning of three waste management units, the FMMC campus will be the first zero-waste campus in the city. “By just spending Rs 50 a month for microbes, each family in the city also can make their house zero-waste premises. We have installed six green bins of 3,000 litres capacity each, at three different locations in the campus.”

Similarly, few apartments in Mangaluru City Corporation (MCC) limits also have taken initiatives to make their premises zero-waste areas.

For instance, Sai Prem Apartment with 16 flats in Mannagudda, where MCC commissioner S Ajith Kumar Hegde resides, has its own waste management unit to convert about 20kg of wet waste generated every day into manure. Sudheendra Kumar, one of the residents, said the apartment hands over only dry waste to (AWHC). “We have installed two green bins of 400 litres capacity each. By spraying microbes on the wet waste dumped in the bin, we get manure once in 15 days,” he said. Meanwhile, Maurishka Palace on Kadri Kambala road in the city has installed five bins of 200 kg capacity each. While the apartment has 330 flats, 250 are occupied, said Maurishka Palace Residents Association president Subodh Shetty.

Secretary Dr Ravi Kiran said the housekeeping section staff of the apartment collect wet, dry and sanitary waste separately.

While wet waste is converted into manure, dry waste is handed over to the vendor twice a week. The resident association fetches Rs 6,000 to Rs 7,000 per month by selling dry waste to the vendor. Meanwhile, sanitary waste is disposed of effectively as per the guidelines of the MCC. The apartment will soon procure an incinerator to manage sanitary waste in its premises, and plans to segregate hazardous waste too in the future, Dr Kiran said. MCC commissioner S Ajith Kumar Hegde and officials conducted a visit to the three premises to extend support from the city corporation.

Goarkhpur: National president of Jan Adhikar Party and former cabinet minister Babu Singh Kushwaha said that he will field candidates from all seats in the forthcoming elections in the state

He was interacting with reporters said in Kushinagar district on Thursday evening. While talking to reporters he said that Bahujan Samaj Party has become the party of rich now. He further said that BJP victory in UP was not a result of anti-Muslim votes but anti-Akhilesh and anti-Mayawati votes.

Advocating to bring Jan Adhikar party in power, he said, “Around three decades ago Kashiram ji formed BSP for justice to marginalised people of the society but his ideology was lost with him and now the BSP has become a party of rich people. SP, BSP and Congress can’t do good to the people of backward section of the society and to bring justice to them it is important to form their government.”

“There are 45 per cent people in the state who belong to improvised section and if we include Muslims the number will increase to 62 per cent. But with just 30-32 per cent votes, a party makes government here,” he added.

“In the last election, BJP won not with anti-Muslim votes but with anti-Akhilesh and anti-Mayawati votes. People have understood the reality of SP, BSP and Congress and they want a government theat could bring justice to them and work for their benefits,” said Kushwaha.

Farmers' delegation on way to meet SP in Dhar to submit memorandum

MHOW: Two days after mob lynching in Manawar , police have zeroed in on 36 people, who assaulted the six Ujjain farmers, and have been able to identify 15 of them till Friday. Cops were able to identify them from different pictures, video footage recovered as evidence and statements of four arrested accused.

Three police teams have been formed to nab the people, who were identified assaulting the farmers but have been absconding from their villages while cops are questioning the four arrested accused on Thursday. “Till now 36 people have been found beating the farmers and 15 of them have been clearly identified on basis of video footage and statements of accused in police custody. Not only their houses but other residences of their villages are also being searched. Two teams have been searching the jungle as there are inputs of accused hiding in deep jungles,” Dhar SP Aditya Pratap Singh told TOI.

He said that an advisory has also been issued across district through police stations and other government agencies urging people not to pay heed to rumours as the gruesome incident was a result of rumour about child lifters spread by some people.

Representative Image

INDORE: Bridging the infrastructure gap to connect rural and remote locations by pumping in more funds and early diagnosis are the key to cure tuberculosis (TB), said experts.

TB is the second highest cause of deaths in the world with India having the highest disease burden, where about 29 per cent of world’s cases are reported despite the fact that around 90 per cent cases can be treated by medicines, said experts.

Seyed E Hasnain, vice chancellor at Jamia Hamdard University , Delhi and professor of biological sciences said, “TB is a serious problem and it is completely curable but yet people die due to lack of early diagnosis and lack of infrastructure highly missing in rural areas. Devices currently used are expensive and cannot be used in rural areas due to lack of electricity.”

Scientists and academicians from across the world discussed disruptions in technology, innovations and drugs to help mankind cure some prevalent diseases at an international conference on ‘Emerging Areas of Biosciences and Biomedical Technologies ’ organised by Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Indore on Friday.

Experts said primary health centres lack equipment to diagnose TB besides fear of social boycott attached with the disease makes treatment further out of reach of patients.

Experts also stressed on the need of funds for better results in treating TB.

Professor Steffen Stenger , University of Ulm, Germany said, “TB treatment is highly underfunded. HIV has far better results because a lot of work is being done at different platforms as fund is huge unlike TB. In India the issues are absence of well-structured and organised health centres.”

Experts doubted Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s ambitious target to end TB by 2025. World Health Organisation plans to eradicate TB in 33 countries including India by 2035.

Hasnain said, “I have my doubts to be able to eradicate TB by 2025 but there is nothing wrong in giving it a try. We have come up with a new diagnostic battery-operated tool for detecting TB, which is rapid and far more economical and can be easily used at any rural health centre.”

125,['8/02/2020'],India’s first glass-floor bridge to replace Lakshman Jhula in Rishikesh,"This story is from February 8, 2020

Authorities have now approved a site near the old bridge’s location for a new suspension bridge to come up

DEHRADUN: A year after the iconic Lakshman Jhula , which was constructed in 1923, on Ganga at Rishikesh was closed after it was declared “unfit”, the state authorities have now approved a site near the old bridge’s location for a new suspension bridge to come up. The new bridge’s design, officials said, would comprise a glass floor on both sides and an asphalt road in the middle.

Public works department (PWD) officials said that the floor made of toughened transparent glass would give pedestrians a sense of walking on the surface of the river while crossing through the bridge.

According to the design prepared by the PWD and finalised by the state government, the total width of the new bridge is 8 metres and the length is 132.2 metres. The glass floor would be of 1.5 metres in width on both sides while the road would be 2.5 metre wide. The toughened glass to be used as floor on both sides would be 3.5 inches thick.

The design for the bridge will now be sent to IIT-Mumbai for approval. “IIT-Mumbai will vet the design and thereafter, we will prepare the detailed project report (DPR) and the tender bids will be floated,” additional chief secretary Om Prakash told TOI.

On being asked about the stipulated time period for the completion of the ambitious project, the senior official said, “Efforts will be made to complete the project before Kumbh 2021 but it is too early to predict a deadline.”

He asserted that no chances will be taken in the construction process as the aim is to come up with a bridge, which would last for the next 150 years. “Each pillar of this bridge would be 30 metres deep and making each pillar is itself an elaborate process,” said Om Prakash.

The IAS officer added that light motor vehicles such as cars would be permitted to ply on the new bridge. “We are using iron pillars, which are stronger than ones usually used in bridges. On both boundaries of the bridge, there will be a seven-feet-high toughened glass railing,” he added.

The IAS officer said that the authorities would ensure that only authorised vehicles use the new bridge. “Light vehicles such as cars would only be allowed to use the new bridge,” he added.

Movement of pedestrian and vehicles was stopped on Lakshman Jhula on July 12, 2019, after a technical team found it unfit and since then, residents and tourists have been highly inconvenienced.

Akash Rawat, a local resident, said, “In the absence of the bridge, the other side of Ganga has become increasingly inaccessible. Tourist and foreigners have started avoiding the area and due to this, our business is also suffering. The government should complete the construction of the new bridge on priority.”

CHENNAI: On July 27 last year, Mohammad Ali, manager of a private bank, was knocked down in Royapettah by a car being driven on the wrong side by a drunken man. Ali, who was on a bike, was among the scores of victims who perish in road accidents despite following the rule book because for every Ali, there is somebody who ignores a ‘ no entry ’ sign and speeds down from the opposite direction.When TOI went out to survey such one-way stretches across the city, it found that regard for such ‘no entry’ boards was scarce. Near the Madras Race Club, two-wheeler riders and taxis enter a no-go zone from a blind curve (see photograph and map).“While coming from Madipakkam I go under the bridge at Guindy to proceed towards Anna Salai. It is a bit dark under the bridge but as I come out I always find a vehicle in front of my car on the wrong side,” said George, a software engineer. “I slow down every day because I expect at least one vehicle coming from the wrong side,” he said.Motorists have converted many such short one-ways, which are less than 300m, into two-ways.“A barricade on the Thiru Vi Ka Road- Peters Road junction says it is a one-way. But vehicles are found on either side of the road,” said lawyer V S Suresh, who deals with motor accident cases. “The one-way sign put up by police is covered by posters,” he said. Police too have not removed them, he said.In some cases, for instance at the junction between OTA and Alandur foot over-bridge, people drive on the wrong side on directions from the traffic police. “The stretch is too long for motorists to take a u-turn,” said a policeman at the junction said. Thambu Chetty Street in Parry’s is another one-way where lawyers and law office staff drive in both directions. Nopoliceman stops lawyers for driving on the wrong side.Violators ride/drive on the wrong side to save time, avoid traffic or save petrol. But the risk exceeds benefits – riders on the opposite side are not always prepared for a surprise, traffic goes haywire and accidents happen. Road engineers said wrong side driving is very much like smoking, it is a bad habit that people find tough to stop.“When there is no one to stop us, we think it is okay to drive on the wrong side. Riders tell themselves that chances of accidents are less,” said a professor from the department of civil engineering (transportation engineering division), IIT-M. “Driving on the wrong side of the road is dangerous when the oncoming traffic is at high speed. The situation is worse at night. Some drivers/riders use high beam and blind the oncoming traffic,” he said.Road safety activists have campaigned for enforcement and quick action against offenders. The Chennai traffic police booked 86,142 people for wrong side driving in 2019 and to 97,215 in 2018. But action has not curtailed the menace. “When we book them for driving on the wrong side, they have to pay only `100,” said a traffic enforcement officer from T Nagar.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74021941,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-190434,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/what-no-entry-zones-they-are-shortcuts-for-chennais-motorists/articleshow/74016280.cms

AHMEDABAD: A senior citizen tolerated harassment in the hands of his son and daugher-in-law for 11 years before filing a police complaint. Ayodhya Mishra, 78, a retired railway official accused his son and daughter-in-law of beating and abusing him and and his physically handicapped wife, Vidyavati, 75, for over a decade. Mishra stays at Hariomnagar society near D-cabin in the Sabarmati area.

Mishra stated he had over the years called police many times and made complaints, but they just told the accused to leave the house without any further formal action.

Mishra had retired in 2004 and bought a house for himself. His son Premprasad, 40, and his wife Sunita, 38, have been staying with him. He has alleged that they have been beating him and his wife over frivolous issues since 2009.

“Despite the fact that I have given shelter to my son and daughter-in-law, they were very unkind towards me and my wife,” he states in the FIR.

“They frequently thrashed and intimidated us while telling us to leave the home. Earlier, I had, many times, called up police and represented my grievance against Premprasad and Sunita. Even though the cops had asked them to leave my house, they continued to stay with us and beat us frequently,” he states.

On Thursday, Mishra’s son and daughter-in-law again beat him and Vidyavati, after which he called up police control room. Finally, a complaint was registered against Premprasad and Sunita under charges of causing hurt, uttering abuses and abetment.

129,['8/02/2020'],Political row over breather to Reliance Power to repay dues,"This story is from February 8, 2020

BHOPAL: A decision by the Kamal Nath government in Madhya Pradesh to give four more years to Anil Ambani ’s Sasan Power Project to repay dues of Rs 450 crore in installments has triggered a political controversy, with BJP accusing it of using public money for the “convenience of industrialists”, and Congress pointing out that the breather is part of industrial policy framed by the erstwhile BJP government.

PCC media department chief Shobha Oza said, “These massive dues had accumulated during the former BJP government’s tenure. The Congress government is only trying to recover the money owed by Reliance Power Limited.”

""Knowing the circumstances of the economy and the company concerned, the Nath government’s aim is to recover the dues, which is why four years’ time has been given,"" Oza argued, adding: “We are not the BJP, whose modus operandi is known in case of Nirav Modi , Mehul Chouksey and Vijay Mallya .”

BJP criticized the Congress government for “giving exemptions to select industries” when the state is battling financial crisis. “The Congress government has decided to exempt recovery of Rs 450 dues from industrialist Anil Ambani in four years. This proves that it’s a government of industrialists and capitalists. The chief minister himself is an industrialist. He is worried more about increasing capital of industrialists,” alleged leader of opposition Gopal Bhargava .

BJP chief whip in assembly Narottam Mishra joined the attack, saying, “The government is running an industrial policy at the cost of public money for the convenience of industrialists.”

Rejecting BJP’s allegations, public relations minister P C Sharma said that the government is investor- and industry-friendly and aims to promote industries to create more jobs. “The vision and intention of Congress government and chief minister is very much clear. The government is promoting investors and industries. This is a part of investor friendly policy of the government,” said Sharma.

State Congress spokesman Narendra Saluja explained that the decision has been taken under rules of the 2014 Investment Promotion Policy of the erstwhile BJP government. “Under this policy, the company has been asked to repay dues within the next four years. The policy clearly states that firms investing Rs 500 crore and more can get up to 12 years to pay their dues,” he pointed out.

Oza hit out at BJP, holding it responsible for the slowdown of economy. “People like Nirav Modi and Vijay Mallya fled with Rs 2.70 lakh crore and NPAs have grown to 126%,” she pointed, adding: “The nation’s debts have increased by 71% in the last six years. Over 5 lakh crore worth of loans of top industrialists have been written off by the NDA government. The MP government has not written off dues, like the Centre. This government is only giving more time to the company to pay its dues.”

Mangaluru: Mangaluru City Corporation (MCC) has warned that all bulk waste generators must have their own waste management units or else cough up a hefty penalty .

A penalty to the tune of Rs 25,000 will be imposed on bulk waste generators including apartments, small industries, hostels, educational institutions, marriage halls and restaurants from Monday, if they do not set up waste management units in their premises, said MCC commissioner S Ajith Kumar Hegde .

“If they fail to comply with the waste management rules, a penalty to the tune of Rs 50,000 will be levied on them in the second round of the drive. MCC has already sent notices to 1,948 owners for not adhering to the rules. More than 2,000 apartments, 1,670 restaurants and hotels as well as other bulk waste generators in the city have been given a deadline of February 10 to set up waste management units as per Solid Waste Management Rules 2016,” Hegde said.

The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has expressed its concern over urban local bodies failing to manage solid waste effectively. The NGT has issued guidelines and directed the government to submit a compliance report once in three months. Hence, the state government is very serious about the implementation of Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016.

Accordingly, the MCC has conducted workshops twice for all bulk waste generators including apartments, hostels, educational institutions, hotels, restaurants, marriage halls, catering services, merchants, chicken stalls, small industries, builders and others.

Initially, they were given October 31, 2019 as the deadline to comply with the waste management rules. However, most of them have not installed waste management units in their premises, he said.

INDORE: Power supply to over 1.5 lakh consumers of rural and city’s north division was affected for more than 10 hours, when two power transformers of power transmission company of 220 KV Jaitpura Grid, burst on Friday morning.

This included around one lakh consumers of city’s north division and some 50,000 consumers of Dharmpuri and Sanwer. Operations of around 100 industrial units of Bardari were also affected following the incident that took place at around 8.15am.

Two power transformers including 160MVA and 40MVA were completely destroyed in a massive fire, which broke out from a current transformer installed near these transformers.

The sound of explosion was so loud that it created panic among locals of nearby villages including Dharampuri and Jaitpura. Thick smoke could be seen from about half a kilometre.

“We heard two explosions one after another in a gap of 10 minutes and the grid had caught fire, when we reached the area. Power supply of our village went off immediately after the explosion,” said Ajay Chouhan, a villager from Dharampuri.

Supply from the grid was snapped immediately after the incident came to the notice of power transmission company employees, who later raised an alarm and called fire brigade.

It took about five hours for fire tenders to bring the situation under control as oil kept leaking from power transformers. Dharampuri, Dhaturia, Aswaya, Hatunia, Tarana, Barlai and nearby areas were the worst affected. In city’s north circle, supply to Sanwer Road, Aurbindo Hospital, Jaitpura industrial belt and Sukhlia areas had major impact.

Madhya Pradesh Paschim Kshetra Vidyut Vitaran Company Limited (MPPKVVCL) managing director Vikas Narwal claimed that the situation was brought under control within five hours after the incident and supply to 90 per cent of the affected feeders was restored before sunset.

“We had our team of some 10 engineers and 50, who were engaged to ensure alternate arrangements to restore supply. Supply to most of the affected areas was restored till 6.00pm,” Narwal told TOI. “We aim to restore supply from the affected grid by Saturday evening. Till then supply to connected areas could be affected for short intervals,” he added. The incident has also prompted state energy minister Priyavrat Singh to order an inquiry into the incident. “An inquiry will be conducted to ascertain the exact reason behind the fault,” the minister stated in an official note.

132,['8/02/2020'],Basti district to be renamed after sage Vashishtha,"This story is from February 8, 2020

Gorakhpur: The renaming of Basti district after Maharishi Vashishth appears to be on the cards with the local administration sending a proposal on this to the state's revenue board.

The cost of implementing the change is estimated to be around Rs 1 crore and the district administration is learnt to have sent an expenditure report to the state headquarters for a final nod.

In the past, the Yogi government rechristened Mughalsarai railway junction after RSS ideologue Deen Dayal Upadhyay and renamed the districts of Allahabad and Faizabad as Prayagraj and Ayodhya, respectively.

A year ago, during Basti Mahotsav, the chief minister had announced that Basti Medical College would be named after Maharshi Vashishtha, one of the most revered Vedic sages. Thereafter, many citizens — including MP Harish Dwivedi and MLA Ajay Kumar Singh — began demanding that the district be renamed as well. On November 28 last year, a proposal to change the name of Basti district was sent to the Revenue Board. After analysis of expenditure, district magistrate Ashutosh Niranjan sent the report to zonal commissioner Anil Kumar Sagar who in turn forwarded a revised version to the government.

“We estimate an expenditure of Rs 1 crore. A final approval is awaited before Basti is renamed,” DM Niranjan said.

CHENNAI: Waking up to the locational advantage of the Island Grounds in Chennai, the Tamil Nadu Tourism Development Corporation (TTDC) has decided to hold exhibitions and amusement rides throughout the year. This will be in addition to the annual trade fair.

The development comes in the backdrop of a go-kart operator withdrawing the services from Island Grounds. “While the contract for offering the go-kart service was valid for three years, the private operator wound up the services midway. So we have called for tenders to utilise the space for establishing other tourist activities,” a senior tourism department official said.

As per the tender floated by TTDC, an area measuring 45,000sqft will be provided to the successful bidder to organise exhibition and amusement rides. “The space can be utilised for organising different activities, including laser shows. However, the concept should be formulated by the bidder on revenue-sharing model with TTDC,” the official added.

The massive 29-acre land parcel remains idle for the entire year, except during the 70-day annual India Tourist and Industrial Fair held between December and February every year. During Deepavali season, cracker shops are set up. Attempts had been made in the past to convert the Island Grounds into a happening place by organising food fair and banana festival a decade ago. It, however, did not continue after change in regime.

Tamil Nadu Tour Travel and Hospitality Association president V K T Balan said food-on-wheels providing international cuisines could be made part of Island Grounds. ""There should be no permanent structure installed on the premises. 45 trucks offering a range of food and cultural dance performances from across the country in an area of 45,000 square feet will be a major crowd-puller,"" he said. Tourists and visitors could be kept engaged from dusk to dawn, he added.

Hardik Patel

AHMEDABAD: A city sessions court once again issued an arrest warrant against Hardik Patel , a Congress activist and former convenor of the Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS), for skipping court proceeding in a sedition case on Friday.

Allahabad: Autopsy reports of the 35-year-old widow and her three children, who were found dead at their Aswa Daudpur village home in trans-Ganga on Thursday morning, have indicated that the woman was electrocuted and the minor girls were smothered to death.

Preliminary investigation into the deaths of Manju Devi, a bidi worker, and her daughters Priya (8), Annu (6) and Ritika (4) had suggested suicide, as the main door was locked from the inside.

However, the postmortem examinations are now questioning that theory of police and vindicating the bereaved family’s suspicions that the woman and her children were either murdered or the woman was forced to take the extreme step.

SSP Satyarth Anirudh Pankaj confirmed the autopsy reports on Friday and said a detailed probe had been ordered. “The mother was electrocuted and the minors suffocated to death, possibly on being smothered with a pillow. Forensic experts are looking for clues to nail culprits, if any,” he said.

Manju Devi’s parents have accused her two brothers-in-law, Mahesh and Dinesh, of harassing her since her husband Ramesh Bharatiya passed away four years ago. Mahesh and Manju’s father-in-law Shri Nath were detained for questioning on Thursday. The SSP said the role of the in-laws would be thoroughly investigated.

Jaipur: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Friday said the state budget would have provisions to improve ease of doing business , which according to him was the only way to improve finances in the wake of the economic slump.

Addressing a state-level tax advisory committee meeting, he said revenue collection in Goods and Services Tax (GST) remained below expectations due to which the states did not get much funds from the Centre.

“Also, the Centre has reduced subsidy for various schemes which is affecting development work. In such a scenario, industrial development can only bring prosperity in the state,” Gehlot said.

“The state government is taking several steps to promote industries and more efforts will be made for fair provisions in the state budget to make the economic atmosphere better,” he said.

Gehlot said several important policies, new laws and schemes had been implemented to promote industries and a better atmosphere had been created for them to grow and develop. In the budget too, industries would be well taken care of,” he said.

At the meeting, representatives of different industrial organisations gave their suggestions on the budget. Additional chief secretary (finance) Niranjan Arya said fair and constructive policies would be incorporated in the budget.

Energy minister B D Kalla and industry minister Parsadi Lal Meena were among those who attended the meeting.

Mangaluru: Mangaluru City North MLA Dr Y Bharath Shetty warned contractors who are taking up underground drainage (UGD) works in the city, not to let sewage flow into stormwater drains.

He said that he has received complaints from the public that contractors have been diverting sewage from UGD pipelines into open drains. He warned that criminal cases will be booked against contractors if they continue to divert sewage into open drains.

Chairing a meeting of people’s representatives and officials of Karnataka Urban Infrastructure Development and Finance Corporation (KUIDFC), the MLA said water resources at many places in the city have been polluted due to the flow of sewage from the UGD.

“I have received many complaints that contractors have been putting the UGD flow into open drains when they take up development works. This is an unscientific method, which will contaminate the water resources in the nearby areas. Hence, they should take up work scientifically. We will have to file criminal cases against them if they do not take up work scientifically,” the MLA warned.

Under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (Amrut) scheme, Rs 60 crore has been reserved for the repair of UGDs. There is a need to check the quality of work, he said. “I have already directed officials to take up initiatives to purify wells and other water resources, which are polluted due to unscientific UGD work,” he added.

AHMEDABAD: A Sola-based advocate on Friday filed a complaint with the city police alleging that his wife, who is a chartered accountant, had beaten him and tried to strangle his mother after he alleged that she had an affair with her business partner.

In his FIR with Sola high court police, the advocate, 38, stated that the incident took place at his home in Sola area during wee hours on Thursday.

He states in the FIR that he had married the chartered accountant, 35, who hails from Pune, in 2007. After their marriage, the couple settled in Ahmedabad where he started practising law and the woman began working with a chartered accountant firm.

For the past six months, he and his wife had been working at his office near Kargil Crossroads on SG Road.

“My wife has been working with her business partner for four months. Her business partner, who has his office in the Bodakdev area, used to visit my office to meet my wife very frequently,” states the FIR.

“I heard my staff members gossiping about my wife’s illicit relationship with her business partner. I also had doubts over their relationship so I installed CCTV cameras in my office,” the advocate stated in the FIR.

He states that he had worked at his office till late on Thursday night and reached home at around 3am on Friday.

“When I reached home, my wife and my mother were awake. As soon as I entered the house, my wife began asking the reason behind installing CCTV cameras at office. I told her my staff had told me what she does at the office with her business partner. For this, I had installed the CCTV cameras,” he states.

To this, his wife became angry over him and allegedly began abusing him. She also threatened him that she and her business partner would kill him.

“My wife then got very angry, and my mother tried to pacify her. But she pushed my mother and tried to choke her. When I tried to rescue my mother, she beat me and threatened to kill me,” he states in the FIR.

The man then approached Sola high court police and filed a complaint of causing hurt, uttering abuses and criminal intimidation against his wife.

MUZAFFARNAGAR: The Muzaffarnagar police has decided to join the “Fit India Movement” by encouraging people to remain healthy and fit by including physical activities and sports in their daily lives. In this context, police has sought suggestions from public regarding measures to ensure city residents take to regular fitness regime.

According to police sources, the task will be undertaken at every thana level wherein areas such as school and college grounds, parks and police line fields will be identified for carrying out daily exercises. Yoga teachers, gym instructors and ordinary citizens are being asked to give ideas and contribute in holding and supervising daily exercises.

Last year, police in Muzaffarnagar had launched an anti-drugs drive in which hundreds of youth and social activists had joined. It helped police to bust drug peddling and arrest the sellers.

When asked, senior superintendent of police, Muzaffarnagar, Abhishek Yadav said, “We are working on a plan to make ordinary people, especially the youth and working people who do not have the means to keep themselves fit by providing them a place where they go for exercising and following a fitness regime. We received many ideas and offers to help people in keeping fit by yoga teachers, gym instructors and health-conscious people.”

Asked where the fitness programmes will be conducted, the SSP said, “It is not possible to bring thousands of people at one place and so, we will use the police-line field in the city and school or college's grounds in rural areas for the purpose.”

Locals said this concept will not aid people to take part in sports events but also those living in rural areas will get easy access to police.

A rural-based health-conscious man, Rajender Kumar , said, “I have been exercising at home without any guidance I will join the fitness programme if they are going to organized in my area. It will also be beneficial for people who often face difficulties in approaching police.”

Tribals stage protest on the highway

VADODARA: Traffic movement in the tribal-dominated Chhota Udepur district was affected severely on Friday after the locals observed a bandh to protest government’s inaction in including Koli Rathwas in the schedule tribe (ST) category. The tribal leaders alleged that the government hasn’t fulfilled its promise and if it still fails to meet their demands, the protests will only grow stronger.

On Friday morning, shops and business establishments across the district including Chhota Udepur town remained closed. Post offices, banks and even milk dairies downed their shutters as the protesters took over state highways as well as national highway from Vadodara to Chhota Udepur.

The protesters blocked highways by felling trees and burning tyres. However, no violence was reported from any part of the district.

Talking to TOI, Sangram Rathwa, son of former Congress MP from Chhota Udepur Naran Rathwa, claimed that the entire tribal community including leaders from all parties supported the bandh which was very “successful”.

“We have been demanding inclusion of Koli Rathwas in ST category for a long time. Our men, who were hired as lok rakshak dal (LRD) personnel last year, were also harassed by the government department that kept asking them for various certificates,” Rathwa further alleged.

“The government has included several non-tribal communities in ST but Koli Rathwas are still facing injustice. We have met the chief minister three times with regard to the issue. If the government doesn’t accept our demands, we will be forced to intensify our stir,” he said.

The government departments mention Koli Rathwas as Koli which comes under other backward classes (OBC). Hence, Koli Rathwa community people get notices asking them to produce various certificates after they get government jobs in ST quota. “This is sheer harassment of our community’s youth,” he added.

Congress MLA from Chhota Udepur, Mohan Rathwa said, “Ration cards, Aadhaar cards and even names in their bank accounts have Rathwa surname. But the government doesn’t consider them from Rathwa community. Even in LRD exams, 24 students of this community scored above 73 per cent but didn’t get jobs.”

Chhota Udepur SP, M S Bhabhor said, “The protesters had blocked the highways for some time but we cleared the roads soon. Protesters stood in front of a train in Bodeli but made no attempt to delay the train.”

Kanpur: A man was duped of Rs 62,000 by a miscreant from a neighbouring village, who used to talk to him on phone as a girl by using a voice modulation application.

The victim, who works as driver of the village head, nabbed the accused, a resident of Bidhnoo area, and handed him over to police but was let off after he promised to return the money. The two sides amicably resolved the issue, said police.

The driver of a village head had recently filed a complaint stating that a man had cheated him using voice modulation. “The accused, pretended to be a girl and took Rs 62,000 from the driver over various pretexts, ” said inspector Devendra Solanki.

“During investigation, it was found that the caller was a man pretending to be a girl. The accused was detained when he came to the driver’s house to collect money on Wednesday. The accused revealed that he was unemployed and thus came up with a plan to call bachelors of adjoining villages. He used to chat with them in female voice with the help of a voice modulation application and duped them of money. He called the driver posing as a girl, saying he was handsome, their horoscopes matched and she wanted to marry him,” the inspector said.

About a month passed but whenever the driver asked for a meeting in person, he was given some or the other excuse. The accused then asked the driver to send some money saying ‘her’ family was in some financial problem.

The driver gave Rs 62,000 but soon realised that he had been cheated, and approached police.

“The driver caught the accused on Wednesday and handed him over to us. But, the two sides resolved the issue amicably. We asked the accused to return the money,” said Solanki.

Mangaluru: A rare sixth century granite idol of ‘ Lajja Gauri ’ was discovered fixed beside the road at Barkur village in Udupi district.

Lajja Gauri is depicted nude and is said to be a fertility symbol. Dr Shivakant Bajpai, superintending archaeologist of ASI Bengaluru Circle, who is on a tour of the coastal districts, said he first came across the idol when its picture went viral on social media. He subsequently traced it to a public road in Barkur, which is an ancient historical town of coastal Karnataka. It was the ancient capital of the Alupa kingdom and a seat of power for several centuries.

“This is a very important idol and hundreds of vehicles pass by the idol every day, and could have damaged it. We are retrieving it, and I have issued an order to my local in-charge to keep it in safe custody. I have also sent a mail in this regard to the DC and SP of the district,” he said.

The idol is likely to be from the 6th or 7th centuries, though more research is required to confirm a date, Dr Bajpai added.

Photo for representative purpose only

BHOPAL: Weeks after the skyrocketing onion prices made the consumers cry, it’s the turn of onion farmers to shed tears of frustration, following a steep decline in its prices.

Rates of onion have been falling down with each passing day. In the onion growing district of Neemuch, it was sold at Rs 5 a kg to Rs 11 a kg on Friday while in Bhopal it was sold at Rs 5 to Rs 17 per kg in the wholesale market.

Interestingly, this is happening when the onion yield has just started arriving in the market; complete onion produce will arrive in the market by March. In the last three months or so, the onion prices wreaked havoc on consumers’ household budget when the cost of the commodity ranged between Rs 120 and 150 a kg in the state capital. The scenario wasn’t any different in the rest of the state.

Unseasonal rainfall in the onion growing belts of the country had damaged the crop, leading to its shortage and the price hike, lament wholesalers of Bhopal mandi. In states like Madhya Pradesh, onion crop arrives in February –March. It is really baffling that onion prices have started crashing as soon as the yield arrived in the mandis, said a market expert in Neemuch, Mustafa Hussain . “ At the moment about 1500 bags of onion, each weighing about 50 kg, are arriving in Neemuch mandi every day and rates vary from Rs 5 to Rs 11 a kg on Friday. Tonnes of onion will reach the mandis soon, and the prices are likely to go down further. If the trend continues, the farmers will have to start throwing away their produce, a practice seen in the past also,” said Hussain.

A big onion farmer of Neemuch, Mohan Nagda , lamented, “Unlike other products, farmers don’t fix the rates of their produce. We depend on the traders and they know the crop is bumper this year, hence taking advantage of this fact.” President of the wholesalers association of onion and potato in Bhopal ‘s Karond Mandi, Mohammad Idris, said, “ Prices of the best quality onion are falling by Rs 100 for 40 per kg every day for the past three days. It came down to Rs 700 per 40 kg on Friday from Rs 1000 per 40 kg on Wednesday.” Medium quality onion was available at a cost of Rs 20 per kg in Bhopal’s retail markets.

Member of the newly constituted Agriculture Development Council (ADC), Shivkumar Sharma alias kakka ji , said, “I had earlier recommended to former CM Shivraj Singh that the onion growing districts should be identified to develop a network of onion storage. I will raise this issue again in the next meeting of the council.”

Mangaluru: Dakshina Kannada superintendent of police B M Laxmi Prasad said that a Kadaba police station assistant sub-inspector (ASI) will be suspended over dereliction of duty , as he failed to attend to an acid attack victim, when she called the station immediately after the incident.

The 35-year-old victim who is being treated at Wenlock Hospital, received serious burns after she was attacked by her brother-in-law with acid used in making rubber sheets, at Kodimbala, Kadaba taluk in Dakshina Kananda, on January 23. After her husband’s death, two years ago, she was fending for her family.

The decision was based on a report submitted by Puttur DySP Dinakar Shetty on the Kadaba acid attack case, where many people alleged that jurisdictional police had failed to act on the matter, and that the case was not dealt with properly. “In the report submitted, we have found that the ASI who was on duty on the day of the acid attack at Kadaba police station failed to respond to the victim’s call, when she called the station. Apart from it, the ASI did not intimate about the incident to his higher-ups, nor did he send any vehicle to help the victim. The victim came to the police station after the attack, to file a complaint. We have decided to suspend him for dereliction of duty,” superintendent of police B M Laxmi Prasad told TOI.

After allegations were made of mishandling the case, a committee was formed by SP Prasad. The committee submitted a report two days ago. There were allegations against police that they were shielding the accused, and that the investigation was not going in the right direction.

Senior police officials who did not want to be identified, said that the accused was sexually harassing the victim for a long time. Meanwhile, police, after recording the statement of the victim, have added additional cases against the accused. They are IPC sections 509 and 354a (sexual harassment).

“The victim was constantly requesting the police for help but it was denied. The spot mahajar at the victim’s house was not conducted as per procedure. Before the incident, the accused was sexually harassing the victim for a long time. All these observations have been stated in the report,” said a senior police official.

Bijnor: Senior officials, including district magistrate (DM) of Bijnor, on Friday held a meeting with the representatives of two communities to iron out differences between them over taking out of a procession in Shyamiwala village to mark the Sant Ravidas Jayanti on Sunday. The procession was stopped by the district administration in 2013 after people of the minority community objected to it.

Now, people of the Dalit community have said that they will embrace Christianity if the procession is not allowed on the coming Sunday. A group of people, claiming to represent over 500 Dalits of Shyamiwala village, held the meeting with DM Ramakant Pandey.

“It was an age-old tradition, and we want it back,” said Omprakash Jonny, a member of the group which met the DM.

Omprakash told TOI, “We were carrying out the procession for the last many decades, it is not new. Samiwaala has close to 250 Dalit families with around 700 members. The objection was raised in 2013 during the SP government, prompting the district magistrate to stop the procession.”

Jonny claimed that they had filed a petition in Allahabad high court, in 2019, challenging the then DM’s order. The court had passed an order on March 3, 2019, asking the petitioners to approach the DM again, he said.

He further stated, “We have told the district magistrate that all Dalits in my village will convert to Christianity if we are prevented from taking out the procession, which is our fundamental right.”

When contacted, additional district magistrate Vinod Kumar Gaur said, “District magistrate had called both the groups on Friday at collectorate. We heard their arguments. The DM will take a call on it soon.”

MEERUT: With arrest of four suspects, local police in UP’s Saharanpur district claimed to have solved the murder case of an elderly couple who were killed on February 5. According to the police, deceased Krishna Kumar Sharma (65) was in money lending business which led to confrontation between lender Krishna Kumar and the main accused who hails from his native village.

Krishna Kumar Sharma and his wife Sunita Sharma (56), who used to live alone at their Saharanpur residence in Shivpuri colony, were attacked by unidentified assailants on the morning of February 5. The accused had fled through the roof of the house after bolting the main door from inside. The couple with fatal injuries inflicted by axe was rushed to hospital where they were declared brought dead.

Police achieved their first breakthrough following careful study of account books, where deceased Krishna Kumar kept records of his money lending transactions, which were recovered from the crime scene. According to police, main accused Karan Singh had borrowed Rs 16-17 lakh from Krishna Kumar and the latter was insisting on payments. The accused then decided to bump off Krishna Kumar and hired two aides for the job.

“Based on the account books and CCTV footage in the area, we began our investigation. Later, we landed on more clues which helped us in zeroing in on the suspects who hail from deceased’s native place in Anantmau village. Karan, Johnny and Arun Saini are the main accused in the case,” Saharanpur SSP Dinesh Kumar P said.

“Karan had borrowed Rs 16-17 lakh from Krishna Kumar and the latter was insisting on payments. Karan hired Johnny and Arun Saini, also native of Anantmau village, for Rs 5 lakh for the double murder,” the Saharanpur SSP added.

According to police, after spotting familiar faces, deceased Krishna Kumar opened the door and the accused made friendly entry into the house on the day of incident. “The killers had hid their weapons, an axe and a fire arm, in their shawl. The accused caught Krishna Kumar off guard when he was busy scanning through the account book. The accused later attacked his wife Sunita who rushed to the spot after hearing screams for help,” the SSP also said.

BHOPAL: Mayor Alok Sharma staged a dharna on Friday, alleging that the Congress government is deliberately stalling inauguration of civic projects started durng his tenure.

Sharma, whose tenure as mayor ends in February, wants to inaugurate as many projects as possible before he demits office. But, according to him, the Congress government in the state is pushing back inauguration of projects that are ready or nearing completion.

On Friday, he staged a sit-in near the proposed arch bridge near Kamla Park, stating that it should have been completed a year ago, but is not being inaugurated because local Congress leaders want this to happen after he demits office.

“There are only three houses, which have to be shifted and work on the arch bridge would be completed. Former chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan had agreed to shift encroachments so that the arch bridge, which would greatly ease the traffic on the road, could be completed on time, but after the Kamal Nath government came to power, the project has been stalled,” he alleged.

The mayor said he would inaugurate the statue of Rani Kamlapati and the bridge if the state government doesn’t announce the date of its inauguration by the time he demits office. The arch bridge has been named after the queen.

Sharma said the civic projects which were undertaken during his stint as mayor should be allowed to be inaugurated by him and the members of present municipal council, but the state government is not only putting those projects on hold, he is not even being invited to inauguration functions when they do take place.

“I am being ignored and insulted. This politics of ‘confrontation’ only disrupts development, but the Kamal Nath government seems to have decided to tread that path,” Sharma alleged.

BJP district president Vikas Virani , who also addressed the gathering, claimed that schemes undertaken by the former BJP government for the welfare of economically weaker sections, women, children and youth are being discontinued by the Kamal Nath government.

Residents and tourists in Mussoorie were pleasantly surprised with the snowfall. This was the fifth snow spell of the season for the queen of hills.

The snowfall commenced in the afternoon at around 3 pm in Mussoorie and within a short time, the entire town was covered in a white blanket bringing cheer for the tourists.

“We never expected to witness snowfall. It is a pleasant surprise,” remarked Roshan, a tourist. The snowfall, which continued for nearly one-and-a-half hours caused issues for school children who were returning from their schools.

“No one expected a snowfall and hence we did not carry an umbrella in the morning. So we got drenched while walking back to our homes,” said Poonam, a local student.

The snow spell didn’t impede traffic and regular vehicular movements were reported between Mussoorie and Dehradun.

Mussoorie has been witnessing unusually cold conditions this season. Earlier spells of heavy snowfall had caused immense problems for the local residents.

Vadodara: There seems to be no end to the delays in the ambitious solar dome project work of the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC). The dome is coming up on the Akota-Dandiabazaar road.

Work stopped since January 27 after the bamboo scaffolding erected for work on the ceiling collapsed injuring one worker. After the incident, despite expectation of work to restart, nothing has moved so far.

The contractor has now shifted all the material for the work on the ceiling to the side of the road and applied hard breaks on the ongoing work. Sources said that the contractor wants complete closure of the road before resuming work.

The work on the ceiling of the dome was being conducted so far by closing the Akota to Dandiabazaar lane of the road under the dome. Traffic of both lanes used to merge on the Dandiabazaar to Akota lane on this portion under the dome.

“The contractor is concerned that in order to complete work in time, it will have to be done by closing the road completely,” said VMC executive engineer Paresh Patel from the futuristic planning cell. However, sources said that the recent accident had also contributed to the decision.

Patel said that they were trying to work out a solution so that the road remained open. “We are looking into the design of the scaffolding for this,” he said.

Vijai Sardesai

PANAJI: GFP chief Vijai Sardesai said that chief minister Parmod Sawant ’s maiden budget speech was filled with hollow announcements which lacked financial allocations.

GFP said that they did not expect the government to be able to adhere to the budget figures just as it failed to do for the current financial year.

“Only hollow announcement of priorities – resumption of mining, exploring hinterland, medical and eco-tourism, ease of living, ease of doing business, Goa as convention destination and educational hub- but no details of how these will be achieved,” said Sardesai.

He said that the budget did not explain how Sawant intended to restart mining operations, fund the recruitment of 1,200 policemen, purchase 50 electric buses for Kadamba and promote hinterland tourism.

“Where is the specific allocation? Where is tourism master plan?” Sardesai said. GFP also criticised the hike in excise rates, saying that domestic tourists coming to Goa will have no incentive to come to Goa for liquor.

“This budget has potential to kill tourism. Foreign tourists declining. And liquor, which is the main attraction for domestic tourists, will become more expensive because of considerable hikes in excise and licence fees,” Sardesai said.

Sardesai also said that the revenue surplus projected by Sawant was unrealistic. “How can a government that borrows money to pay old loans and interest have a revenue surplus?” asked the GFP MLA.

Cap

Vadodara: Barodians will soon know the exact number of crocodiles that they have been co-existing with.

The forest department will conduct census of crocodiles residing in Vishwamitri River and various ponds in and around the city on Saturday. The forest department conducted its last official crocodile census in 2015.

“We will be conducting the census in two parts. One in the morning and other in night. It will be done by forest officials and NGO volunteers,” said Nidhi Dave, regional forest officer (RFO), Vadodara. Eleven teams have been formed to conduct the census of which nine will focus on Vishwamitri River that is home to hundreds of crocodiles.

The census teams will visit the 17-km stretch of Vishwamitri River beginning from Vadodara-Ahmedabad Expressway to Talsat village in Makarpura. Count will also be done in ponds including Kashi Vishwanath Temple, Manjalpur, Kalali, Dena, Talsat, Chhani, Dumaad, Vemali, Harni, Sama, Vasna, Bhayli and Tandalja.

“Many of these ponds usually don’t have crocodiles, but it is possible that some reptiles may have shifted there during the floods last year,” a forest official said.

Forest officials are expecting that the count of crocodiles may go up this year as compared to 2015. During the floods that left many areas of the city submerged in monsoon, over 100 crocodiles that ventured out of Vishwamitri River and various ponds were rescued by the forest department. A large number of crocodiles in Vishwamitri River live in the stretch between Kala Ghoda and central jail.

Crocodiles in the river are very healthy as the adults on an average measure about 14 foot and weigh about 300 kg.

Allahabad: After the Union government announced the constitution of trust for construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya, replica of the proposed temple put on display at the camp of Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) in Magh Mela has become a major selfie point.

Devotees flocking at the ongoing Magh mela from neighbouring states like Madhya Pradesh and Bihar are visiting the camp to have a glimpse of the replica.

VHP office-bearers claimed that the number of devotees visiting the camp to see the replica of Ram temple has increased at least four-fold in last two days.

VHP spokesman Ashwani Mishra said: “For last two days, 8,000-10,000 devotees are visiting the camp per day to see the replica. At least eight lakh devotees have already visited the camp so far.”

He said the craze for replica had increased manifold since the Union government announced the trust for temple. VHP had unveiled the temple’s replica at its camp in sector 1 of Magh Mela area on January 12, decades after the structure was first put up on display during Kumbh Mela in 1989. This is the first time when VHP has displayed the model of Ram temple in Magh Mela. Earlier, it was displayed only during Kumbh and Ardh Kumbh.

“Visitors are interested in viewing the replica closely and offering prayers. We have also made elaborate arrangements as many pilgrims will visit the camp during the last 15 days of the Mela,” Mishra said. Shakuntala, who came to visit Magh Mela from Ayodhya, said; “I have visited Karsewakpuram many times to see the stones being carved for Ram temple but got the opportunity to have a glimpse of the replica at the ongoing Magh Mela.”

Usha Ghate of Gwalior said, “Everybody is keen to view the replica and hope that the model would be accepted by the trust”.

MEERUT: A delegation of dignitaries formed by the local administration in Saharanpur district, to persuade the women protesting at Eidgah ground in Deoband in calling off their agitation, was left red-faced after it met with fierce opposition.Like Shaheen Bagh in Delhi, hundreds of women have been on indefinite sit-in at Eidgah ground in Deoband for the past 12 days in protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC). At the behest of local police and administration, members of local peace committee decided to meet the agitating women to persuade them in calling off the agitation.On Thursday, a 14-member delegation had met the protesters on Thursday but had to return empty-handed after agitating women raised slogans of “Go Back” and allegedly threw bangles at the delegation members. Police later claimed that anti-social element in the crowd instigated women forcing return of the delegation.“The delegation had gone to clear the air on NRC but some anti-social elements in the crowd instigated women who began sloganeering,” Saharanpur SSP Dinesh Kumar P said. “The main contention of the protesters was NRC and a clarification regarding government’s stand on it has already been put out in the Parliament. Now, economics is involved in the protest and people are making money,” he claimed.Amid the uproar, in a written reply to the Lok Sabha recently, Ministry of Home Affairs MoS Nityanand Rai had said that “till now, the government has not taken any decision to prepare NRC at the national level”.Meanwhile, a video of Darul Uloom vice-chancellor Abul Qasim Nomani making an appeal to hold conditional talks of peace committee members with women protesting in Deoband and persuade them in calling off the agitation went viral on social media. The video was later misrepresented to give an impression that Darul Uloom has made an appeal to call off agitation in Shaheen Bagh in Delhi.In an official press release, VC Nomani rubbished reports linking his comments with Shaheen Bagh protests. “The viral video of mine on social media is in fact a clip of meeting held by district administration regarding peace in Deoband wherein a false narrative was created that Darul Uloom appeals to end the protests. This is entirely baseless and false propaganda. My opinion is being wrongly twisted. It is clarified that Darul Uloom Deoband has not issued any appeal to end the country-wide protests. We pray that the struggle is crowned with success,” he said in the release.In Video: Deoband: Women at anti-CAA rally chant ‘go back’, throw bangles at dignitaries",meerut,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74021475,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-981402,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/women-at-anti-caa-stir-in-deoband-chant-go-back-throw-bangles-at-locals-persuading-to-call-off-protest/articleshow/74015288.cms

Trichy: Oil spill from the underground pipeline of ONGC carrying natural oil has damaged a fertile land cultivated with black gram crop in Tiruvarur district on Friday. Due to the oil leakage, a portion of the land is inundated with the crude oil.

Sources said that Panneerselvam hailing from Moolangudi village near Tiruvarur had cultivated black gram crop in his land. Beneath Panneerselvam’s cultivation field, ONGC had installed pipeline to carry the crude oil extracted from ONGC’s oil wells in Kamalapuram locality to one Early Production System (EPS) near Moolangudi, where the crude oil will be collected for further processing.

Meanwhile, on Friday, a leakage in the underground oil pipeline was reported in Panneerselvam’s field as crude oil leaking appeared on the surface of the land. The aggrieved farmer, who had lost his crop, maintained that the revival process will take years to restore his field damaged due to the oil spill, has sought for compensation.

The ONGC Cauvery asset officials were subsequently alerted about the oil spill. “A team of officials inspected the field and immediately plugged the oil leakage. Appropriate compensation will be provided to the farmer for the oil spill,” an official source with ONGC said. ONGC Cauvery asset managing the natural oil and gas exploration in Cauvery delta districts including Tiruvarur said that a study will be done in the pipeline running below the Moolangudi village in Tiruvarur district to prevent such incidents in future.

PUNE: The state government is yet to appoint the full-time joint director of health services for prevention and containment of epidemic-prone diseases, considering the threat of novel coronavirus infection.For now, an officer of family welfare department has been given an additional charge of this post.“The office of the joint director of health services monitors epidemic control programme in Maharashtra. However, this crucial post has been lying vacant since January 1, 2020. An officer who is already overburdened in training medical officials in state’s family welfare programme has been given an additional charge of such an important post,” medical practitioner and activist Abhijit More said.He said the joint director, who is the technical head of the state, was responsible for surveillance of epidemic diseases, control of epidemic and reduction in such cases and casualties. “In the prevailing situation, when the threat of the novel coronavirus is looming large, how can the state government keep such an important post vacant? It should be filled on an urgent basis,” More said.A senior health official said purchasing N95 masks and other protection equipment and kits were not enough to overcome challenges posed by outbreaks like the one in China. “Filling up the key vacant posts and also posts of ground staff are the key to prevent and contain spread of viruses and communicable diseases,” he said.Another official said there was absolute lack of understanding at the highest level of policymakers and health authorities. “What they are interested in is patchy work. There is no long-term plan, vision and preparedness. Once the prevailing scare is over, things will be back to as they were,” he said.“If we look at what is happening in China.

Pantnagar airport director, SK Singh, said that the previous plans were shelved due to technical glitches

RUDRAPUR: Announced in 2015, the expansion of the only airport in Kumaon region at Pantnagar in Udham Singh Nagar district still lies pending. This is despite a local complaining against the delay with the ministry of civil aviation last year.

In his letter dated July 16, 2019, addressed to Hardeep Singh Puri, minister of state (MoS) for civil aviation, the complainant Bhagwan Das had said that the expansion of Pantnagar airport was announced in 2015 and banners of the same were put up at Pantnagar airport. These banners had Prime Minister's face on it. Das also mentioned the record of actions in previous years in the letter.

The letter shot by Das reads, ""The current airport was to be expanded on contiguous land. However, the plan was shelved because of various limitations like an elephant corridor, railway property, and other restrictions. Later, a new site adjacent to the current airport was considered but after three years of deliberations, this site was shelved due to unknown reasons"".

Das further stated that the original site was again considered upon. ""Consequently, after four years of back and forth, we came back to square one,"" the letter added. He requested the ministry to intervene and also sent the copies of complaint to Uttarakhand ’s chief minister and chief secretary, who on July 26, 2019, directed the competent authorities of civil aviation to take prompt actions.

Talking to TOI, Pantnagar airport director, SK Singh, said that the previous plans were shelved due to technical glitches. ""We have now identified almost 1,100 acres of land near Pantnagar industrial area stretching towards Kichha town. But the land has not been transferred to the airport authority. Once the district administration hands over the land, the expansion will be done swiftly,” Singh said.

Meanwhile, Udham Singh Nagar district magistrate Neeraj Kharwal said that the process for selecting the land for the expansion of airport is still ongoing. ""As soon as we find a land catering to all the requirements of an airport, the acquisition and transfer will be initiated at the earliest,” he said.

Allahabad: Allahabad high court on Friday granted bail to former examination controller of UP Public Service Commission ( UPPSC ), Anju Katiyar, who was lodged in jail for her involvement in the LT Grade Teacher Examination-2018 paper leak case.

While directing for the release of Katiyar on bail, Justice Ramesh Sinha said the trial should be expedited and preferably conclude within a year, provided there are no legal impediments.

The court also directed that Katiyar would have to surrender her passport, if any, before the trial court. She has also been directed to submit an undertaking that she won’t leave the country without obtaining permission from this court or till the trial concludes.

On May 30, 2019, the Special Task Force had arrested Katiyar for her alleged involvement in leaking the question papers of two subjects for LT Grade Teacher Exam-2018 in Varanasi. She was sent to jail after being produced before the court.

The former UPPSC examination controller was arrested after several rounds of questioning. The STF also scanned her laptop and went through her documents. The team also managed to collect evidence from her office and residence.

A few days before Katiyar’s arrest, Kaushik Kumar, owner of the printing press roped in for publishing the question papers, was also arrested for his involvement in the paper leak. Based on his statement, an FIR was lodged against nine persons, including Katiyar, at Cholapur police station in Varanasi. The accused have been charged with embezzlement, fraud and other relevant sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act.

An instant bail application was filed on behalf of the applicant, Katiyar, with a request for release on bail in a criminal case under sections 420 (cheating),120B (conspiracy) and other sections of Indian Penal Code (IPC) read with section 7/8/13 of the Anti-Corruption Act. The application was registered at Cholapur police station in Varanasi district during the pendency of the trial.

Jodhpur: The high court on Friday issued notice to the Centre seeking reply on denial of Unique Identification Authority of India ( UIDAI ) to the police in providing the phone number linked with the Aadhaar of a missing girl.

Hearing a habeas corpus petition, a division bench of justice Sandeep Mehta and justice Vijay Bishnoi stated that in the cases where search was being made by the investigation officer for missing persons, the privilege of confidentiality cannot become a hurdle in the process of investigation.

Earlier, AAG Farzand Ali told the court that the IO tried to gather information regarding the mobile numbers linked with the Aadhaar of the missing girl in order to trace her, but the UIDAI refused to provide the information claiming privilege on the ground of confidentiality.

The petition had been moved by Anusuiya Rathore in 2018 stating that her daughter Garima had been missing since 2017 and had prayed the court to direct police to find her.

According to AAG Ali, Garima from Chittorgarh had gone missing with a boy, a cab driver, carrying money and ornaments from her house. A report was filed by police, but they could not be traced.

The IO told the court that all the measures were taken up, right from putting their phone numbers on surveillance to inquiry of the driving licence of the boy, but to no avail.

“The option, that could appear to be of some help, was catching them with their biometric data fed in Aadhaar through the phone numbers. But when we contacted the authorities, they refused citing violation of the right to privacy,” the AAG said.

Taking this denial seriously, the court issued notice to the Centre through the Additional Solicitor General seeking reply by February 24.

Trichy: The civic body has been dragging on its feet to make hoteliers, generating more than 50kg per day, responsible for taking care of food waste generated from their outlets as they have been given a grace period till February 15. The corporation had planned to stop collecting waste from them from December 1, 2019.

Two months on, corporation vehicles are still spotted collecting waste from the hotels near Central bus stand and Chathiram bus stand, while waste collection from hospitals with in-patient service has ceased. As a result, hospital managements have expressed their disappointment. “If the corporation can collect waste from hotels where waste generation is huge, why not from the hospitals as well? We cannot ask our patients to stop consuming food inside the hospital,” a medical professional from Thillai Nagar said.

Hoteliers on the other hand plan to charge customers extra for setting up recycling machines. “If the civic body forces us to install waste recycling machines, we have no other go than to collect a portion of the charge in recycling the waste from our customers. It will only affect the public,” a hotelier from Cantonment said.

Corporation officials said that the hotels were given an only grace period to identify alternatives for processing the waste. “From February 15, we will stop collecting waste from hotels.

NEW DELHI: In a rare move, a word from PM Modi ’s speech in Rajya Sabha was expunged from the records. Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu expunged the word used by Modi on Thursday during his reply to the discussion on a motion thanking the President for his address to the joint sitting of both Houses of Parliament at the start of the Budget session.

“The Chairman was pleased to direct expunction of a certain portion of the proceedings of Rajya Sabha dated February 6 at about 6.20 and 6.30pm,” Rajya Sabha secretariat said.

Modi had made the remark while launching a defence of the National Population Register saying it was being updated with demographic information for better targeting of government’s welfare schemes.

Naidu also expunged a word from leader of the opposition and Congress member Ghulam Nabi Azad ’s statement made after Modi’s speech. Azad had stated that the Congress was in favour of giving citizenship to persecuted migrants from Pakistan but was against framing of a law based on religion.

178,['8/02/2020'],PCMC may initiate Bopkhel bridge construction on defence land soon,"This story is from February 8, 2020

Pimpri Chinchwad: The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation may soon get permission to start the construction of the Bopkhel-Khadki bridge and its approach road in the defence area as the civic general body recently approved Rs25.81 crore to be given to the state government for giving alternative land to the defence authorities.

Shirish Poredi, the spokesperson of the engineering department of PCMC, said, “The civic body started the construction of the bridge last year, following which we put the foundation for five pillars in Bopkhel. We are now constructing a retaining wall for the approach road outside the river.”

He said the civic body was hopeful of getting permission from the defence authorities soon to construct the pillars and approach road on the defence land.

“Funds worth Rs25.81 crore have already been cleared to be given to the state government for providing its land to the defence authorities,” Poredi said.

He said the total length of the bridge was 1,500-metre and width was 8.4-metre. “The carriage width was 7.5-metre and there would be no footpath as defence authorities did not allow it. The cost of the project is Rs53.5 crore,” he added.

Bopkhel village has a population of 21,000. It is located along the Mula river and was merged within the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) limits in 1997.

The village is surrounded by defence land of the College of Military Engineering (CME) on three sides and Mula river on the fourth side.

Earlier, it was linked to the Pune-Mumbai highway in Dapodi via the 2.25km road through the CME land. But, it was closed in May 2015 on the directives of the high court for security concerns.

The recent general body resolution stated that Rs25.81 crore had to be given to the state government as value of its 7,367.03 square-metre land in Yerawada, which would be given to defence authorities for getting defence land for the Bopkhel bridge.

Gulab Bhalerao, the executive president of the Bopkhelgaon Rasta Sangharsha Samiti, said, “People have to travel around 6km to reach Khadki bazar to catch a bus. The distance would be reduced by half after the completion of the Bopkhel bridge.”

MEERUT: The Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) sleuths arrested a businessman from Kotdwar in Uttarakhand for fraud of Rs 20 crore.

On Thursday, he was produced before the special court in Meerut and sent to 14 days judicial custody.

According to sources, the businessman was fraudulently availing input tax credit by showing purchases via shell companies.

“On February 3, our teams had conducted raids on three firms located in Kotdwar. These were Uttaranchal Iron and Ispat Pvt. Ltd., PL Steels, and Kanhaiyaji Concast Pvt. Ltd., in which they found a GST fraud worth Rs 20 crores. In this connection, the director of PL Steels and Kanhhaiyaji, Mukesh Kumar, was arrested on Wednesday. On Thursday, he was produced before the GST court in Meerut and was sent to 14 days to judicial custody,” Manish Goel, additional director general, DGGI, told TOI on Friday.

Goel said there are several other companies on the radar at the moment.

Notably, this is the second raid conducted in the recent past. Last month, a similar raid took place at Poddar Ispat Pvt Ltd, in which the officials unearthed a GST fraud of Rs 10 crore.

This is not the first time that fraud of invalid input tax credit has come to the fore. In March last year, the DGGI sleuths had arrested Rajesh Goyal, 42, a resident of New Panchwati colony Ghaziabad, for issuing fake invoices of more than Rs 400 crore from around 50 shell companies.

180,['8/02/2020'],Trade deal with US may prove harmful to public health: Activists,"This story is from February 8, 2020

Mumbai: Health activists and the domestic medical device industry have expressed concern over the proposed US-India trade deal and its potential implication on public health. They have urged the government to reject the US demand for provisions, which could undermine public health and access to affordable medicines.

Worried about the “US pressure” to push India to accept harmful “TRIPS-plus” intellectual property provisions and to do away with price caps on medical devices , they have written to the Prime Minister to reject the US demand. “There is no precedent of India negotiating price control policies in trade, and it is critical that policies meant to protect public health are kept outside the purview of trade agreements”, the letter says, a copy of which is available with TOI. This comes weeks before the US President’s visit to India, and reports of a proposed trade deal between the two countries.

“”In particular, we are concerned with the US demand to do away with price controls on medical devices as part of the ongoing negotiations. We are also apprehensive of the continuous US pressure on India, which will surely intensify for increased intellectual property (IP) protections through amendments to the IP Act”, it adds.

It is understood that in a recent commerce ministry meeting with stakeholders, there was a demand from law firms representing pharma MNCs to remove public interest safeguards in the Patents Act, such as provisions restricting the scope of patentability, local working as a ground for granting of a compulsory license, pregrant oppositions etc.

In recent years, US has opposed India’s moves -- pricing caps imposed on cardiac stents and orthopaedic implants -- while earlier it had raised concerns regarding certain patent provisions like compulsory licensing for drugs. “If India accepts the “TRIPS-plus” demands of US, it would seriously undermine the availability of affordable generic medicines in India and result in pushing more people below the poverty line due to out-of-pocket expenditure on medicines and increased cost of healthcare”, it says.

The US demand to do away with price controls will allow companies to fix very high introductory prices for medical devices and this will compromise access to them by not correcting market distortion, they feel.

The signatories include public health activists represented by the Campaign for Access to Medicines-India, All India Drug Action Network, Initiative for Health & Equity in Society (IHES) International Treatment Preparedness Coalition, South Asia, Delhi Network of Positive People, Lawyers Collective, among others.

PUNE: Three of the five men who vandalized a private hospital at Ashirwad Chowk in Kondhwa on Wednesday night were arrested by the Kondhwa police on Friday.

Those arrested were Tousif Shaikh (24), Sohail Qureshi (23) and Mehboob Shaikh (24) from Shivnerinagar. They will remain in police custody till February 10. They work as a driver, a car painter and a fitter, respectively.

Five men had vandalised Welfare Hospital and abused its staff after a dispute over issuing a cause of death letter for a 17-year-old boy.

Inspector Mahadeo Kumbhar (crime) from Kondhwa police station said, “The CCTV cameras installed at the hospital captured the images of the vandals. The police established the identity of the three suspects and arrested them. The suspects are friends of the 17-year-old’s brother. Investigations have revealed that they had vandalized the hospital and attacked its doctor and staff. We are questioning them to identity their individual roles in the attack. The incident has to be investigated because it is a social offence.”

Their custodial interrogation will help identify the two suspects who are on the run. A police team has been sent to arrest them. Those already arrested will be questioned about the the involvement of the others, he added.

An offence of rioting among other charges of the Indian Penal Code and Maharashtra Medical Service Person and Medical Sevice Institution (Prevention of Violence and Damage or Loss to Property) was registered on an FIR lodged by the hospital’s director Sadique Khan.

The 17-year-old’s parents had admitted him in the hospital on Tuesday night. On Wednesday, the doctor told the boy’s parents to shift him to another hospital because his condition was not improving. The parents got his discharge and took him to two hospitals which refused to admit him. The patient then passed away on way to Sassoon General Hospital.

CM Vijay Rupani, mayor Bijal Patel and AMC chief Vijay Nehra at Happy Street on Friday

AHMEDABAD: The inauguration on Friday of ‘Happy Street’ — the revamped version of the 64-year-old ‘Khau Gali’ in the posh Law Garden — served up a controversy after people were seen walking over a rangoli themed on the tricolour . The rangoli, incorporating the image of Patang hotel, had been drawn on a footpath.

Criticism inundated social media platforms though many people were seen walking over the rangoli even late on Friday evening. Videos of people walking over the rangoli were widely shared by enraged citizens.

Citizens red-flagged the offence, tagging municipal commissioner Vijay Nehra and mayor Bijal Patel. C Shekhar Dave (CShekharDave1) tweeted: “Insult of National Flag By People. Flag created at Happy Street Law Garden by municipal corporation”. Another citizen, Muzammil Memon (muzammilmemon3), tweeted: “This photo from law garden new happy street way. This is an insult to our national flag. Please order the dismantling of the tiles.”

Speaking to TOI, a couple at Happy Street, Varun and Aradhna Kankariya, said they moved away from the rangoli. “Our national flag should not be drawn on the ground,” said Varun. “It is unfortunate that people unwittingly walked across it.”

Nehra said: “Some enthusiastic students had drawn the rangoli. People should have respected the flag and kept away from the area.” He went on to say: “But if someone posts or publishes photos of people walking on the rangoli, we will initiate action against.”

Legal experts said that painting the tricolour on a road was in violation of the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971. This law stipulates a jail term of up to three years or a fine or both for showing disrespect to the national flag. Imtiyazkhan Pathan, an advocate, said: “The definition of the Indian National Flag includes any picture, painting, drawing or photograph of the tricolour.” Pathan said that Article 51A of the Constitution also rules that every citizen must respect the national flag.

Representative image

TRICHY: Trichy Corporation will soon serve notices conveying its intention to stop collecting waste from apartments and gated communities irrespective of the quantity of the waste they generate every day. At the same time, residents are questioning the role of the civic body as it is levying solid waste user charges from all residents and commercial establishments.

The civic body has planned to collect waste only from individual houses and commercial establishments generating less than 50kg waste per day, and will stop waste collection from apartments and gated communities in a month.

“As the process of informing our decision to the apartments has been initiated, we have decided to stop collecting waste from gated communities with more than four dwelling units,” a civic body official said. The move, if implemented, will evoke a huge public backlash as the residents are already upset over the poor coverage of door-to-door waste collection.

“If Trichy Corporation refuses to collect waste from apartments, why collect solid waste user charge from us,” asked V Nadaraja, president of a residents welfare association (RWA) in Cantonment .

“Solid waste management is the key responsibility of a local body. If a corporation refuses to execute its duty, we will protest against the irresponsible move,” said S Sakthivel, convenor, Federation of Tiruchirappalli City Residents Welfare Associations .

The corporation had announced that waste collection from hotels and hospitals, that produce more than 50kg of waste per day, would cease from December 1, 2019. However, hoteliers have managed to avail grace time. But for city hospitals, the waste collection has stopped.

The civic body has suggested bulk waste generators to recycle their own waste into manure using recycling machines. As such machines needs heavy investment, residents are worried over a possible hike in the monthly rent.

The move to stop collecting waste from hospitals has added burden to hospital managements here. “After the corporation stopped collecting waste, we could not focus exclusively on our medical services, as getting rid of waste is a huge challenge each day,” a medical professional told TOI.

welcome move

Allahabad: Cleaner ‘pink’ toilets, newspapers to read and RO-filtered water supply are among the facilities that Allahabad University ( AU ) students would be able to access at the new ‘girls common room’, which was inaugurated on campus on Friday.

Located behind the education department, the facility was inaugurated by AU’s officiating vice-chancellor RR Verma. Constructed over a 1,200 square-feet area, the common room has the capacity to accommodate around 100 girls at a time. AU has over 23,000 regular students, including 7,300 women. However, until now, there were no common halls exclusively for women on the campus and students had been demanding one since long.

“Often there are long gaps between classes and there aren’t a lot of places to sit during such intervals. Most girls are forced to head to the Women’s College campus if they want to access a toilet. The new common room plugs these gaps,” said Priya Singh, a BSc student.

The facility was commissioned during the tenure former AU VC RL Hangloo, after a group of women students met him last August and demanded a common room. The construction commenced in August and was completed in December. The facility’s inauguration was delayed due to Hangloo’s resignation.

AU officials are also planning to install a sanitary pad vending machine in the newly constructed common hall.

Officials said the pink toilets were constructed in the arts faculty as it’s the busiest on campus and has the maximum number of women students, as compared to the commerce, science and law faculty. While the law and commerce faculty campuses have common rooms, they are no match for the new facility. We will consider constructing a similar common rooms for other departments as well, if the demand arises,” said AU public relations officer Shailendra Mishra.

The police said that Pradeep, who is a suspended member of a political party, was arrested after police received a complaint in January that he allegedly collected Rs 4 lakh from a victim with a promise to provide houses by using his political clout.

Officials said that the accused collected Rs 4 lakh and issued an allotment letter to the victim. Later, when the victim went to the GHMC office, they realised that it was a fake allotment letter.

On Thursday, Pradeep was taken into custody. He was arrested and produced in court on Friday.

Pradeep, who works in a fast food center, is a resident of Indira Nagar . He had duped victims in the past by using the same modus operandi. Two cases are pending against him in Banjara Hills and Jubilee Hills police stations.

Trichy: Computer virus produced by human ingenuity can be more harmful than biological viruses, said Prateep V Philip, DGP civil supplies, CID, Chennai.

He was speaking at a two-day workshop on Cyber Security, online verification and fact-checking organised by Central University of Tamil Nadu (CUTN) that concluded here on Friday.

Saying that every day 200,000 malwares are introduced into the net which is more harmful than any biological virus, he asked aspiring media professionals of CUTN to be committed to the integrity of data to counter this challenge.

Coronavirus is one of many viruses that keep mutating and every year we see a new virus. But the kind of virus and malware human ingenuity produces is far greater than biological virus, he said. He said that every day 200,000 are launched into network systems around the world and that makes the netizens prone to virus attack.

“It is far more pervasive than coronavirus, as it can be brought under control through strict measures. “But computer related virus is multiplying, and everyday human ingenuity is creating new forms of cybercrime and every one of us must have come across cyberattack of one kind or another,” he said.

The problem of too much information (TMI) and too little insight has been an issue, he said. While many world leaders are affected by fake news, he said we all become experts overnight by reading the shared fake news on social media which are hitting us at rapid rate.

“We have no control over fake news in social media platforms. We keep getting invaded by new dimensions of very burning issues around the world and we have no way of filtering it,” he said.

Asking students to analyse news with right perspective by developing an insight, he said it is only then we will be able to analyse news with the right perspective so that it will not be harmful for readers.

There are people who invent new methods to use ICT to harm others, if not physically, their reputation and, also to commit fraud.

A fact will remain fact and one cannot embellish it. But ICT has revolutionised the world and shrunk human mind.

Online verification, fake news and cyber security have ramification with each other. In this uncertain and ambiguous world, he said there is a need to develop commitment among youngsters on integrity of data to face the challenge.

Water gushes out of a damaged underground pipe in Bhubaneswar

BHUBANESWAR: The Public Health and Engineering Organisation ( Pheo ) will set up a cell for monitoring water supply network in an attempt to prevent loss of drinking water during transition or theft by private tankers.

The cell, which will be set up at the Water Corporation of Odisha’s office, will have dedicated manpower and be equipped with advanced tools to check and fix leakages in the pipelines. The cell has been entrusted with the responsibility to devise ways for saving drinking water.

Experts said nearly 90% of the holes in the pipelines can’t be detected because of their sizes, but they have the potential to drain a healthy amount of water out of the supply chain. “We are working on the issue. The cell with expert manpower will be of great help to check water loss,” a Pheo official said.

Pheo superintending engineer Chitta Ranjan Jena said there were plans to set up a centralised command control centre that would receive reports about leakages in the pipeline system. “Our team will visit the reported site and fix the line within a specified time,” he added.

Jena said, “The aim is to save enough water to implement the 24X7 water supply plan. It won’t be possible if we don’t take steps to save the water lost during transition.” The government has launched the ‘drink from tap’ mission to ensure that every household gets round-the-clock water supply.

Sources said Pheo supplies about 295 million litres of water to the households in Bhubaneswar daily, but half of it gets lost due to theft by private water tankers or during transition. According to the estimated population, the demand of water is pegged at 120 million litres a day.

“We do have an oversupply of water but we cannot afford to lose water as our consumer base has increased in recent times. The 24X7 water supply plan cannot be materialised if we don’t make prior plans to save water. The cell, control rooms and water metres will help in the process here,” another Pheo official said.

Bareilly: Former Samajwadi Party (SP) district president of Sambhal unit along with 40-50 party workers have been booked for staging a protest at sub-division office on Thursday. They have been booked for violation of section 144 (unlawful assembly).

On Thursday, Firoz Khan, former SP district president of Sambhal, along with 40-50 party workers visited the sub-division office to protest against potholed roads and poor power supply in the district. They later gave a memorandum to sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) to be sent to Governor Anandiben Patel.

Police later lodged an FIR against Khan and the party workers under IPC sections 188 and 505 (statements conducing public mischief).

Amit Kumar, station house officer, Kotwali police station, said, “Though only five party workers were called to talk to SDM, a large number of party workers reached there in violation of rules. Even they raised inflammatory slogans against officials of Public Works Department (PWD) and power department.”

Reacting to the FIR, Khan told TOI, “We were planning to protest against potholed roads but officials asked us to meet them rather than stage protests. So, when they asked us to meet them, why we have been booked. An FIR has been lodged against us for highlighting the plight of people.”

He added, “When we gave a memorandum, officials told us that our demands will be met. If the stretch from Sambhal-Gajraula, Sambhal-Behjoi and Sambhal-Chandausi is not repaired, we will launch a massive agitation against the government. Potholed roads are leading to accidents. We are ready to face more FIRs, but we want potholed-free roads.”

Awareness session was held before Friday namaz at Shikshak Park in the city

Kanpur: The Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) organized an awareness session ‘Jan Chaupal’ before Friday namaz at Shikshak Park in the Parade area of the city here in support of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

District BJP President Sunil Bajaj said, “Today, prior to ‘Juma namaz’ (Friday prayer), the city unit of the party organized a ‘Jan Chaupal’ and also an awareness session at Shishak Park in Parade area where we tried to satisfy the people, particularly Muslim men and women, by answering their CAA related queries and dispelled their misinformation on the issue”. He said more such ‘Jan Chaupals’ would be organized in the city till February 11.

“We have been repeatedly saying that the law isn’t aimed against any Indian, yet the opposition is playing vote bank politics and is hellbent on spreading false propaganda. However, we will expose the opposition parties with our awareness campaigns”, Bajaj said.

The party, he said, has also decided to distribute booklets and handbills among Muslims to clear misconceptions about the Citizenship Amendment Act. “The booklets and handbills contain details about the CAA that only grants citizenship to minorities in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh and has nothing to do with Muslim citizens of India,” he added.

To recall, scores of people had protested against the CAA in Babupurwa and Yateemkhana areas in December demanding its revocation because besides making religion a criterion for granting citizenship, it also violates the spirit of the Indian Constitution. Nearly, three people died and ten others were injured during the violent protests on December 20 and 21.

TRICHY: At least five districts in Tamil Nadu that border Kerala are on high alert to prevent the spread of novel coronavirus . Health officials from the state have been touring the districts to oversee preparations, health secretary Beela Rajesh said on Friday.The department of public health and preventive medicine has taken awareness on novel coronavirus to campuses by organising sensitisation programmes to educate students to focus on washing hands to prevent infection. The state has been encouraging people who have travelled out of the country to call a health worker if they have symptoms of fever, cold or breathlessness.State nodal officer Dr P Sampath said village health nurses and health inspectors have been told to instruct passengers on quarantine that they should not leave their homes if they have symptoms. “We will take them to GH by ambulance,” he said.Awareness programme was held for principals from more than 100 colleges from Trichy , at the government engineering college in Sethurapatti and at the office of the deputy director of health services ( DDHS ), Trichy, on Friday.The core objective of the programme was to drive home personal hygiene among students and faculty in crowded places like educational institutions.“Avoid being in crowded places, ensure hand hygiene. Since the novel coronairus is a droplet infection, people are prone to get infected anywhere,” A Subramani, DDHS, Trichy told TOI.Even though the state health department claimed to have no case of nCoV in the state, the public health and preventive medicine was in full swing to keep the general public informed about prevention measures. “We have no positive novel coronavirus case but we should be prepared to protect ourselves,” said DDHS.His team suggested the participants were told to tell their students to use cresol with soap solutions as disinfectant and hand wash. “It is available for cheap in the market. Cresol can be mixed in the advised ratio with water and used as disinfectant,” said DDHS.The public health department has planned to cover all the colleges in the district shortly.

Ajay Kumar Sharma voices the need for the state government to tweak regulations to allow cantonments to get a ... Read More

PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The principal director of Defence Estates , Ajay Kumar Sharma, will hold a meeting of defence and cantonment officials on Monday to review the progress in the matter of giving the share of Goods and Service Tax ( GST ) to cantonments.

“The state should give the GST share to the cantonments on the lines of the formula it uses to give the GST share to municipal corporations because cantonments are deemed to be municipal corporations,” said Sharma.

Letters seeking grants to the cantonments on the lines of municipal corporations have been sent to the state and the Union governments, Sharma told TOI after inaugurating a maternity ward at the Khadki Cantonment Board (KCB)-run Babasaheb Ambedkar Cantonment General Hospital on Friday.

Lt Gen SK Saini, the then general officer commanding in chief (GOC-in-C), had written a letter to the state government demanding the cantonments’ GST share. The state government officials had said GST was not collected from the cantonment areas.

“Now, the defence officials have informed them that the state government collects GST from the cantonment areas. There is a need for the state government to make amendments in the rules for giving the cantonments a share of GST,” said Sharma.

Lt Gen CP Mohanty, the new GOC-in-C, Southern Command, is conducting the follow-up regarding the GST share of the cantonments.

Suresh Kamble, chairman of finance committee, KCB, said, “Efforts are being made to get a share of GST from the Union and the state governments. There is a need for grants from the state government for implementing the health department’s schemes. Shivajinagar MLA Siddharth Shirole demanded Rs5 crore per annum for the KCB during the assembly session in Nagpur.”

KCB used to receive the share in octroi income from the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) as it collected octroi on its behalf. Later, the state government abolished octroi and replaced it with local body tax (LBT).

The cantonments are facing financial difficulties because of the abolition of octroi and LBT. Their main source of income now is the vehicle entry tax.

199,['8/02/2020'],"Cow dung craters: Showcause notice issued to NMC engineers, contractor","This story is from February 8, 2020

Nagpur: Taking serious cognisance of a TOI report on shoddy quality of road asphalting work at Ayodhya Nagar, municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe has issued show cause notice to executive engineer Avinash Barahate, deputy engineer KC Hedao, and junior engineer Lam Songe of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) Hanuman Nagar Zone, and contractor Amruta Construction.

For the first time, the civic chief also ensured three roads of total 300 meter were relaid by the contractor at a cost of Rs20 lakh.

Mundhe also directed NMC Public Works Department (PWD) to take samples from all recently asphalted roads and test their quality at NMC laboratory. NMC has asphalted many roads through private contractors at a cost of over Rs40 crore after monsoon. Now, PWD will have to test all these roads. Necessary action is likely to be taken if works are found to be of shoddy quality.

NMC had asphalted three internal roads of Ayodhya Nagar under NMC Hanuman Nagar Zone through Amruta Construction 10 days ago. Within a week, potholes appeared due to cow dung, which TOI reported on February 2. So, the roads had to be asphalted for the second time within 15 days by the same contractor.

Mundhe also directed chief engineer Ulhas Debadwar and superintending engineer Manoj Talewar to test the quality of latest works and take appropriate action.

Immediately after assuming charge, Mundhe had issued show cause notices to contractor and engineers for shoddy quality concretization of WHC Road.

RTI activist TH Naidu told TOI VNIT and other engineering colleges should be appointed as third party agencies for testing roads asphalted or concretized by NMC. “Engineers clear bills without any inspection. Actually, it is the responsibility of engineers to be present while execution of works, but that never happens in the city. Bills should not be cleared without approval of third party agencies,” he said.

Naidu added that quality of NMC works is likely to improve with Mundhe becoming civic chief. “We used to lodge a series of complaints but failed to get any response from engineers, who have a strong lobby in NMC. Assistant commissioners are transferred but engineers remain on the same posts for years. Mundhe has started to take action against engineers, which is a good sign,” he said.

Naidu said Mundhe should develop NMC’s new hotmix plant to ensure proper quality of road works. “NMC proposed a new plant seven years ago but never developed it. It is due to nexus between engineers and contractors. NIT asphalts all its roads through its own plant and never through contractors,” he said.

Trichy: A man who returned from Singapore was admitted in the isolation ward at the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial (MGM) government hospital here with fever and sore throat, on Friday.

Hospital sources said that he was not diagnosed with symptoms of novel coronavirus on arrival, but after reaching home he was feeling unwell and came for treatment at MGM where the doctors diagnosed him with fever, cough and sore throat.

Doctors collected his swab samples and sent it to the King Institute in Chennai on Friday. He seemed to have normal fever and his condition was stable. Since the lab test was required to rule out nCoV, the hospital administration admitted him in the isolation ward.

The 30-year-old man, working in Singapore for the past few years, a native of Trichy, returned to Trichy on Thursday. An official said that the man was involved in tunnelling works in Singapore.

A 38-year-old man of Pudukottai is also being treated in the isolation ward at MGM since February 4 after he complained of fever and sore throat after his return from China on January 31.

It may be pointed out that on February 4, the hospital administration discharged a 27-year-old man from Madurai who was first diagnosed with fever at Trichy airport on February 2. The hospital sent him back home after he tested negative for nCoV.

In the central region, government medical college hospital in Tiruvarur also admitted three men with unconfirmed nCoV since January 3. The latest was a 29-year-old man from Nagappattinam district. Dean of the hospital Dr J Muthukumaran said on Friday that he had no symptoms but he wanted to clear his doubts if he had any infection. “ His health condition is also normal,” said the dean.

On February 4, a 32-year-old man from Tiruvarur got admitted to the hospital to get a medical certificate to prove he was not infected with nCoV so that he can return to his job in China.

Of the three patients, a 35 year old man a returnee from China became normal after treatment since February 3. “The results of three people are yet to be out but they are normal and stable,” said the dean.

Representative image

PUNE: The Samarth police on Friday arrested the owner of a bakery under the charge of culpable homicide after a 17-year-old worker died of electric shock on January 24.

According to the police, the owner — Shahid Abdulhaque Ansari (52) from Kondhwa — ignoring his employees’ warnings about a malfunctioning machine, which fatally electrocuted Salauddin Ansari, who hailed from Uttar Pradesh.

Ansari was produced before a magisterial court, which remanded him in police custody till Saturday.

Police said that on January 24, Salauddin and two of his colleagues were operating the machine, which is used to pack bakery products, at Famous Bakery in Nana Peth. Around 10.30am, the three workers received a minor electric shock.

In a panic, the workers approached the bakery owner, complaining that the machine was malfunctioning. Ansari allegedly ignored their warnings and ordered them to continue working, claiming that they would be safe, police said.

Around 6.45pm that day, Salauddin was electrocuted while working with the machine and died as a result. A case of accidental death was registered under section 174 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Code.

Sub-inspector Vivek Padvi was appointed as the inquiry officer to investigate the circumstances leading to Salauddin’s death.

During the course of his investigation, Padvi found that the victim and his co-workers — Adam Ansari and Riyasat Ansari — had first complained to the bakery owner that the machine was malfunctioning, and that they were receiving electric shocks. He ignored their warnings and told them to continue working. The workers then resumed working, albeit in a state of fear, police said.

According to the inquiry, around 5.30pm, Adam again complained to his employer that it had become difficult for them to work because of leaking electricity from the machine.

The employer then used some testing equipment to check if the workers were really receiving electric shocks. Adam and Riyasat later expressed their inability to continue working and asked their employer to get the machine repaired, the inquiry established.

In their statements to the police, the workers said that their employer instructed them to continue working by reciting ‘bismillah’ (in the name of God) and that they would come to no harm. In spite of being aware of the fact that the machine was malfunctioning, Ansari forced his employees to work, the inquiry revealed.

“Ansari should have stopped his employees from working, but he ignored their warnings and did not ensure their safety, and forced them to operate the machine. The victim, Salauddin, collapsed after he suffered from an electric shock at about 6.07pm. The owner, instead of hospitalizing the worker, asked him to take rest. The victim’s cousin and fellow workers later rushed him to the hospital after his health started deteriorating, but he died on the way,” sub-inspector Padvi said.

“Salauddin’s life could have been saved, had the employer allowed them to stop operating the machine and instead rushed him to to the hospital immediately. There was negligence on his part,” Padvi added.

An FIR under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Juvenile Justice Act was lodged on Thursday.

Telangana govt mum on MGBS-Falaknuma route,"HYDERABAD: A day after Hyderabad MP, AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi wondered about the delay in taking up Metro Rail works in the Old City, Hyderabad Metro Rail managing director NVS Reddy on Friday said the state government will take a call on the works.“A call will be taken by the government soon on the Old City stretch,” he said. Except the 5.5km stretch in the Old City falling under corridor II, L&T Hyderabad Metro Rail Ltd (LTHMRL) has completed works in all the three corridors.Municipal administration minister KT Rama Rao said the government was committed to taking up works on the Old City stretch. He said this both on the floor of the assembly and also during a meeting with elected representatives from the Old City.Highly-placed sources in the government, however, said LTHMRL was not keen on taking up the project mainly due to land acquisition issues.“Though the government wants to complete the works, it is not in a position to spend Rs 1,000 crore on the stretch. It will be taken up along with Metro connectivity to the RGI airport in the second phase,” a senior official of the government said.The Old City Metro works were supposed to be taken up along with other corridors, but they was stalled six years ago after AIMIM legislators raised objections over the alignment announced by the government.The stretch, which is part of JBS to Falaknuma covering a distance of 15 km, was planned via Darul Shifa, Purana Haveli, Mir Alam Mandi, Moghalpura, Hari Bowli, Shalibanda and culminate at Falaknuma. AIMIM legislaxtors said if the road was widened to 80 ft or 100 ft from the existing 40 ft to 60 ft, as many as 1,100 properties would be affected. To avoid this, the MLAs came up with a new alignment via along the Musi river, High Court, City College, Hussaini Alam, Kalapathar and Bahadurpura.L&T, which conducted a feasibility study on the advice of the government, however, said the new alignment was not feasible as it would not only increase the project cost by Rs 400 crore to Rs 500 crore but also increase distance by 2 km. There were also environmental concerns as the alternative route was supposed to pass along the Musi river.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74021867,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-667716,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-funds-govt-mum-on-mgbs-falaknuma-route/articleshow/74016461.cms

BHOPAL: A tiger killed a woman in Matkuli region of Satpura Tiger Reserve , about 170km from Bhopal , on Friday morning, triggering violent protests by villagers who torched a forest office. This is the second such incident in Madhya Pradesh in four days — on February 3, a woman was killed and partly eaten in Katni.Hundreds of villagers in Matkuli are living in dread and demand that the tiger be removed from this patch of STR in Hoshangabad district.The victim, Sawariya Bai of Mehendikheda , had gone into the forest to defecate around 6am when the tiger attacked her. Villagers claim it was a tiger recently relocated from an enclosure in Bandhavgarh as part of its re-wilding process. They say it has been targeting their cattle, and has now killed a human.“We have recorded the movement of four tigers in the area but aren’t sure which one attacked the woman. Her family has been given Rs 4 lakh as compensation and efforts are being made to track the tiger,” STR field director S K Singh told TOI. The woman was attacked on a nullah between a revenue land and core area of STR, he added.The killing sparked anger in nearby villages. A mob of around 100 barged into the local eco-centre, armed with sticks and iron rods, demanding that the tiger be traced and translocated. Forest officials and other employees fled as the mob went on the rampage.“Villagers set fire to the forest office. The situation is now under control. We will register an FIR once we get an official complaint from the forest department. As of now they are busy chasing the tiger,” said Satish Andhman, TI Matkuli police station.“This is the third time that a tiger released in the wild from an enclosure has killed a human. The whole process of re-wilding is faulty,” said wildlife activist Ajay Dubey, adding that he is moving court with a request to close these enclosures.Around 20 people have been killed by tigers in MP in the last four years, say sources. Some experts blame it on mismanagement, arguing that tigers are being relocated to prey-deficient areas, resulting in conflicts.Read this article in BengaliIn Video: MP: Tiger kills woman near Satpura Reserve, angry mob destroys forest office",bhopal,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74021391,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-718058,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/tiger-kills-woman-near-satpura-reserve-mob-torches-forest-office/articleshow/74016445.cms
208,['8/02/2020'],Modern College calls back invite to Tushar Gandhi,"This story is from February 8, 2020

Tushar Gandhi

PUNE: Modern College of Arts Science and Commerce revoked an invitation to Tushar Gandhi , great grandson of Mahatma Gandhi , and activist Anvar Rajan after the Patit Pavan Sanghatna raised objections.

The two had been invited for a seminar titled ‘Revisiting Gandhi’ to mark the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. Rajan, is the secretary of Maharashtra Gandhi Smarak Nidhi where Tushar Gandhi is also a member.

In his first tweet about the development on Thursday night, Gandhi said that the programme was cancelled after “Patit Pavan Sanstha threatened to disrupt the programme if I was present”. Later on, Friday, he tweeted, “The dishonesty of the management of Modern College Pune is exposed. I believe they continued with the programme with a convenient speaker but yesterday they told me that the seminar was cancelled. They should rename the seminar ‘Revisiting Gandhi Dishonestly’.”

Rajan termed the withdrawal shameful. “I was told that I will be the keynote speaker. They took Tushar Gandhi’s contact number from me and said they wanted him to give the inaugural speech. I sent them the number. On Thursday afternoon, I got a call from them stating that my invitation has been cancelled. I did not ask for any reasons,” said Rajan.

He said that both Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) and Modern College were big institutions and should not succumb to the pressure from small organizations.

Meanwhile, Patit Pavan Sanghatna’s Swapnil Naik, said, “We had not objected to anyone coming. We had said that we would object to any anti-national talk on the campus. We have heard their speeches before and some have been objectionable. We do not want children to be influenced by this. When we came to know about the invitees, we met the staff of the college and said that we will object if the platform was used for political talk. We did not tell them to revoke the invitation.”

Gajanan Ekbote, chairman of Progressive Education Society that runs Modern College said, “This is seminar was held under SPPU’s Quality Improvement Programme. We received about Rs33 lakh from the university to organize it. A few organizations approached us yesterday stating that since it is a university-sponsored programme, no political statements should be made by anyone.”

Ekbote added the organizations also showed the staff videos of the speakers where they have criticized PM Modi, Amit Shah, ABVP and BJP among others. They said they will agitate if speakers criticize them. “So I called Tushar Gandhi and told him not to talk about politics but he said how can we separate politics and Gandhi? I told him it is an academic programme. There are 10,000 students studying in the 2.5 acre campus and many have examinations now. I am concerned about their security in case an untoward incident happens. Hence, we cancelled their invitation,” Ekbote said.

Ekbote further said that 250 delegates were attending the programme. “It is untrue that Gandhi was told that the programme was cancelled. I told him we will organize a separate lecture by him in a week and he had agreed to it,” he said.

When contacted, Tushar Gandhi said, “I wasn’t told that only my invitation was cancelled. I was told that the programme was cancelled due to objection from Patit Pavan Sanghatna. Later, Ekbote sir said the programme has been cancelled. He said the funding agency, would not like me talking political and that student organizations too had objected. It is insulting that they lied to me especially in a programme on Bapu. Now I will not like to come to Modern college at all.”

“The worrying aspect is that this kind of attitude is being promoted and we are succumbing to threats. Only the values enshrined in our constitution make us a democracy. If fundamental rights are going to be curbed due to loutish elements in the society, then it is a worrying sign,” he said.

State ministers tweet over developments

State housing minister Jitendra Avhad tweeted to home minister Anill Deshmukh on Friday morning about the goings-on at Modern College. In reply, Deshmukh tweet said: “I Thank you Avhadhji for informing me about this issue. We will make sure that prompt action is taken and justice is done in this case.” Awhad then tweeted: “Thank you ... for your quick response on the #TusharGandhi episode and prompt action with this It is a clear message to anti-democratic forces that they will b given a fitting reply from the govt.”

209,['8/02/2020'],Fasting Matri Sadan seer Padmavati seeks action against Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat &amp; six others,"This story is from February 8, 2020

Haridwar: Seer Padmavati, on Thursday, addressed a letter to the Prime Minister, in which she sought action against seven people in the next seven days. These include Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat, Jal Shakti ministry secretary UP Singh, CMOs of Dehradun and Haridwar, SDM of Haridwar and Van Nigam managing director Monish Mullick.

The seer, who was lifted by police from Matri Sadan ashram in Haridwar on the night of January 30 and admitted to Doon Hospital, began a fast unto death on December 14, demanding an immediate freeze on a hydel project and halt to illegal sand mining on the Ganges.

Padmavati alleged these people had been harassing her, that she was taken to Doon Hospital by force on their orders, and that they had defamed her by alleging she was two-months pregnant, just to kill the movement to save Ganga led by Matri Sadan.

In her letter, sent on the 55th day of her fast, she also sought the PM’s permission to be allowed to “peacefully sacrifice her life for Ganga”, mentioning the mental trauma she is undergoing at the sight of doctors, cops or any district official.

The seer in her letter said that her only plea is to be allowed to continue her “tapasaya for the river”. “In case you fail to meet my demand of initiating action against these seven people, then my only request to you is to allow me to continue my tapasya and sacrifice my life for the holy river Ganga,” reads the letter.

Earlier on February 1, she had slapped Rs 100 crore notice on the Dehradun CMO and the doctor under whom she had been admitted to Doon Hospital, Dr Vijay Bhandari, giving them seven days to “plead guilty and to disclose the names of people who had spoiled my name by calling me two-months pregnant.”

Dayanand, another seer of Matri Sadan, said neither of them has responded yet. “We haven’t heard anything from the doctors till now. Padmavati is under tremendous trauma after being victimised by the government at the hospital,” he said.

Meanwhile, another seer Aatmabodhanand, who sat on hunger strike on the same night that Padmavati was relocated by the cops, has completed nine days of fast on the same demands.

Amaravati: Following rising complaints over being left out of pension beneficiaries’ list, the state has decided to take up a special drive to identify eligible candidates to receive welfare pension. The special drive would continued for a week and a fresh list will be readied.

Panchayat raj and rural development minister Peddireddy Ramachandra Reddy has assured that each and every eligible person would be granted pension soon after the re-verification through the special drive is completed. He appealed to the elderly and other pensioners not to worry about not getting pension during the current month as they would be given February’s pension along with March’s pension.

In a statement on Friday, the minister said that mandal parishad development officers and municipal commissioners will personally visit each and every household of those who have been removed or missed from the lists and include their names if found eligible during the inspection.

Meanwhile, speaking to media in the secretariat, municipal administration minister Botcha Satyanarayana rubbished talk of removing pensioners on a large-scale. He said they were ready to grant pension to every eligible person irrespective of their political affiliations. He assured the pensioners not to panic even if they don’t get their money in February as they would grant their pension if found eligible in March. He said they have granted pension to six lakh new candidates in the last few months.

“The official surveys identified about 4.16 lakh people as ineligible to receive the pension and removed them from the lists. We are assuring people to wait for a few more days as we have instructed the officials to take up re-verification. We are ready to include any number of people if they are found eligible,” said Satyanarayana.

The minister took the opportunity to clarify that the process of appointing members for the select committee has not begun as the council chairman had not followed due procedure. “Chairman has no authority to appoint the select committee on his own. He has to follow the due procedure,” said the minister.

He also rubbished reports of Millennium Towers in Visakhapatnam getting vacated to house the secretariat. He said that they were not in a hurry to move to Visakhapatnam despite the fact that the government is committed to decentralise administration.

Representative image

MARGAO: Francis ‘Boy’ Pereira, accused of desecrating several religious structures and discharged by courts in several such cases, was once again arrested by Curchorem police on Friday after a cross located at Camral in Curchorem was found defaced.

Police sources said that the cross was found desecrated on Friday morning. Acting on a complaint lodged by a local, police booked a case against Pereira under Sections 295 (injuring or defiling place of worship with intent to insult the religion of any class) and 427 (mischief causing damage) of the IPC.

The police nabbed Pereira from Margao where he had come to attend a hearing in the externment proceedings against him in the court of the South Goa district magistrate. He was arrested while he was returning home after the case was adjourned to March 20.

The Curchorem police have also booked Pereira under section 3 of the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act after he allegedly broke the plaque announcing the launching of a work and carrying the name of power minister Nilesh Cabral.

The externment proceedings against Francis ‘Boy’ Pereira underway in the court of the South Goa district collector for over the last nearly two years. Defence lawyer Eric Coutinho, arguing on behalf of Pereira has earlier submitted before the court of the South Goa collector that of the 19 cased filed against Pereira, he has been discharged in most of them.

The South Goa police, in its report to the district magistrate seeking Pereira’s externment from the district has submitted that he has been “posing constant hazard in the maintenance of public peace in the locality and his movements are causing alarm and fear in the minds of the public” and that there was reasonable ground to believe that “he may engage in commissioning of cognisable and non-bailable offences.”

55-year old Pereira, a resident of Curchorem, was arrested by the Curchorem police on July 15, 2017, after a month-long police hunt.

PUNE: Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Limited ( MahaMetro ) is drawing up plans for last-mile connectivity for the Metro service , widely expected to start later this year.“We have started Metro trials recently and are holding talks with different agencies for last-mile connectivity,” a senior MahaMetro official said.The official said they plan to introduce several options, in addition to Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) buses. “E-rickshaws and bicycles are among the options. We need to conduct an analysis of ridership in different areas,” the official said.A PMPML official said it was very likely that their midi (mid-sized) buses will be used for this service. “We have 250 midi buses, which will be used. These buses may be smaller than conventional buses, but will need less parking space near the stations,” outgoing PMPML chief Nayana Gunde had said.Metro services on the priority stretch between Sant Tukaramnagar and Dapodi are expected to become operational this year.Activists, however, are against the idea of PMPML providing feeder buses. “The Delhi Metro has its own feeder service. I don’t think PMPML should even be involved in this. Our analysis shows that Metro ridership is going to be very less. Why should the PMPML sacrifice its buses? It must first improve its quality,” Sujit Patwardhan of Parisar said.Meanwhile, RTO officials said the registration of e-rickshaws was less than ideal. “The registration has been dismal in Pune. We have tried to encourage people to use them, but in vain. With MahaMetro thinking about e-rickshaws as an option for feeder services, the figures might improve,” an RTO official said.“Buses are one option, but PMPML’s fleet is still thin,” Sanjay Shitole of PMP Pravasi Manch said.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74022572,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-902228,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/efforts-on-to-provide-last-mile-connectivity-for-metro-service/articleshow/74016464.cms

Rampur: A court in Rampur has given bail to 15 anti-CAA protesters on Friday. The district and sessions judge Alka Srivastava accepted the bail pleas and directed that they be released after furnishing two bail bonds of Rs 1 lakh each. The protesters were arrested by police for their alleged involvement in the December 21 anti-CAA violence in Rampur.

District government counsel Dalwinder Singh told TOI, “We had vehemently opposed the bail pleas of the protesters. The court granted bail after investigating officer dropped heinous charges against them.”

Recently, Amar Singh, the investigating officer of the case, had produced two separate applications before the court, in which he had stated that no offence under charges of murder, attempt to murder and dacoity could be made out against 26 of the jailed protesters. During the protest, one of the alleged protesters Faiz Khan was “shot dead”.

Kotwali police had arrested more than 30 persons and sent them to jail under IPC sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapons), 149 (unlawful assembly), 307 (attempt to murder), 302 (murder), 333 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt to deter public servant), 353 (assault or criminal force) and sections 3 and 4 of the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, 1984. Section 7 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act (CLAA) was also invoked against the protesters.

According to officials, 10 protesters were sent to jail by Ganj Kotwali police station under charges of “rioting, assault on public servants and attempt to murder”.

Defence counsel Syed Amir Mian said, “They [protesters] had been arrested after violence broke out at Hatikhana square last December. The charges of heinous crimes — such as murder, attempt to murder and dacoity — were dropped after the courts accepted the investigating officer’s applications. After dropping the charges, we had moved their bail applications which the court accepted. They [15 people] have now been granted bail in the matter.”

Notably, family members, particularly women, of the jailed “innocent individuals” had earlier also registered their protests and demanded their immediate release following which the investigating officer had moved an application to drop the “heinous charges”. Now, the family members of other arrested protesters are waiting for their release too.

KANPUR: A sub-inspector (SI), posted at Ghatampur Kotwali police station of the district, was sent to lines after he allegedly barged inside a marriage venue and took to the dance floor after forcing the DJ to play his favourite Bollywood numbers.

The incident took place on late Thursday night at a resort in Jahangirabad area under Ghatampur police station, where the reception of Anirudh Yadav, brother of pradhan of Benda village, Vikas Yadav, was underway.

According to police sources, SI Amit Sharma, along with three constables, had gone inside the marriage venue without any invitation. The host of the function Vikas Yadav then went to the Ghatampur Kotwali and lodged a complaint in this regard. Later, he also brought the matter to the knowledge of senior police officials, including DIG Anant Deo, alleging how the SI, who was not been invited to the marriage function, had forcibly barged inside the venue and took to the dance floor after forcing the DJ to play his favourite Bollywood numbers.

The SI allegedly manhandled a male guest Aditya Yadav, who tried to question his presence at the function. “He then misbehaved even with the women guests, who tried to intervene in the matter. He also created ruckus at the wedding venue and threatened the host and the guests with dire consequences. The police were called, but when they arrived at the venue, he fled the spot along with the constables accompanying him,” said the witnesses.

“On the instruction of DIG, the SI has been sent to lines. The role of police constables, who accompanied the SI is being scanned. We are scanning CCTV footage and investigations are continuing,” said inspector Ghatampur Kotwali Gyan Singh.

220,['8/02/2020'],AMU to conduct pending exams from next week,"This story is from February 8, 2020

Agra: Nearly two months after the Aligarh Muslim University ( AMU ) was closed for early winter vacation due to violence that erupted in the campus on December 15 during the anti-CAA protest, the university has decided to conduct the pending examinations from next week.

Confirming this, AMU spokesperson Shafey Kidwai said that a fresh schedule for the pending examinations was being prepared by the respective deans and would be notified separately. He said pending examinations in social science faculty would be held between February 10 and 17. The decision was taken by the dean at a recent meeting chaired by vice-chancellor Tariq Mansoor.

AMU authorities had postponed examinations for the second time on January 15 after reopening of the university, as students had completely locked down the campus despite repeated appeals by the vice-chancellor to resume classes and take exams.

The protesting students have been demanding withdrawal of all “false cases” registered against protesting students, no further police action or harassment against those who carry out peaceful protests on campus, and resignations of VC Mansoor, registrar Abdul Hamid and proctor Afifullah Khan for alleged police excesses in the campus on December 15.

Though the VC and registrar have not resigned from their posts, proctor Afifullah Khan stepped down on Tuesday.

AMU’s coordination committee member Faizul Hassan, who is also the former students’ union president, said that appearing in the examination is individual’s decision, but they will not call off their strike till their other demands, including resignation of the VC and the registrar, were met. He said their protests against the CAA and NRC would also continue. The students offered Friday prayers at Bab-e-Syed in large number.

Jaipur: Under the new excise policy of Rajasthan government, which will be announced by chief minister Ashok Gehlot soon, it is believed that a fresh lottery of the liquor shops in the state would be conducted and may set a target of 15% increase in the revenue, pegged at around Rs 12,500 crore.

According to an official, currently the revenue is over Rs 10,000 crore. The lottery of the liquor shops in Rajasthan was introduced in 2005. There are three types of liquor shops - composite shops (in which both Indian-made foreign liquor and country liquor are sold), IMFL shops and country liquor shops.

Currently, there are around 6,600 liquor shops in the state, including composite, IMFL and country liquor shops. As the state government is exploring various ways to discourage consumption of alcohol, it may introduce hiked liquor rates to serve the purpose and also boost revenue.

""Under the lottery system, anyone can apply for a shop. If more than one application is received for the possession of a shop, lottery is conducted for that shop. In 99% cases, more than one application is received to seek possession of a shop. Lottery is conducted for all types of shops,"" said an official.

""The new policy has not been approved yet (by the chief minister). It will take 3-4 days more to get an approval,"" said a finance department official.

Earlier, a high-powered committee set up under senior cabinet minister B D Kalla to study the demand for liquor prohibition had ruled it out. The committee, which included representatives of NGOs, had vowed to make efforts to reduce consumption of alcohol by creating awareness among people by highlighting its bad effects.

On the new liquor policy, Kalla had said heritage hotels and historic buildings, which are frequented by foreign tourists, would be given liquor licenses.

Bareilly: Journey of two minor children, 11 and 4, from Hardoi to Haridwar to become spiritual leaders was cut short after the children were caught by the ticket collector at Bareilly railway station on Thursday night. The two cousins had left their home on Thursday after they were scolded for not studying . They had decided to reach Haridwar to become ‘sadhus’ so that they don’t have to go to school and study.

The boys were first handed over to government railway police and then to ‘Childline’ team and their parents in Hardoi were informed about them. Both the children are the residents of Timna Kalan village in Beniganj area of Hardoi. One of them studies in Class V while the other has recently joined school. Both the children boarded the general coach of Howrah-Dehradun Mail (13009) at 9.30 pm from Hardoi railway station.

The children were wearing their school uniform. The elder one was carrying his school bag. They soon caught the attention of co-passengers. Upon questioning, the children said that they are with their family and going to Haridwar. Suspecting that the children were lying, passengers informed TTE and the children were deboarded from the train at Bareilly junction railway station around 12 am. Thereafter, the children were handed over to Childline through GRP and information was gathered about their family. The children told officials that they have relatives in Haridwar who have turned into sadhus and live a peaceful life there.

Ramanjeet, coordinator child helpline team, told TOI, “Both the children are cousins and their parents are expected to reach Bareilly anytime on Friday night. The children told us that they were going to Haridwar where they could become ‘sadhus’. Elder one was particularly tense and said that everyone used to scold him for not studying and he doesn’t want to go to school while the younger one looked scared and didn’t talk much.”

“The children were carrying a bag containing books and two pair of clothes. We are waiting for their parents to arrive but we may not be able to hand over the custody of children to them because the court is closed and will open on Monday. Abandoned children are legally handed over to their parents through child welfare committee (CWC). We may transfer them to Childline team in Hardoi to ensure that their parents won’t face much inconvenience,” he added.

Bhaiya Lal, father of elder children, told TOI, “My son studies in a primary school while his cousin goes to Anganwadi centre for studies. The children were reluctant to go to school and were forcefully sent which is why they got angry and didn’t return home. We all were quite tense but late night we received a call from police that both of them were found in Bareilly. We are thankful to God that our children are safe.”

Vadodara: Children and youngsters suffering from thalassaemia are usually advised to avoid strenuous physical activities as it may hurt them. But nearly 90 thalassaemia patients from across the country will break the myth when they take the field on Saturday. Aged between 14 and 24 years, the youngsters will play a cricket tournament at a private ground on Gorwa Road.

A city-based NGO, The Wishing Factory that works for thalassaemia patients, has organized the event where the participants will play 20-over matches. “The idea is to send a message among thalassaemia patients that the disorder doesn’t restrict them from living a normal life. They can play sports and enjoy it,” said Parth Thakur, a thalassaemia patient, who started the not-for-profit organization. He works for welfare of thalassaemia and blood cancer patients.

“As disabled children find it difficult to express their emotions, sports or any physical activity act as an outlet to their emotions and help them cope up with stress, anxiety, and depression. Sports helps enhance mental health by building confidence, self-esteem, and resilience,” Thakur told TOI. The 10-over cricket matches will be played with tennis ball.

“We had organized this tournament for the first time last year but this time eight cities including Vadodara, Surat, Rajkot, Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Ulhasnagar and Nagpur are participating in the tourney,” Thakur added.

Agra: A fake maritime academy run by a gang of eight men was busted by Agra police on Friday. So far, the kingpin and two others have been arrested.

The fake academy, ‘Offshore Shipping’, has been functioning near NH-2 since 2013. Since then, more than 300 aspiring sailors enrolled in it. All the “students” primarily hailed from remote areas of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Haryana, Punjab and Chhattisgarh. However, none are from UP.

According to police, kingpin of the gang identified as Zulfikar Ahmad, 30, has been arrested. An MBA degree holder from Dhoomanganj Allahabad city, Ahmad was living in Satsangi apartments In Ellora Enclave under New Agra police station.

Financer of the academy Dinesh Kumar and his son, Lokesh Kumar, hailing from Quarsi in Aligarh district, have also been arrested. They were putting up in Surya apartments in Lawyer’s Colony here. Police said Dinesh Kumar was also an instructor at the fake academy.

Speaking with TOI, Saurabh Dixit, an additional superintendent of police, said, “The fake maritime academy only targeted unemployed youth of remote areas who lived outside of Uttar Pradesh in order to avoid suspicion. The academy was operating for the past seven years. It admitted close to 40 students per batch with each paying Rs 1.80 lakh as fee for a four-month course.”

Umesh Chandra Tripathi, station house officer of New Agra, said, “The fake academy is located in Kaushalpura and has a hostel, an open ground and digital classroom facility. We assume the gang made more than Rs 5 crore.” He said the matter came to light after duped aspirants connected police and complained about the academy, which promised to get them placed in shipping companies. But the certificates issued by academy were not accepted at any job interview, as they were fake, said the SHO.

ASP Dixit said, “The students were made to mop the academy floors and were taught nonsense stuff. The website of ‘Offshore Shipping’ claimed that the academy was recognized by the ministry of government affairs but no such ministry exists.”

One of the duped student, Sanjay Singh, said, “They charged us Rs 300 for entrance examintion to qaulify for the four-month course. They also passed such students who couldn’t even write their name in English.”

Panaji: The seed of the unique Goan culture with its well appreciated model of peaceful coexistence took root in Old Goa , in a globalised society, centuries before the concept of globalisation became known.

Delivering a talk on Cathedral Day at Se Cathedral in Old Goa on Thursday, author and history researcher Oscar de Noronha said that Rudyard Kipling’s saying that East and West can never meet was disproved at Old Goa, as the historic coming together of local and foreign communities here did indeed produce a globalised society.

Making a case for greater attention to Old Goa by the local community and the world, Noronha said the old city needs to be preserved for the heritage value of its monuments and for being the crucible of Goan culture of tolerance. The much revered St Xavier’s sacred remains attract people of all faiths.

“It is here that Asia’s first university and printing press were established, scientific study of Konkani and polyphonic music was initiated, and exquisite Goan cuisine took shape,” Noronha said.

Though the once vast city, which extended towards Corlim, Bainguinim and Carambolim, is now being choked from all sides, locals have to show passion to protect it. “Old Goa remains precious and ever-relevant to Goa and to all people of goodwill from the world over,” he said.

Before its decline, it was a political power hub, developed into a commercial emporium with goods brought in and exported from all over the world, an educational and cultural centre, religious powerhouse and a fashionable town. But the moral decay prevailing then prompted St Xavier to urge the Portuguese king to send in the inquisitors to halt the permissiveness, Noronha said.

NEW DELHI: Congress on Friday slammed the Modi government for ""stifling its voice"" every time it sought to question the government. Party MP Rahul Gandhi alleged BJP did not ""like him speaking in the House"" and stopped him, as a result, in what he called was a ""completely unparliamentary manner. ""

Rahul also claimed that Union health minister Harsh Vardhan had acted at the behest of higher ups in the government and read out a statement demanding an apology from him instead of answering a question about his parliamentary constituency not having a medical college.

""People are struggling because they don't have access to medical facilities. BJP obviously doesn't like me to speak in the House. So, in a completely unparliamentary manner, the health minister raised something that I said outside, which he has no business doing during Question Hour,"" he said .

Later, Congress lodged a formal complaint against Vardhan with Speaker Om Birla , demanding action against the minister and an apology from him for his ""unparliamentary"" remarks against Rahul Gandhi.

""Gandhi pleaded that his rights and privileges should be restored and opportunity should be given to him to ask questions. I have said our member in the Well went there due to the emotional outburst triggered after the minister's remarks. If found to be wrong, we will express regret,"" Congress' leader in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said.

234,['8/02/2020'],Top grades elude Raj varsities,"This story is from February 8, 2020

Times News Network

Jaipur: Rajasthan may have highest numbers of universities in the country but none of these has scored top grades, A+ or A++ , by the MHRD.

Majority of the 77 varsities have never participated in the National Assessment and Accreditation Council ( NAAC ) ratings while those which tok part have scored A, B and C grades, which creates a major obstacle in creating an image of the state as an education hub.

The NAAC grading gives an overall impression about universities in terms of faculty, courses, infrastructure and innovation to name a few. These rankings are not mentioned in the degree, diploma or certificates but it is being considered by students while seeking admission.

Even premier institutes like Rajasthan University (A-grade), Central University (A-grade) and Mohan Lal Sukhadia University (A-grade) have not able to secure the best grades. These are most sought after institutes in the state. While the other premier ones like Jai Narain Vyas University, Kota University and Maharaja Ganga Singh University and Maharishi Dayanand Saraswati University are far from the top grade.

“The NAAC rankings are a real assessment of any institute or a heath card. The overall poor rankings mean it is a clear mismatch between quality and quantity and state shouldn’t boast untill it has some A++ grades. Also, it questions government and other stakeholders who have failed on this important front,” said Puneet Sharma, an educationist.

The poor NAAC grades make the institutes ineligible to get funding from different agencies. “The poor grades are a big disadvantage for teachers and students as chance of getting funds become dismal. Every funding agency considers NAAC grading before shortlisting any proposal for grants,” said Sharma.

KB Kothari, a senior educationist, felt the this situation was preventing students from outside state. “The enrolments in several such universities have become so low they have not able to sustain. It is not a good sign for the education sector in the state,” said Kothari, who also asked the state to ensure they should limit the opening of new institutes and allowe those who meet all norms.

SECUNDERABAD: Commuting woes of people travelling to Habsiguda, Tarnaka, Nacharam, Moulali and ECIL X roads from Lalapet have finally eased after more than eight months.

The Lalapet flyover , which was closed in May 2019 for renovation and repair work, was made operational from Friday.

The repair work was expected to be completed by August 2019 but was postponed to December 2019. “We were unable to procure bearings, so the work was delayed,” said a GHMC official.

“The flyover has been renovated at a cost of Rs 5.85 crore. Works such as elevation corrections, laying of CC wearing coat, new expansion joints, strengthening of beams were taken up,” said a Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) engineer from projects department.

“The flyover being operation is now a major relief,” said Ananth Rao a resident of Moulali. “The traffic menace at Mirjalguda T junction has reduced. We no longer have to take a detour from Habsiguda and Nacharam to reach Tarnaka.”

When the flyover, measuring 650 metres in length was closed, heavy vehicles from Tarnaka Junction to Lalapet flyover were diverted at Tarnaka Metro Station , Tarnaka flyover and Habsiguda, causing congestion in those areas. Another resident said that the making the flyover operational was important keeping in mind heavy traffic.

It was the Chinese New Year in the last week of January that the scare of coronavirus was apparent in various parts of China,” recounts Jesal.She had a harrowing experience coming to India to escape the lockdown of Shanghai in nick of time. Jesal arrived at Ahmedabad airport on Thursday and is now with her uncle’s family in the city.“I heard the stories of food shortage but I did not experience it myself. What I can say is, there was panic due to scarcity of masks. I along with the family that hosted me had shifted to Xinjiang, five hours from Shanghai, where there was no case,” said Jesal, adding that the phenomenon prompted the Chinese to follow hygiene practices and wear masks.She added that as the virus was completely new, there was surely a lot of apprehension in China but the work is on to find a remedy.When the Indian authorities refused to allow her in the country and prepared to send her back to Shanghai, her father had taken on to Twitter and had appealed to Indian and international authorities. “It was a harrowing experience but I also got help from unexpected quarters. An FRRO official saw my PIO card and allowed me in India — I cried at that moment,” she recounts.What next? “I don’t intend to return to London immediately.

A decision will be taken in accordance with the law and no section of society will face any kind of discrimination.

Ahmedabad: If all had gone to plan, 318 students of the National Institute of Design (NID), donning distinctive Indian attire, would have received degrees and awards in the presence of their parents. But the premier design institute had cancelled its 40th convocation with a curt email sent to students last Sunday. Fifteen-odd students who arrived on the campus, however, remained positive in the face of the institute’s somewhat indifferent attitude. The students organized their own get-together with their parents and a few faculty members on the institute’s lawns on Friday evening.

“Majority of us are leaving on Friday night or Saturday morning,” said a postgraduate student. “It would have been great on the institute’s part to at least give us a heads-up on what’s in store.” The student said: “It is unlikely that my parents will travel again to Ahmedabad for the convocation. They are also returning home on Saturday morning.” The student went on to say: “But I found solace in the fact that they could meet my close friends and teachers I adored.”

Over the course of the week, the institute maintained distance from media and external stakeholders, not revealing the reason that led to the cancellation. Even the chief guest for the event, danseuse Mallika Sarabhai, was not offered an explanation.

Veni Shaila & Vignesh were set to exchange rings when a giant wave drowned her at Palavakkam

CHENNAI: It was their second wedding anniversary and the Vellore couple wanted to exchange gold rings in the sea off Palavakkam in the city. Just after midnight on Thursday, after they had cut a cake and stepped into the water, tragedy struck. A giant wave pulled the woman, a nurse, in and she drowned. Her husband managed to escape.

Police identified the deceased woman as Veni Shaila. The 27-year-old, who works at the Christian Medical College Hospital in Vellore, married Vignesh, who works in a textile firm there, on February 7, 2018.

On Thursday morning, the couple and their one-year-old son arrived in the city and went to the house of a friend in Neelankarai. At night, they hosted a dinner for family members, relatives and friends before arriving at Pagalai Nagar Beach in Palavakkam at 11.30.

Two police constables, who were on duty at the beach, saw five cars screech to a halt close to the shore and around 30 people including children and adults get off. Shocked to see so many people there at that time of the night, the constables warned them against entering the water. The group of people convinced them saying the couple would cut a cake and they would all leave.

“After cutting a cake on the seashore, just 10 minutes before midnight, the couple told the constables they would like to exchange rings with waves touching Veni Shaila’s feet as she had wished,” said Neelankarai assistant commissioner of police Visweswara Ayya.

The constables were asked to move away and as they were sending the others in the group away from the water, the couple ventured a few metres inside. Though water was at the hip level, Veni Shaila’s friends began videographing the event and she went deeper into the sea. Vignesh was closer to the shore. As she tried to open a box of rings, a huge wave dragged Veni and her husband in. Vignesh, however, managed to scramble back to safety, but there was no sign of his wife. The other members of the group began a frantic search but could not find her.

The constables on the spot ran to a nearby fishermen’s colony for help and wanted to set out in a boat. They abandaned the plan as it was too dark. The constables alerted the Neelankarai police. Veni Shaila’s body washed ashore at Kottivakkam beach around 2am.

The body was sent to the Government Royapettah Hospital for postmortem examination. Police said an inquiry by the Revenue Divisional Officer (RDO) was ordered as the woman had died within seven years of her marriage.

251,['8/02/2020'],177 employees of cash-strapped BSNL opt for VRS,"This story is from February 8, 2020

Bareilly: More than half of the BSNL manpower comprising 177 employees of different sections in Bareilly got retirement under voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) offered by the national telecom on Friday. After mass retirement, according to BSNL officials, landline consumer availing telephone and broadband services could face difficulties for a temporary period since only a few linemen were left in the department to fix snapped cable.

District secretary of national federation of telecom employees (NFTE) Ratipal Singh said that among 177 BSNL employees got retired on Friday, 48 were associated with their federation.

“BSNL consumers are going to suffer badly as most of the retried employees are lineman and other technicians. In Budaun district, out of 33 employees, 31 took VRS while in Pilibhit of 31 employees 29 opted the same today. Now one can assume how the department will run by two employees there,” Singh said.

Deputy general manager of BSNL Bareilly, Ashvini Kumar Saxena, also expressed his anxiety over mass retirement and said, “Of 342 employees, 177 retired today. We have already called tenders and vacant posts will be filled by outsourcing. We hope things will be under control within a month.” However, he said that as of now there was no shortage of manpower in Bareilly.

Notably, there are 7,169 landline and 3,178 broadband customers availing BSNL services. Besides, post-paid mobile phone customers in Bareilly are 4329 while pre-paid ones are 3.21 lakh.

The VRS for BSNL employees was notified in November and the Bareilly had prepared a list of as many as 269 aging employees who are 50 plus.

The cash-strapped public sector undertaking has set a target of offering voluntary retirement to 80,000 employees across the country as 70% of BSNL’s revenue alone is spent on their salary. The BSNL has been lagging behind private players due to its slow Internet speed and data spectrum. While private telecoms have made available 4G services, BSNL is stuck with 2G and 3G.

252,['8/02/2020'],HC quashes cognizance against former IAS Aswal in a corruption case; prosecution fails to bring evidences,"This story is from February 8, 2020

Jaipur: In a relief to former IAS officer Lalchand Aswal, a single bench of Rajasthan High court on Friday quashed the cognizance order and action taken by the ACB against him for alleged corruption charges.

The ACB had arrested an engineer with Rs 15 lakh cash and some files outside the house of Aswal and implicated the officer with corruption charges.

The bench comprising Justice SP Sharma while accepting the petition filed by the officer quashed the trial court’s cognizance against him.

In the petition it was stated that neither the ACB made any recovery of money from Aswal nor any incriminating evidence to prove that he was demanding money.

The accused Purushottam Jeswani, an engineer who was arrested in the case with the files and Rs 15 lakh, had initially told that the money belonged to him and was taken into custody by ACB. He later claimed that he was supposed to give the money to Aswal.

The defence argued that there has been no evidence in the court to prove that the amount that Jeswani received from the contractors was to be given to Aswal and that is why he was not named in ACB's first charge-sheet. Aswal was made accused in the supplementary charge-sheet.

In response, the state government’s AAG Rajendra Yadav said Aswal was the CEO of the municipal corporation at that time. There is a possibility that the amount recovered from Jeswani was meant to be given to him.

Hearing both sides, the court quashed the cognizance order and action against Aswal.

On August 10, 2014, ACB arrested Jaipur Municipal Corporation's executive enginer with Rs 15 lakh and 46 files from outside the house of Aswal. Later, the ACB had filed a case against Jeswani and Aswal.

254,['8/02/2020'],SP student’s wing allege poor students are being deprived of fee reimbursement scheme,"This story is from February 8, 2020

Bareilly: Agitating workers of Samajwadi Chhatra Sabha (SCS), student wing of the Samajwadi Party (SP), reached Vikas Bhavan on Thursday along with some college students, and raised slogans against the Yogi Adityanath government, alleging the latter had barred large numbers of poor students from availing benefits under its fee reimbursement scheme. They said the government’s move would force poor students to drop out.

The agitating workers wanted to meet chief development officer (CDO) Chandra Mohan Garg, but Vikas Bhavan staff stopped them at the stairs. Later, the CDO emerged to meet them, when they submitted with him a memorandum.

Former SCS office bearer Hirdesh Yadav said by stopping scholarship for poor students and barring them from availing the fee reimbursement scheme, the BJP government was unjustly forcing them out of college. “This move will force hundreds of poor students to drop out. If the government doesn’t roll back the decision, we’ll intensify our agitation,” said Haider Ali, a SP worker.

Contradicting the SCS claim, district social welfare officer Ashok Dixit said there was no change in fee reimbursement scheme norms for poor students, whether they hail from general, OBC or minority groups.

“We’ve only introduced a provision for SC/ST students, under which, only those who are enrolled in professional courses via counselling would be able to avail fee reimbursement, while those who get direct admission under management quota won’t be covered. The decision was taken after the government received complaints from across the state that higher educational institutes running professional courses have been claiming fee reimbursement from the government, by showing fake admission records of SC/ST students under management quota,” Dixit added.

Notably, students from general, OBC and minority class enrolled under management quota are already barred from availing the scheme. There is also a cap of Rs 50,000 for students of these categories, while SC/ST students get full fee reimbursement.

255,['8/02/2020'],Ex-Turkish commando held with drugs worth Rs 71 lakh in Goa,"This story is from February 8, 2020

Murat Tas

PANAJI: Goa police arrested 47-year-old former Turkish Army commando Murat Tas with 710g MDMA worth over Rs 71 lakh on Friday. The former commando used to sell drugs to foreign tourists in the state and use the money to fund his lifestyle, police said.

After anti-narcotic cell (ANC) received a tip-off that Tas would approach foreigners to sell drugs, they formed a team and started monitoring his movement.

He was apprehended after the banned substance was found concealed in his rented room at Khalchawada at Arambol, ANC superintendent of police Shobit Saxena told TOI.

After it was confirmed that Tas was involved in the drug trade, police arrested him. He had come came to Goa first in September 2018. Police said this was his second visit and he has been in Goa since November 2019.

Saxena said that during interrogation, Tas told police that he started peddling drugs internationally after he completed the two-year compulsory commando training with the Turkish Army.

“This was his second trip to India, and he stayed in Goa both times and enjoyed a lavish lifestyle. He used to sell drugs to maintain his extravagant lifestyle. He has only studied till high school,” Saxena said.

Saxena said he used to get the narcotic substance from Turkey in a small box or in a bottle so that he could escape airport checks. He said Tas used to visit places frequented by foreigners. He would get friendly with tourists before offering them drugs.

“The accused doesn’t deal with Indian nationals,” Saxena said.

The former commando has also travelled to Bahrain, Russia, Georgia, Sri Lanka, Germany and many other parts of the world, police said.

Police have filed a FIR under sections of NDPS Act against the accused.

He said that they have recovered a photo of his from the 1990s wherein he was dressed in army fatigue.

PATNA: Though liquor is prohibited in the state, his refusal to provide a plastic glass for boozing cost a 55-year-old man his life in Begusarai district on Thursday night.

The incident took place at Suja village under Mufassil police station when one Manoj Sah, along with his accomplices, thrashed grocery shopowner Ram Ratan Singh with sticks and blunt objects for refusing to give them a glass for consuming liquor.

The injured was rushed to a nearby primary health centre from where he was referred to Sadar hospital where he succumbed to his injuries early Friday morning. Singh’s relatives alleged that Manoj, who runs a tea stall at the village, had demanded a glass for boozing at his shop.

Eyewitnesses said Sah’s accomplices also opened fire in the air to terrorise the local residents, who couldn’t muster courage to chase them. Sah also escaped apprehending retaliation from the victim’s family.

Mufassil police station SHO Raj Bindu Prasad said Sah assaulted Singh following a brawl, but he refused to disclose the reason behind the incident. “Both the deceased and the accused are neighbours and the two had an altercation on Thursday evening, which led to the killing of Singh,” he told this newspaper over phone.

The SHO said raids were on to nab the accused. Singh’s body was handed over to the family after postmortem.

The police said the deceased was physically disabled and used to earn livelihood for the family by running the grocery shop.

Barely a few hours before the fatal attack on Singh, a police team seized 14 cartons of India made foreign liquor (IMFL) from an SUV near Rustama village in Begusarai district. “Liquor is easily available on demand in the district but at a high rate,” a trader of Teghra subdivisional town claimed.

The sale, consumption and manufacture of liquor are banned in the state under Bihar Excise and Prohibition Act 2016. Even all the SHOs had given in writing to the state police headquarters that the provisions of liquor ban were being strictly implemented under their jurisdiction.

Ahmedabad: Passengers travelling by IndiGo Airlines flight 6E-125 from Ahmedabad to Kolkata had some nervous moments as the aircraft was forced to return to the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International (SVPI) airport after developing a mid-air technical problem a few minutes after taking off at 6.40am on Friday.

According to senior government officials, the aircraft was an Airbus A320neo. “One of the engines developed an increased level of vibrations mid-air. The pilot thus turned the aircraft back to Ahmedabad,” the officials stated.

In a relief to IndiGo, directorate general of civil aviation (DGCA) on January 13 decided to extend the deadline for the budget carrier to replace all 135 unmodified PW engines on A320neo aircraft from January 31 to May 31. Stating that “desperate measures” were required to “put things in order”, the DGCA had on November 1 told IndiGo to replace the PW engines in 97 A320neo aircraft “at all costs” by January 31, or they would be grounded.

The airline issued a statement saying, “This morning, an IndiGo aircraft operating Ahmedabad to Kolkata returned to Ahmedabad. During the flight, the pilot momentarily observed a caution message and followed the standard operating procedure. As a precautionary measure, the pilot landed back at Ahmedabad airport. The aircraft was back in operation after inspection.”

Narendra Modi (left), Congress leader Rahul Gandhi (centre) and Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal. (Photo:... Read More

NEW DELHI: Which party has to play catch-up in these assembly polls and just how much of a mountain does it have to climb to reach the top? The answer to that question depends on what we take as the reference point. If it’s the last assembly polls, it is BJP that has to do a lot to overhaul AAP, if it’s the 2017 civic polls or the 2019 Lok Sabha election, the roles are reversed.

In 2015, AAP’s near-total sweep came on the back of a 54.6% vote share, which comfortably eclipsed BJP’s 32.8% and, of course, the 9.7% that Congress won. If we take this as the starting point, therefore, the minimum swing needed for BJP to catch up with AAP is 10.9 percentage points. In other words, if 10.9% of voters were to shift from AAP to BJP, both parties will end up with vote shares of 43.7% (54.6 minus 10.9 and 32.8 plus 10.9). Of course, if there is a swing away from AAP, but only a part of it goes to BJP and the rest to Congress or others, the asking rate for the saffron party will become even higher.

Delhi assembly elections 2020 live updates

Complete Coverage on Delhi Elections

If, on the other hand, we take the 2017 civic polls as our starting point, BJP’s 36.1% was well ahead of AAP’s 26.2% and Congress’ 21.1%. To close the gap, AAP will need to wean away 5% of all voters from BJP to itself. That is, its asking rate is about half as tough as what BJP needs to do vis-à-vis the last assembly polls. Again, this is assuming a neat swing from BJP to AAP.

The gap between BJP and its rivals in 2019 was even larger than AAP’s lead in 2015. The saffron party got 56.9% of the votes, Congress was second with 22.6% and AAP third with 18.2%. Since by all accounts, Congress is not really in the race to win in Delhi this time round, let’s look at what it will take for AAP to close this gap. That works out to a swing of 19.4 percentage points from BJP to AAP, which will leave them almost level at about 37.5%-37.6%.

None of these swings — barring the one needed from 2017 — looks like an easy task to achieve. But the good news for both sides is that they have already done it in the past, between 2015 and 2017 in the case of BJP and between 2014 and 2015 for AAP.

The fact that Delhi’s electorate grows so rapidly could also help. Between 2015 and 2019, the electorate grew from 133.1 lakh to 143.3 lakh, an increase of 10.2 lakh in just four years. By the time of the current elections, that has already grown by another 3.7 lakh to reach 147 lakh. Some of this addition is young people becoming old enough to vote, but a lot of it is also adult migrants coming to the capital. Could they hold the keys to these swings?

HYDERABAD: Wondering why authorities are mum when even park spaces are being occupied, the Telangana high court on Friday directed the principal secretaries of municipal administration, and panchayat raj departments, along with HMDA commissioner, Sanga Reddy district collector and Madhavapuri Hills temple committee president to appear before the court on February 26.

The bench of Chief Justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A Abhishek Reddy was hearing a PIL filed by Thakur Rajkumar Singh of Human Rights and Consumer protection cell trust, challenging the inaction of the authorities in protecting a two-acre park land at Madhavapuri Hills colony in Ameenpur area of Sanga Reddy district.

Refusing to agree with the temple committee, which said that they occupied the park land for a good cause like building a temple, and that they have no objection even if the temple is taken over by the endowments department, the bench said that an encroachment is still an encroachment and an illegal construction needs to be razed regardless of the intentions of its builders.

“There are three crore Gods in India, if encroachments are allowed in the name of God, then there would be no space left for any other public purposes,” the bench said. The Supreme Court had made it clear that no constructions should be allowed in spaces meant for raising parks, the bench said brushing aside the temple committee’s arguments on two GOs issued by the state in 2018.

Since the temple was built in park land, it needs to be demolished, the bench said. Otherwise, we will direct the temple committee to pay Rs 5 crore as costs, the bench said.

This is Lord Venkateswara temple, and when the temple committee contended that the deity too has rights that are required to be defended, the bench earlier directed the petitioner to make the deity a party to the case. The petitioner accordingly filed an affidavit making Lord Balaji as respondent to the case.

AHMEDABAD: AMC which aimed to raise more than Rs 700 crore through the e-auctioning of five plots in the city, managed to raise just Rs 306 crore, as two plots on offer had no takers.

On Friday, the civic body auctioned off two plots, one on Sola Road and another in Nikol.

The Sola Road plot was sold to Avenue Supermarkets, of Thane, which operates the D-Mart brand. It bid Rs 64.69 crore or Rs 1.08 lakh per sq m, against the base price of Rs 51.37 crore or Rs 86,000 per sq m. The plot in Nikol was auctioned to A V Builders for Rs 28.23 crore or Rs 77,700 per sq m, against the base price of Rs 20.75 crore or Rs 57,120 per sq m.

Two plots went unsold at e-auctions on Friday. A 13,222 sq m plot off the posh Sindhu Bhavan Road, — where commercial plots have sold for prices between Rs 1.7 lakh and Rs 2.5 lakh per sq m last year — did not get any bids.

Bidders were online, but remained inactive as the AMC set a base price of Rs 1.59 lakh per sq. m. A 15,351 sq m plot on Science City Road offered at a base price of Rs 1.59 lakh per sq m also did not find takers.

On Thursday, a plot in Bodakdev was auctioned for Rs 213 crore.

261,['8/02/2020'],No road closure in Metro’s revised Heritage Walk plan,"This story is from February 8, 2020

Nagpur: The Heritage Committee has cleared revised plan of MahaMetro ’s Heritage Walk project around Zero Mile in which an internal road of Civil Lines known as Lala Lajpat Rai Marg will not be closed for traffic.

Earlier, the Metro agency had submitted a plan in which the road was to be closed and part of Heritage Walk project was to be built over it. The plan was rejected by the committee on December 13 last as traffic police had advised against closing the road.

MahaMetro then prepared a revised design knocking off some features. Earlier, it had planned a fair sized open air amphitheatre. Now, it has been dropped. A museum of Survey of India was also planned, but it has also been scrapped. According to Metro officials only landscaping and plantation will be done around Zero Mile now.

The official said that the earlier design included sculptures of eight to ten freedom fighters. “Now, we will have to see whether any space is left for installing them,” he added.

As per the revised plan, the premises will have Zero Milestone, tree courts, stepped landscaping, mound garden, drop off plaza, tree bosque and tree avenue plantation.

In the last meeting of Heritage Committee, it had come to light that MahaMetro officials had not taken permission from Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and traffic police before preparing the design.

A Metro official expressed disappointment over rejection of the earlier proposal. “Nagpur has very few hangout spots. We were planning to create one where people of all age groups could have enjoyed themselves. Children would have gained knowledge about working of Survey of India. People would spend time in the amphitheatre. However, we will abide by the committee decision,” he said.

There were several plans to beautify Zero Mile, but nothing was done. Finally, Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari had to step in for the job.

262,['8/02/2020'],Reverse swing: What it will take for each party to win in Delhi elections,"Narendra Modi (left), Congress leader Rahul Gandhi (centre) and Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal. (Photo:... Read More

NEW DELHI: Which party has to play catch-up in these assembly polls and just how much of a mountain does it have to climb to reach the top? The answer to that question depends on what we take as the reference point. If it’s the last assembly polls, it is BJP that has to do a lot to overhaul AAP, if it’s the 2017 civic polls or the 2019 Lok Sabha election, the roles are reversed.In 2015, AAP’s near-total sweep came on the back of a 54.6% vote share, which comfortably eclipsed BJP’s 32.8% and, of course, the 9.7% that Congress won. If we take this as the starting point, therefore, the minimum swing needed for BJP to catch up with AAP is 10.9 percentage points. In other words, if 10.9% of voters were to shift from AAP to BJP, both parties will end up with vote shares of 43.7% (54.6 minus 10.9 and 32.8 plus 10.9). Of course, if there is a swing away from AAP, but only a part of it goes to BJP and the rest to Congress or others, the asking rate for the saffron party will become even higher.If, on the other hand, we take the 2017 civic polls as our starting point, BJP’s 36.1% was well ahead of AAP’s 26.2% and Congress’ 21.1%. To close the gap, AAP will need to wean away 5% of all voters from BJP to itself. That is, its asking rate is about half as tough as what BJP needs to do vis-à-vis the last assembly polls. Again, this is assuming a neat swing from BJP to AAP.The gap between BJP and its rivals in 2019 was even larger than AAP’s lead in 2015. The saffron party got 56.9% of the votes, Congress was second with 22.6% and AAP third with 18.2%. Since by all accounts, Congress is not really in the race to win in Delhi this time round, let’s look at what it will take for AAP to close this gap. That works out to a swing of 19.4 percentage points from BJP to AAP, which will leave them almost level at about 37.5%-37.6%.None of these swings — barring the one needed from 2017 — looks like an easy task to achieve. But the good news for both sides is that they have already done it in the past, between 2015 and 2017 in the case of BJP and between 2014 and 2015 for AAP.The fact that Delhi’s electorate grows so rapidly could also help. Between 2015 and 2019, the electorate grew from 133.1 lakh to 143.3 lakh, an increase of 10.2 lakh in just four years. By the time of the current elections, that has already grown by another 3.7 lakh to reach 147 lakh. Some of this addition is young people becoming old enough to vote, but a lot of it is also adult migrants coming to the capital. Could they hold the keys to these swings?",elections,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74020336,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-199169,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/delhi/reverse-swing-what-it-will-take-for-each-party-to-win/articleshow/74016645.cms

HYDERABAD: Three days after the murder of fish vendor P Ramesh in Jawahar Nagar came to light, the police arrested a food delivery boy, Raju Naik alias Srinivas, on Friday. Srinivas, who has two wives, said that he committed the offence to extort money , since he was finding it difficult to maintain both the families.

Joint commissioner of police (West Zone), AR Srinivas, said the accused, who was earlier a tenant in the victim’s residence at AG Colony, used to consume liquor with Ramesh. The accused realised Ramesh earned a lot of money by selling fish. As he was unable to manage his families with the Rs 15,000 he earned per month, Srinivas then planned to kidnap Ramesh and extort money. He lured the victim to his room, which he had taken on rent in Jawahar Nagar, a month ago, for a drink. The victim was offered a drink laced with sleeping pills.

264,['8/02/2020'],"Submit information on removal of electric poles from 89 roads: HC to NMC, MSEDCL","This story is from February 8, 2020

Nagpur: Expressing anguish over miserable failure of civic and power entities for removal of deadly electric poles from the roads, the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court on Friday sternly directed both respondents to submit information on the status of work done on 89 roads after widening.

A division bench comprising justices Atul Chandurkar and VG Joshi further directed both entities to submit a concrete plan within two weeks on when the removal work would be completed.

The directives came while hearing a suo motu PIL (No 98/2018) based on TOI’s reports on electric poles standing right in the middle of roads due to expansion. Shreerang Bhandarkar has been appointed as amicus curiae.

Earlier, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s ( NMC ) additional commissioner Ram Joshi sought an unconditional apology for not completing the poles’ removal work within the stipulated period as asked by the HC.

Citing inordinate delay due to heavy rains and other factors, he requested the court to extend the deadline by four months.

“Once it rains, the work can’t recommence for the next two to three days as the work involved is very hazardous and complicated. Citizens too opposed the shifting, contending that the new site is in the vicinity of their homes. Many of them also rush to the MSEDCL for restoring power supply in their area as soon as it was snapped for shifting,” he said.

In the last hearing, the HC had directed the respondents to conduct a survey on 89 out of 113 such roads, which are widened and prepare estimates. In the survey, it was found that as many as 2,704 electric poles along with 368 DP/TP/FP structures and 100 transformers are in the middle of roads, thus obstructing traffic. “Of these, MSEDCL has undertaken shifting work on seven roads. One road each is within the National Highway Authority of India’s (NHAI) and PWD’s jurisdiction and 15 under the PWD,” Joshi said.

The NMC further informed that out of 19 old roads under the Integrated Road Development Project (IRDP), shifting has been completed on two. Out of remaining 17, the revised estimate of three roads is required to be done by MSEDCL, while work on 14 roads is on the verge of completion.

“For installing of poles at a new place and dismantling them from old places requires regular electric outages of minimum six to eight hours per day. However, the outage given is for a very short duration and that too, on a few occasions. It leads to slowing down of the shifting work. On several occasions, MSEDCL has given outage on a particular day for shifting of electric poles but at the last moment the outage was withdrawn for various reasons,” Joshi said.

Rapid Action Team deployed around the Charminar on Friday

HYDERABAD: A series of anti-CAA events, including dharnas, awareness drives and door-to-door campaigning have been planned across the state by various Dalit and Muslim organisations from between February 10 and March 10.

A ‘Chalo Hyderabad’ protest will be held on March 14, where SC, ST and Muslim organisations will participate.

The organisers on Friday said they will launch a one month door-to-door awareness campaign about CAA , NPR and NRC .

Addressing a press conference organised by Jamiatul Ulema-e-Hind in collaboration with various SC, ST and BC groups, the organisers said that peaceful protests against CAA, NPR will be held.

A state-level Dalit Muslim Intellectual Conference will also be held on February 22. On March 1, a Chalo Kakinada programme will be organised, which will include an even called Dalit Garajana. The organsiers said that on March 6 and 7, they will hold a Tribal conference, organised by Girijans.

At the Chalo Hyderabad protest, special arrangements will be made to conduct the programme peacefully. “All these programmes will be held after proper consultation with the police commissioner so as to ensure peace, and without disturbing the traffic in the city,” the groups said.

Criticising the CAA and NRC, the groups said: “More than Muslims, backward classes including the tribal community and Dalits are at loss with their implementation, as majority of the population from these communities is illiterate and has no proper documentation to prove their citizenship.”

They said, “It is a conspiracy by BJP and RSS to alter the Constitution made by Dr BR Ambedkar. We pledge to protect the Constitution in its entirety. BJP and RSS are trying to bring back the distasteful concept of untouchability. Indians must unite to protect the Constitution.”

AHMEDABAD: After dealing with thousands of vacant engineering seats over several years, the state government has decided to reduce the number of seats in technical courses from 2020, said sources. About 1 lakh seats had remained empty in degree and diploma engineering courses in 2019.

According to estimates, 2,000 seats in degree engineering and 5,000 seats in diploma engineering courses could be slashed. Colleges are being marked for seat cuts, sources said. “A government-appointed committee has recommended career-oriented short-term courses for both government and self-financed institutions,” said an education department official.

Sources, however, also said that the aim could be to improve the student-teacher ratio for National Board of Accreditation (NBA) affiliation.

PANAJI: The excise duty revision announced by chief minister Pramod Sawant will see a new fee structure where the area of the bar, restaurant, supermarket or store will determine the licence amount. For wholesale dealers of liquor the permit fee has been tweaked based on the annual turnover.The move is to make the licencing system equitable and simultaneously bring in more revenue for the state, excise department officials said.“Presently, a small dealer in the village and a big store that gets more business are paying the same licence fee. The idea is to make the tax system just. That is why the fee for bar licence will now be based on the size of the store,” an official said.For bar and restaurants, while the earlier fee structure for urban, rural and coastal areas have been retained, the government has now said that the licence rate will go up for every 10sqm of additional area. So while the base licence fee for 50sqm AC pub in the coastal area will remain at Rs 11,000, for every additional 10sqm, the owner will have to pay Rs 1,600.Wholesale liquor dealers with a turnover of over Rs 50 crore will find themselves shelling out a lot more in licence fees as the dues have been hiked by 166%, from Rs 75,000 to Rs 2 lakh.Sawant’s budget proposals had all the alcohol companies reaching for the calculator to understand the impact on Goa’s lucrative liquor industry.“Companies have two choices, either absorb the cost of the excise hike or pass it on to the customer and watch the market die out. At a minimum, we are looking at a 25% drop in consumption,” a senior management official for an international liquor brand said.The state’s alcohol market is roughly estimated around Rs 3,500 crore while the excise collections for the state hover just over Rs 500 crore per year. “Instead of increasing all the taxes, the government should have raised the duties on cheaper brands to discourage low-end tourists. Right now we are discouraging the premium category of tourists who don’t come to Goa only to drink, but who also contribute to the economy,” a tourism industry stakeholder said.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74019199,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-594692,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/excise-licence-fees-to-be-based-on-size-of-store-restaurant/articleshow/74016658.cms
268,['8/02/2020'],Delhi high court stays govt’s move to increase auto fares,"This story is from February 8, 2020

File photo used for representational purpose

NEW DELHI: Delhi high court on Friday stayed AAP government’s decision last year to hike autorickshaw fares . The court acted on a plea filed by an NGO, Aiding Hands Foundation, which had challenged the increase in fares on the ground that the notification revising auto fares was issued without the approval of the competent authority — the lieutenant governor — and that it would severely impact people. A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice C Hari Shankar granted an interim stay noting that “We hereby stay the operation of the June 12 notification issued by Delhi government till May 21.”

The bench said it was of the opinion that the petitioner had a prima facie case in its favour and the transport department of Delhi government could not issue the notification as LG was the competent authority.

“We are not concerned about the dispute between you two (Delhi government and LG). But if you cannot do anything, it means you cannot do (it),” the court remarked after hearing advocate D P Singh, appearing for the NGO, where he argued that Delhi government did not have the power to issue such a notification. The central government also supported the petition and maintained that the notification could not be issued by Delhi government and it had to be set aside.

However, AAP government opposed the petition, arguing that auto fares was a topic that came under the transport department and by extension within the remit of the elected government, which had the power to issue the notification to revise the rates. The court, on July 8, last year had issued notice to Centre, Delhi government, its transport department and fare revision commission on the PIL. The petition challenged the notification saying the authorities arbitrarily revised the auto fares in Delhi, adversely impacting the residents who were otherwise victimised by the unruly behaviour of auto drivers.

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar informed Rajya Sabha on Friday that there are 80 Indian students remaining in Wuhan in China. Of them, 10 students who came to the airport were not allowed to board the special Air India flight by the Chinese authorities as they were running fever.

The remaining 70 have voluntarily stayed back but the Indian embassy in China is in touch with them and the Indian community in other parts of China. When members of the House asked if Pakistan had sought Indian help in evacuating its citizens from China, Jaishankar said: “Regarding Pakistan, at the time when our two flights were going, we had told all the students and the larger community in Wuhan that we were prepared not only to bring back our own people but all people in our neighbourhood who would like to come back.”

“This was an offer which was made to all our neighbours... seven students of Maldives chose the offer. But I would like members to know that offer was made to everybody,” Jaishankar said.

In view of the continuing lock down of the Hubei Province in China, the Indian government decided to evacuate the Indian students and other professionals working in Wuhan and neighbouring cities in the province. The House lauded the role of Air India, its crew, team of doctors, para medical staff and the two Indian embassy officials who coordinated and executed the challenging operation.

272,['8/02/2020'],"Wanted criminal with 10 cases of murder and ransom against him in Delhi, Haryana arrested in Doon","This story is from February 8, 2020

Dehradun: Anil Pehelwan alias Leela, one of the most wanted criminals of Delhi and Haryana carrying a reward of Rs 1 lakh on his head, was arrested by Dehradun police late on Thursday. He had jumped parole in October 2018 and had been elusive since then as he was believed to be staying at different locations to evade arrest.

Police officials said that on a tip-off, a team was formed led by SP Dehradun (rural) Parmendra Dobhal, which tracked his location for several weeks before arresting him. A .32 bore pistol was also seized from his possession. Leela had 10 criminal cases – including those of murder of a police inspector in Rohtak city besides kidnapping and extortion — against him in Delhi and Haryana.

Leela was lodged in Tihar Jail in 2014 and during his stay there, policemen noticed in CCTV footages that a woman would come to visit him often. They suspected the woman to be his wife and traced her location to Dehradun.

Further investigation took police to Doon Vihar locality and the cops zeroed in on a house in the area where they believed Leela could be hidden.

Dehradun senior superintendent of police (SSP) Arun Kumar Joshi said, “A police team worked as LPG cylinder delivery boys and even sold vegetables in the area to find out his whereabouts.”

After the house number — where Leela could be holed in — was confirmed, police prepared a blue print of all routes leading to the house. “There was a possibility that Leela’s accomplices may open fire at our team if he was arrested, therefore we decided to carry out the proceedings very quickly. Wearing bullet-proof jackets, our team members apprehended Leela’s car outside the house and arrested him,” Joshi said.

A resident of Bahadurgarh in Haryana district, Leela was a state-level weightlifter. After completing his studies from a Delhi college, he along with his cousin Babloo opened a gym. Inspired by Babloo, who murdered his wife’s boyfriend, Leela performed his first crime and looted a car.

His crime career then took off and of the 10 cases against him, seven were registered in Haryana and remaining in Delhi.

In 2011, he and his aides had kidnapped a boy and demanded Rs 1 crore for his release. In the same year, he kidnapped a lecturer in Bahadurgarh and took a ransom of Rs 20 lakh for his release.

The same year, inspector Ramkishan Dahiya shot a relative of Leela’s accomplice in an encounter and to avenge the death, Leela murdered the cop two years later in Rohtak.

In 2012, he was also accused of a murder in his native Noona Majra village.

In 2014, Delhi crime branch arrested him and he was sent to jail till 2017. After coming out on parole, he threatened a disco club owner in Bahadurgarh and demanded an extortion of Rs 50 lakh. Following which, he was again arrested but he came out on parole in 2018 and was missing since then.

274,['8/02/2020'],"Gujarat: Despite gas switch, Morbi 81st on NGT list of most polluted clusters","This story is from February 8, 2020

The industrial cluster of Morbi has been ranked 81st on the list of 100 most polluted clusters

AHMEDABAD: How the Morbi-Wankaner ceramics cluster created a gas-based economy may have become part of business folklore, but a recent National Green Tribunal (NGT) order shows that industrial pollution is still a major concern here.

The industrial cluster of Morbi has been ranked 81st on the list of 100 most polluted clusters where the NGT has sought an action plan from state pollution control boards.

Following an NGT order in March 2019, for an immediate shutdown of all industries run of polluting coal gasifiers at Morbi, units began switching to gas. As a result, it became the country’s largest hub in terms of gas consumption, with consumption doubling from 2.25 million metric standard cubic metres per day (mmscmd) in a month after the NGT order.

In November, the NGT named Morbi as one of the most polluting industrial clusters in the country in its order. The reason, it said was that many units continue to use coal gasifiers despite a complete ban on them.

“Even though this area is polluted but not ‘critically polluted’, the same may not be covered by the said order, but the fact remains that there is high amount of pollution as shown by the latest report of GPCB,” it said.

The tribunal directed the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), which has compiled data of industrial clusters that are deemed polluting, to prepare a tabulated analysis of all reports submitted by state pollution control boards on their action plans by February 15.

“GPCB must initiate immediate steps for prosecution of industrial units that have operated in violation of the law and recover compensation for causing damage to the environment and public health. This amount may be assessed by a committee with representatives of CPCB, GPCB and National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI). The CPCB will be the nodal agency for coordination and compliance. The committee may suggest a restoration plan,” according to the order.

Morbi has more than 850 operational tiles units, which uses raw material from Rajasthan.

“The raw material, which is shaped like small stones, needs to be processed using steam. This is mixed with chemicals and converted to a fine powder. To generate steam, large quantities of coal are being used, which cause air pollution,” said an industry expert aware of the matter.

The fact remains that there is high amount of pollution in Morbi-Wankaner, the NGT said in its order adding that PM10 values were 552.66 and PM2.5 was 289.61. “Stringent measures are thus required in the interest of protection of environment and public health,” it said.

PUNE: The Pune Municipal Corporation has collected Rs 1.5 crore in fines from over 53,000 citizens for spitting, throwing garbage and flouting the plastic ban .

The action was taken as a part of the Swachh Bharat Mission survey during the past one year.

The civic administration’s data showed that while around 49,000 people were fined for littering the city, penalties wered levied on 4,000 traders for flouting the norms of plastic ban. Rs1.15 crore was recovered from citizens and Rs35 lakh collected from traders.

Apart from collecting the fines, those found spitting were also made to clean the road. The action was taken by the solid waste management department along with the respective ward offices.

The sanitation inspectors and health department officials also carried out anti-spitting drives to create awareness about the ill effects of spitting and the health problems it can cause.

Action was taken at public places like gardens, municipal buildings, government offices and civic hospitals, civic officials said.

A fine of Rs180 was imposed for each offence. Repeat offenders were fined more, civic officials said.

“The Pune Municipal Corporation had carried out action against erring citizens. Action was also taken against traders for using plastic carrybags,” said Dnyaneshwar Molak, head of the PMC’s solid waste management department.

According to Molak, the Pune Municipal Corporation administration would intensify the drive in the coming days. Public participation is a must to ensure that cleanliness is maintained, Molak stressed.

The implementation of the statewide plastic ban commenced on June 23, 2018. The plastic carry bags which were widely available across the city are replaced by cloth and paper bags at many locations, but other plastic items continue to be used in the city at a larger scale.

AHMEDABAD: Delayed shipments from China and a spike in raw material prices are threatening the dyes and dyestuff industry in Gujarat. Disruption in raw material supply from China could lead to 25% of dyestuff making units in the state closing, industry players fear. Gujarat is home to more than 600 dyestuff manufacturing units.Local dyestuff units are heavily dependant on imports of several raw materials, including chemicals and intermediates, from China and supply has been hit due to shipments being stuck owing to the coronavirus scare “Shipments from China have not arrived and the same chemicals available from Indian players are exorbitantly priced.If this situation continues much longer, 25% of dyestuff manufacturing units here will be forced to shut down,” said Yogesh Parikh, president, GDMA.Over the past fortnight, the prices of several chemicals used as raw material in the manufacture of dyes have nearly doubled, according to GDMA estimates. For example, the price of H-Acid has gone from Rs 350 per kg to Rs 550 per kg. For certain other chemicals, prices have nearly doubled.“Prices of several raw materials that come from China including J-Acid and Tobias acid, have increased by 35%. At the same time, their prices in the Indian market have risen by 15%,” said Bhupendra Patel, chairman, Chemical Export Promotion Council (Chemexil), Gujarat region.“The Chinese government extended its New Year vacation to February 10. However, even if business resumes, there are concerns that factories may not be given permission to continue manufacturing.

Jaipur: The body of an 8-year-old boy, who had gone missing over a month ago, was found in a drain in Sikar close to the railway station on Thursday.

The boy identified as Ganesh Kumar was reported missing on January 6 but cops failed to find him. The boy’s father Banja Ram had moved to Sikar to work as a labourer around a year back and lived close to the station. A month ago, he registered a missing person report at Kotwali police station in Sikar city. The boy’s body was found when a 8-feet deep drain was being cleaned ahead of a senior railway official’s visit on Friday.

“The father had reported his son missing and we had searched the entire area but could not find him. The drain was not covered and it appears that the child fell into it accidentally and died. We had searched around the drain, too, but could not spot the boy as it was quite deep,” said an official of Kotwali police station. Banja Ram claimed that the cops did not put enough effort to find his son. “Till the time a senior official was not visiting, the drain would not have been cleaned and we would still be looking for our child. The authorities should have covered the drain but they failed to do because of which Ganesh fell into it. It shakes me to the core to imagine how painfully my son died and its all because the concerned authorities were careless.”

The body was kept in the mortuary on Thursday night and handed over to the family after autopsy. The likely cause of death was due to suffocation.

279,['8/02/2020'],ASP told to probe case into violence in local poll,"This story is from February 8, 2020

Madurai: The Madras high court has directed the Virudhunagar assistant superintendent of police (ASP) to investigate the case which was registered following violence during indirect of Watrap panchayat union, while hearing a plea moved by a DMK candidate seeking CBI or CB-CID inquiry into the case.

S Kannan, a resident of Virudhunagar district, in his petition stated that he was fielded as a candidate for the post of chairman of Watrap union in the district. When the indirect election was conducted on January 11, he had secured seven votes and the other candidate belonging to the ruling AIADMK secured six votes.

Since he secured more votes, the members of the ruling party created a ruckus during the election. He stated that with the help of the Srivilliputhur DSP Rajendran, the ruling party members entered the premises and caused damaged to the properties. Though they attempted to tear the ballot papers, the returning officer had taken them in his custody safely. Following this incident, the election was stopped.

Kannan said that though the police officials knew the identity of the people who were involved in violence during the election, a case was registered against unknown people. The DSP was primarily responsible for the election to be stopped due to which action should be initiated against him.

Hence, the petitioner moved the high court Madurai bench seeking CBI or CB-CID inquiry into the case. When the case was heard on Thursday, justice A D Jagadish Chandira gave the direction to the Virudhunagar ASP who is an IPS officer to investigate the case with video footage and other available materials and disposed of the petition.

280,['8/02/2020'],Daily wagers held in Rs100 cr fake GST bills case; probe on to reach mastermind,"This story is from February 8, 2020

Nagpur: Three daily wagers have landed in the taxman’s net in an intricate GST evasion racket allegedly involving fake transactions of over Rs100 crore.

The names of the three were used to run allegedly dummy firms, created solely for the purpose of tax evasion. An operation by the Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGSTI), against a steel trading firm, has led to the arrest of two workers and a driver engaged in this concern. The mastermind, who is still at large, is also being tracked down, said sources. The arrests are part of a larger operation against the firm, in which tax evasion trails run to Punjab and Haryana.

The arrested trio has been identified as Ramprasad Borkar, Mohammed Sheikh and Nehar Bopche. Their income and living standard do not match the transactions undertaken in their names, said sources, but entire deals happened in their names. Bound by the law, the three — whose names and signatures were used in the transactions — had to be arrested. The law calls for arresting the person in-charge of a business where an alleged tax fraud or evasion is found. This was the three labourers in this case, since they were at the helm on paper, said a source.

Further investigations revealed that the papers, including Aadhaar cards of the three, were collected by the alleged mastermind in the name of getting Know Your Customer (KYC) formalities done. Instead, documents related to three firms were prepared using their identification papers, said a source. The three are expected to file police a complaint against the alleged mastermind for misuse of their documents.

The firms created using their names are Baba Enterprises, Bhawani Enterprises and Karan Steel. One of the firms did not exist at the given address, and addresses of the other two turned out to be low-end residences.

It is learnt that the firms were used to generate fake invoices for both purchase and sale of goods, which ultimately led to availing of input tax credit, even by firms located as far away as Punjab and Haryana, said sources.

According to preliminary investigations, fake invoices worth Rs108 crore were unearthed by the sleuths leading to input tax credit of Rs9.75 crore.

The DGGSTI has come across a number of fake invoice cases for availing ITC, leading to arrests. ITC is a reduction available from the final liability in proportion to the tax paid at the time of purchase of inputs for making the end-product. ITC can be used to clear the overall tax liability too.

File photo of Kapil Baisla

NEW DELHI: Two days after being served a notice by the Special Investigation Team (SIT), the brother of Shaheen Bagh shooter , Kapil Baisla , joined the probe on Friday. Sachin Baisla was questioned regarding Kapil’s associations and asked to hand over the mobile handset that Kapil regularly used.

The handset from which the cops had found the photographs of Kapil and his father purportedly joining Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) had only a handful of numbers saved in it. Most of them belonged to Kapil’s friends.

Kapil was taken into two-day police custody on Thursday. During this period, the cops scanned through his bank accounts to establish whether a large sum of money was transferred into his account. Sachin too was questioned regarding this. Sources said that Kapil’s all claims are being cross-verified since he has been changing his statements.

While scanning through Kapil’s phone, police have also come across some coded words, which were used during the chats in some WhatsApp groups. Sachin too was a member of some of the groups. He is being questioned to get further clarity in this regard.

Sources said that when Sachin was questioned about his affiliation with AAP or any other political party, he did not give a clear reply. “He has been changing his versions every now and then,” said a police officer. “Sachin first claimed that he was unaware of Kapil’s plan as the latter had left home unannounced on February 1. But he retracted his statement when confronted by the cops. Police are now waiting for Kapil’s father, Gaje Singh, to join the probe,” the officer added.

Meanwhile, source of the weapon used by Kapil still remains shrouded in mystery. Kapil initially claimed that he had the weapon since seven years, but failed to identify the arms dealer. He has even been changing his statements regarding the identity of the dealer.

282,['8/02/2020'],‘Form panel on deaths caused by faulty medical equipment’,"This story is from February 8, 2020

Villupuram: Villupuram MP D Ravikumar has urged the Union government to constitute a commission to collect data on the number of deaths of patients caused by malfunctioning medical equipment that were not calibrated by biomedical engineers and not certified as safe by them.

Speaking at the Zero Hour in Parliament on Thursday, Ravikumar said the commission must probe all the deaths of patients caused by the malfunctioning medical equipment in the hospitals.

He regretted that the Union government failed to implement the recommendation of the Niti Aayog to set up an exclusive agency to calibrate and test the medical equipment in the hospitals.

He said a survey by the Centre for calibration and testing medical equipment of the National hub for healthcare instrumentation development in Anna University declared that 35% of the 12,000 medical equipment including ventilators and dialysis units in 250 hospitals in Tamil Nadu have not been calibrated.

""The medical equipment that were not calibrated and tested by biomedical engineers and certified safe by them may give false results leading to inappropriate treatment resulting in the loss of several lives,"" Ravikumar pointed out.

He said the government has made calibration mandatory only 23 types of medical equipment and not for all medical equipment.

""It is high time the Centre takes a serious note on the recommendation of the Niti Aayog to set up an exclusive unit to calibrate and test the life-saving medical equipment in the hospitals. The Centre must also constitute a commission to collect data on the number of deaths caused by malfunctioning medical equipment,"" he said.

A survey by the centre revealed startling facts that only one of five ventilators on an average in hospitals across Tamil Nadu mostly private hospitals has been certified safe by biomedical engineers. The remaining live-saving equipment that were not calibrated often give inaccurate results of the tests performed using them resulting in the doctors and paramedical staff extending inappropriate treatment to the critically ill patients leading to their death or resulting in other major complications, said the survey.

The centre screened life-saving equipment such as defibrillators, dialysis machines and ventilators besides basic equipment like blood pressure machine and lights in operation theatres in hospitals in Chennai, Vellore, Trichy, Madurai, Coimbatore and Tirunelveli.

C Amruta

BENGALURU: C Amruta, the software engineer who was arrested in Port Blair days after she allegedly murdered her mother and attempted to kill her brother, was counselled for suicidal tendencies by a psychiatrist in police custody. Later, she was produced before a city court, which on Friday sent her to judicial custody.

Amruta and her boyfriend, Sridhar Rao, a Banaswadi resident, were arrested in the Andamans on Wednesday, two days after she allegedly committed the crime in her Ramamurthynagar residence.

“She banged her head against the wall inside the police station in Port Blair and showed suicidal behaviour at KR Puram police station too. So we took the help of a psychiatrist, Dr Bindu, and counselled the accused on Thursday,” an investigating officer said.

Police claimed Amruta had planned to commit suicide after returning from the Andamans. According to police, she told them she had loans of over Rs 15 lakh from a few banks and was unable to clear them. She used to receive messages and calls from the banks for repayment. “My mother was very sensitive, and I’m sure she would not bear the humiliation of anyone coming to our house for loan recovery. So I decided to kill her and my brother. I took Sridhar to the Andamans for my last trip before taking the extreme step,” she told police.

On Saturday night, Amruta went to sleep around 9.30pm, with the digging bar by her side. She woke up around 2.30am and bludgeoned her mother to death with it. She sat in front of her mother’s body for more than an hour before proceeding to attack her brother, who was asleep with earplugs, police said quoting her statement.

Though Amruta claimed Rao didn’t know of her crime till Bengaluru police knocked on their doors in Port Blair, police said they have evidence of him being aware. Preliminary probe also revealed Amruta’s mother questioned her whenever she got late or left home early. “Investigation is on to know whether she decided to kill her mother for this reason,” an officer said. Rao also has been sent to judicial custody.

BENGALURU: There is new hope for childless couples considering surrogacy. A select committee of Rajya Sabha looking into The Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill, 2019 has not only suggested the proposed legislation provide for ‘willing women’ (besides close relatives) to become surrogate mothers, but said they should also be compensated.The bill has been approved by Lok Sabha and is now before the Upper House.Fertility expert Dr Kamini Rao, who had made a presentation before the select committee on the issue, said, “There’s no doubt about the need for regulation. However, a ‘willing woman’ will not come for nothing. She will have to be compensated. Poor women coming forward for surrogacy may be illiterate, but they aren’t ignorant. It’s only by bringing in a realistic, practical legislation that surrogacy services can be carried forward in India.”Private infertility agencies in Bengaluru were in a dilemma as in its current form, the bill provides for only close relatives to become surrogate mothers to childless couples. Though the bill is still to become a law, its categorical assertion limiting surrogacy to close relatives and the proposal to ban commercial surrogacy had resulted in the service virtually coming to a halt.With the new recommendations, agencies are now saying childless couples can pursue surrogacy plans and women willing to become surrogate mothers can work towards renting out their wombs. The new proposal to compensate willing women for surrogacy now provides room for commercial considerations, they point out.Prakash Kulkarni of Varada Fertility Centre hoped the bill would soon become law and end all uncertainties related to the surrogacy sector. Pointing out that lack of clarity only leads to lack of transparency, he said: “Currently, there are four couples with us seeking surrogacy benefit to have a child of their own.”“Women in touch with us were aware of the developments. They weren’t coming forward to rent a womb. This scenario will continue till the government enacts the law and notifies rules legalising commercial surrogacy,” said Natesh MC, who runs Fertineeds Private Limited, coordinating surrogacy.Natesh said that in Bengaluru alone he has kept on hold requests from 10 couples for surrogacy.“We have put our plans on hold for over a year now as the bill first proposed to ban commercial surrogacy. An agency that we were in touch with suggested we wait as women weren’t coming forward to rent their wombs. Whether it’s commercial or compensated, until the government comes up with rules, crucial years of our life will get wasted,” said a Bengaluru techie-couple, who have now also registered for adoption.Sources in the fertility industry say there’s a lot of uncertainty in the surrogacy sector and things are being done surreptitiously. “It’s not true that there is no business at all, as there is no ban yet and the law, whenever it comes, won’t have retrospective effect,” sources said. Most agencies accept only women with proven fertility history for surrogacy, but young widows who have not given birth are among those landing surrogacy assignments amid all the uncertainty, they added.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74025021,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-194369,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/compensated-surrogacy-move-cheers-fertility-clinics/articleshow/74015987.cms

Nagpur: An old water pipeline in Uppalwadi belonging to OCW burst on Friday morning leading to problems for motorists. The Uppalwadi railway underbridge (RUB) became heavily waterlogged making it difficult for vehicles to cross it. OCW spokesperson said that there were no problems in water supply even though thousands of litres had gone waste.

A National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) contractor was working on the road below RUB but OCW officials are not sure whether he damaged the pipeline.

“A 900 millimetre diameter pipeline from Kanhan water treatment plant (WTP) lies below the road. A 200mm branch pipeline emerges from there. A score valve was fitted on this branch years ago by Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC). The plate above it and the valve itself had become corroded and we can’t say whether NHAI excavator hit the plate or not,” said the spokesperson.

However, NHAI contractor was asked to repair the valve by OCW, which he did. The leakage was plugged by evening.

The spokesperson said that as soon as OCW officials learnt about the damage they turned off the valve supplying the 900mm pipeline. “We had already supplied water to the command area in the morning and as the pipeline burst after 11am, we did not face any problem. There will be no problem on Saturday morning too,” he added.

BENGALURU: The recent increase in milk prices and impending hike in water and power tariffs have pushed up food prices in Bengaluru, with hoteliers deciding to revise their rate cards.

The Bruhat Bangalore Hotels Association resolved to increased food prices by up to 20%. Accordingly, food consumed in small and mid-segment hotels will be dearer in the range of Rs 2 to Rs 5 from Friday, while prices in fine-dining restaurants will go up by Rs 10.

Other than hike in milk and curd prices by Rs 2/litre, rates of refined oil, tur dal and LPG have gone up. The price of oil has increased from Rs 70.5 to Rs 105; tur dal is being sold at Rs 80/kg from Rs 50, association president PC Rao said.

“Apart from commodity prices, user charges of water and electricity are set to go up. Many hotels are finding it difficult to even recover their working cost,” said Raghavendra Padukare, owner of By-Two-Coffee chain of hotels, known to sell food at reasonable prices.

There are 18,000 hotels in Bengaluru, including small, medium and fine dining , of which 60% are on food-delivery platforms. “Online prices will also go up, but that will take some time as hoteliers have to work out the new rates with the service providers,” he added.

Supriyo, minister of state for environment, made the remark while replying to a supplementary related to air pollution during Question Hour .

The Speaker, however, immediately expunged the remarks from records. Birla also told parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi to make Supriyo understand parliamentary proceedings. Congress members protested over the minister's remarks. Amid the protests, the minister said he was withdrawing the remarks.

Supriyo's remark came when Chowdhury, while referring to answer given by the minister, said it was a wishy-washy statement and just a statement of intent and nothing more than that.

290,['8/02/2020'],Rohan Khaunte arrest case: Opposition MLAs seek Goa governor’s intervention,"This story is from February 8, 2020

PANAJI: Opposition MLAs on Friday met Goa governor Satya Pal Malik and sought his intervention in the case of the recent arrest of former revenue minister Rohan Khanute.

The MLAs requested Malik to direct the government to lodge a complaint against the complainant as well as conduct an inquiry into the episode. They asked that the deposition of former chief minister and senior-most MLA Pratapsingh Rane, who was witness to the incident, be taken into account.

Calling Khaunte’s arrest ‘unprecedented’, former deputy chief minister Vijai Sardesai said this incident signals the “onset of fascism through the legislative assembly in the state”.

Rane said the speaker should have issued showcause notices and conducted an inquiry before taking action. “How can you take action without an inquiry? We are all responsible people,” Rane said.

When told that the Speaker said he had issued permission based on the police report, Rane said, “Police were not there. They did not see anything,” and added that police went to Khaunte’s house at night.

Opposition leader Digambar Kamat said that for the first time in the state, the budget speech was read out in the absence of the opposition. “There have been many fights, but there was never an instance where the opposition was absent on budget day,” he said.

In their memorandum to the governor, the MLAs stated that the state government “has failed miserably to uphold provisions of the Constitution and has sought to silence its critics and detractors, including the opposition MLAs, in a manner that does not follow the due process of law and is a vulgar and blatant abuse of authority”.

The MLAs said that the manner in which the Speaker granted permission for Khaunte’s arrest was “rather cavalier for an offence which is minor and bailable and was done without even demanding a preliminary inquiry report into the matter to verify that prima facie a case exists”.

The police, they said, ought to have issued a notice of appearance before effecting any arrest. The incident “smacks of high-handedness, abuse of law and a tactic to divert attention from the main issue on hand, the colossal failure in governance,” the MLAs said.

HYDERABAD: With no let-up in the coronovirus outbreak in China, Hyderabad’s mobile phone repair market in Abids and Secunderabad, which largely depend on spare parts from China, could take a hit.People throng Jagdish Market in Abids and Gujarati Galli, Koti, for purchasing mobile phone accessories and spare parts, which primarily are sourced from China.Merchants at the Jagdish Market said that though they have stock of Chinese mobile phones, they would soon run out of the stocks. “We are facing shortage of spare parts. Some of these spare parts are costly and customers prefer coming to us instead of going to bigger showrooms which charge them a huge price,” Ahmed Pasha, a merchant, said.“My cellphone was given for repair after the touch screen went kaput. I did not want to spend Rs 5,000 or Rs 6,000 at a high-end shop. I went to Jadish Market for a replacement, but I could not find one,” said V Sunita, a techie from Himayatnagar.The cellphone market in Secunderabad is also hit with supplies from China dwindling.Along with the cellphone spare parts, the Chinese toy market in the city is also facing the heat. “We are not getting any plastic toys from China since 10 days.

292,['8/02/2020'],"Govt to pharma cos: Don’t book hotels, flights, tours for docs at conferences","This story is from February 8, 2020

Nagpur: It’s quite common for pharmaceutical companies to arrange stays in five star hotels and sightseeing tours for delegates of national and international medical conferences, held often in big cities. But, in a recent correspondence issued to the pharma lobby, the department of pharmaceuticals has asked them to stop this practice.

The department of pharmaceuticals is attached to the Central government’s ministry of chemical and fertilizers. The letter is addressed to organizations like Indian Drug Manufacturers Association (IDMA), Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA), Federation of Pharma Entrepreneurs (FOPE), and Organisation of Pharmaceutical Producers of India (OPPI). These groups include most leading drugmaker companies in India.

“The department has received a grievance alleging that pharma companies organize hotels, accommodations in five-star hotels, local sightseeing etc at conferences conducted by doctors,” the letter reads. It further adds that all pharma companies should follow Uniform Code of Pharmaceutical Marketing Practices (UCPMP).

“Pharma associations are requested to make sure that the pharma companies adhere to provisions of UCPMP and no unethical promotion of pharma products is done during the conference,” it concludes. The UCPMP is a voluntary code of conduct for ethical marketing practices, and it bars pharma firms from offering inducements to doctors to promote their products.

Clause 7.2 of the UCPMP states “companies or their associations/ representatives shall not extend any hospitality like hotel accommodation to health care practitioners and their family members under any pretext”.

Nagpur has hosted many such national and international conferences during 2019 and many are lined up for 2020. Director of a leading event management company in the city, who was not willing to be named, said pharma companies sponsor most of the expenses of such conferences.

“Most of the conferences are sponsored by pharma companies. Local units of such companies pay even for the delegate registrations, and hotel stay of doctors. Some companies organize sightseeing tours for them,” he said. Tourist spots in and around Nagpur are prominently highlighted in the conference brochures to serve this purpose, he added.

Doctors and representatives of pharma companies in city were reluctant to comment on the development. A general manager of a leading pharma company said the letter has been issued to the associations of drugmakers and not to individual companies. So, they will wait for specific instructions to come from their association or corporate office of the company.

Many others claimed that they follow the codes mentioned in UCPMP.

Rampant practice

Associations of different specialist doctors in modern medicine organize conferences on regular basis

Such conferences are combined with Continuous Medical Education (CME) events

Doctors are supposed to attend these CMEs and earn credit points for getting updated knowledge

These credit points are must for practicing doctors to get their registrations renewed

Pharma companies allegedly sponsor these conferences, stay, travel, and sightseeing of doctors

Doctors allegedly enjoy free outings, trips and tours with sponsorship of pharma companies

UDHAGAMANDALAM: Forest minister Dindigul C Sreenivasan on Friday personally conveyed his “deep regret” to a tribal boy in the Nilgiris district , a day after he made the teenager unbuckle his footwear. After the minister expressed his regret, C B Kethan, 14, agreed to withdraw a complaint he filed at the Masinagudi police station.

The minister who had come to inaugurate the Theppakadu elephant rejuvenation camp on Thursday had taken Kethan’s help to unbuckle his footwear to enter a temple. The incident created a controversy.

On Thursday evening the boy filed a complaint, which police did not register.

On Friday, the minister met Kethan, his mother Kali, and around 50 tribal people belonging to different communities. The meeting took place at Tamizhagam, a government guest house in Ooty. J Innocent Divya, the Nilgiris collector, Shanthi A Ramu, Coonoor MLA, and other AIADMK district functionaries were present.

The minister conveyed his “deep regret,” following which Kethan and his mother offered to withdraw the petition.

Villagers of Lightpadi, from where Kethan hails, consider it inauspicious to wear footwear. However, the younger generation have started wearing slippers. “We feel uncomfortable as Kethan has touched the slippers of the minister. Hence, we want to perform a pooja in our village temple.” According to the villagers, the minister has offered to sponsor the expenses for the pooja.

When the villagers submitted a petition seeking basic amenities such as drinking water facility, toilets and roads, for which the forest department is not giving clearance, Sreenivasan instructed the forest officials to give them NOC for developing basic amenities.

“The petition also sought 300 green houses for their village. The minister okayed 100 green houses for them in the first phase. A proposal in this connection will be sent to the government soon,” said Innocent Divya.

AIADMK sources allege Kethan’s family and the villagers had been instigated by some political forces to blow up the issue.

Police said the complaint signed and handed over by Kethan is not valid as he is only 14 years old. However, later in the evening Kethan and his mother withdrew the complaint.

295,['8/02/2020'],Ooty rose garden gears up for silver jubilee celebration,"This story is from February 8, 2020

Udhagamandalam: The Government Rose Garden in Ooty has added 201 new plant varieties to the existing 4000 varieties ahead of its silver jubilee celebration in May. With 31,500 rose plants of 4,201 varieties, it is one of the biggest and finest rose gardens in the country.

Shiva Subramaniam Samraj, joint director of horticulture department, said, “As many as 201 new rose varieties have been added to the garden in the past 10 months. In total, we have added 500 varieties of roses in the past three years. The heritage section of the garden houses very rare and old varieties and it is a major tourist attraction.”

He said the new varieties of roses were developed by Rose Federation, an authenticate body. The federation will develop new varieties according to the requirements of gardens and name them. The new varieties are also patented by them.

The garden houses rose varieties that are named after former chief minister Jayalalithaa and founder of modern Nilgiris, John Sullivan.

It is to be noted that Colin Sullivan, a descendant of John Sullivan, had in 2014 made a humble suggestion to name a rose after the latter through the Nilgiri Documentation Centre. Subsequently, in January 2019, a new variety was developed and named after John Sullivan.

When Steve Jones, president, World Federation of Rose Societies, visited the garden in 2014 he had said, “The Ooty rose garden is one among the 100 best rose gardens in the world.”

The garden comes alive with roses in full bloom in April and May. “In other months, rose blooms according to characteristics of each plant,” the joint director of horticulture department said.

Developed and maintained by the horticulture department, the garden is located in a royal area of Vijayanagaram. It was set up in 1995 to celebrate the centenary of the annual flower show at the Government Botanical Garden in Ooty. Spread across 10 acres, the garden had in 2006 won the prestigious garden of excellence award that was instituted by the World Federation of Rose Societies.

Recently, an irrigation system was installed in the garden at a cost of Rs 20 lakh under the special area development project. “This is mainly to protect the plants during winter and summer. We are taking all efforts to maintain the excellence of the garden. We will be celebrating the silver jubilee of the garden in a grand manner,” Samraj said.

The newly-wed couple

KORAPUT: Rinku and Pinki (names changed) had known each other since childhood. Living in the same village in remote Malkangiri district , they grew up together. Little did they realise that one day they will fall in love with each other. But then the inevitable happened some three years back.

Despite the country’s top court having decriminalised same sex relationship, staying together was still not an option for them from where they come. It would have set tongues wagging and a fear of backlash from a society which still frowns on such relationships.

So they decided that one of them would undergo sex change and become a man and then get married. This was a bold decision and one which had the blessings of both sets of parents.

Recently, the two tied the knot. The wedding was kept under wraps but news got out as their marriage photographs found their way to social media.

While the newly-wed couple refused to talk to media, sources close to the family said the two were in a relationship for the past three years and decided to get married.

One of the girls is an engineering graduate in Bhubaneswar. It was she, a 25-year-old, who decided to undergo the sex change and become a man so that she could marry her girlfriend. “The parents of the two girls not only gave their consent but also supported them during the entire medical process,” a family source said.

The sex change procedure was carried out at a private hospital in New Delhi on July 3, 2019 and a week later, she was declared a man. Around Rs 6 lakh was spent on the whole medical procedure which was borne by the girl’s parents.

“It took around six months for him to recuperate from the surgery and once he found himself fit, the marriage was solemnized in the presence of family and close relatives,” the source added. But, despite the mariage, the two won’t be able to have children.

“Chances of such couples becoming parents are negligible,” said Sapan Kumar Dinda , a surgery specialist at Malkangiri district headquarters hospital.

NEW DELHI: Names missing, incorrect details and faulty EVMs upset many a voter who returned dejected after failing to vote In Kalyanpuri, Ram Chander and eight of his family were shocked to find names missing. “We always vote together. Like every time, we left to vote early but were told our names were missing. We had all voted in the Lok Sabha election and never expected this,” said Chander. They tried to plead but to no avail.If pleading did not help, neither did waiting to see if a mismatch of name and details could be fixed. Anjali Devi (70) hung around to see if her booth level officer could solve her problem. The Seemapuri resident of 40 years said while the photograph and details were hers, the name read Abdul Anwar. “She had voted in the last election. I remember her. But there has been some glitch and the name is not hers,” a BLO said.In R K Puram’s Ravi Dass camp, Sobha Devi (85) went a second time to the polling centre. “I requested I be allowed to vote. I haven’t missed an election in 50 years but nothing happened. I don’t know how my name dropped off,” she said.Rajendra and Anju Sharma of Chhattarpur had voter IDs but did not find their names on the roll. “I moved houses, maybe that is why my name was removed,” said Rajendra.Meanwhile, at Raisina Bengali School (CR Park), two of the four booths had glitches in EVMs so voting got delayed, irritating earnest voters who had queued since 7.30 am. C Chakraborty, a 60-year-old, said, “Why are faulty machines here? Why can’t EC prepare better? We come early and face this sham.” Polling started 40 minutes late but not before many had left the queue.Rohini resident Geeta Bhatia found it impossible to vote. “I’m headed to office after voting. But where will I keep my purse and phone? Policemen didn’t allow me to carry anything. This is a nuisance,” she said, before leaving the Sector 15 booth.Meanwhile, polling staff and volunteers complained there was no provision for food or drinking water. If a college student volunteer in Laxmi Nagar rued, “Nobody is concerned about food or water for us,” polling staff in Vivek Vihar echoed his thoughts. “Not a cup of tea, forget refreshments. We may have been paid but we get in early and can’t just leave the booth, so some refreshments should have been organised,” she said. Not just food, staff pointed out there was no point calling a room a creche if it had no toys.

300,['8/02/2020'],"In these dark times, incandescent words","This story is from February 8, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: Had someone asked finance minister T M Thomas Isaac ‘Will there be budget in the dark times?’, he would have answered promptly, ‘there will also be budget, about the dark times’.

The budget Isaac presented on Friday was packed with political statements and the speech was utilized by Isaac to clearly convey the political position of CPM and LDF on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and National Registry of Citizens (NRC) controversies.

“Democracy and dictatorship are standing face to face in India. The rulers in Delhi speak only in the language of hatred and rancour. Their followers consider violence and attack as their karma. The administrative set-up has completely yielded to communalism. Generally speaking, this is the India of today,” thus began the 11th budget speech of Isaac. The minister who used to wear colourful long kurtas on budget days, chose a black one on Friday.

Drifting away from the usual practice of quoting extensively from the works of a great author in his budget speeches, Isaac quoted from several literary works, especially poems, to spice up his speech this year. Though he began with noted Malayalam writer Anand and concluded with Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore, rendering magniloquence to the speech, in between were lines from lesser known writers and even teen poets like Drupath Gautham.

Depicting the current volatile situation in the country, Isaac quoted from Anand’s article, ‘The pathways before a nation’, in which the author raised a doubt ‘how a society so highly educated and standing at the forefront of intellectual world, could suddenly be possessed by hatred towards a community and indulge in unbelievable crimes’. And, he tried to find the answer in lyricist Anwar Ali’s lines which said ‘…We are living in times’, and went on to ‘encapsulate the situation by quoting a young poet O P Suresh whose line reads: ‘Malice is the pennant, Terrorism, the diplomacy, Attack, the mode of greeting Every citizen, a mighty explosion’.

The minister refers to the ongoing anti-CAA protests across the country, saying, “We are passing through a period of the biggest agitation in the history of independent India. Students, youth and women are at the forefront of this struggle.” He goes on to acknowledge the joint protest carried out by LDF and UDF against CAA by saying, “The chief minister and opposition leader sitting at sathyagraha on the same agitation platform was a powerful message to the whole nation. Then the legislature of Kerala unanimously passed a resolution against this communal amendment. I am proud to say that the other states in India view with wonder the unity evolved in Kerala.”

Asserting that fear has engulfed even the ‘imagination of our children’ in the backdrop of CAA and NRC, Isaac quoted Drupath Gautham, a 15-year-old student at Meenangadi in Wayanad, who wrote: ‘Fear is a nation, Silence is an ornament there’.

Poet P N Gopikrishnan was the next to be quoted to capture the grave situation where rulers are getting ready to erase the citizenship rights of the people. ‘Just like a house incorrectly drawn, was wiped out by a child, with an eraser’. Meanwhile, noted poet Prabha Varma’s lines delineated how ‘the campuses are resonating with curled fists, that declare they wouldn’t yield an inch…’

The young women too are at the forefront of the struggle as lyricist Vinod Vaishakhi writes: ‘Over the snow, Girls gleaming like torches, Cry out “Sanghvad Se Azadi”,’ or like Refeeq Ahammed aspires: ‘We, we are the youth, You cannot but fall, into garbage heaps’.

Shifting from poetry , Isaac quoted from the chapter titled ‘Freedom’ in the novel ‘Mullappoo niramulla pakalukal’ by Benyamin which read: ‘By three o’clock in the afternoon, people began to slowly flow along the streets…Some held the national flag and some others the white flag of peace. Some others moved draped in the national flag. This nation does not belong to anybody else, but it is ours’.

The intention, as the finance minister said, was to show how Benyamin predicted the ‘human chain’ organized in Kerala on Republic Day last month.

Among other writers who figured in Isaac’s speech were noted poet Sachithanandan and lesser known Vishnu Prasad, Thwahitha Shir of Ottappalam Vaniyamkulam School (who took part in Palakkad District Youth Festival competition), Vijila Chirappad, Girija Pathekkara, Faikha Jaffer, Asokan Marayur and M R Radhamani.

And in his final appeal to uphold secular renaissance values, Isaac opted to quote from the famous 35th chapter of ‘Gitanjali’ by Rabindranath Tagore: ‘Where the mind is without fear, And the head is held high, Where the knowledge is free…’.

Later, while addressing the post-budget press meet, Isaac said there is clear politics in the budget. “It is not the time to omit politics in budget speech. The use of Gandhi’s assassination painting on the cover of the budget speech is part of the resistance we raise against the policies followed by the Centre,” he said.

301,['8/02/2020'],SC takes note of death of infant at protest site,"This story is from February 8, 2020

New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Friday initiated suo motu proceedings against involving children in agitations in the wake of an infant’s death at Shaheen Bagh , the site of anti-CAA protests in the capital. The court also deferred hearing on a plea seeking removal of the protesters to Monday, though it said it “understood there was a problem”.

A four-month-old had died in his sleep on the night of January 30 after returning from Shaheen Bagh where his parents had taken him during the anti-CAA protest .

The matter will be taken up on February 10 by a bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde.

The court took cognisance of a letter written by 12-year-old bravery award winner Zen Sadavarte to the CJI seeking directions to prevent children from participating in protests. The Class 7 student said the Shaheen Bagh incident was a violation of the deceased infant's right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution and inclusion of children and infants in protests amounted to “torture and cruelty”.

Earlier in the day, hearing a plea to remove protesters from Shaheen Bagh , a bench of Justices S K Kaul and K M Joseph postponed the matter to Monday. “We understand there is a problem. We will take it up on Monday. We will be in a better position by then,” the bench said.

When one of the petitioners said voting for Delhi assembly polls was scheduled on February 8, the bench said, “That is exactly why we are saying come on Monday. Why should we influence it?”

While asking the petitioners to wait till the matter was heard, the bench said, “We think it would be appropriate if the high court deals with the matter. The high court is the appropriate forum and we can issue directions to this effect.”

Seeking removal of protesters from Shaheen Bagh, advocate Amit Sahni has sought directions to Delhi Police to ensure smooth traffic flow on the Kalindi Kunj-Shaheen Bagh stretch which has been blocked since December 15. He approached the SC against the January 14 order of the high court which did not direct the police to remove protesters but asked it to deal with the situation keeping law and order in mind.

Sahni said the law enforcement machinery was being “held hostage to the whims and fancies of the protesters” who had blocked vehicular and pedestrian movement from the road connecting Delhi to Noida.

Panaji: Chief minister Pramod Sawant has expressed willingness to offer single-window clearance for people interested to shoot their films anywhere in the state. People wanting to set-up a film studio on public private partnership (PPP) mode will also be welcomed, Sawant told the legislative assembly on Friday .

He was speaking on the congratulatory motion tabled by Mayem MLA Pravin Zantye. The House congratulated Sanjay Shetye and his Vinsan World team for their movie ‘Sthalpuran’ being selected to be screened at the Berlin Film Festival.

Sawant said Goans need not go abroad as they have opportunities in the state. “The Entertainment Society of Goa (ESG) offer schemes supporting film production,” he said.

Zantye said many films, including foreign films, are shot in the state. “This offers ample opportunities to local artistes,” he said.

NCP MLA Churchill Alemao appealed for adequate state support to producers of khell tiatrs as the form is going into oblivion.

Dindigul C Sreenivasan

COIMBATORE: Forest minister Dindigul C Sreenivasan on Friday expressed hope that the AIADMK would emerge victorious in the urban local body elections in the state. He was in the city to inaugurate the 25th sports meet for the state forest department personnel.

Addressing the gathering, he said in the last assembly election the district had returned AIADMK MLAs in all the segments, except one. The ruling party had also tasted victory in the local body elections in the district. Crediting local administration minister S P Velumani for the electoral gains in the district, Sreenivasan said the victory march would continue in the urban local body elections too.

Accusing opposition parties of heaping baseless allegations on the ruling party just to find fault, he said the AIADMK government was functioning in a transparent manner. “The forest department, for instance, has recruited 2,000 personnel in the past few years and every posting was made in a transparent manner without room for any irregularities. Applications were collected online and it was the merit that determined the recruitment.’’

Sreenivasan said chief minister Edappadi K Palansiwami was particular about eradicating corruption in all the government departments.

He said the CM has allotted Rs15.5 crore for the development of forest institutes in Coimbatore and Vaigai dam. “Similarly, Rs 57 crore has been sanctioned in the first phase for the maintenance of 570km road in forest area. For the benefit of forest workforce, the government is initiating several measures like salary hike for anti-poaching watchers.” tnn

Pritiranjan Moharana

KENDRAPADA: Golapa Singh (64) has been living in Kheresa , a slum in Jagatsinghpur town, all his life. During this time the slum dwellers had made numerous appeals to the state and district authorities to provide them land to build houses. But all such entreaties came to nought. People had given up all hope of moving out of the slum before Pritiranjan Moharana entered their life.

The 55-year-old engineer recently donated 28 decimals of land to 25 landless families, paving way for them to construct houses. The present market value of the land is around Rs 40 lakh. “It gives me pain to see the plight of the slum dwellers living in our area. Now I can die in peace. My son and daughter are well settled. They too have supported me in this endeavour,” said Moharana, who resides in Cuttack .

“The authorities will soon register the names of benefactors in the land record of rights,” said Dr Manas Ranjan Bhoi , the tehsildar of Jagatsinghpur.

Talking about the decision to donate land, Moharana said this was a long-term plan. “My father (Bholanath Moharana) was a teacher. He taught me to help the needy. I was born with nothing. I have nothing else to achieve in life. My only dream was to help the poor,” Moharana added.

The urge to do something for the poor was always there, but it came returned strongly sometime back when he witnessed the plight of some slum dwellers in Kheresa.

“We have been living in the slum for more than four decades. Several times in the past we have urged authorities to provide us land. But our pleas fell on deaf ears. We are grateful to Moharana for providing us land to build homes,” Singh said.

Jiban Das a retired official in Jagatsinghpur, was overwhelmed to hear about Moharana’s decision. “I have no words to express how small I felt when I came to know that Moharana donated land for the poor. Nowadays there is a mad rush to acquire wealth. But Moharana proved he is an exception. His nobel gesture showed that humanity still exists in today’s selfish world,” Das said.

PANAJI: Mining truck owners are set to get relief after the legislative assembly passed the Goa Motor Vehicles Tax (Amendment) Act, 2020 on Friday, allowing those involved in transporting mineral ore to pay tax on a quarterly basis, instead of bulk tax on a yearly basis at a time.

The bill that was introduced in the House sought to amend Section 4 of the act, so as to provide relief to tipper/truck owners in view of the stoppage of mining activities.

An amendment bill was also passed approving the ordinance issued in October 2019 reducing tax for registration of new vehicles for the period between October 17 and January 31, 2019. The government had slashed road tax by 50% for registration of new vehicles in a bid to boost sales.

The old registration rate — in force prior to the ordinance — for four-wheelers, motorcycles, tricycles, auto rickshaws and motor vehicles belonging to partnership firms and limited companies with share capital of less than Rs 50 lakh, became applicable from January 1, 2020. There was considerable rise in motor car registrations while the state GST collections also increased by 35%, the bill stated.

The duo who saved the man from drowning

KORAPUT: The presence of mind of two teenagers helped save a middle-aged man from drowning in the main canal of Kolab irrigation project flowing through Jeypore on Friday. The two teenagers are Sanjay Pujari , 19 and Kisan Majhi , 17.

The man, Balaji Sahoo , a photo studio owner of Jeypore, accidentally fell into the canal when he was resting on its embankment after he fell unwell during his morning walk.

“While sitting on the embankment I felt my head reel. Soon I fell into the canal and lost my senses. Thereafter, I don’t know what happened,” said Sahoo, who was discharged after being taken to the local hospital.

The water current swept the unconscious Sahoo several metres away until few women passers-by raised an alarm. Sanjay and Kisan, who were near the canal, immediately dived into the canal to save him.

“We saw the man floating in the canal water that was flowing at a high speed. The man was few metres away from a big iron gate of the canal and would have dashed against it. So, without wasting time, we jumped into the canal, swam to him and dragged him out,” said the duo.

While Sanjay has completed his ITI course, Kisan has completed high school education. After Sahoo was rescued by the two friends, locals informed police, who subsequently admitted him to the local hospital for treatment. He was discharged after treatment.

“The brave act of the duo is commendable. We have felicitated them as their act is an example for others,” said Baleswar Gidhi , inspector-in-charge of Jeypore town police station.

The cache of weapons seized in Malkangiri district

BHUBANESWAR/MALKANGIRI: In one of the biggest seizures of arms and ammunition in the state, a joint team of Odisha and Andhra Pradesh police as well as personnel from Border Security Force and Central Reserve Police recovered an INSAS light machine gun, are three INSAS rifles, three carbine sten guns, 202 rounds of 5.56 mm ammunition and 59 rounds of 7.62 mm ammunition during raids at Maoist hideouts in Malkangiri district in the last three days.

Two VHF set-cum-scanners, an optical sight, 100 grams of gun powder and five bundles of codex wires were also among the items seized, Odisha DGP Abhay said in Bhubaneswar on Friday. Abhay termed the seizure as the highest ever haul in the history of anti-Maoist operations by Odisha Police . This is also the first time that an INSAS light machine gun was seized during an anti-Maoist operation.

SP (Malkangiri) Hrisikesh Khilari said the bulk of the weapons was seized from swabhiman area under Chitrakonda block in Malkangiri district. Police said the massive recovery followed an exchange of fire between security forces and Maoists in Goigunda forest on January 15. “Following the gun battle, we had managed to seize several Maoist documents and electronic devices. Subsequent search and area dominance exercises led to the recovery of the arms and ammunition from swabhiman area,” Khilari said.

Though efforts are on to ascertain the sources from where the Maoists got hold of the sophisticated weapons, there’s a suspicion that most of the seized arms and ammunition might have been stolen by the rebels from police stations in the past. It must be mentioned that Maoists had looted police armouries in Koraput district in 2004 and Nayagarh in 2008.

“We suspect the huge cache of arms belonged to the Maoists of Andhra-Odisha border special zonal committee. It is suspected that the arms and ammunition could have been looted from the police in the past. It is under probe,” Abhay said.

Police said they have intensified combing operations in Malkangiri to improve road connectivity and ensure smooth progress of development projects in the region.

Coimbatore: In a protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC), about 5,000 people formed a 5-km long human chain from Aathupaalam to Podanur Bazaar Street on Friday.

The protesters, holding placards asking the Centre to withdraw CAA and NRC, were residents from areas like Vasantha Nagar, Podanur Main Road, Kurichi, Aathupaalam and Thirumulai Nagar and members of a few Muslim outfits. The protest was organized through welfare associations.

“We need the government to see how many people are protesting against the Act,” said S Abdul Khader from the Podanur Vasantha Nagar Residents Welfare Association.

“CAA could make many Muslims lose their citizenship. I myself don’t have a birth certificate. If the government ask me for birth certificates and citizenship proofs of my father and grandfather, how will I produce it,” he asked. “Many of us have lived here for generations. To prove their citizenship, our ancestors tattooed Indian flag on their hands. How can we show all that?”

The protest was the third major dissent against CAA and NRC after the road show on Government Arts College Road last week and a huge protest at VOC grounds last month.

Pramod Sawant

MARGAO: The Board of Studies in Social Science has taken the decision to include the life and times of noted freedom fighter Francisco Luis Gomes in the curriculum of Std X, chief minister Pramod Sawant , who also holds the education portfolio, has told the House.

“The mention of Dr Francisco Luis Gomes has been already made in the supplement of history of Goa in Std XII in the Chapter “The Constitutional – Republican Phase’ under the sub-topic ‘Contributions of some Great Goans’,” reads the written reply tabled by Sawant in the House to the question raised by Curtorim MLA Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco.

Gomes, who represented Goa in the Portuguese parliament, and known as the “prince of intellectuals”, was also a historian and economist.

The contents of the chapter to be included in the history text book of Std X were being edited by the Board of Studies and is going to be included in the curriculum from the academic year 2021, Sawant added in the written reply.

Nevertheless, despite a strong demand for preserving Gomes’original house at Colmorod, Navelim, the structure lies in ruins. Obscured by a thick overgrowth of vegetation, there is hardly anything to suggest that this ramshackle house once belonged to the great Goan parliamentarian. The Margao municipality had in the past passed a resolution to acquire the house along with the surrounding land in order to maintain and preserve it.However, there has been no progress on the front.

320,['8/02/2020'],Bengal toy retailers wary of hike in customs duty,"This story is from February 8, 2020

Kolkata: Over 30,000 people in Kolkata and nearly a lakh in the state may be out of jobs over the next few months following the 200% hike in customs duty proposed on imported toys in the Union Budget tabled by Nirmala Sitharaman. A bandh will be observed in toy markets in the Burrabazar area on Saturday to protest this hike.

Currently, over 80% of articles in the toys market in India is imported. Bengal has a Rs 1,000-crore market for toys, while Kolkata alone accounts for Rs 700-750 crore. There are over 4,000 retail shops for toys in the city, while the state figure is 10,000.

Retailers and small vendors are scared that this steep hike will destroy the industry because it is heavily dependent on imports.

Dhiman Mazumdar, who went to Hatibagan to buy electronic toys for his granddaughter, was surprised to see that one toy that was priced Rs 1,200 just 15 days back was now costing Rs 1,800. Souvikk Ghosh, a toy retailer in Fariapur area, felt the toy industry will cease to exist aft-er this. “The customs duty hike is with immediate effect. So, even if some distributors have old stock, prices have increased. Soon it will be difficult to get buyers,” he added.

According to him, there will be a 40-50% hike in price of toys due to this duty hike.

Vikash Jain, vice-president of West Bengal Exim Association, pointed out that customs duty has been hiked from 20% to 60% in the budget with immediate effect. “There are over 1 lakh toy retailers in the country. Besides, there are street hawkers. Now most toys, specially battery-operated ones, are being imported from China, Malaysia and Hong Kong. Indian toys constitute only 15-20% of the market,” he added.

Jain argued that developing indigenous capability is good but it cannot happen in a day and “a three-fold rise is killing for any industry”.

Association secretary Akshay Binjrajka said on no other commodity was such a hike proposed in this budget. “There is hardly any manufacturer of battery-operated toys in India and a few doing this are actually assembling. A customs duty shield is good, but to this extent it will kill retailers and importers.”

The main wholesale market for toys in the city is Canning Street while big retail markets are China Baazar and Bagri Market.

Coimbatore: He earned the nickname ‘Arisi Raja’ after he ate rice from shops and houses that he raided in Pollachi area last year.

Though the 18-year-old wild tusker was captured on November 14, 2019, his name remained the same until the forest department recently decided to give it a new name for taming purpose and order commands.

At present, Arisi Raja is lodged at the kraal where the famous crop raider Chinna Thambi lost his roguishness and became a kumki.

The former department came out with a list of 10 names to give a new name to Arisi Raja and finally zeroed in on ‘Muthu’.

A mahout and a cavady (assistant to mahout) are currently giving various commands to Muthu. The elephant is expected to be released from the kraal in three months.

The forest department tranquillized and captured Arisi Raja alias Saapattu Raman near Arthanaripalayam village in Pollachi on November 14, 2019. Two kumkis (trained elephants) Kaleem and Kapildev were used to capture the tusker. The elephant killed a minor girl at Navamalai near Aliyar in May 2019 and a man at Arthanaripalayam near Pollachi on November 9, 2019. Later, the elephant was translocated to Varakaliyar elephant camp where it was kept inside the kraal.

“Only the public called the elephant as Arisi Raja. But the department did not use the name,” forest range officer P Sakthivel said.

Panaji: The comptroller and auditor general (CAG) audit has pulled up the water resources department ( WRD ) for wasting Rs 11 crore by awarding contracts for canal distributary works without conducting any survey and soil investigation leading to changes in the scope of works and foreclosure of contracts.

Despite spending Rs 30.7 crore on the completed portion of one distributary of the Tillari irrigation project, the WRD couldn’t release water for irrigation to seven villages in North Goa for more than seven years, the CAG stated.

The audit observed that the WRD finalised alignment of one of the distributaries based on a study conducted by consultant Tritech Engineering Projects, Pune, but neither the consultant nor WRD had dug any trial pits to ascertain soil classification.

During actual execution of work, the contractor and WRD encountered totally different site conditions.

On one stretch, while executing the work, the contractor and WRD observed that the soil strata at site was of collapsing nature and to avoid probable leakages from the pipes and consequential problems to habitation downstream, the WRD decided to execute the work with mild steel (MS) pipes instead of RCC pipes.

On another stretch, the same problems were encountered where the MS pipes could not be laid by the contractor as the terrain had become dangerous and risky due to collapsible nature of soil.

The CAG did not accept the reply of the executive engineer division VII of the WRD in July 2017, which stated that it may not always be possible to investigate sub-surface conditions comprehensively before taking up the work and that the more commonly followed practice is to accept a certain risk.

“The reply is not acceptable, as the preparation of estimates and starting the work without conducting adequate surveys was in violation of the procedures prescribed in the central public works department manual,” the CAG report stated, adding that the risks accepted by the department in this case “far out-weighed the prescribed codal provisions”.

due recognition: The painting depicted final moments of Gandhiji

Thiruvananthapuram: “We will not forget who killed Mahatma Gandhi,” said finance minister T M Thomas Isaac when asked about using artist Tom Vattakuzhy’s painting ‘ Death of Gandhi ’ for the cover of budget document. The minister, who began his budget speech with statements against Citizenship (Amendment) Act, made a political statement by using the painting, which captured the final moments of Gandhiji.

Interestingly, it was a sweet ‘revenge’ for Vattakuzhy who saw several persons, including senior politicians Rahul Gandhi and Kanhaiya Kumar, sharing the image without giving him credits on Martyrs’ Day on January 30.

The painting, in the medium Gouache, was drawn in July last year and soon became an instant hit on Facebook where he posted it first.

Sharing the post of Rahul Gandhi, Vattakuzhy had mentioned, “When our horizons of freedom is at stake, when our historical past is at stake, I wanted this painting as an indelible poignant memoir to be etched into the soul of every Indian and keep reminding us always of how our father of nation died or rather was assassinated. But it saddens me as a painter, to see the work being circulated like a fatherless child without acknowledging its authorship.”

Vattakuzhy said that the finance minister had contacted him seeking his permission to use the painting. “It is the need of the time to have more history painting, a genre which is not very prevalent in the country, at a time there are different readings of history,” he said.

A painting of artist Jalaja P S is used as the cover of the budget document in English. Her painting under the series ‘Learning Mind Experience’ too is about Gandhi assassination.

Another painting, which became the cover of ‘Gender and Child Budget’ tabled in the assembly, by a young artist too became a topic of discussion. The painting ‘Ente Ammayum Ayalpakathe Ammamarum’ (my mother and mothers in neighbourhood) which had won Shanker’s award was drawn by 14-year-old Thrissur student Anujath Sindhu Vinaylal. ‘Flower Seller’ by renowned Mexican painter Diego Rivera was used as the cover of ‘Budget in Brief’.

Tirupur: The Tirupur city police cracked down on underage motorcycle riders on Friday.

Sensing that a growing number of underage boys were riding motorcycles in the city posing a threat to other motorists as well as themselves, a team of police personnel conducted a vehicle check near the corporation office. By evening, the team led by deputy commissioner V Badrinarayanan intercepted more than 40 bikes driven by boys below the age of 18 years.

Police confiscated the vehicles and asked the boys to bring their parents. The bikes were returned to the parents after a stern warning to them not to allow their wards drive motorcycles until they obtain licence. The parents were warned about the dangers posed by inexperienced drivers who have not been licenced to drive.

The boys meanwhile were made to assemble and sensitized on the legal requirements to drive a motorcycle. They were told that it was illegal to drive a motorcycle without a licence. “Driving a motorcycle without proper learning, will not only endanger the lives of other motorists but also is a threat to your safety,’’ Badrinarayanan told the boys before they were let off with a warning.

The Tirupur police said that they would continue vehicle checking drive in the coming days to weed out underage driving.

case

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday decided to take up the plea of the Centre and Delhi government on execution of death sentence for four convicts in Nirbhaya case on February 11 when the time period given by Delhi high court for them to exhaust all legal remedies expires.A bench of Justices R Banumathi, Ashok Bhushan and A S Bopanna, however, turned down solicitor general Tushar Mehta’s plea that the court should issue notice to the convicts so that they could also be heard on delaying tactics adopted by them frustrating execution of sentence.“Nation’s patience has been tested enough now and the court has to lay down law on the issue,” Mehta told the bench while pleading that the court should decide on whether condemned prisoners in the same case can be hanged separately.The Centre has challenged in the top court the February 5 order of the Delhi high court which had dismissed its plea against the trial court’s order staying execution of the death sentence while stating that all the four convicts have to be executed together and not separately. The bench said it would hear the petition on February 11 when it will take a call on whether notice needed to be issued to these convicts.The Centre said in its petition, “The question is whether a convict who has exhausted all his remedies can still frustrate the mandate of law merely because mercy petition of one of the co-convicts is pending before the President and another co-convict has not even filed the mercy petition. In other words, can one convict, by sheer inaction — calculated and designed or otherwise — frustrate the mandate of law?”",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74023205,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-384285,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/nirbhaya-hanging-sc-to-take-up-centres-petition-on-feb-11/articleshow/74016762.cms

334,['8/02/2020'],Sivaganga collector defies HC ruling,"This story is from February 8, 2020

Madurai: Defying a Madras high court order to swear-in M Devi as panchayat president of Sankarapuram village, Sivaganga district collector and district election officer (DEO) J Jayakanthan has passed an order to stay the swearing-in citing that the other candidate and the district administration are planning to move the Supreme Court (SC) against the court order.

Two candidates were declared as winners of the panchayat president election for Sankarapuram. On January 2, M Devi was declared the winner by issuing Form 25 and the next day the returning officer (RO) cancelled her Form 25 and issued a fresh Form 25 to the other candidate A Priyadharshini by declaring her the winner – after a recounting. Devi moved the high court Madurai bench challenging the order stating that Priyadharshini is closely associated with the ruling AIADMK.

On Thursday morning, a division bench of justice M Duraiswamy and justice T Ravindran observed that once Form 25 is issued, the RO becomes functus officio and he or she has no power to entertain any application for recount of votes as per Rule 66 of the Tamil Nadu Panchayats (Election) Rules.

Though the court had passed the order, the Sivaganga collector passed another order the same day (February 6) to stay Devi from swearing-in as the panchayat president. The order reads: “By citing the order passed by the high court Madurai bench, Priyadharshini submitted a letter to the collector urging to stay the swearing-in of Devi, as they are planning to move an appeal before the Supreme Court. Since the district administration after consultation with the government advocate has also planned to move for an appeal before the SC, the swearing-in of Devi has been stayed till the apex court delivers its final verdict.”

Speaking to TOI, Devi’s husband S Mangudi said that after the high court had passed a verdict in their favour, they were planning request the RO for swearing in Devi. Before that, the other candidate met the collector based on which the latter had passed the order.

“The collector sent his order copy to me by WhatsApp. This order shows that he is acting in a biased manner and that he is being influenced. When the high court passes an order, the collector is bound to comply with it, unless an injunction is granted by the SC,” said Mangudi and added that the other candidate and district administration is yet to move the SC.

He pointed out even if they move for an appeal, Devi should be sworn-in as the president based on the order of the high court, until the SC delivers its final verdict. M Saravanan, the counsel representing Devi, said that when the high court had passed an order, the collector has no locus standi to pass such an order to stay the swearing-in of Devi as the panchayat president.

Nagpur: The Athena Fest 2020 culminated on a high note with an array of activities that led the audience to merriment and beyond, on Friday.

Organized by the cultural and literary body of Hislop College, The Athenaeum, in association with The Times of India, the sixth edition of this annual inter-collegiate extravaganza witnessed competitions like Word Busters, Scavenger Hunt and Group Dance .

Word Busters is a word game that tests the participants’ speed, skill and strategy. It incorporates elements of vocabulary and quizzing to be used tactically. Hosted by co-convener of Athena 2020 Shirin Badar, the event brought together school and college students to battle it out in the preliminary round and give a spot to the top four teams in the semi-final round.

The winners of this round put up an intense fight in the finale which saw Hislop College’s Carren Thomas and Srishti Vaidya emerge victorious by defeating Std IX students Shraddha Moglewar and Ananya Kothari of BVM, Civil Lines.

Showing high spirits after finishing as the runners-up, Moglewar and Kothari appreciated the challenging pace of the game. They said, “The competition was tough and it was a great experience to be able to share the stage with college students. We got the opportunity to learn new words and expand our vocabulary.”

Scavenger Hunt, a fun game, made the teams scamper off to complete 12 active and creative tasks like taking a group selfie with maximum number of teachers, finding somebody with an unmatching pair of socks and taking a picture of resting cows with the hilarious adjunct to earn extra points for posing as cows.

Group dance, the most-awaited competition of Athena, had the atmosphere filled with endorphins as teams presented nuanced performances, holding the audience entranced. Traditional attires, folk dances, Bollywood and Tollywood music and gymnastic manoeuvres kept the crowd spellbound.

A majestic Bharatanatyam performance recreating a sequence from ‘Mahishasur vadh’ by one of the teams fetched the first prize.

Speaking to TOI about the grand success of the event, Athenaeum president Rohit Vijayan said, “The fest was specially curated to provide participants a platform to display their talent in a vast line up of activities ranging from poetry, singing, dancing, painting, sketching and many more.”

Athena 2020 convener Lovely Menachery said, “Over the years, The Athenaeum has been organizing events that bring together fun, knowledge and creativity. This fest, since its inception, has brought talent of students to the fore. The uniqueness of the fest lies in the fact that every aspect of the event is managed by students. We are thankful to our sponsors and print partner TOI for supporting the event.”

338,['8/02/2020'],GIDC under scanner for transfer of Meta Strips land,"This story is from February 8, 2020

Panaji: Goa Industrial Development Corporation ( GIDC ) has drawn flak from the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) for the fraudulent transfer of industrial land at Sancoale from Meta Strips Ltd (MCAL) to Varama Sir India Logistics and Infrastructure Pvt Ltd in 2016.

The CAG report for 2017-18 said that GIDC failed to recover Rs 26.6 crore from MCAL for transfer of the land, which did not have the government’s approval in the first place.

While then chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar rejected the proposal to transfer the land in September 2016, a fresh application moved by GIDC’s managing director was cleared by the government without Parsekar’s approval.

“The GIDC allowed the lessee to mortgage the entire plot enabling MCAL to raise large finances for itself finally creating encumbrance of over Rs 400 crore on the land that it had obtained by paying Rs 1.47 crore,” the CAG report said.

The report also said that instead of charging 60% of the prevailing plot rate, GIDC charged MCAL only 10% resulting in short recovery of transfer fee of Rs 26.6 crore.

Meta Strips acquired 2.42 lakh sqm of land in 1998 to set up an export oriented unit to manufacture copper and copper alloys, foils and strips for 30 years. Meta Strips then mortgaged the land for a loan of Rs 117.6 crore.

In 2015, MCAL decided to close down operations and sought permission from GIDC to transfer the land to Varama Sir India Logistics and Infrastructure Pvt Ltd.

CAG’s audit scrutiny revealed that enhanced compensation of Rs 6.36 crore has not been paid to those whose land was acquired. The audit also found that a substantial portion of land allotted to MCAL remained unutilised.

“The transfer application was directly dealt with the managing director without following the procedure of scrutiny by security committee or screening committee,” said the report.

The government has already initiated action to recover the amount for the transfer of the plot. In December, TOI reported that the industries department found that the transfer of the 2.42 lakh square metre plot to the logistic firm did not conform to Goa Industrial Development regulations.

The office of the advocate general told the industries department that Rs 26 crore should be recovered from Meta Strips, sources said.

TimesView Managing the huge volume of waste we generate daily is a challenge and segregation is an important way to manage this problem. A concerted effort is needed from both the KMC and citizens.

KOLKATA: The civic solid waste management department has decided to set up small compost plants across the city, where biodegradable garbage will be converted into fertilizer . The aim, an official said, was to take the load off the Dhapa dumping ground, the capacity of which has already been exhausted. On Friday, even Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation had a discussion at its MMiC meeting on its plan to set up 10 waste-to-compost plants in Salt Lake.KMC has already started work on four plants in south Kolkata, the first one at Chetla nearing completion. Construction of three other plants along Tolly’s Nullah, between Kundghat to Garia, is under way. According to a KMC solid waste management official, once these four are ready, more will be planned at wherever land will be available. “A major advantage of these mini-compost plants is that they require very little space and investment. A small plant can be built on 2.5-3-cottah plot and Rs 15 lakh can be invested for buying machines. Each plant can recycle 310 kg biodegradable waste into fertilizer a day,” said a KMC solid waste management official.According to Debabrata Majumdar, MMiC overseeing the KMC solid waste management department, they decided to build the small plants in neighbourhoods after introducing segregation of waste at household-level in 20 wards. “It is easy to utilize the segregated wastes to convert into fertilizer at the ward level itself. This will not only ensure less transportation costs but will also take the load off Dhapa, which is chocking under refuse from 144 wards in Kolkata,” he said, adding the civic body hoped to inaugurate the first four plants by another six months.The civic body has plans to replace handcarts with battery-operated vans to transport organic waste. “With battery-driven vans, we will be able to take more garbage to the compost plants than a handcart can carry,” said a KMC official. At present, civic workers collect segregated garbage from Chetla, Bijoygarh, Garia, Patuli and Jadavpur areas and take biodegradable waste, like fruit, vegetable and paper, to a compost plant at Dhapa.In Bidhannagar, the civic authorities will soon float tenders to engage an agency that will build 10 organic waste-to-compost units in Salt Lake. “About 1,500 sq ft of area will be required for each unit. The idea is to recycle biodegradable waste into compost,” said a civic official, adding household waste segregation has already started in Salt Lake, garbage from where is no longer dumped at Mollar Bheri. Two units are in operation in neighbouring New Town.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74023281,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-27621,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/four-mini-waste-to-compost-plants-to-come-up-in-s-kolkata/articleshow/74016773.cms

MADURAI: Though there has so far been no official instruction to introduce measures in government offices with regard to the spread of novel coronavirus (nCoV), the collector office and corporation office in particular in the city are lacking in cleanliness and hygiene. These offices are highly vulnerable for the spread of the virus.“The first thing to remember is personal hygiene. We have asked everyone, from students to public, to practice hand washing regularly to prevent spread of any infection, including nCoV. However, there has so far been no instruction in particular to step up cleanliness measures because there is hardly any risk here in Madurai,” said a senior corporation health official. However, both the corporation office and collector office was devoid of provision for soaps and hand wash solutions for washing hands in the toilets.The open grounds in the campus of both offices have litter strewn in many spots despite the presence of sanitary workers. Since the collector office sees hundreds gather to submit grievances every week, which makes the offices vulnerable to easy spread of infections. At the corporation office, there is water stagnating in the defunct fountain. Many students, who come to the corporation office campus grounds, to prepare for union public service commission (UPSC) exams are also facing health concerns.“We usually just sit on the grounds with bed sheets spread out.

Thiruvananthapuram: Sale of compact fluorescent lamps (CFL) and filament bulbs would be banned in the state from November 2020, finance minister announced in the budget on Friday.

As per statistics, 2.5 crore LED bulbs were installed during the last year. Streetlights and bulbs in government institutions will be replaced by LED bulbs. The government would also extend support to initiatives by local bodies for clean energy drives.

The minister said the quality of power supply in the state was set for a quantum leap. The voltage problem and frequent power failure would soon be a thing of the past, he said.

“Two key problems facing the power sector are insufficient power supply and frequent power failure. Remedies are being found for these two issues. The first can be resolved by constructing transmission lines.

The volume of electricity that can be brought through the completed Kochi-Edamon corridor is equivalent to 800MW of installed capacity. The work on the Rs 1,000 crore-TransGrid 2.0 project has begun. Once it is completed, electricity equivalent to 2,000MW installed capacity can be brought from outside and power requirements up to 2040 can be fulfilled.

Next thing to be resolved is frequent interruptions in distribution. “Dyuthi, 2020 Distribution Renovation Scheme’ a Rs-4,000 crore project, is aimed at avoiding such interruptions by ensuring at least double lines from 11KV line to transformers. E-safe scheme will be implemented to reduce dangers resulting from electricity,” Isaac said.

Based on this criteria, Ambalappuzha and Cherthala Taluks will be declared as hunger-free zones from April. This scheme can be expanded to more areas in 2020-21. An amount of Rs 20 crore has been set apart as special financial assistance for this. Under the aegis of Kudumbashree, 1,000 food courts will be started for providing food at Rs 25.

The budget has also announced various projects for the coir industry. In order to distribute cancer medicines at a low price, an Oncology Park will be constructed at Kerala State Drugs and Pharmaceuticals Limited in Alappuzha with the aid of KIIFB in the 6.4 acre land.

346,['8/02/2020'],Gender budget falls short of women’s expectations,"This story is from February 8, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: The state’s acute financial crisis has cast its shadow on the gender budget as well. Though Rs 3,809 crore has been allocated for various women’s welfare schemes, the finance minister has not made any new major proposals. It accounts to 18.4% of the total outlay compared to 16.8% allotted last year. In 2017-18, only 11.5% of the total outlay was earmarked for such schemes.

The proposal to set up an International Women’s Trade Centre (iWTC) at the Gender Park’s Kozhikode campus is highlighted as a key proposal. It will serve as a platform for women to safely start and expand enterprises and market products globally. However, only a token amount of Rs 1 crore has been provided for it.

As part of Hunger-Free Kerala Project, Kudumbashree will set up 1,000 food courts, which will provide meals at a rate of Rs 25. Through Kudumbashree, the state is planning to start ‘She Lodges’ in all cities. As many as 200 Kerala Chicken outlets, 1,000 green initiatives, 50 hotels with daily turnover of Rs 30,000 per day, are also among the targets fixed for Kudumbashree.

A total amount of Rs 600 crore has been set aside for Kudumbashree, including assistance from local self-government institutions.

The government had announced a financial support of Rs 3 crore for two women filmmakers in last year’s budget. Now, the finance minister has stated that these women directors should belong to SC/ST community.

Declaring 2020 as the Year of Women Safety, the finance minister has announced a comprehensive programme worth Rs 5.5 crore for police department to improve gender awareness. However, the budget has earmarked only Rs 10 lakh for it and stated that rest needs to be mobilized. Under a separate scheme of the Kerala State Women’s Development Corporation, the police will be allocated Rs 50 lakh for undergoing gender sensitization training.

The budget has made an allocation of Rs 5 crore for training and self-employment of transgender persons.

In the IT sector, Startup Mission has been allotted Rs 8 crore for various programmes, including the Kerala Women in Startups project.

A total of Rs 1847.33 crore has been allocated in the child budget, which is 8.9% of the total state plan outlay. The budget has earmarked Rs 50 lakh for the project Hope, which aims to provide psycho-social support to school dropouts and children in flood-affected areas. The finance minister has also earmarked Rs 8.40 crore to set up 28 Pocso courts in the state.

348,['8/02/2020'],Onion Price in Delhi: Why onions are making you cry despite enough supply,"An onion market in Delhi. (File photo)

NEW DELHI/NASHIK: Are onions still wreaking havoc on your monthly budget? For once, supply issues are not to blame, with around 50 trucks of onions coming in from Gujarat and Maharashtra at Azadpur Mandi every day, each bringing in around 20 tonnes of the essential commodity.The reason why they continue to cost you a bomb then is the high retail and wholesale price differential in Delhi. While the wholesale price currently ranges between Rs 15/kg and Rs 25/kg, retailers are selling onions for anywhere between Rs 40/kg and Rs 60/kg. Usually, sellers keep a margin of Rs 15/kg to account for transportation, storage and other costs. A 100% margin, which even some traders find hard to explain, is biting consumers hard.In Nashik, which is Delhi’s biggest supplier, the average wholesale price has steadily dropped over the last few weeks. To put things in perspective, it was Rs 1,600/quintal on Friday, a drop of 40% from Rs 2,600/quintal on January 31. The average wholesale price had touched an all-time high of Rs 8,625/quintal on December 16 last year at Lasalgaon APMC, the country’s largest wholesale onion market. Since then, the prices has dropped almost 81%.In the past fortnight, the drop is nearly 64% — from Rs 4,100/quintal on January 20.This decline, however, is yet to reflect in the retail markets of Delhi. In terms of kilograms, when the wholesale price ranged between Rs 60 and Rs 100 from mid-December to mid-January, individual consumers were buying it for anywhere between Rs 80/kg and Rs 120/kg. On Friday, at the roadside stalls near Mata Sundri College in New Delhi, onions were being sold at Rs 50/kg. Similarly, in east Delhi’s Samaspur, the retail price was between Rs 55/kg and Rs 60/kg. Mohammad Zubair, a vegetable seller in Samaspur F Block, said the prices had come down by Rs 30-40/kg in a month. “It’s gradually going down,” he claimed.In south Delhi’s Vasant Kunj, too, the current retail price hovered around Rs 50/kg.Rajan Pal, a seller at Bhogal vegetable market, said at Rs 55, the commodity was far cheaper than it was a couple of months ago when a kilogram cost above Rs 100. . “We get onions from Afghanistan and other countries too, but people prefer the Indian version,” he said.Srikant Mishra, secretary of Onion Traders’ Association, Azadpur Mandi, found the high wholesale-retail price differential surprising. “There is no shortage of supply in the wholesale market. But the retail prices are much higher than usual,” he said, adding that the retail prices were decided by the retailers. The economics of demand and supply determines the prices in the retail markets and there is no mechanism to control them. Factors like location and quality of the product play their part too: in upscale colonies, the retail prices are typically higher.Pintu Mandal, a seller at a market in Govindpuri, said onions were going as high as Rs 60/kg as “the wholesale price was still steep”. He attributed this to many wholesalers hoarding stocks with an eye on a dip in supply later.According to Lasalgaon APMC officials, there has been a rise in production in all onion-growing pockets of the country in the last one month, but the demand has remained in the same territory as earlier. This has led to a drop in the average wholesale price. “Production is good in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu too. This has led to a drop in demand for Maharashtra’s onions. As a result, the average wholesale onion price has dropped,” Suvarna Jagtap, chairperson of Lasalgaon APMC, said. She said a continuous fluctuations in the wholesale price were also responsible for the selling price not stabilising. The Centre had yet to lift the stock limit on wholesale and onion traders, which had been cut from 50 tonnes to 25 tonnes for wholesalers and from 10 tonnes to 5 tonnes for retailers, Jagtap said.“The government needs to lift the restrictions on onion traders — both wholesalers and retailers,” she added.A source in the Union ministry of agriculture, however, denied that there was any control over retail prices. “Some retailers have already purchased onions from the wholesale market and are releasing these gradually. This is the reason for the wide gap. The retail prices will drop gradually,” he said.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74020548,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-224514,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/why-onions-are-making-you-cry-despite-enough-supply/articleshow/74016807.cms
349,['8/02/2020'],Kolkata: Solar panels on depot roofs to charge e-buses,"This story is from February 8, 2020

KOLKATA: The West Bengal Transport Corporation ( WBTC ) is set to generate power through solar panels on depot roofs to recharge its electric vehicles . The Energy and Resource Institute ( TERI ) has conducted a study and found significant savings in annual electricity bills.

In a study at the WBTC Kasba depot, TERI found highly feasible strategies for electrification of public transport in Kolkata by powering the charging stations at major WBTC depots through solar energy. Actual site survey and measurements of power consumption patterns were performed as part of the study.

At a discussion on electric mobility, organised by the British Deputy High Commission and Bengal Chamber of Commerce on Friday, transport secretary N S Nigam hinted at significant increase of its electric bus fleet with its policy shift from Capex to Opex.

In the Capex system, the state transport undertaking has to buy electric buses out right. In the Opex model, WBTC needs to pay on per-km basis, which will make the total cost of operation half or even less than that of conventional internal-combustion engine buses, or the fuel-run vehicles. WBTC, which now runs 80 electric buses, has decided not to add to the diesel buses. “We have developed a fairly good charging infrastructure, but to increase the number of electric buses, we need to boost the infrastructure,” said a transport official.

TERI has proposed that the roof on the depot sheds be used to install solar-power panels. “GIS-based estimation of the plant capacity on the available rooftop area has been found to be enough to power the buses plying during the day,” said Shashank Vyas, associate fellow (electricity and fuel), TERI. WBTC can further save on its annual power bills if the depots were to opt for CESC’s time-of-day tariff, under which the electricity prices are different, depending on the peak and non-peak hours.

Alekhya Datta, fellow & area convenor, electricity and fuels convenor, TERI, who conceived and performed the study, along with Ram Krishan and Neshwin Rodrigues of TERI, said, “Such models using localized renewable energy and battery storage can provide benefits of reduced operating costs for depot operators and better grid-management for the electricity distribution company.”

TERI also plans to boost this model for other bus depots so that a sustainable and viable operational model can be established.

350,['8/02/2020'],A mixed bag amid acute economic crisis,"This story is from February 8, 2020

This is a budget which tries to balance the revenues and expenditure amid acute fiscal crisis. A quick overview of the budget reveals that it gives emphasis on capital investment and employment generation. There is also ample allocation for enhancing employment opportunities at local panchayat level. It needs to be seen how many of these schemes will take off this year.

The budget seems to be environment-friendly with a series of environment protection measures. To boost the state’s economy, the budget has raised social security pension by Rs 100. Though it is a small sum, it will help alleviate the poor man’s problem a little bit.

Looking at the health sector, there is a little bit of disappointment. The budget has not met with the criteria envisaged by the Center’s health policy, 2017. The Centre’s health policy had said that by 2020, the state should set apart 8% of GSDP for various welfare programmes in the health sector.

Though the budget has allocated Rs 700 core for various health schemes, it is not just enough as Kerala is today reeling under the impact of many new-age diseases and outbreaks of deadly viruses like Nipah and coronavirus. There are a host of secondary and life-style related diseases that need to be addressed urgently. The growing geriatric population is another challenge that Kerala needs to focus and we should find ways to enable the elderly to lead a productive life.

The oncology park coming up in Alappuzha is a good initiative as cancer cases in the state are on the rise. Another major issue in the health sector is that around 100 micro, small and medium enterprises have stopped their functioning. We need to find a long-term solution to revive these institutions, especially because people living in rural and semi-township areas may not have access to good hospitals.

The budget has adopted some key measures to revive the flagging agriculture sector. Though a CIAL-like model for selling plantation crops was promised in the last budget, it didn’t materialise. The proposal to give royalty for paddy farmers and incentives for value addition for coconut products will push the agri sector in the coming years.

Kerala’s flagship women’s initiative Kudumbashree getting a high weightage in the budget needs to be a seen a positive sign. The budget has allocated Rs 1,000 crore each for various welfare projects in Wayanad and Idukki, which is commendable.

Though garnering funds through KIIFB is not a good financial model, I suppose in a debt-ridden state, where over 75% of the income of the state goes to the payment of salaries and pensions of government employees, we do not have much options. It is indeed a Hobson’s choice and that says a lot about Kerala’s economy today.

351,['8/02/2020'],App for ordering homemade food launched in Coimbatore,"This story is from February 8, 2020

Representative image

COIMBATORE: To Tap into the growing demand for “home-cooked food”, a Chennai-based home food delivery app, Fooddoo, was launched in the city on Friday. The app connects home-based caterers with customers looking for home cooked foods and snacks in their locality.

The app, available on android and IOS, has on board around 30 homemakers, who specialize in preparing various types of dishes, and customers can choose the homemaker and dish based on his or her menu.

“We serve food prepared by moms at home,” co-founder of the app Saurav Mukherjee said. “The app displays a list of food items that are available for delivery in and around your area along with the name of the homemaker who is preparing it,” he said. The app, which was also launched in Trichy on Friday, has been a runaway success in Chennai with 300 moms and 40,000 customers.

With the number of nuclear families, students and IT professionals from other states growing and domestic cooks and maids becoming more in short supply in the city, the service is a silver lining.

“While food aggregators like Swiggy and Zomato are a blessing for office workers like us, who were earlier dependent on messes close by, eating restaurant food daily has taken a toll on our health,” T Harish Goel, an IT employee at Saravanampatti, said.

“Many of us have begun having stomach upsets and acidity problems often after eating restaurant food daily. Now, with most of us becoming health conscious, we don’t feel like eating greasy, oily food every day,” T Siddharth, a media professional living in a mansion at Gandhipuram, said.

While Fooddoo is a recent entrant in the city, another aggregator called Easy dine launched a similar operation as a pilot project a few months back. Another app called Ms Chef was launched in 2016 but wounded up in short time. Easy dine stopped their aggregator service and instead moved out of their home kitchen and into a large-scale kitchen with an appointed chef. “We ran an aggregator service by recruiting two to three housewives in an area, sending them orders, collecting prepared food, packing it and delivering it. However, it did not work out for us, because the housewives were not preparing it at the right time, sticking to our timelines and quantity issues also could not be standardized,” founder of Easy dine Gurukrishnan said.

“Now, we take monthly, weekly and daily orders and cater to everything from our new kitchen at Ganapathy,” he added. Easy dine now has around 150 customers.

Fooddoo says they are now perfecting the delivery model by standardizing quantity and assuring a certain business to the moms who have tied up with the app. “We are right now focusing only on South Indian cuisine. We will slowly add Andhra, Bengali and Chettinad cuisines, among others, once we get moms who specialize in those cuisines joining us,” Mukherjee said.

Giriprashath, who started Namma Veetu Paniyaram, has so far listed his FSSAI certified home on Swiggy. “While I get up to 372 orders from Swiggy in a week, I also get clients from people running hostels for students at Kuniamuthur, Sundarapuram etc, who order from me for their students and have subscribed monthly.”

352,['8/02/2020'],"Smoother tracks, sound barriers muffle E-W noise","KOLKATA: In July 2018, deafening noise during East-West Metro trial runs had kept Salt Lake residents awake at night. Cut to January, 2020, you can barely tell a train is moving in the neighbourhood unless you happened to look up and catch a glimpse of sleek BEML rakes chugging along the elevated viaduct. Thanks to the sound barriers installed along various stretches, rail grinding of tracks and auto-lubrication of wheels and tracks, Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation (KMRC) has managed to keep the noise in check.The most effective step against noise pollution, however, has been the rail grinding of tracks. The rail grinder was hired from Chennai Metro for Rs 3 crore. Sound inside underground tunnels is also controlled because rail grinding has been done along the 6km tracks from Sector V till Phoolbagan. The rail-grinder machine will be at work when the entire project is completed. In fact, thanks to rail-grinding at regular intervals, East-West Metro will be less noisy than the existing north-south line.Kolkata’s Line 2, when fully operational, will connect Sector V and Howrah Maidan. A truncated 5km stretch in Salt Lake is due to be commissioned next Thursday. This 5km stretch, along with another 4km from Salt Lake Stadium, from where the tracks go underground towards Phoolbagan and go on till the Sealdah crossover, has undergone rail-grinding. The exercise reduces noise, improves riding comfort and enhance longevity of the tracks and rolling stock.“To reduce the noise generated while trains ply on the viaduct and later the underground tunnel, the tracks have been smoothened through this process called ‘rail-grinding,” explained an official.Since a rail-grinder costs more than Rs 30 crore, KMRC imported the rail-grinding equipment from Namma Metro, also known as Bengaluru Metro, and used it to grind the tracks last May. The hiring charge was Rs 3 crore. “A rail-grinding machine evens out the tracks by removing irregularities or corrugation on the surface,” the official said. Along with rail-grinding, auto-lubricating machines have been installed on either side of four major curves to smoothen the tracks. The rakes also have inbuilt auto-lubricants – the more the rakes will run the more effective the auto-lubrication. Each of the five rakes earmarked for the commercial run have travelled more than 3,000km and are, therefore, less noisy now.Some Salt Lake residents have an extra privilege, though. KMRC has installed sound barriers next to ILS Hospital, opposite East-West Metro’s Central Park depot, at DL block, opposite Karunamoyee, Rabindra Bharati University campus at EE Block and near Bidyadhari School . The barriers will stretch 20m-30m along both sides of the viaduct or the superstructure on which the tracks have been laid.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74023587,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-15605,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/smoother-tracks-sound-barriers-muffle-e-w-noise/articleshow/74015710.cms

Madurai: T Kallupatti town panchayat in Madurai district, adjudged the cleanest local body in Swachh Survekshan League 2020 under less than 25,000 population category got two battery operated vehicles for better implementation of the solid waste management system on Friday.

Minister for revenue, IT and disaster management R B Udayakumar, handed over the two vehicles valued at Rs 1.90 lakh each to the town panchayat at a function and said that the local body should strive to maintain its achievement.

Speaking about T Kallupatti bagging the first place in the second quarter results in Swachh Survekshan League, executive officer of T Kallupatti, Chinnasamy Pandian said, “This is at the all India level, and all the first three spots were bagged by local bodies in Tamil Nadu.”

He said that almost 80% of the 4,500 households in T Kallupatti segregated their waste. A total of 43 workers including members of the self-help groups worked relentlessly to keep the locality clean which has around 11,000 people. The wet waste is deposited in the resource recovery park and manure is sold at Rs one a kilogram to local farmers. They use the plastic waste for laying roads by mixing it with tar.

Other wastes are sent to the Ramco cement factory in Virudhunagar. Plastics and dry waste collected are sold to local scrap collector and the members of the SHGs receive incentives around Rs 1000 each, every week.

Pandian said that the new battery vehicles that they had received would help the workers who work from 6 am to do quicker trips around the town panchayat. “Otherwise theyget tired usually by 11 am and we also clean our drains, as the local body does not maintain garbage bins and it is ‘bin free’ local body,” he said.

They have plan to buy more vehicles to sustain the villages cleanliness. “It is a matter of pride to us that our village is the cleanest in the region, even cleaner than the city,” said T Pandiarajan, a local resident.

PANAJI: The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG), in its report for 2017-18, said that the Goa government needs to formulate a proper borrowing-repayment strategy to avoid falling into a debt trap.

While acknowledging Goa’s efforts towards fiscal responsibility, the CAG said 52% of Goa’s outstanding debt is expected to come up for repayment by 2026 which will put a strain on the government.

The CAG report for 2017-18 was tabled in the state legislative assembly on Friday.

While the CAG report noted that Goa’s fiscal deficit stood at 2.29% in 2017-18, it noted that outstanding liabilities of the state increased from Rs 12,695 crore in 2013-14 to Rs 18,552 crore in 2017-18. According to the latest government figures, Goa’s public debt has crossed Rs 20,000 crore.

“The maturity profile of the state debt indicates that the liability of the state to repay the debt during the periods 2018-19, 2019-21 and 2021-23 would be Rs 888 crore, Rs 1,676 crore and Rs 2,126 crore respectively, which may put a strain on the government budget during that period,” the CAG report said.

The report said that loans worth Rs 7,093.41 crore, that is 52% of the total public debt (as on 2017-18) would have to be repaid from 2021 onwards and well into 2025. “Therefore the state government would have to work out a well-thought out borrowing strategy to avoid falling into a debt trap,” the report said.

The CAG report also said that Goa needs to improve its tax to gross state domestic product (GSDP) ratio, which at Rs 6.73% in 2017-18 was much lower than the 14th Finance Commission’s assessment of 8.31%.

The report further says that Goa met two of the three major fiscal targets set under the Goa Fiscal Responsibility Act 2014 (Goa FRBM Act).

“In respect of debt to GSDP ratio, fixed at 25% by the Goa FRBM Act, the current ratio stands marginally higher at 26.4%,” said the CAG.

The state government spent more on capital expenditure than the amount it borrowed, indicating better use of funds and the use of revenue surplus for capital asset formation.

“There is an overall improvement in the ratio of revenue expenditure to capital expenditure, indicating improvement in the quality of expenditure during 2013-18,” said the report.

359,['8/02/2020'],I-T raids on film stars not politically motivated: Minister,"This story is from February 8, 2020

Madurai: Information and publicity minister Kadambur C Raju on Friday said that raids conducted by the income tax (I-T) department at the places of prominent film stars are not politically motivated. Talking to reporters at Kovilpatti in Tuticorin district after taking part in a free bicycle distribution event at a government school, the minister said that the I-T department functions independently.

“I-T department is functioning independently under the Union finance ministry. They don’t raid persons in the cinema industry alone, but also search places of industrialists and persons across ranks when they get any information. Such raids have taken place in the past too,” he said in response to allegations by Congress that the recent I-T raids are politically motivated.

The minister added that when there is a seizure during the I-T searches the department returns it to the people concerned when they produce the proof. Stating that the I-T department has the right to conduct such raids, he added that it is a common practice. Raju asked whether such raids did not take place at the houses of film artists when Congress was in power.

To a question if actor Rajinikanth has extended support to the BJP by justifying CAA, the minister said he cannot comment on his statement and that the actor would be the right person to comment on it.

Raju also said that the government will consider making available special seats and arrangements for differently abled persons in cinemas. His reply was to a query on whether the government would make cinemas inclusive for differently abled people similar to seats reserved for them in buses.

360,['8/02/2020'],Startups: Isaac’s team for collateral-free loan,"This story is from February 8, 2020

Kochi: For startups which have products in the market and are ready to scale, the new scheme announced in the budget to provide 90% of the work order as loan up to a maximum of Rs 10 crore has come as a relief.

Presenting the budget, finance minister T M Thomas Isaac had said that loans would be given at 10% interest rate without asset security for startups who have secured work orders from government/quasi government/major corporates or institutions. If these are purchase orders, money will be given after discounting them.

“This would be of great help for startups like us who have work orders but can’t accept them because there is no capital,” said Vimal Govind, co-founder and CEO of Genrobotics Innovations.

Isaac said Kerala Financial Corporation (KFC) and Kerala State Industrial Development Corporation (KSIDC) will give money across the counter without any collateral security on the recommendation of an expert committee chaired by the IT secretary. Any loss sustained on account of this will be made good by the government, Isaac said.

“This would be hugely beneficial to units in the MSME sector,” said Robin Alex Panicker, venture partner, Unicorn India Ventures.

Govind said they are getting lots of orders from state governments but even banks are not giving them money against work orders.

“Even the 10% interest rate is not much if this proposal can be realised since banks are not willing to risk,” said Govind.

The state government has also proposed a financial assistance up to Rs 1 crore while developing new product prototypes related to sustainable development goals of United Nations. For this, Rs 10 crore has been provided to KFC. An amount of Rs 73.50 crore has been earmarked for Startup Mission in 2020-21.

In the wake of criticism that new companies prefer headquarters in Chennai and Bengaluru since the stamp duty in Kerala for starting and merging the companies is higher when compared to that in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, the state would examine and rationalise the rates, said the finance minister .

Thomas Isaac

KOCHI: The state is planning to formulate comprehensive plans in the local body-level for preventing disasters due to climate change.

While presenting the budget finance minister Thomas Isaac said that such an extensive disaster prevention/response programme at the local-level will be first-of-its-kind in the world.

The training with necessary guidelines for this has been completed. Before finalising the annual plan, draft reports will be prepared, he said.

The core aspect of this report illustrates what should be the preventive actions and precautions to be taken on each ward, based on the lessons learned during the natural disasters in 2018 and 2019, if such an eventuality re-occur. This will be discussed in all grama sabhas. Based on these discussions, at least some projects will be included in the plan. nThe state has earmarked an amount of 1,034 crore for state disaster management department.

Highlighting the plight of Idukki, Isaac said there is a need to retain the district as a region suitable for agriculture and inhabitation.

A proper consensus regarding land utilization should emerge from the grass roots, he said. For regaining the lost nutrients and bio components of agricultural lands, remedial measures will be adopted on the basis of soil testing.

Stating that watershed-based land use planning will be implemented with public participation, he said an amount of 200 crore will be made available from Rebuild Kerala for such an elaborate programme. Local disaster management plan, sanitation and water conservation programmes and tree plantation campaigns have to be connected with this, he added.

KOLKATA: When graphic designer Soumya and school teacher Tulika took their wedding vows on Wednesday night, the groom and the bride signed on another dotted line. The just-married couple pledged their organs on the most important day of their lives.

While many guests were left astounded by the couple’s move, some were inspired to join them in taking the pledge to save lives even after their death. “Stories in the recent past on how some people have gifted lives to the dying, even after their deaths, have moved us. Donating organs is like gifting life to someone who is dying for want of an organ. So we decided to pledge our organs on our D-day,” said the graphic designer from Belgachhia .

In order to make their pledge formal, they had invited members of the Bengal Organ Donation Society (BODS), an NGO, to help them with the formalities. The couple signed on the forms before they made the announcement from the dais. The couple’s move did create a ripple among the odd 350 guests. “While many guests were puzzled, my parents and in-laws lauded our move. In fact, 20 guest pledged their organs as well. We were overwhelmed,” said Soumya.

The wedding dais became a stage for organ-donation campaign for a few minutes. BODS members took the opportunity to brief the guests in the marriage hall in Goabagan on organ donation and why families of brain-dead patients need to consent for the noble cause. “The young couple seemed highly motivated on the issue of organ donation. It is appreciable that they made this special occasion to pledge their organs. By doing so, they have sent a message on organ donation, raising awareness among the guests,” said VM Swamy of BODS.

“We wanted to make this day memorable by doing something for a cause. Even after my death, my organs can promise a new life to seven people,” said Soumya.

Kolkata: BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya and party leader Mukul Roy were detained on Friday afternoon as soon they reached Charu Market in south Kolkata to join a pro-CAA BJP rally. The rally was planned over a 2km stretch from Tollygunge Phanri to Hazra and was scheduled to start at 1pm.

Police started putting up barricades along the stretch much ahead of the rally that was scheduled to start from Tollygunge Phanri at 1pm. Tension had been building up in the area as BJP supporters started gathering at Tollygunge Phanri. BJP supporters scuffled with police as soon as the latter stopped the car carrying the two BJP leaders near Charu Market and told them there was no permission for the rally.

The cops pushed two leaders into apolice van when they defied the police directive and went ahead with the rally programme. “This is undemocratic and unconstitutional,” the BJP national general secretary said on a day when BJP MPs agitated against “murder of democracy in Bengal” outside Parliament. “Police put no restriction on rallies against CAA. But they won’t allow rally in support of CAA,” the leader said. tnn

Kochi: State government has given emphasis on implementing major infrastructural development projects, including the Kochi-Palakkad Hi-tech Industrial Corridor Project, in the budget. It is an extension of the Chennai-Bengaluru Industrial Corridor project. It is expected that works of phase 1 of the project would begin in Palakkad in this financial year. The 160km-long stretch in the state will have six manufacturing clusters.

“The state has allocated a substantial amount for acquiring 2,000 acres in Palakkad. First phase of the project identified in Palakkad would attract a total investment of Rs 10,000 crore and direct employment for 22,000 people,” said Alkesh Kumar Sharma, principal secretary (industries), who is heading the project.

The industrial corridor project seeks to optimize the economic and employment potential by stimulating investments in manufacturing, agro-processing, services and export-oriented units. Integrated manufacturing clusters, which will come along the corridor, will boost the manufacturing activities in sectors, including IT and biotechnology.

“Kerala is implementing the biggest anti-recession package in the country. This will support the state economy during crisis period. It will be ensured that infrastructure facilities, which normally require 25 to 30 years to materialize, will be readied in Kerala within a span of three years,” said the finance minister in his budget speech.

NEW DELHI: On the second day of Delhi Development Authority’s public hearing regarding the land-use change of seven plots that are part of the Central Vista , many eminent architects and urban planners put forward their suggestions and objections.

“This is a legal heritage area as per the master plan for Delhi,” said AGK Menon, a consultant with INTACH. “I asked where are the studies that justify the change of land use,” added the urban planner and the conservationist.

“National assets like Vigyan Bhawan, National Museum and National Archives will be broken down. Few bureaucrats and politicians can’t decide this. These are of national importance,” he added.

Shamit Manchanda, chairman of the northern chapter of The Indian Institute of Architects, said that it was a public hearing and not public consultation or discussion. It was made clear by DDA’s board of inquiry that respondents would not get any answers, he added.

“No one is against the project, but it should be done after impact studies.”

“There is talk of the Parliament and North and South Blocks not being structurally safe. They can’t be retrofitted and hence will be converted into museums. But if the buildings are unsafe for MPs, how can they be safe for the common man?” asked Manchanda.

“The Central Vista land belongs to the people, the government doesn’t own it. They are only custodians of it,” said Raka Chakravarty, former member of Delhi Urban Art Commission. She added that with the change in land-use, government offices will replace existing museums, archives and art galleries, which are repositories of national treasures.

“What is the compensatory recreational space being offered to the citizens while undertaking this development? Decorative greens in front of government offices are no substitute,” she said.

“We know DDA has turned this hearing into a farce. We are here so that we can tell the apex court that we have followed the due process and our pleas for sanity have fallen on deaf ears,” said Rajiv Kakria, convener, “Save Our City” campaign.

CAG said that Goa does not have a comprehensive and holistic municipal solid waste management policy.

CAG said that the action plan of January 2017 which was converted into the state’s holistic policy on solid waste management had its own drawbacks. CAG said that the preparation and submission of new solid waste management policy by the consultant had already been delayed by 10 months.

The methodologies adopted by urban local bodies to determine the quantum of waste generated was neither uniform nor did these conform to be procedures prescribed in the municipal solid waste management manual 2016.

None of the 191 village panchayats furnished waste management data to any state government agency during the last five years.

As a result, the state government has no data on waste generated, collected and disposed of by the village panchayats during the last five years.

CAG wants the government to draw a roadmap for establishment of common waste treatment and disposal facilities for bio-medical and hazardous wastes.

CAG said only six of 14 urban bodies had landfill sites which were not in use either due to poor maintenance or dumping of mixed waste. Despite an expenditure of Rs 11.2 crore, four dump sites could not be rehabilitated effectively. The rehabilitation of six already exhausted dump sites had not been taken up.

Goa CM Pramod Sawant

PANAJI: Stating that a sizeable quantity of crop get destroyed by wild animals, chief minister Pramod Sawant said the government will reconsider the old proposal to declare some wild animals vermin.

“There was an attempt to declare some wild animals as vermin, but it didn’t materialise. A lot of crops get destroyed and therefore, we will look into the matter again,” Sawant said.

He was replying to a ‘Calling Attention” motion moved by Sanguem MLA Prasad Gaonkar who spoke about damages suffered by farmers in his constituency owing to attacks by wild animals.

Talking about the measures taken by his government to minimise farmer losses, he said a provision has been made to grow fruit-bearing trees deep inside the forests.

“We need to take precautions. Forest boundaries need to be finalised. The areas must be fenced so the animals can’t enter villages. We will take whatever precautions that needs to be taken,” he said.

He also said people must realise that wild animals enter human habitat when their food sources are depleted. At times, they could be disturbed in their natural environment, Sawant said.

Kolhapur: Civic chief Mallinath Kalshetti on Friday issued show-cause notice to 245 staff of Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) for arriving late to work.

On Friday morning, Kalshetti along with his deputies visited the offices of various departments within the KMC main building and the Shivaji Market divisional ward office. He found out that the attendance of employees who reported late through the biometric attendance system.

He issued the show-cause notices and has sought immediate reply from the staff to avoid further action.

“We have a fixed time for the staff to arrive at their respective offices. The attendance system has been installed to know the accurate time of arrival. Citizens are kept waiting for a long time. I have asked the management department to mark the leaves of the staff arriving ten minutes late in the last four days,” said Kalshetti.

Earlier, the attendance would be manually recorded in a register. The staff was supposed to write the timing of their arrival; however, many times, despite late arrival, the attendance would be recorded at 10am. The introduction of the biometric system, which faced some opposition, has changed this.

The officials said that 245 employees will have to take cut in their salaries if they continue to arrive late. The officials said that none of these employees told the reason for their arrival to the heads of their respective departments.

Kolhapur: NCP corporator Sandip Kawale and BJP’s Vijaysinha Khade-Patil filed the nomination for the post of the standing committee chairman on Friday.

All the senior corporators of the Congress and the NCP were in attendance when Kawale was filing his nominations. “It will help to keep the flock together till the last moment,” said one of the corporators.

Kawale is likely to win the election of the standing committee chairman, as the Congress-NCP alliance has a clear majority in the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) with 16 members. Kawale’s nomination by the party was announced by NCP’s R K Powar. The corporator from Rajarampuri is considered to have close ties with the top brass of both the Congress and the NCP. Kawale is said to have a stronghold in the area, a factor that played into the advantage of the Congress during the assembly elections last year.

The Congress corporators have vowed to vote for the NCP nominee. However, Kawale has to ensure that none from the NCP defects at the last moment. A couple of years ago, the NCP candidate had faced defeat in the standing committee chairman’s election after two of its corporators voted for the BJP nominee. According to party sources, Kawale will serve as the chairman for four months as the NCP leaders want to give a chance to another corporator before the 5-year tenure of the civic body ends this year.

The opposition was not sure as to whom they would nominate for the chairman’s post. However, after long discussions with the top brass of the BJP and the Tararani Aghadi, Khade-Patil’s nomination was finalised. Khade-Patil is considered to be close to BJP state president Chandrakant Patil.

The Congress-NCP supported Pratidnya Nille-Utture’s (Shiv Sena) nomination for committee chairman’s post. This means either Sena corporators vote in support of their candidate or stay absent during the mayoral elctions on Monday.

Vijayawada: In a major development, the night food court at Indira Gandhi Municipal Stadium in the city is about to get a major facelift. The Vijayawada Municipal Corporation ( VMC ) is gearing up to develop the food court as an ‘Eat Street’ of international standards to attract tourists.

The VMC, which is focused on city development works, is giving top priority for street furniture projects. The civic body, which developed modern bus shelters, has now started streamlining hawkers’ zones and street vendors in the city. The project is estimated to cost Rs 6 crore.

The night food court on the main road adjacent to IGMS stadium is among the major attractions in the city, with over 150 street vendors selling a variety of food products.

In December 2014, the Telugu Desam Party-led government had started the food court with the supervision of city police and the VMC. Thousands of citizen visit the food court every day and it is a major hangout for the city’s youth as well.

The lack of proper amenities and poor infrastructure have become a major concern for tourists and residents who visit the food court. Taking cognizance of their worries, VMC authorities proposed to develop the food court as eat street to attract tourists. “We have decided to give a new look to the street and develop a huge footpath on both sides of the road to facilitate food trucks and stalls. Hygienic mobile restrooms will also be arranged at multiple locations,” said VMC chief Prasanna Venkatesh. He added: “We have submitted the pre-bids and are awaiting the final approval of designs so that we can call for tenders.”

The civic body assured that stalls would be allocated for the current stall owners who have been having their business in the stadium for years.

Stall owners welcomed the VMC’s proposal and said that they supported the development works. “VMC authorities conducted a meeting with us and gave a presentation on the development works. We are happy that the government has come forward to develop the food court, on par with international standards. Officials assured us that they would allocate stalls to us. It is a great opportunity for us to serve food at an eat street of international standards,” said Sk Rabbani, a stall owner at the food court.

Panaji: The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) has recommended “proper exhaustive investigation by the CID or the CBI” after audit indicated “widespread misappropriation of funds” by the departments of revenue, registration and transport. In the meantime, the CAG has recommended that FIRs be lodged and action initiated in the cases covered in the audit.

The CAG, in its report for 2017-18, found that the directorate of account’s Internal Inspection Cell had not conducted internal audits of some offices between 2013-18 and in others where audit was conducted, they could not detect misappropriation of government money.

It was also found that the cashier in the office of the North Goa collector deleted 362 computer generated receipts valued at Rs 10.7 lakh, the cashier in the office of the South Goa Collector deleted computer generated receipts valued at Rs 13 lakh, and the office of the mamlatdar Salcete deleted receipts amounting to Rs 1.2 lakh collected through mutation fees where misappropriation couldn’t be ruled out. The cashiers in all three cases were placed under suspension.

In the transport department, too, the CAG found that computerised receipts had been deleted.

The audit also found that cashiers responsible for handling cash in four offices were suspected to have misappropriated money to the tune of Rs 3.3 lakh.

This was found in the office of the mamlatdar in Salcete where receipts towards purchase price by the mundkar/tenanted property owners were not found entered in the cash books for the year 2016-17, in the office of the mamlatdar in Bardez where entries for fees for issue of duplicate electoral photo identity card, certified copies of electoral rolls, security deposits for panchayat elections could not be seen in the cash book, and in the office of the sub-divisional officer Margao where money collected towards fees for certification of documents and fees under RTI Act were not entered in the cash book during 2014-18.

In the registration department’s office of the civil registrar cum sub registrar, Mapusa, CAG found non-completion of cash book entries and short amount deposited into the government treasury.

Financial indiscipline was also seen in the transport department. “Despite having full contingent of accounting staff, non-writing of cash book on daily basis and non-verification of cash balances by the director of transport during the entire period of 2013-17, indicated slackness on the part of the department in handling the cash. It is a serious issue involving the safety of the government revenue and needs immediate attention at the apex level,” the audit report stated.

383,['8/02/2020'],Civic body fails to curb use of plastic carry bags,"This story is from February 8, 2020

Kolhapur: The civic administration has seized over 8kg plastic carry bags since Tuesday and collected Rs 1.05 lakh in fine from traders, jewellers and roadside vendors for flouting the plastic ban norm.

The action against those flouting the plastic ban norm comes in the wake of the directions issued by state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray. He spoke to the municipal commissioners across the state about the implementation of the plastic ban. The plastic carry bags less than 50 microns in size have been banned.

Kilograms of plastic is recovered from the open spaces and nullahs during the drive undertaken by the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) on Sunday. Municipal commissioner Mallinath Kalshetti has set March 31 as the deadline to make the city ‘plastic-free’—a tag which the city is unlikely to get in the near future given the return of the plastic bags in the markets.

One of the officials of the sanitation department said that the action against the traders was random and that no plan of action had been outlined to deter traders and vendors from dispensing plastic carry bags.

“We have learnt that the plastic carry bags are clandestinely supplied from outside the city. We do not have jurisdiction over the areas where the plastic carry bags are manufactured. We have learnt that a huge amount of carry bags are supplied from the nearby Gandhinagar market. We have asked the higher authorities to talk to the district administration to stop the production of the plastic carry bags,” said the official.

According to some officials, the equipment used to manufacture other plastic material were also used for manufacturing plastic carry bags. The officials said that such equipment should be confiscated.

The traders claimed that the consumers asked for plastic carry bags and if they could not provide for it, consumers tend to stop buying from them and it ate into their business. “Since the ban, we have not caught any repeat offenders. As per law, the repeat offenders have to be booked under environmental laws, besides having to pay a fine,” said the official.

Environmental expert Uday Gaikwad is also of the view that the supply chain of the plastic carry bags should be snapped. “I have witnessed that the carry bags are provided through a well-developed chain to the vendors in the city. We don’t know where the plastic carry bags are produced. What we do know is that they are supplied from the nearby markets in Gandhinagar,” he said.

“The alternatives to plastic carry bags have not yet been made available at cheaper rates. Consumers should be made more aware. If they refuse, then the use of plastic carry bags will definitely come down. Joint efforts must be taken by several agencies for effective clampdown on the use of plastic carry bags,” said Gaikwad.

Kolhapur: The civic body has started putting patchwork on damaged roads as a temporary measure due to delay in the funds that is to be released by the state government.

The Kolhapur Municipal Corporation has completed construction of 16 major roads in the city through its own fund of Rs 1.72 crore. Paschim Maharashtra Devasthan Samiti has decided to grant Rs 5.5 crore for the construction of the roads surrounding Mahalaxmi temple. The work has not begun as the process to appoint the contractors is yet to be initiated.

The KMC has submitted a proposal of Rs 178 crore to reconstruct over 200 km of the roads which were badly damaged by the floods last year.

Of the 81 wards, the roads of 33 wards have been completely damaged. The traders and activists are demanding immediate restoration of the roads as it has affected the turnout of visitors in the city and also cause difficulties for the regular commuters.

Netradip Sarnobat, chief city engineer of KMC said, “We expect the approval of our proposal soon. We have been told that in the first phase Rs 100 crore will be sanctioned. However, it will take some months. Till then we have initiated patchwork with the stones and tar which will stop further deterioration of the roads. Once the funds are released, we will complete the construction before next monsoon.”

Meanwhile, district guardian minister Satej Patil has announced that the emergency funds of Rs 4 crore will be released through the district planning and development council (DPDC). Patil has asked the civic officials to provide the report of the roads that are to be built urgently. The funds will be transferred to the KMC and the civic administration is likely to start the work through its public works department (PWD).

“We also expect some funds to be allocated in the KMC’s budget, that will be presented next month. Our priority will be restoring the roads which have regular traffic,” added Sarnobat.

Thrissur: The state budget presented by T M Thomas Isaac has evoked mixed reactions in Thrissur . Projects like launching of an agro-processing park and the scheme for doubling of income from Kole wetlands have been welcomed. However, opposition leaders decried the absence of special packages for the agriculture sector in the district, though it has a very large paddy cultivation area.

Agriculture minister V S Sunil Kumar said the agro-processing park will be located at Kannara near Peeshi and will be implemented through KIFB. In these parks, units producing wine from banana will be set up. The minister said that Rs 2 crore has been earmarked for doubling of income from Kole wetlands, through Kole double.

Emphasising that the budget was focussed on the development of infrastructure as well as on launching welfare projects, minister A C Moideen said that the budget has earmarked Rs 10 crore for SILK and Rs 7.5 crore for SIFL. The minister said the budget has also earmarked significant funds for several road development projects in the district.

Government sources pointed out that being the cultural capital of Kerala, Thrissur will stand to gain significantly from Rs 150 crore earmarked for various projects and institutions in the cultural field.

Out of the Rs 422 crore earmarked for the animal husbandry sector, Rs 75 crore will be allocated for the Kerala Veterinary and Animal Sciences University. Kerala Lalithakala Akademi will receive Rs 7 crore in the ensuing financial year. Theatre activists have welcomed the announcement that Rs 3 crore has been earmarked for promoting amateur plays.

However Congress MLA Anil Akkara, alleged that hopes were high that a major cancer care facility like the RCC will be set up at Thrissur Medical College Hospital. However, the budget shattered this hope.

VIJAYAWADA: Two miscreants broke into a house and robbed a woman at knife-point at Tiruvuru town in Krishna district on Thursday.

The complainant was identified Shohan Devi (30) and her husband Gopal Singh. According to Tiruvuru CI Veeraiah Gowda, the incident happened at night when two persons barged into their house when she was alone and stole around Rs 57,000 cash at knife-point.

Soon after they fled, the woman called up the police, who reached the spot and inquired into the matter. “We have identified the accused and it is only a matter of time before we arrest them. The woman is safe but it is a clear case of robbery ,” Gowda told TOI.

Devi and Gopal run a cellphone shop in the town.

The police said that the accused were known to the victim and that they had conducted a recce hoping for a bigger booty. However, after the woman confessed that all they have is fake jewellery and cash, disgruntled, they left with the cash. The police registered a case under section 392 of IPC (robbery) at Tiruvuru police station.

EcoBrane combats the turbidity problem faced by armed forces.

LUCKNOW: Soldiers deployed in remote places hardly ever have easy access to clean drinking water. Those manning posts at high altitudes are often compelled to carry bottles of drinking water along with other supplies.

The inconveniences may end for the men in fatigues if technocrats from the Slovak Republic , working closely with Indian counterparts in Lucknow, have their way. The team of experts seems to have developed a filter made of nano fibres that can provide clean drinking water without electricity.

EcoBrane, as this non-woven cloth filter is called, also combats the problem of turbidity that the armed forces face during wars and even otherwise. On display at DefExpo 2020, the unique filter demonstrated its ability to contain contamination in all forms, be it solid particles, allergens or bacteria.

Rakesh Bhagwandas Taurani, president and CEO of Indian Chamber of Commerce and Culture in the Slovak Republic, said an informal discussion on the hardships faced by the Indian Army spawned the idea of a cloth filter.

Vinay Agarwal, chairman of Lucknow-based Bharat Solutions that will manufacture the cloth filter, said it could solve drinking water problem in drought-prone areas. “People can fetch water from anywhere, ponds or lakes, and filter it using this cloth.”

Czech firm NAFIGATE Corporation and Bharat Solutions inked an agreement on December 29, 2019, according to which the technology from Slovakia will be transferred to India with the local company as exclusive manufacturer.

The best for the last: the unique filter is estimated to cost Rs 1,200 apiece and can serve 500 litre of water before the cloth needs a wash. Disposal will be required after 1,000 litre of filtration.

Wasana Promkasikorn takes a bite of her favourite pasta and noodles on Friday

KOLKATA: Pasta and pad Thai noodles have replaced rice and paneer curry on the hospital platter for the 23-year-old Thai woman who gave birth to a boy onboard a Qatar Airways flight on Tuesday and has been in Charnock Hospital since then. The woman, Wasana Promkasikorn , reportedly refused food for the first two days, prompting the hospital authorities to change her menu.

“For the first two days, she ate almost nothing and was returning the full platter every time. Initially, we thought she was not hungry. But later we realized that she was finding it difficult to eat the food we were serving. Hence, the hospital cook spoke with her to understand her preferences. She was initially hesitant, but later said that she would love some pasta and noodles. Now, we are serving that,” a senior official of the hospital said.

Promkasikorn, a single mother, who was travelling to her home in Bangkok from Oman, without disclosing her pregnancy to Qatar Airways last Tuesday, had given birth to a boy 35,000 feet up in the air. She was helped by five crew members and a woman doctor. The flight was diverted to Kolkata and she was de-boarded and admitted to Charnock Hospital on VIP Road. Doctors said the mother and child were fine.

“She is scheduled to fly back to Bangkok from Kolkata on February 12 and the Thai consulate has requested us to escort the mother and child to the airport on that day,” the official said.

A senior official of the Thai consulate visited Promkasikorn at the hospital on Friday to check on the duo and assured the hospital that they will take complete responsibility of their treatment and stay in the hospital.

“The consulate official explained to her the reason behind the extended stay at the hospital even though the mother and baby are clinically fit to be discharged. She understands the situation and now that she is getting her favourite food, she seems happy,” the hospital official said.

Kolhapur: District superintendent agriculture officer, Kolhapur , Dyandev Wakure said on Friday that the temperature fluctuations in the region was likely to affect the growth of fruit crops, especially mango and cashews.

According to him, the drop in the maximum and minimum temperatures in the region could give way to fungal growth in the mango and cashew crops, which were cultivated in around 18,000 hectare of area in the district.

“The drop in temperatures is conducive for field crops like wheat and jowar but not for fruit crops. Around 40,00 hectare of area in the disrict is under the cultivation of field crops. Rabi season, which starts from October and concludes in March, did not have much of an impact on the field crops,” said Wakure.

Sugarcane, which occupies around 1.5 lakh hectare farmland in the district, has not seen much of an impact as the crushing season has already began.

Wakure attributed the variation in the temperature to global climate change in recent times. “The shift in temperature is quite unpredictable in recent times, which is a direct byproduct of climate change,” he said.

There was a massive drop in the maximum temperature in the region this week. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the maximum temperature in the city dropped by 5 degrees celsius. On Friday, the maximum temperature was 27.1 degrees celsius.

The minimum temperature dropped by a notch to touch 15.5 degrees celsius on Friday—one of the lowest temperatures this season.

In its forecast, the IMD has stated that the minimum temperature would hover around 15 degrees celsius over the region during the weekend. The maximum temperature is likely to notch up to 32 degrees celsius.

The weather forecast report from the Regional Meteorological Centre, Mumbai, stated that the weather was dry on Friday and that there was no major shift in the minimum temperature over the region. The minimum temperatures were below normal over Kutch, above normal over Madhya Maharashtra and Marathwada and normal for the rest of the region.

CLEARED SKHER

Kolhapur: BJP once again won the elections to the posts of mayor and deputy mayor in the Sangli-Miraj-Kupwad municipal corporation, though it was facing internal strife.

BJP’s Geeta Sutar was elected the new mayor and unexpectedly got two additional votes. She defeated NCP’s Varsha Nimbalkar. Sutar got 43 votes as against 35 by Nimbalkar. Anand Devmane of BJP was elected deputy mayor. He defeated Yogendra Thorat of Congress.

BJP office-bearers heaved a sigh of relief after winning the election as the NCP-Congress had tried its best to ensure the BJP does not win the polls.

The differences within the BJP unit had made the contest interesting. As many as ten BJP corporators were not happy with the choice of candidates and stayed away from party meetings. Ten corporators did not join the others in Goa, where they were taken ahead of the voting.

State BJP president Chandrakant Patil, however, succeeded in convincing the rebel corporators. BJP also got support of its allies to win the election for the second consecutive time. BJP also has its leaders at the top positions in the Sangli zilla parishad.

393,['8/02/2020'],"DRDO Daksh Scouts to defuse IEDs, intrude terror hideouts","This story is from February 8, 2020

The small robotic vehicle, code named ‘DAKSH Scout’ weighs less than 20kg and can be carried as a backpack.

LUCKNOW: Come April and Indian Army will get a remote-controlled robotic surveillance vehicle that can sneak into hideouts of terrorists, transmit live feed of their activities and defuse improvised explosive devices (IED) planted in the residential or commercial areas.

Developed by Research and Development Establishment (Engineers) of Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), the small robotic vehicle, code named ‘DAKSH Scout’, weighs less than 20kg and can be carried as a backpack.

The vehicle is on display in the ongoing DefExpo-2020 at Vrindavan Yojana.

An official said, “The device can be controlled through remote 200 metres away. Its modular flipper-based design enables it to climb stairs and optional water jet disruptor can defuse IEDs, thus reducing direct involvement of security personnel , which means lesser casualties.”

“With four on-board cameras that are used for real-time video transmission, the device is portable and can be deployed in cross-country areas and spaces like culverts,” he added.

“If terrorists are hiding in a building and have taken hostages, defence personnel can steer DAKSH scout through remote control into the hideout. The live feed can give them information about the number of terrorists and hostages in the building and their locations. This will help in planning counter terror operation. Similarly, if an IED has been planted in a building or a market place, DAKSH scout can defuse it,” he said.

Like DAKSH scout, another device developed by DRDO is Remote Controlled Weapon Station (RCWS).

On display at Defence Expo, the weapon station has been specially designed for ARJUN MBT Mk- 1A (tank). An improvised version of manually operated air defence gun, RCWS will be handed over to Army by April.

“It enables soldiers to aim and fire at ground or aerial target from safe interiors of battle tank without exposing themselves, thus reducing possibilities of a casualty in operation. The operator can control the gun and sight target from ‘operating console’ and ‘joystick’ from inside the gun turret,” the officer said.

“RCWS also has automatic firing system, two axis stabilisation, day camera, night vision devices and automatic target tracking. The operator can automatically load the gun and fire through the station,” he said.

“RCWS was designed to remotely operate a 12.7mm machine gun,” he added.

394,['8/02/2020'],29 fake job agencies may sour your Gulf dream,"Representative image

HYDERABAD: The ministry of external affairs (MEA) has warned people looking out for jobs in Gulf and other regions to be wary about fake agents and agencies. MEA said 29 illegal agencies were operating in both Telangana and Andhra Pradesh . Maharashtra and Punjab top the list of fake agencies at 86 each with Delhi trailing them closely at 85.While 15 such agencies are active in Telangana, 14 are operating in AP. Some of them are individuals, while most others are travel agencies, it said. “It is surprising that 25% of the agents have not recruited anyone for jobs abroad. Yet, they are surviving,” Emigrants Welfare Forum president M Bheem Reddy told TOI. He said he got the details from MEA after he filed an RTI query.Interestingly, hundreds of licensed recruiting agencies registered with MEA claimed that they did not send a single individual for jobs abroad in the last three years. “This only confirms that illegal ways are being adopted to take gullible persons abroad, especially to the Gulf,” a migrants rights activist said.Workers are taken on visit visas with a promise that they would be given a work permit on their arrival in Gulf. In several instances, however, such workers neither get jobs nor salaries. They also do not get the work permit, thus making their stay illegal. While huge amounts ranging from Rs 1.5 lakh to Rs 4 lakh are paid to the agents to take them abroad, workers often end up doing odd jobs and getting far lesser wages.In 2017, as many as 320 agents had reported ‘nil’ recruitments. The next year, 402 agents had shown they did not recruit anyone. Similarly, 414 agents had shown nil recruitment in 2019. The agencies have to register with the eMigrate system of MEA and follow the norms in recruiting people for jobs abroad.But, these procedures are given a miss by illegal agents, who operate in their own style. They lure prospective customers, take them to the Gulf and leave them in dire straits.Just a fortnight ago, seven youngsters from Telangana were taken to Dubai with a promise that they would land jobs for themselves. “We are stranded here without any job,” one of the duped youngster told TOI from Dubai. He said each of them paid the agent Rs 1.5 lakh to Rs 3 lakh. “The agent, however, is not responding to our calls,” he rued.It also becomes difficult for those who had gone there to come back to India. Once they land in the Gulf countries, their passports are taken away by local agent or employer. The illegal agents make them believe that they will get a job visa after taking them there on a visit visa.Women are forced to work as domestic helps once they land there though they are promised jobs in beauty parlours. Two sisters from Nizamabad , who were stuck in Muscat were rescued recently. MBT leader and social worker Amjed Ullah Khan said Shaheen Begum and Asma Begum were promised a salary of Rs 25,000 and sent to Oman by a travel agency.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74019932,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-159550,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/29-fake-job-agencies-may-sour-your-gulf-dream/articleshow/74015896.cms
395,['8/02/2020'],"Karnataka: Opportunists, defectors preferred over loyalists in modern-day politics","This story is from February 8, 2020

State BJP president Nalin Kumar Kateel with new ministers KC Narayanagowda and Shivaram Hebbar on Thursday.

BENGALURU: With 10 party-hoppers walking away with ministerial posts and at least three more tipped to be inducted into BS Yediyurappa’s cabinet when it is expanded the next time, loyal BJP legislators, who toiled to build the party, are cursing their fate.

Over a dozen MLAs, including the likes of S Angara, Haladi Srinivas Shetty, Appachu Ranjan, Anand Mamani, Abhay Patil and Sunil Kumar have been BJP’s war horses for decades and have won assembly terms at least thrice, but were denied ministerial berths. Party functionaries wonder if loyalty, honesty and efficiency are relevant any more in modern-day politics.

“Shetty and Angara are five and six-time MLAs respectively and are extremely popular and honest. Besides Angara is an SC. It should be a matter of honour and pride for any CM to have them in the cabinet, but unfortunately nobody is bothered,” said a state BJP functionary.

Though the BJP has been claiming political compulsions and circumstances for handing defectors ministerial posts, the trend of rewarding “loud mouths” and turncoats is becoming ominous.

And it’s not just with the BJP. Congress and JD(S) too have many loyal and seasoned MLAs who have got the short end of the stick. Former Lok Sabha opposition leader Mallikarjun M Kharge immediately springs to mind, but there are others such as CS Nadagouda, former MLA of Muddebehial, Hanur MLA Narendra, Bhadravathi MLA BC Sangamesh, Indi MLA Yeshwanthrayagouda Patil and R Raghumurthy of Challakere.

“Political equations have changed. Things like loyalty, track record and efficiency are rarely considered while selecting ministers. It is unfortunate,” said five-time MLA Nadagouda, who served as minister for only two years in the Veerendra Patil government.

In JD(S) too, MLAs like HK Kumaraswamy, KM Shivalingegowda and AT Ramaswamy who are excellent parliamentarians and have a reputation of being clean, have been neglected while mediocre and part-time politicians enjoyed power whenever the party was in office.

“It hurts to see undeserving people get rewards. People who lobby, indulge in blackmail and groupism are the ones who enjoy power nowadays,” said state JD(S) president HK Kumaraswamy.

Kumaraswamy, a six-time MLA and has never been made a minister despite being the lone MLA from SC community who has been winning election after election.

Senior Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge has been seen by many Congress leaders as someone who paid a price for his loyalty and obedience in 2013. Many leaders think he was handed a raw deal when the central leadership chose Siddaramaiah, who joined from the JD(S), as chief minister.

“Had Kharge been a little assertive, aggressive and good at lobbying, it would have been difficult for Siddaramaiah to replace him. Kharge thought his loyalty and efficiency would bring him reward, but did not happen,” said a senior Congress functionary.

Kharge should have learnt from G Parameshwara on how to strike a bargain with the high command, the functionary said. “Parameshwara made enough noise to ensure he was heard whenever necessary to get his share of power,” the Congressman said.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Criticizing the central government for not giving due consideration to expatriates, state finance minister T M Thomas Isaac enhanced the 2020-21 outlay for Norka ( Non-Resident Keralites Affairs) department to Rs 90 crore from Rs 30 crore earmarked in 2019-20. Top priority would be given to rehabilitation of returnees and promotion of foreign employment , he said in his budget speech.

“The changes effected in the Union Budget on the definition of expatriates and taxes imposed on them is a huge setback for us. The central government is not ready to give due consideration to expatriates, whose contribution is critical for compensating the trade deficit of the country,” he said.

Pointing out that Norka welfare fund membership rose to 4.7 lakh from 1.1 lakh during the LDF government’s tenure, Isaac said the previous government had spent just

Rs 68 crore for the welfare of NRKs, while the present government has already spent Rs 152 crore. “An amount of Rs 36 crore was additionally sanctioned in the previous year. In the five-year tenure of the previous government, the allocation to Norka was only Rs 82 crore,” he said.

Giving top priority to the rehabilitation of expat returnees, Isaac earmarked Rs 27 crore for Santhwanam scheme, while the annual family income limit for availing benefits under the scheme was raised to

Rs 1.5 lakh from Rs 1 lakh. An amount of Rs 9 crore has been allocated for Pravasi Kshema Nidhi, while Rs 18 crore was allocated for giving interest subsidy for four years and capital subsidy to small-scale entrepreneurs.

Under ‘Care Home’ or ‘Garden of Life Project’, a scheme meant for ensuring the usually-available facilities to senior members of Malayali families settled abroad, Norka will provide five acres to the company formed for this purpose, as the share of the first unit, Isaac said. An amount of Rs 2 crore has been earmarked for Norka Business Facilitation Centre.

Intended to promote foreign employment, Rs 1 crore has been set apart for comprehensive revision of job portal with the help of an expert team, and Rs 2 crore for technical enrichment.

Thiruvananthapuram: The budget proposed to plug loopholes in Kerala Education Rules ( KER ) so that the practice of aided school managers making unjustifiable appointment of teachers is curbed.

Finance minister T M Thomas Isaac said the government wants the aided school management to stop the practice of misinterpreting the KER rules to make room for appointment of new teachers. “17,614 new posts were created during this government’s tenure. It was sanctioned after intense deliberations and detailed examination. However, government aided schools created 18,119 posts without following these procedures. 13,255 teachers continue to be in the protected category. With the implementation of Right to Education Act, the teacher-student ratio was reduced from 45 students to 30 per teacher in lower primary schools and to 35 students in upper primary schools. It was interpreted that even if there is one student above this ratio, new posts could be created. At the sub-district-level if the AEO approved, posts were created. Many complaints were received on creation of such posts and they will have to be necessarily examined. The situation of creating a new post even if the student ratio exceeds by even one student will have to change. New posts should be created only with concurrence of the government. KER will be amended accordingly,” Isaac said.

The minister also announced in the budget that government would issue an order before March for the creation of 1,000 posts in higher education institutions. This comes as a result of the government’s recent decision to adopt the 16 hours per week teaching criteria.

“It is necessary to sanction new courses in the higher education sector. For that, a committee chaired by the secretary, higher education, will be assigned to scrutinize the applications received from colleges. We intend to sanction a total of 60 courses. Eligible colleges will be selected based on certain criteria,” he said.

A programme for the renovation of laboratories in all government colleges will be implemented in 2020-21. Each college will have to prepare and submit special proposals for this. The amount required for this will be made available from the major infrastructure head.

The higher education council will determine the best three departments in universities in the science, arts & literature and social studies domains, and special awards will be provided for its development. Necessary posts and fund for infrastructure development will be provided. An amount of Rs 20 crore is specially earmarked for this. The higher education council itself will select researchers for the Kairali Research Award.

The outlay for technical education is Rs 210 crore.

Representative image

HYDERABAD: The vigilance wing of Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) will conduct fresh raids on water thieves and press criminal charges against them from March first week as the board’s Voluntary Disclosure Scheme, ( VDS ), that was implemented on November 22 last year for a period of 90 days for regularising illegal water connections, is set to come to an end.

Over 30,000 consumers regularised illegal water connections after announcement of VDS and the board is expecting another 20,000 consumers to utilise the scheme. Beyond the VDS period, the water board will be levying hefty penalties.

Those caught drawing water illegally beyond the moratorium period will have to pay double connection charges, water bill for three years and service charges of Rs 300, failing which criminal charges could be pressed. Consumers may also be imprisoned for up to five years. “The vigilance wing will be strengthened with additional police force,” sources said.

Kochi: Finance minister T M Thomas Isaac announced a host of schemes for agri and horticulture sector, including ‘Jeevani - Our Agriculture, Our Health’. This scheme aims at encouraging backyard farming. An amount of Rs 18 crore is earmarked for this. In addition to this, Rs 7 crore is earmarked to Vegetable and Fruit Promotion Council Keralam (VFPCK) for vegetable sector. Three agencies, namely local government institutions, VFPCK and agriculture department, will invest a total amount of at least Rs 500 crore in the vegetable sector. Self-sufficiency can be achieved substantially if co-ordination is ensured. An amount of Rs 3 crore is earmarked for pineapple processing centre at Vazhakkulam. This centre and agro park at Thrissur will have facilities for making wines from fruits.

He also announced a procurement plan for surplus production of small scale fruits and vegetables after domestic consumption in a single platform. An electronic platform, modelled on Uber, has been developed by Kerala development innovation strategy council (K-DISC) for this purpose. Farmers, co-operative societies, banks, other producers, large and small-scale merchants and consumers are being brought together in a network on this platform. Also, as part of green initiatives, there is a campaign for planting one crore saplings of fruit bearing trees each year for a decade. The expenditure for this will be around Rs 54 crore each year. This is expected to create an additional income of Rs 50,000 crore in the state within 10 years.

The state observes the 50th year of land reforms, the finance minister should have announced a strong package for integrated farming which would help those holding small farmlands. “There’s a criticism that small land tufts are not profitable and hence, Kerala has not been able to sustain its agricultural practices. The land reforms was a social revolution while integrated farming could be the advent of technological revolution in agriculture. This is important in the backdrop of rising concerns of climate change,” said K G Padmakumar, director, International research and training centre for below sea-level farming, Alappuzha.

The minister said that the integrated rice park announced last year will commence operation in 2020-21. The detailed project report (DPR) for two rice parks under industries department is ready. An amount of Rs 20 crore is earmarked. The first phase of rubber park will be established in the 500-acre land remaining after the requirement of Newsprint Factory. As the transport connectivity, water connection and electric connection are already available, operation of the park could be commenced in 2020-21 itself. “The announcement of the special directorate for plantations in Kerala is welcome. This will solve lot of our issues as it will act as a one-point coordination centre. As for rubber park, we have been discussing for some time. We have to wait and see once how it will pan out because questions like how are we going to market the rubber products will have to be addressed,” said B K Ajith, secretary, association of planters of Kerala.

An amount of Rs 118 crore is earmarked for paddy cultivation. Agriculture department will provide Rs 5,500 as subsidy per hectare.

402,['8/02/2020'],No big-bang proposals to transform economy,"This story is from February 8, 2020

By : Rudra Sensarma

KOCHI: Kerala finance minister T M Thomas Isaac would not like this comparison but his budget like the recent Union Budget has a lot of incremental changes but no big-bang proposals that can transform the economy .

The state’s GDP grew by 7.5% in 2018-19 indicating that the economy has been resilient to the demonetization and flood related shocks. Manufacturing sector grew by 8.8% and if these trends have continued in 2019-20 then it is a big surprise why this sharp uptick in economic activity has not helped the fiscal situation.

While fiscal deficit has been held at 3% of GDP, revenue deficit that shows the excess of current spending (like salaries, pensions and interest) over current expense has increased to 2% of GDP in the current year. The next year’s projected figure of 1.55% is higher than last year’s budget estimate of 1%. This shows that the state continues to prioritize current expenditure over capital spending which is not going to help the worsening debt situation. Kerala now has the distinction of having the joint (with West Bengal) second highest debt as a percentage of income (the highest being Punjab) among all states. Interest payments as a percentage of revenue receipts is higher than the all India average.

One can understand that a pre-election year budget is hardly a time for fiscal prudence but to give credit to Thomas Isaac, he has tried his best to squeeze out revenue from various sources. Increases in tax on buildings, cars, luxury bikes and the hike in fair price of land will help to improve the poor level of own tax revenues of the state that have been steadily declining. The budget has also proposed expenditure rationalization moves like redeploying surplus staff to other departments, ban on new car purchase by government departments and removing ineligible and deceased beneficiaries from welfare schemes. The gains will not be significant but are a step in the right direction.

While KIIFB was set up to channelize NRI money into investments, the recent surge in bank deposits from non-resident sources shows that there is potentially a lot of funds that are flowing into bank accounts but not getting productively invested in the state. The state government needs to make it easier for NRI’s to invest in the state. While the budget’s promise of taking the state to the top 5 in “ease of doing business” rankings is laudable, it will take more than providing financial aid for firms that create employment, as the budget proposes to achieve the “ease of doing business” goal. The government has to understand that investment potential can be truly achieved by creating an environment where businesses can flourish, free from the worries of bureaucratic hurdles, labour unrest and general strikes. Giving public money to private businesses is hardly the solution.

405,['8/02/2020'],"UP signs 23 MoUs with pvt cos, Rs 50k-cr windfall for def corridor","This story is from February 8, 2020

Lucknow: The Uttar Pradesh government on Friday signed 23 MoUs with private companies and PSUs, which could bring investments of up to Rs 50,000 crore into the state’s defence corridor. The ongoing Defence Expo, where these MoUs were inked, is being touted as one of the biggest held so far with over 200 MoUs already been signed between governments, private companies and other organisations.

Ajay Kumar, secretary defence, said in the previous Defence Expo, 40 MoUs had been signed and a target of 100 had been set for the ongoing expo. “However, not only did we meet this target, we exceeded it by 100%. These also include the launch of 30 products during the expo,” he said.

A major MoU signed by the UP government included one with DRDO, which has come on board as knowledge partner with UPEIDA for development of a defence corridor in the state. DRDO chairperson Dr G Satheesh Reddy said: “It is our duty to ensure that the corridor comes up. We will support UPEIDA in skill development and hand holding in technical areas. We will also establish a cell to coordinate with the government and once the corridor comes up, we will also establish an R&D centre.”

Other than the UP specific MoUs, 68 more MoUs were signed for defence-related collaboration. Along with launches of 30 products, there were six major announcements in the defence sector and 18 transfers of technology. An Initial Operational Clearance certificate of Light Utility Helicopter (LUH) was also issued to Hindustan Aeronautics Limited during the ceremony. The LUH will work as a replacement for the Cheetah and Chetak helicopters, which are currently being operated by Indian Armed forces.

BDL launched the Amogha-3, an anti-tank guided missile, and the Varunastra, an anti-submarine torpedo manufactured under the technological guidance of DRDO, while OFB launched the “Sharang”, a 155mm artillery gun with a 36 km range and handed over a model to Chief of Army Staff Gen M M Naravane.

Defence minister Rajnath Singh said that India should move towards becoming a net defence exporter in the coming years. “These MoUs are a step towards achieving the target of making India a $5 billion defence exporter in the next five years. UP itself will emerge as defence manufacturing hub in coming years. The liberalised licence regime that has been brought in by the Narendra Modi-led government will definitely attract large investments by both Indian and global companies,” he said.

The budget also earmarked Rs 20 crore to Clean Kerala company from the outlay of Suchitwa Mission as a revolving fund. Isaac said canals and rivers at a length of 1,450km have already been cleansed under the ongoing river rejuvenation project. Many clogged streams have been opened. Barren land to an extend of 4,000 acres has been cultivated. Twenty acres of encroachments have been reclaimed.

AMARAVATI: Demanding the immediate withdrawal of proposals on unified service rules, teachers in all of the state’s municipal schools have intensified the protests on Friday.

Teachers staged lunch-hour demonstrations in schools, raising slogans against the proposal to formulate unified service rules. The teachers are worried that the unified service rules would deprive them of their seniority, promotions and unsettle the families. “In the present system, municipal teachers’ transfers are confined to a particular municipal town or corporation. Unified service rules will allow the authorities to shift the teachers from one town to another town within the district leaving nearly 12,000 families at the mercy of political representatives,” fumed Municipal Teachers’ Federation (MTF) state president Somarauthu Ramakrishna. The teachers will be shunted out of the existing towns after completion of eight years of maximum service in one particular town. He explained that the municipal teachers would also lose promotions due to the district unit transfer system.

Ramakrishna said the draft rules were readied without consulting any union representing the teachers’ community and proposals were sent to chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy for ratification. “It is really strange that the proposal has been hurriedly moved to CMO without communicating it to anyone in the unions. The unified service rules proposals are not acceptable to us,” said Ramakrishna.

Maheshwar Hazari

PATNA: Bihar ’s economy grew at the rate of 10.5% in 2018-19 as compared to the national growth rate of 6.80%, state planning and development minister Maheshwar Hazari said here on Friday. He added that the state featured in the top five in terms of GDP growth rate in the country in 2018-19.

As per documents shared by the minister, the GDP growth rate of 10.5% for fiscal 2018-19 is based on constant prices by taking 2011- 12 as the base year. Hazari claimed that the growth rate of Bihar in terms of current prices (as opposed to constant prices) stood at 15% against the corresponding national figure of 11.20%. According to experts, the calculation of growth rate based on constant prices is done by excluding inflation and while calculating the growth rate based on current prices, inflation is included.

“The growth of state’s economy was rated highest in the country in the fiscal 2017-18 and the government has ensured to maintain the double-digit growth rate despite the economic slowdown,” Hazari said. The economic survey of Bihar for the fiscal 2017-18 had quoted the state’s GDP growth rate at 11.3%. The minister also claimed a surge of 13.20% was witnessed in terms of per capita GSDP (gross state domestic product) at constant prices in 2018-19 as compared to the previous fiscal. In terms of figures, the per capita GSDP stood at Rs47,541 crore.

“In terms of constant prices on the other hand, the state’s per capita GSDP stood at Rs33,629, which was 8.8% higher than the previous year,” Hazari said.

Kochi: It is old wine in a new bottle for the health sector . “The government is trying to consolidate the gains of the past four years. The budget further strengthens the Aardram Mission ,” said Dr B Ekbal, planning commission member.

Health professionals said that the only new thing in the budget is the oncology park and drugs for organ-transplant patients. “But this is not even 1% of the healthcare. It is also sad that treatment in government hospitals that should be free, is now being offered through an insurance scheme involving private players,” said diabetologist Dr Sreejith N Kumar.

On the positive side, there is the proposal that Kerala State Drugs and Pharmaceuticals Ltd (KSDP) will manufacture drugs needed for organ-transplant and cancer patients.

At present, 6,000 people have already undergone organ transplants. Every year, 300 to 400 patients undergo organ transplant. They need minimum Rs 750 a day for the drugs at present. With drugs being manufactured by KSDP, the cost will come down to Rs 28 per day. Drugs worth Rs 600 crore are purchased for cancer treatment in Kerala in a year. Also, focus is on palliative care and establishing medical colleges in backward districts of Kasaragod, Wayanad and Pathanamthitta.

However, on the flip side, under Karunya Arogya Suraksha scheme, the amount required is Rs 700 crore but assistance provided from the Centre is only Rs 140 crore. This will severely affect the scheme. “The government is silent on protecting the small and medium hospitals,” said Indian Medical Association (IMA) state president Dr Abraham Varghese.

“Despite our repeated requests, there is no social security for high-risk doctors and medical staff who work with patients who have contracted infectious diseases like Nipah and coronavirus,” said neurologist Dr V G Pradeep Kumar.

Health experts rued that very little money has been allotted for the health sector again though Kerala struggles with increasing communicable and non-communicable diseases. “The total amount allotted to the health sector is just 1% of the GDP,” said Dr N Sulphi, former IMA secretary.

414,['8/02/2020'],‘India not prepared for ‘swarm of drones’ attacks’,"This story is from February 8, 2020

Vijay Chopra

Lucknow: In the small hours of September 14 last year, 10 drones sneaked into the Saudi Arabian air space and targeted two crude oil fields, triggering massive fires and a global oil crisis. While Saudis managed to douse the inferno soon, it took countries across the continents several days to rein in the soaring crude oil prices.

Saudis had installed systems in the oil fields to detect drones but the ‘flying enemies’ gave them a slip.

That were 10 drones. Now imagine the sight if a ‘swarm of drones’ are used to carry out such coordinated attacks. Simply put, it would be catastrophic, for which a country like India is not prepared yet, warn defence and cyber experts. “Rogue drones or unmanned aerial vehicles pose the biggest challenge for the future, as they can easily target a nation’s critical infrastructure like gas fields and airports,” said Pankaj Kuchhal, general manager, technical, Indian Oil Corporation.

These deliberations were part of a session titled “Countering Rogue Drones”, organized by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) at the ongoing Defence Expo in Lucknow on Friday.

While emphasising that drones will remain part of the future security and development projects, panellists said it was time to put in place an advance mechanism that can neutralize threats from the aerial miscreants.

However, the main challenge lies in detecting drones as they fly very low and often go undetected by radars.

Sunny Sharma, CEO of Bangalore-based IIO Technologies Private Limited, suggested the use of radio frequency or RF, which, he said, was way more effective than radars in detecting drones. Once detected, rogue drones can be jammed. Most of the other experts also said jamming was an effective technique.

Sharma stressed that besides technology, drone users must also be educated as many users of the flying object can trigger a catastrophe unintentionally. “Counter-rogue drone strategies are meant for criminals, whereas clueless or careless users need to be educated,” he added.

The experts were of the view that one counter-strategy may not work, and therefore, a combination of measures should be devised to ground the aerial enemy.

In an engaging interaction with the audience, Amber Dubey, joint secretary in the civil aviation ministry, said the central government would lay out the guidelines on use of drones in the coming months so that their misuse is checked. “A firecracker dropped from a rogue drone on a large crowd will not kill anyone, but it would be enough to cause a stampede. And that’s a big scare. Hence steps to counter such objects are required,” he added.

Lt Gen (retd) Sanjeev Madhok said at present it’s “a cat-mouse chase” between experts and attackers.

“The key is to stay ahead of criminal minds so that they are not able to disrupt our daily lives by aerial means,” the former Army officer added.

415,['8/02/2020'],Defacing of street lights continues unabated in Doon,"This story is from February 8, 2020

Dehradun: The defacement of public properties in Dehradun is continuing unabated, often right under the noses of officials.

In the latest such instance, flags of a political outfit have been put up on street lights along Rajpur Road since the past few days in a clear violation of rules.

When TOI contacted Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), the organisation which has put up the flags, Sanket Nautiyal, a senior member of the state unit, said, “We have placed the flags as part of the build-up for our event scheduled on Saturday. We have taken permission from all the concerned departments and once the event gets over, we will remove it by ourselves.”

However, officials of the Dehradun Municipal Corporation (DMC), which is mandated to ensure that public properties including electric poles and street lights remain free from encroachments, told TOI that it is illegal to put up any advertisements or objects on street lights since it amounts to defacing. “It is completely illegal to deface street lights or any other public property. The DMC does a routine check every 2-3 days to ensure that the poles and street lights remain encroachment-free,” said municipal commissioner Vinay Shankar Pandey who did not comment on whether notices will be sent or fines imposed on the defaulters.

Nainital-based lawyer Abhijay Negi meanwhile said that “the law is not being properly enforced in such cases.” “Uttarakhand has a legislation named ‘Uttarakhand anti-spitting and anti-littering legislation’ which was enacted in 2016. In this legislation, the littering aspect has been very widely defined and it includes defacing as well. Such activities are rampantly taking place in Dehradun but it is sad that the administration is not taking any action,” he said.

Doon-based activist Reenu Paul added, “I feel that political advertisements should not eat up public spaces as they have no benefit for society. Also, strict action should be taken against those who are defacing public property in any manner.”

416,['8/02/2020'],Coastal area package takes shape with specific outlays,"This story is from February 8, 2020

Kochi: Though a coastal area package with an allocation of Rs 5,000 crore — to be implemented in five years — was announced in the previous budget, the finance minister announced the break up in this budget. An amount of Rs 380 crore has been earmarked as plan fund in the current year for fisheries sector, including harbour engineering department.

In addition to this, Rs 750 crore will be spent through KIIFB in 2020-21. T M Thomas Isaac has set aside Rs 64 crore for schools, Rs 201 crore for hospitals, Rs 57 crore for sea wall and pulimuttu, Rs 209 crore for harbour, Rs 100 crore for fish market and Rs 150 crore for roads.

The construction of Chethi and Parappanangadi harbours will be commenced in the summer. As part of Life Mission, 7,000 houses worth Rs 280 crore will be constructed for those living in coastal areas. The project amounting to Rs 2,450 crore from Rebuild Kerala has been approved for the rehabilitation of fishermen in the coastal areas spending Rs 10 lakh per family.

Stating that some of the projects mentioned above may take many years to complete and even if such expenditure in the succeeding years is set aside, the outlay for coastal package for 2020-21 will come to Rs 1,000 crore.

On the controversy surrounding Ockhi fund, Isaac said that district-level review meetings will be conducted to inform fisherfolk about the allocations. Okhi fund has been expended properly. Still, some people are raising false allegations. Hence, a social audit will be conducted by a team headed by Aruna Roy on Okhi expenditure, he announced.

An amount of Rs 15 crore has been earmarked for development of other allied jobs for the women in fisher folk families and Rs 6 crore for fish-vending women.

Fishermen association said that against the backdrop of shortage in marine landings, there are no concrete suggestions in the budget for helping fishermen shift their activity to outer and deep-sea areas. “There is no mention on restructuring the debt-ridden fishing units or writing off their debts. The major issue related to the harbours in Kerala is that most of them are not in a position to be used because of soil erosion. The budget allocated for harbours will be of no use until a detailed study is conducted to address the specific glitches,” said Charles George, state president, Matsyathozhilali Aikyavedi.

TIRUPATI: Continuing the ongoing offensive against red sanders smuggling, the red sanders anti-smuggling task force (RSASTF) sleuths conducted combing operations at Seshachalam forests on Friday morning and arrested two smugglers and seized 75 logs and two vehicles of the smugglers.

Speaking to reporters, task force SP, P Ravi Shankar, said, a team led by RSIs Vasu and Lingadhar, carried out combing operations inside the forests near Srivari Mettu-Alipiri route since Thursday night.

In the early hours on Friday, the combing parties spotted a group of around 20 red sanders smugglers cutting down trees near NCC firing range.

When the smugglers realised they were surrounded, they attacked the task force sleuths with stones. The latter, however, managed to nab two smuggled, while the rest fled.

The arrested have been identified as Rajesh and Kuppu Swamy , both are from Tiruvannamalai district in Tamil Nadu.

The share of industrial sector in domestic revenue has increased to 13.2% in 2018-19 from 9.8% in 2014-15

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Finance minister T M Thomas Isaac has said a new vigour is evident in Kerala’s industrial sector . The share of industrial sector in state’s domestic revenue has increased to 13.2% in 2018-19 from 9.8% in 2014-15. In national factory production, the share of Kerala has increased to 1.6% from 1.2%.

Isaac has put the credit for the industrial growth on the impressive performance by public-sector undertakings (PSUs). That may be the reason, he has kept a sizeable share of funds for the PSUs. In total, an amount of Rs 280 crore is earmarked for the PSUs in 2020-21.

Isaac pointed out Kerala State Drugs and Pharmaceuticals Ltd as the symbol of progress in the industrial sector. “In 2015-16, the production was Rs 28 crore. The target to achieve in 2020-21 is Rs 150 crore,’’ he said.

The outlay for medium- and large-scale industrial sector (MSME), including investments in public sector enterprises, is Rs 468 crore. Of this, Rs 109 crore is for Kerala State Industrial Development Corporation and Rs 92 crore for Kerala Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation.

While listing out the major progress happening in the PSUs, Isaac said Kerala Minerals and Metals Limited has invested Rs 65 crore for its expansion from its own profit. Installation of pollution control systems at Travancore Titanium Products have been completed. Keltron’s co-operation in defence sector is progressing.

On getting accreditation from railways, Autokast’s foundry is moving towards bogie manufacturing. Kerala Automobiles have launched e-auto in the market. The construction of new pharmaceutical manufacturing unit of Kerala State Homeopathic Cooperative Pharmacy has been completed. This will be commissioned in 2020-21 after installing machineries and obtaining certifications. Thus the public sector is progressing, he said.

420,['8/02/2020'],CII-Exim award means a lot to us: KOEL CEO,"This story is from February 8, 2020

Pune: For R R Deshpande, managing director and chief executive officer of Kirloskar Oil Engines Limited (KOEL), the CII-Exim Bank Award for Business Excellence — given at the end of 2019 — is the most coveted of all accolades the company has received over the years.

It took the company 15 years to come to a stage when the award — based on the European Foundation for Quality Management — was finally conferred for overall business improvement and on tough scoring parameters.

“About 15 years ago, I had told the owner this was an award that we would like to gun for … People (in business circles) know it is not easy,” said Deshpande.

At the time, the company had just become debt free, thanks to very tight cost control measures introduced by the then joint managing director, Gautam Kulkarni. Deshpande, who was a director at the company then, said they had to align the organization to win this tough award.

""About eight assessors sit for eight days to cross-check all our claims against the values. We were at 300 points in the beginning and slowly climbed to 600 — the floor points needed for the award,” said Deshpande, who joined KOEL 43 years ago as a trainee engineer.

The award in a way personifies the growth of KOEL, the investment in the entire business ecosystem and chipping away at the target.

“This is the award that has been earned by the people of this company after a tough fight of 15 years. In 2017, we ended at 570 points. So we did not participate in 2018 and instead, focused on preparation. We had to take a step back to come back with a bang,” he said, adding, “Today we are a debt-free company and have a surplus of Rs1,000 crore. Earlier we had Rs400 crore.”

The company, in 2012, planned to “touch the world” by 2025. The first of its milestones — Vision 2021 — is around the corner and the company aims to hit a top-line of Rs5,051 crore by then — a tough ask given that it earned Rs3,200 crore in FY2019 and is likely to end the current fiscal at a similar top-line. “Our first job is to stick to last year’s level and then pick pace. The targets can be readjusted,”he added.

LUCKNOW: A 23-year-old man preparing for competitive examinations was grievously injured after being shot at in Madiaon on Friday evening during a clash that followed a quarrel between two college lads over use of expletives.

Victim Chandan Singh, a resident of Kamlabad Badauli, was part of one of the two groups involved in the clash, police said. He was rushed to KGMU Trauma Centre, where doctors say his condition is still critical.

Trouble started in the morning when two undergraduate students of a private college in Bakshi ka Talab, identified as Harshit Singh and Aman Yadav, had a quarrel and traded abuses. Although teachers intervened and quelled the tension, peace did not last long.

According to preliminary police investigation, the two bumped into each other at Bithauli Crossing in the evening and picked up a fight once more. Harshit allegedly beat up Aman who went home and narrated the incident to his father, Luvkush Yadav.

An infuriated Yadav gathered his henchmen, and armed with sticks and countrymade weapons went to Harshit’s place to seek revenge. Harshit had mobilised his supporters too and Chandan was among them.

“As both parties clashed with sticks and bricks, someone allegedly from Yadav’s side opened fire from a pistol. As Chandan slumped to the ground bleeding, the groups dispersed,” Madiaon SHO Vipin Kumar Singh.

The officer said an FIR for attempt to murder and rioting had been lodged, and police were looking for Yadav and his aides. “Four persons have been detained for questioning. We are yet to ascertain if the firearm used was a licensed one,” he added.

427,['8/02/2020'],Who was Baba Jumdevji (1921-1996),"This story is from February 8, 2020

Nagpur: Mahantyagi Baba Jumdevji was a well known spiritual guru and social reformer from Nagpur who championed causes like social uplift and empowerment. He also raised his voice against alcohol consumption and social evils like child marriages. Born as Juman Thubrikar on April 3, 1921, his early childhood was spent in the neighbourhood of Golibar Chowk. A decade later, his family shifted to a new home in nearby Timki. That’s where his journey towards becoming Baba Jumdevji started.

His grandson, Rahul Thubrikar, while recounting the era when Baba Jumdevji was hardly 10 or 11 years-old, said, “That house was a place where strange things would happen. Things for which not many had ready answers. Out of nowhere, sound of someone whistling could be heard, utensils would fall on the ground in empty rooms and red ants would suddenly appear on one’s body. Baba Jumdevji’s family was from weaver community. At times, the handloom would start operating on its own.” A decade later, a spiritual solution was found to the problem with Baba Jumdevji volunteering to undergo the risky process when he was around 18 or 19 years of age.

Baba Jumdevji’s tryst with destiny happened when he turned 21. “That was the year when he attained enlightenment and he made certain vows to God. In turn, he was also promised the same from the almighty,” said Thubrikar.

Soon enough an acquaintance approached Baba Jumdevji for solution to his problem. “That gentleman became Baba Jumdevji’s first ‘sevak’. There are many tales of amazing things Baba Jumdevji did and it would be unfair to share just bits and pieces of it. His fame spread far and wide over the decades and that led to serpentine queues of people waiting upon him and there being no space in Timki house,” said Thubrikar.

Urged by his followers, the Baba then opened a hall at Wardhaman Nagar so people won’t be inconvenienced. “He was a visionary. A majority of his followers were poor farmers who reared livestock. He opened a small dairy cooperative for them to sell milk and earn a steady livelihood. Baba Jumdevji then thought of providing loans to artisans for which he opened a small bank in 1976,” said Thubrikar.

He urged his followers to abstain from alcohol consumption and child marriages, something that was very prevalent during 1940s when he started his spiritual journey.

428,['8/02/2020'],Incorrect addresses in vehicle challans increase burden of court,"This story is from February 8, 2020

Jaipur: Incorrect addresses mentioned on the challans, increased pendency and non-serving of warrants are the major reasons which led the state government to withdraw nearly 10,000 Motor Vehicles Act-related cases from various courts.

This was decided by the state government on the recommendations made by the Rajasthan Legal services authority (RLSA), which had clearly asked the state government to withdraw these cases since the pendency is increasing and the respective courts dealing with MV Act cases don’t have space to keep the records and papers for a long time.

In its letter to the home department, the RLSA on March 8 had said that the state has got nearly 40,000 pending cases related to the MV Act violations. “Accused are warranted in the court for a long time, but they are not turning up and police were unable to serve warrants due to incomplete addresses mentioned in the challans. All these cases were related to various penalities under the MV Act in which courts are engaged, thousands of employees across the state are affected and a lot of paper work is done. Thus, we had requested that such cases be withdrawn,” Ashok Kumar Jain, member secretary, RLSA, told TOI.

RLSA also said that there is no adequate space in the trial courts to keep the documents related to these cases. “We have got nearly 20,000 such files and a clerk can deal with only 500 files. We will need at least 30 more clerks to deal with these cases. Thus, we requested the state government to withdraw the cases which are pending for more than a year,” he added.

Quoting an example of a case, he said the address of the violator is Kailash Chandra, Poorani Delhi. “How will the warrant be served to this man? There are several such cases pending which will be withdrawn by the state government through the Lok Adalat to be organised across the state on Saturday,” he added.

Columnists Aakar Patel spaks at a panel discussion on Citizenship Identity & Migration at the Indian Institute... Read More

Bengaluru: Condemning the police attack at the Jamia Millia Islamia University library in December, historian Ramachandra Guha on Friday said authoritarians, including high-ranking officials of the British Raj and former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi , had spared varsity libraries as they read books .

Speaking at a panel discussion on Citizenship: Identity and Migration, organised by The Network of Women in Media-India, Guha said: “Students were active in protesting against the British during the Quit India movement and during the JP movement against Indira Gandhi, but police never vandalised university libraries. Although the Viceroy and Indira Gandhi were authoritarians, they read books.”

Referring to the library attack at Jamia on December 15, Guha said: “The politics behind CAA is to make Indian Muslims second-class citizens in the country. It’s a discriminatory act as only Muslims will be persecuted.”

“The DNA of the government is to create hatred and fear of Muslims and not love for Hindus or pride of Hinduism. This is apparent to anyone who has been to Gujarat. NRC is aimed to intimidate and harass Indian Muslims,” the historian said.

Referring to the abrogation of Article 370 and turning the Muslim-majority state of Kashmir into a Union territory, he said the sufferings of ordinary Kashmiris who had nothing to do with terrorism or jihad have only worsened. “This is the government that hates ideas and independent thinking; they declared a war against the country’s best universities,” Guha added.

Tirupati: Following an invitation from the Jammu government to build a Lord Venkateswara temple there, TTD administrative top brass, led by EO Anil Kumar Singhal, left for Jammu on Friday. The Jammu government wrote to TTD stating that they have shortlisted four sites.

Earlier, TTD trust board had passed a resolution to build a temple in Jammu and Varanasi.

Speaking to reporters at Tirumala before leaving for Jammu, Singhal said “After TTD expressed its wish to construct a Lord Venkateswara temple at Jammu, the state government there shortlisted four sites as suitable for construction of the temple. They asked us to inspect the four sites and finalise one in order to go ahead with the land allocation process. We will inspect the four sites on Saturday and Sunday and finalize one site which will be the most conducive for establishing a TTD temple.”

After establishing a Lord Venkateswara temple at Kanyakumari in the southernmost state of Tamil Nadu in 2019 at a cost of nearly Rs 25 crore, TTD is now set to establish another Lord Venkateswara temple at Jammu. TTD has already established its temples in different states including Haryana, New Delhi, and Maharashtra.

At present, the construction of several new TTD temples is underway at Amaravati, Visakhapatnam, Hyderabad and Bhubaneswar.

TIRUPATI: Sleuths of the state vigilance and enforcement department stormed into the Balaji Institute of Research and Rehabilitation for the Disabled (BIRRD)—which is managed by the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams—in Tirupati on Friday and verified several records related to the purchase of medicines and medical equipment during the tenure of former BIRRD director Dr G Jagadish.

BIRRD provides world class healthcare to patients suffering from polio mellitus, cerebral palsy, congenital anomalies, spinal injuries and the orthopedically handicapped. The institute also distributes artificial limbs, calipers and aids, free of cost to the poor.

Dr G Jagadish, who has been with the institute since its inception and had also served as the director of BIRRD, was shown the door in June last year, after the TTD’s new trust board decided to adopt the policy of the YSRC-led government’s stand on terminating all the appointments made during the erstwhile TDP regime. After Dr P Jagadish stepped down from BIRRD directorship, several allegations relating to the purchase of medicines and medical equipment surfaced.

Vigilance and enforcement sleuths, led by DSP P Malleswara Reddy, reached BIRRD hospital and verified several records related to purchases of medicines, medical equipment and other records at the hospital.

Speaking to reporters DSP Malleswara Reddy said “Our head office received several complaints on alleged irregularities which have taken place in BIRRD since 2015 and we have been directed to launch a detailed probe. We have to enquire into various aspects which include allocation and utilisation of funds to the institute by TTD, purchase of medicines and medical equipment, etc,” the DSP said.

The DSP said there were allegations that vendors of certain medical implants were hand-picked during the tender processes.

This was against the government norms on dumping of hazardous waste,” said DIG Sitapur range LR Kumar. The factory was issued a license for a godown but it had been manufacturing floor cleaners for the past five years,” he added.

“We are checking whether gas leak was an accident or a sabotage. The factory owner Sukesh Gupta alias Pranav is being questioned about the source of raw materials and chemicals,” said Kumar.

The factory was also functioning with the NOC from the pollution board, DM Sitapur Akhilesh Tiwari told TOI. “It is mandatory for factories to follow norms of the state pollution control board. A committee has been formed to probe the source of chemical laden truck that was brought to the chemical factory,” said Tiwari. The companies which sent the chemicals to Balaji factory are in Kanpur and Lucknow and their owners will be grilled,” said CO Biswan. The victims’s autopsy reports stated death by asphyxiation.

Guntur: Ahead of local body elections, YSRC legislators are complaining that district collector I Samuel Anand Kumar is not consulting them while taking important decisions pertaining to their constituencies.

At a recent District Review Committee (DRC) meeting chaired by in-charge minister Ch Ranganatha Raju, a few YSRC MLAs objected to the decisions taken by the district administration headed by the collector. They asked the minister to rein in the officials from taking decisions on their own.

Tenali MLA Annabathuni Sivakumar said tahsildar issued land acquisition notification to acquire land for housing scheme without consulting him. The MLA said he was left red-faced when the farmers sought his intervention to stop the process. The tehsildar said the process was initiated on the directives of the collector, said Siva Kumar.

Sources said several YSRC MLAs were uncomfortable with the district administration for various reasons. “We are getting a standard reply from camp clerks that collector is busy in meeting whenever we call him to discuss some important issue. Since he is not returning the call after the meeting, I believe that the staff in the pashies (secretariat) were also careless,” a legislator told TOI.

He said a tainted deputy tehsildar in civil supplies department was appointed as CC to collector after Samuel took over the reins of the district administration six months ago. Samuel is the first collector to shift all the CCs from the pashi in the last two decades. “I could not get a small work cleared from the collector’s office in spite of several reminders in the last three months,” said another legislator.

Samuel Anand Kumar was made district collector after YSRC came to power.

Sources said a few YSRC legislators have met Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy, advisor to the government, seeking redressal of their grievances.

Kochi: Finance minister T M Thomas Isaac on Friday announced a slew of projects for Kochi with a total outlay of Rs 6,000 crore, aimed at building an eco-friendly, integrated transportation system in the city. This also includes important overbridges and other roads.

The budget plans include the extension of the Metro rail stretch from Petta to Tripunithura and from JLN Stadium to Infopark, Kakkanad at a total cost of Rs 3,025 crore. The projects to be implemented this year also include integrated water transport in 16 routes with 76 km of waterways and 38 jetties. This project has an allocation of Rs 682 crore in the budget. The water transport department will be equipped with solar boats under the project.

Ernakulam MLA T J Vinod , however, said the Metro extensions and the water metro projects have already received administrative sanction. “This cannot be seen as new projects,” he said. The city will also witness the introduction of green vehicles, subsidies for e-autos, electric and CNG transport buses and KSEB charging stations as part of the project. The Kochi Metro Zone Project with an outlay of Rs 239 crore will offer safe footpath and cycle track.

Further, Rs 2.5 crore has been earmarked for the Kochi Metropolitan Transport Authority, which supervises all these projects. “Petta station will be commissioned in March 2020.

Thiruvananthapuram: Contrary to the Kerala state planning board’s (KSPB) direction during the annual plan formulation meeting to focus less on infrastructure development in the tourism sector and more on destination marketing, finance minister T M Thomas Isaac has opted to bring down the allocation for marketing from Rs 82 crore in 2019-20 to Rs 63 crore in the state budget 2020-21.

The outlay for the sector has also been reduced to Rs 320 crore from Rs 372 crore earmarked in 2019-20. Tourism minister Kadakampally Surendran put on a brave face saying the budget proposals have given a special thrust for the sector to overcome the crises and march ahead.

The KSPB, in fact, had asked the department to coordinate with various agencies for giving more focus on marketing the state’s destinations and products, besides making a serious observation that ‘several constructions, sans proper planning, were having a detrimental impact on the environment’. Isaac, though cited effective marketing’s vital role in surviving the two flood ravages in his budget speech, the scheme managed to grab just over 19% of the total allocation.

Meanwhile, Rs 20 crore has been allocated for the conduct of the Kerala Boat League (KBL) and other ‘jalamelas’ (water sports fest) and Heritage and Spices Route Project (Rs 33.3 crore) has been projected as the most elaborate tourism project. The proposal is to commission the Muziris Heritage project in 2020-21, besides opening at least a dozen museums in Alappuzha.

While, activities of tourism circuits centered at Thalassery are going on, similar plans for Kozhikode, Ponnani and Thankassery ports are being formulated, Isaac said in his speech. The year will also see inauguration of ‘Ormatheruvu project’ focused on erstwhile Gujarati regions, conservation activities of heritage mansions constructed in the 19th century, including churches, mosques and temples.

Establishment of a ‘Tourism Complex/Vinoda Sanchara Bhavan’ is a new proposal for which Rs 3 crore has been earmarked. The intention is to have a centralized office complex on the premises of the Government Guest House in the capital city, ‘bringing various institutions of tourism department under one umbrella’. The department will also explore the possibility of obtaining ‘matching contribution’ from the stakeholder institutions.

Under the ‘Upgradation, Creation of Infrastructure and Amenities’ scheme, which was allocated more than 36% of the outlay, comes development of major and minor tourism destinations, river cruise tourism, development of tourism products and information centres, adventure tourism activities and establishment of wayside and waterside amenities.

Allocation for tourism schemes

442,['8/02/2020'],"Pleas nixed, Kamptee Road flyover to start at SFS Church gate","This story is from February 8, 2020

Nagpur: Mohan Nagar residents are feeling betrayed as MahaMetro is starting the Kamptee Road flyover right in front of SFS Cathedral despite assuring them to shift the ramp near LIC Square. Construction at the spot has already begun.

A MahaMetro official said the agency had submitted the design for extending the ramp near LIC Square to National Highways Authority of India (NHAI). “A team from NHAI head office visited the spot and after considering all pros and cons scrapped our revised plan. The authority asked us to start the flyover from the original location. As we are only the executing agency, we have to abide by their directions,” he added.

The only difference in the new design is that a ramp will be built between Kadbi Square and Indora Square from the flyover. Metro officials say this will reduce the traffic flow at Gaddigodam landing by 70%.

NHAI has not given any reason for rejecting the revised plan. Regional officer Naresh Wadetwar told TOI that the original design had been approved by the technical section of NHAI head office and hence there was no point in revising it.

Another NHAI official said opposition by local residents could not be any reason for revising a design. “There would have been different set of problems in the revised location too. We are facing such problems everywhere inside city limits,” he added.

According to the official, the only change NHAI has allowed was to reduce the width of both service roads from 7.5 meters to 5.5 meters. This will reduce the area of land needed to be acquired.

As per the initial design, the flyover was to start in front of SFS Church. Residents of Mohan Nagar protested as it would endanger lives of hundreds of schoolchildren besides locals. They met Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari, who directed MahaMetro to submit a revised plan to NHAI. After several months, the NHAI has rejected this plan.

Mohan Nagar residents are furious over the flip-flop. A local Joy Jacob said several schools are located in the area and lives of the students would be at risk. “SFS School, St Michael School, Little Flower Kindergarten, St Joseph Convent, St John School and Jeevoday School for Physically Challenged are located near the SFS Cathedral. Hundreds of students attend these school. Their lives will be endangered by the fast traffic coming down the flyover,” he added.

Jacob further said the road is already very narrow and the flyover will make it very dangerous to cross the street. “I fail to understand when the start of the flyover had been shifted towards LIC Square, how it has been shifted back to in front of the church. Gadkari had clearly instructed MahaMetro to change the design. I have learnt that MahaMetro did not even submit a revised design to NHAI and hence there was no change in the plan. The Metro officials have been fooling residents of Mohan Nagar all along,” he said.

The Metro official denied the allegation. “If anybody thinks we did not submit a revised design, he can visit our office. We will show all the papers,” he said.

Father Patrick Lemos of SFS Church termed the development as unfortunate. “Gadkari had promised us to shift the start of the flyover. Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) had passed a resolution in this regard in its general body. How come NHAI is ignoring all this? The affected people will meet soon to chalk out a plan of action. We will meet Gadkari and apprise him that his orders have been ignored,” he told TOI.

444,['8/02/2020'],Duronto to operate from Ajni for 3 more months,"This story is from February 8, 2020

Nagpur: In a move that would inconvenience passengers, the Nagpur division of Central Railway has decided to extend the operation of 12289-90 Mumbai Duronto Express from Ajni railway station for the next three months from Sunday (February 9).

Due to washable apron work on platform no. 1 at the main station, the popular train, which used to run from home platform no. 8 on Santra Market side, was temporarily being operated from Ajni from January 8.

On February 6, the Central Railway completed the task of washable apron in 26 days under the guidance of DRM Somesh Kumar, principal chief engineer (PCE) AK Agrawal, ADRM Jay Singh, senior divisional engineer (coordination) Pawan Patil and Pankaj Dhaware.

It was expected that Duronto would start operating again from the home platform but for the next 3 months it will depart and terminate at platform no. 2 of Ajni. Sources said with apron work for platform 2 in pipeline and straightening of platform 1 planned, Duronto may regularly operate from Ajni.

The decision has not gone down well with passengers. The Bharatiya Yatri Kendra (BYK) general secretary Basant Shukla said, “Ajni station lacks waiting rooms, proper toilets, food stalls, a necessary ramp, lifts, escalators, security, facility to shift differently abled passengers and sufficient parking. Senior citizens will face lot of problems.”

Former corporator from Ajni, Tanveer Ahmed, said: “Though operating trains from Ajni is a good move to make it a full-fledged terminus, it is being done even as the station lacks basic facilities. The decision seems to have been taken for railway’s convenience as Duronto maintenance facility is based in Ajni. Presently, the train has to shuttle from platform 8 to Ajni.”

Assistant commercial manager (ACM) & railway spokesperson SG Rao said, “The decision has been taken to ease congestion at Nagpur station. At 8.40pm when the train departs, there are several other trains in line. Besides, demand to convert Ajni into a terminus is long pending. Duronto operation will push Ajni’s case to make it a terminus.”

Rao added, “RPF personnel will be posted to solve the parking problem. Similarly, a small ramp is already there towards the Nagpur end. Lighting has also been improved at the station. Coolies will also be made available at Ajni an hour before the train departure.”

Regular traveller Madanal Jagyasa felt that the absence of a ramp on Wardha end will cause inconvenience to passengers of front-side coaches. “There is also no battery-operated car facility at Ajni,” he said.

Facelift to platform 1

The washable apron work on platform number 1 and yard was sanctioned in 2015. Apron work on platform 1, where all trains towards north direction are taken up, was started on January 11 and completed on February 6 in two phases. Earlier, the track was laid on wooden sleepers which were eroded due to water and track parameters were not holding properly and hence had become unsafe. Now cement concrete sleepers have been laid in over 500 metres making train operations safe.

445,['8/02/2020'],"PM Narendra Modi’s statement untrue, condemnable, says Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan","This story is from February 8, 2020

Pinarayi Vijayan

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Friday asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to correct his statement that maligns the anti-CAA protests in Kerala .

“It is unbefitting for a Prime Minister to be a part of those who are disappointed with the fact that Kerala is leading the struggle against the communalism of both RSS and SDPI,” Vijayan said in a statement.

The chief minister was reacting to Modi’s speech in Rajya Sabha on Thursday when he quoted Vijayan as criticizing SDPI for infiltrating in anti-CAA protest and engaging in violence.

“Kerala is at the forefront of struggles against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, which is an amendment that brazenly tramples on constitutional values. The unity that we see in these struggles is a hallmark of the secularism of Kerala. It is understandable that some people might want to malign and misconstrue this movement. Kerala will respond in unison to them. Kerala's secular ethos is one that is opposed to all forms of communalism. This state is not an arable land for any kind of communalism,” the CM said.

Noting that protests that are happening against CAA have seen the coming together of people from all walks of life, Vijayan said people have transcended religious and caste lines to form a common front. “And for such a society, they don't need an external tutelage to separate the genuine protest from those opportunists who are trying to sow communal polarization. The statement of the Prime Minister about Kerala, made during the ‘motion of thanks’ to the President's address, was untrue and condemnable,” he said.

According to Vijayan, the remarks he had made on extremist organizations like SDPI were in good faith.

“Kerala is guided by the belief that secularism is the only means for defeating communal agenda of RSS. And we will resist anyone who attempts to pollute this struggle with the poison of communalism. Kerala is not willing to concede ground to those who want to make this an opportunity for communal polarization. People were warned of such infiltrators; proper caution was also exercised,” said Vijayan.

446,['8/02/2020'],Activists demand stay on shifting of bank branch,"This story is from February 8, 2020

Aurangabad: Social activists and residents are protesting against the proposal to move Bank of Maharashtra’s Roshan Gate branch .

In a letter submitted to the bank officials, activists have stated that moving the bank would be inconvenient for the elderly, students and women who have accounts at the branch.

According to Mohsin Ahmed, working president of Aurangabad City District Congress Committee, the bank is the only nationalised bank in the area within a 2-km radius. The Roshan Gate branch of the bank has accounts of small businessmen, elderly and school students who get scholarships and benefits of government schemes through the bank.

The bank authorities have decided to shift the bank to a location which is 2 km away, near Jawaharlal Nehru Engineering College (JNEC). “As there was no nationalised bank in the locality, after our requests, the BoM branch was set up in the area three years ago. The bank has an agreement with the building owner for 15 years. The decision to move the bank from the location would be a concern for around 25,000 account holders in the branch,” Ahmed said.

Ahmed, on behalf of the residents, wrote letters to bank’s zonal office, regional office, RBI governor and finance minister urging them to prevent the moving the bank.

Devidas Tuljapurkar, joint secretary of the All India Bank Employees Association (AIBEA), said that poor business of the bank is the reason for the proposal. “However, if the public sector banks do not cater to the needs of people, who else will?” he said.

When contacted, the branch manager said that the branch will be merged with the existing Bank of Maharashtra JNEC branch (in Cidco N-5) on the same road. The bank official, however, could not elaborate on the reasons for the merger.

Kochi: Fifteen students from Kerala , who were stranded at Hubei province in China, landed at Cochin International Airport from Bangkok on Friday at 11pm. The students travelled from Kunming Airport in China to Bangkok and boarded an Air Asia flight to Kochi. The students include three boys and 12 girls.

After thermal screening at the aerobridge in Kochi, the students were taken to Kalamassery medical college in five sterilized ambulances under the supervision of a team of doctors. Though relatives of the students were gathered outside the airport, they were not allowed to meet them.

“Airport officials told us that students should undergo more medical screening at the hospital besides thermal screening at the airport. So, the 15 students were taken to the medical college in ambulances. I could not even speak to my sister even over the phone. We will go to the medical college to know more about the health condition of the students,” said Karthika Rani, sister of Keerthana Rani who is doing house surgency in China.

The students will be lodged at the isolation ward arranged at the hospital if they show any symptoms of fever. After examining them, it will be decided whether they have to be released from the hospital. Even if they are released, they will be under house quarantined.

In Ernakulam, 312 people have been under house quarantine and no one has symptoms of novel coronavirus. Meanwhile, four people, who were under observation at isolation ward in Kalamassery medical college, were released on Friday. Of the three samples sent from Ernakulam to Alappuzha NIV, none were reported positive for cornovirus.

448,['8/02/2020'],Panel meeting on waste plant ends in 2 minutes due to lack of quorum,"This story is from February 8, 2020

Aurangabad: The standing committee meeting called on Friday to discuss the tender for the Harsul waste plant was suspended within two minutes due to lack of quorum.

The Shiv Sena members said they skipped the meeting as the committee has lost its authority to take a decision on the tender. The Sena members wanted the standing committee chairperson, who is from BJP, to approve the old tender which the latter had objected to.

It was expected that the tender, for appointing agency to operate the 150-tonne-per-day waste treatment plant at Harsul would finally see a breakthrough on Friday.

The standing committee chairperson Jaishree Kulkarni and committee member Surekha Sanap turned up for the meeting but the civic officials were not present. Few officers were present but there was not a single official of the rank of deputy municipal commissioner or above. Subsequently, Kulkarni ended the meeting within two minutes.

When asked, Kulkarni said that a decision was to be taken on the Harsul waste treatment plant but the meeting could not be conducted due to lack of quorum. She added that the officials had expressed their inability to attend the meeting in writing.

The Aurangabad Municipal Corporation’s administration after carrying out the tender process had shortlisted an agency based on the lowest bidding price. However, the committee had rejected the tender on September 16, 2019, asking the administration to ensure that efficient agencies bid for the project.

After CM Uddhav Thackeray, on January 9, asked the AMC to expedite the waste treatment process, the tender was sent to the committee for reconsideration. The standing committee meeting on January 16 saw a heated debate between Sena and BJP members over the project.

According to Rajendra Janjal, the deputy mayor and standing committee member, the committee’s approval is not needed for the project according to section 73 (c) of the Maharashtra Municipal Corporations Act, 1949. “It has been more than 15 days, the proposal is with the standing committee but no decision has been taken. Now, it is the prerogative of the municipal commissioner to approve the project,” he said. The Sena members said that they would write to the municipal commissioner to approve the tender as the new tender process which would at least cost 10 to 12% more than the previous one.

Bengaluru: A Bescom proposal to hike power tariffs ran into huge opposition from consumers at a public hearing held by the Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission ( KERC ) on Friday.

Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board ( BWSSB ), B.Pac (Bangalore Political Action Committee) and Peenya Industries Association, among others, submitted objections and pointed out that for many years, Bescom hasn’t conducted an energy audit and has been purchasing power at a cost higher than the one fixed by KERC.

B.Pac representatives said power consumed by irrigation pumpsets in areas under Bescom was much higher than the approved rate and urged KERC to identify and remove duplicate pumpsets.

Vijay Kumar, secretary of the 5,000-member Peenya Industries Association, said, “Bescom says it has surplus power for financial year 2020-21. Between 6am and 10am, it should give time-of-day power to HT consumers at Rs 2 less than the tariff .”

For low-tension, domestic consumers under BBMP and other urban local body limits, Bescom has proposed a 9% to 12.8% hike in tariff.

KERC chairman Shambu Dayal Meena asked Bescom why it had submitted the hike proposal without verifying its accounts. “While other companies have sought 10-20% hike in capital expenditure, you have submitted one four times that of last year. This will burden the consumer,” he said.

Bescom managing director MB Rajesh Gowda said, “Power purchase cost accounts for more than 80% of our overall expenditure. High cost power is being allocated to Bescom when compared to other Escoms. Overall increase in cost has gone up for the power utility.”

Representative image

AURANGABAD: The Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has tabled a proposal before the standing committee that the property tax be increased by 25%.

According to the AMC administration, there has been no increase in the property tax since 2012-2013. The proposal was placed before the standing committee meeting on Friday, but since the meeting ended without any discussion, the proposal will now be taken up in the next meeting of the panel.

Incidentally, the AMC administration has been criticised for its poor tax recovery. The civic administration was asked to ensure good tax recovery by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar during his recent visit to the city. On January 9, state chief secretary Ajoy Mehta had asked the AMC administration to ensure that its recovery is improved.

However, with the AMC general elections scheduled for April, the standing committee is in a fix over approving the tax hike. The increase in taxes would invite discontent from voters.

Meanwhile, in the current financial year, the AMC has collected 45% of the target set for property tax collection. On Friday, AMC tax officer Karan Chavan said property tax collection of Rs 95.88 crore has been done till now, as against a target of Rs 211 crore. The collection is 8.37% more than previous year.

“The AMC has collected Rs 20.47 crore towards water tax. As the data was not available for water consumers, no target was set for water tax collection,” Chavan said.

Talking about the measures taken to improve the tax recovery over the next one month, Chavan said the drive to increase property tax recovery from commercial properties, the process of printing bills based on the water consumer data has begun and dhol tasha squads are working to encourage recovery from major defaulters in each ward.

451,['8/02/2020'],32 students hospitalized after eating mid-day meal,"This story is from February 8, 2020

Nagpur: Students of Smt Ashatai Mude Primary School and Marotrao Mude High School at Hudkeshwar complained of stomach ache and vomiting sensation after consuming mid-day meal on Friday afternoon. After treatment at a nearby private hospital, 32 students were admitted to Government Medical College Hospital (GMCH) in the evening. All students are doing well in ward no. 3, and are likely to be discharged on Saturday.

Doctors at GMCH told TOI that the students are between 8 to 14 years of age. “The students were admitted with symptoms of food poisoning on Friday afternoon. They are under observation. Condition of one student was a bit worrisome. So, we admitted him to the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit,” said Dr Dipty Jain. Doctors have decided to keep these kids under observation as food poisoning effects can appear anytime after 24 hours of food consumption.

GMCH dean Dr Sajal Mitra visited the ward and instructed doctors to ensure the students get all necessary care. Late on Friday evening, home minister Anil Deshmukh also visited the hospital and interacted with students. He ordered police to collect samples of the food served in the school and send it for testing.

Students said they were served khichdi made of cowpea seeds, popularly known as barbati. There were 233 students in the school on Friday. Some of them started complaining of nausea right after having the first few bites of the dish. Many refused to eat the meal after others started complaining. Students were earlier admitted to a nearby private clinic. Later, Hudkeshwar police were called, who decided to shift these students to GMCH.

School director Mahendra Mude blamed the women’s self-help group that provides mid-day meal to students. “The ZP education department has allotted mid-day meal contract of our school to one Shagun Women’s Self-Help Group. We have got complaints about the quality of food and requested authorities to change this supplier,” he said.

As soon as parents came to know about the incident, they rushed to GMCH. Some of them complained that mid-day meals in school are always of substandard quality. They also alleged that school administration was responsible for the supply of substandard food. Activists of RTE Action Committee also reached the hospital and blamed the school administration for the incident.

“The teacher who looks after the food committee of school must taste and check quality of food before serving it to the students. We demand strict action against the food committee members and the self-help group that served such food to students,” said Mohd Shahid Sharif, chairman of RTE Action Committee.

Kochi: The Marine Products Export Development Authority ( Mpeda ) has launched a certification system for aquaculture, that guarantees quality shrimp post larvae and authenticates their quality in the international market, at the 22nd International Seafood Show that began in Kochi on Friday.

“Called Shaphari, the ‘Antibiotic-free Certification’, is an end-to-end solution that enables Mpeda to audit post larvae offered by hatcheries across the country,” said Kerala governor Arif Mohammad Khan after the inauguration.

The show is organized by Mpeda and the Seafood Export Association of India (SEAI). The three-day long show is held in Kochi after 12 years.

India’s continued buoyancy in sustainable seafood exports in the face of stiff global competition and the latest technological interventions in the aquaculture sector will be on full display at the show.

The entire certification process will be online in tune with the e-governance programme of the central government. There are various certifications systems including MSC and BAP, which are otherwise offshore certification processes, unaffordable to the small and marginal Indian farmers. The present initiative will make the certification scheme affordable to the small and marginal aqua farmers in India.

Exporters can use the certification as a credible proof of document while trading globally. It involves a real-time, four-phased audit recording.

453,['8/02/2020'],Telangana: Shepherd shoots at neighbour with AK-47 for cement bricks,"This story is from February 8, 2020

The bullet which was fired

HYDERABAD: A petty fight over a few cement bricks had a 35-year-old shepherd whipping out an AK-47 and shooting at his neighbour on Thursday night in Akkanapet village, about 90km from Hyderabad. Luckily the shepherd missed his shot as the bullet whizzed past the neighbour’s head.

The shepherd, D Sadanandam, was finally nabbed after a 24-hour-long manhunt from Siddipet on Friday and, the weapon and a gun seized. In fact, the police said the seized assault rifle and the 9mm carbine gun were the ones that had gone missing from Husnabad police station in April 2018. Husnabad town is just 40 km from Siddipet.

Police said Sadanandam and his neighbour G Gangaraju, a 32-year-old tractor driver, has been sparring over a few cement bricks that the latter had borrowed from the former about six months ago. On February 5, Sadanandam’s wife and Gangaraju’s mother had an argument over the bricks, and Sadanandam ran after Gangaraju’s family with a sword in rage.

About 9pm on Thursday, Sadanandam again attacked Gangaraju, but this time with a deadlier weapon. “He first test-fired one round of the rifle into the ground, which alarmed the residents of the village and gave enough time to Gangaraju and family to lock their doors. However, since the door was locked, Sadanandam fired into the house through an open window”, Husnabad assistant commissioner of police (ACP) S Mahendar told TOI.

“Luckily, the bullet went a few inches over my head and hit the wall. There were four adults and two children in the room,” said Gangaraju.

After missing the shot, Sadanandam fled with the weapon and cops launched a manhunt. They also collected the bullets from the crime scene and found out that two rounds were fired from the AK-47.

Previously, constable B Narender of Husnabad police station had been booked under section 409 (criminal breach of trust) of the IPC for taking and not returning an AK-47 with one magazine containing 30 live rounds from the bell of arms at Husnabad police station on October 25, 2015, and one 9mm carbine gun from the bell of arms in 2013.

Now the cops are trying to ascertain how the missing weapons came into the shepherd’s hands. “Sadanandam had visited Husnabad police station a couple of times in connection with a domestic harassment complaint from his first wife. This was the only link he had with Husnabad police station,” an official involved in the investigation told TOI.

Siddipet ACP Ch Rameshwar, who is probing the missing weapons case, said they had recorded statements of all the cops but could not get any leads on the missing firearms. Senior cops are now questioning Sadanandam to find out as to how he had managed to lay his hands on these weapons.

Siddipet commissioner Joel Davis said the weapons were issued for the personal security officer (PSO) of Husnabad inspector. “A constable and a sub-inspector who were in-charge of these weapons have already been suspended,” he said.

NEW DELHI: The last thing you would associate with electric mobility and green two-wheelers would be a company called Jitendra EV, a small-time establishment based out of Maharashtra. And if that’s not surprising enough, there are other similar ones with not-so impressive names. By way of example there is Kabira Mobility, which is a e-bike seller that assembles its rides in Dharwad, Karnataka as also M2Go, a company headquartered in the Punjabi Bagh locality in Delhi.These companies are part of a large group of start-ups — and their numbers are growing by the day — that have sprang up across the country over the last couple of years looking to tap into the growing push towards electric mobility in what are the tech’s early days in India.The game plan is simple: source batteries, controllers, and body parts and stitch them all together (many of the companies proudly call it ‘local manufacturing’ though it’s not much more than just cosmetic, small-time assembly), before selling it under the ‘Make in India’ tag.The sourcing is done mostly from China (and now even from India) and is akin to what happened in the early days of the mobile phone industry in India. People (some from non-related fields) bought the some times nearly completed parts from China, assembled them here at small establishments, and Hyderabad-based Everve Motors is owned by Reddy Customs, who are high-end car modifiers. Gurugram-based Evolet India is a company run by defence veterans while Coimbatore-based Emote electric is run by young engineers.Emote is showcasing its more sophisticated model prototype that has gears and can go from 0-60 kms in less than 4 seconds.Most of these companies have 50 or fewer employees and sales volumes of less than 5,000 bikes annually.M2Go is a start-up conceptualised by some students of a private university in Delhi who came together for a project. One of the promoters of the university liked the idea and decided to invest through seed funding then passed them off as local products under their own brand names.While the trick worked for some years, it was not sustainable in the long run without proper R&D for such sellers, who also often lacked proper corporate structure and/or long-term plans. Today, Chinese phone companies rule the roost and have over 75% share of the smartphone market, while many of the Indian ones have perished.Ask Jitendra Shah, owner of Jitendra EV (who are traditionally auto dealers), on why he decided to have the company under his own name. Pat comes the reply, “If it’s my name that is being used, how can I compromise on quality then.” Amusing but certainly plausible enough logic for him to go for the name.Kabira Mobility’s scooters and a ‘high-speed’ sports bike will begin commercial sales from March this year and Jaibir Singh, the project head, says the project was completed in the last two years or so.Many of the products, which cost between Rs 45,000 to Rs 1.1 lakh, offer a mobility range of 60 km to 100 km (under different driving conditions) with a charge time of around 4 hours. Some of them also offer the convenience of portable batteries, weighing about 12 kg, that can even be carried home.Experts believe that unlike traditional petrol automobile products that need high-tech engineering for designing engines and transmission systems, the heart of e-bike technology is its battery and motor, which is mostly imported from China. The rest of the components are either locally manufactured or are imported as kits to be assembled and sold in the Indian market.And, while small startups are trying to find their feet in the e-bike segment, the bigger ones such as Bajaj Auto, TVS, Hero Moto-Corp and Honda 2wheelers are yet to show any serious intent with the last two not having launched any EV products yet.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74022561,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1328659,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/desi-startups-ride-on-china-for-make-in-india-e-bikes/articleshow/74018728.cms
457,['8/02/2020'],GVMC on a mission to make Vizag a better place to live,"This story is from February 8, 2020

Visakhapatnam: The city’s civic body is once again bracing for the ‘ease of living index 2019’ to be conducted by the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs after putting up a good show in the 2018 index. The ease of living index examines the liveability of nearly 110 cities across a set of three major pillars.

The three pillars further include 14 categories and 50 indicators. The Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation ( GVMC ) will have to submit data sets on these 14 indicators by February 14.

The 14 indicators comprise education, health, housing, sanitation, mobility, safety and security, level of economic development, economic opportunities, city’s resilience and green spaces among others.

At the moment, GVMC is in the process of collecting data sets from concerned departments. Data on education is being provided by the district education officer, on mobility by the road transport corporation, on health by the district medical and health officer. Similarly, all concerned departments are preparing data sets for the purpose.

The ease of living index score is the weighted average of all scores of all pillars along with the citizen perception survey. While the scores on pillars carry 70% weightage on the index, the survey carries the remaining 30%.

R Somannarayana, additional commissioner of GVMC told TOI that the index is calculated on the basis of data provided by the city’s civic body which will be validated through the citizen perception survey.

“In the survey, citizens will be asked simple questions that can be mapped on the three pillars of the index. For instance, the education and health pillars will carry questions on affordability, accessibility and quality of services,” the additional commissioner added.

Somannarayana further said that the civic body has undertaken IEC (information, education, communication) activities to make citizens aware of the index and the perception survey.

“The GVMC is setting up hoardings, billboards and posters across the city. Social media is also being leveraged for the purpose. Special stalls will be set up to educate the public about the survey,” he added.

458,['8/02/2020'],Metro corridor extended to Bhogapuram airport,"This story is from February 8, 2020

Visakhapatnam: The state government has decided to extend the highway corridor of the Visakhapatnam metro rail project to the Bhogapuram airport in the first phase itself.

This will increase the length of this corridor from the proposed 30.8km (Gajuwaka to Kommadi) to 67.74km highway and airport corridors from Steel Plant Junction to Bhogapuram airport. The other corridors are Tatichetlapalem to RK beach (6.91 km) and Gurudwara to Old Post office (5.26 km).

In an order issued by the government on Friday, the Amaravati Metro Rail Corporation (AMRC) has been authorised to call quotations for the preparation of the DPR (detailed project report) for the light metro for a length of 79.91km for the first phase of the project.

The AMRC has also been authorised to avail transaction advisory from Delhi Metro Rail Corporation, RITES Limited and Urban Mass Transit Company Limited.

Modern trackless tram corridors are likely to be part of the second phase— 60.2 km metro rail project. The nearly 80-km first phase project is expected to cost around Rs 15,000 crore.

Following the change in regime in the state, the YSRC government retracted earlier bids. Justifying the retraction, the state government in a GO stated that the project had received only one financial bid— that is from Essel Infra Consortium, which according to the report did not agree to reduce costs.

As a result, a revised DPR was proposed and therefore tenders were cancelled. The first DPR however, was only for a 42.5km-long project across three corridors.

Speaking to TOI, managing director of AMRC NP Ramakrishna Reddy said that the AMRC will finish off with receiving quotations over the next couple of weeks and the consultant for the DPR will be finalised over the subsequent week.

“The first phase of the metro network has been extended till Bhogapuram airport and will cover about 79.9 km from the steel plant to Bhogapuram airport. Estimates and other key components of the project will be prepared by the consultant as part of the DPR,” he said.

Proposals for the second phase of the project include trackless trams. The trams, which run on virtual tracks on the road, work based on the autonomous rail rapid transit system. Sensors on coaches identify the virtual tracks.

The second phase corridors include NAD Junction to Pendurthi, Steel Plant to Anakapalli, Old Post Office to Rushikonda Beach and Rushikonda Beach to Bheemili.

459,['8/02/2020'],This common enemy has united India and Pakistan,"This story is from February 8, 2020

Even during the worst hostilities, both countries worked together to tackle an enemy that has resurfaced again — locusts

‘This morning the trees are almost denuded and the locusts, hanging on the twigs and branches, appear to have changed the colour of the foliage, for the tops of the trees seem covered with a yellow blight, which on close inspection turns out to be locusts…”

That description, from a Times of India report from 1902, describing the devastation of mango orchards in Trombay, near Bombay, is a reminder of how terrifyingly transformative a locust attack can be. It is now being experienced in districts of Punjab in both Pakistan and India, an ancient plague that seems, mystifyingly, to have come to life again.

Locust swarms were once so common that TOI carried very detailed reports about them. In 1879, a correspondent noted the cruel way in which they followed other disasters: “In the famine districts these winged armies made a clean sweep of all the vegetation for miles around, while the moral effect of their presence upon a famine-struck population was so great that the population completely lost heart and ceased to try and battle…”

So sudden and punishing are the attacks that is not surprising that they have commonly been given a divine interpretation, like the swarms that formed one of the plagues of Egypt in the Bible.

STEEDS OF SHIVA

In 1929 , TOI noted that in some districts locusts were called the horses of Mahadev (Shiva) and “were actually caught alive, treated with utmost respect, offered the best of food, worshipped with due reverence.” The belief was that “if the wrath of the god has been appeased and his depredatory appetite satisfied, then the avenging army received marching orders…”

The British might have sneered at these beliefs, but their more vigorous responses to locusts didn’t seem to do much good either. In 1899, TOI reported the police superintendent of Panch Mahals, Mr R P Lambert, firing blank guns to scare away swarms.

A suggestion from 1929 to use aircraft to control locusts was abandoned because it seemed more likely to kill the pilots as their engines clogged with the insects. One correspondent admitted that the main satisfaction of another solution, tar-coated screens, was watching the insects struggle and die, but it made little difference to the huge numbers.

LOCUST ROAST WITH GHEE

Perhaps the only solution was the natural one noted by the writer in 1879: feast on them like the birds and animals do. It was suggested that even humans could do the same: “Pull off the legs and wings and roast with a little ghee in an iron dish, adding curry powder, pepper and salt to taste… locusts are said to be in flavour not unlike shrimp,” Eating locusts is, in fact, a common survival strategy in places ravaged by them, simply because there is little else left. The Hebrew scriptures specify that, unlike other insects, the locust is kosher to eat.

Entomologists had always been mystified by the way locusts suddenly seemed to swarm out of nowhere, and it was Russian entomologist Sir Boris Uvarov who made an important connection in 1921. Locusts and grasshoppers were the same species, but under stressed conditions of drought and diminishing food, grasshoppers laid eggs that became locusts. These locusts could swarm and fly far off in search of food and, when this was found in abundance again, future generations could revert to being solitary grasshoppers.

This insight transformed locust control because now field workers could look for conditions in which grasshoppers were getting stressed and transforming into locusts — and if these were controlled, the larger swarms might never form.

Insights like these led the British to set up a Locust Warning Organisation (LWO) in 1939, to focus on the most vulnerable areas for locusts like the semidesert parts of Rajasthan, Gujarat and Punjab. Remarkably, LWO’s work survived Partition and continued to function even through the worst years of Indo-Pak hostilities.

In a tacit acceptance that insects don’t recognise national boundaries, locust hunters in both countries have co-ordinated with military authorities like the Border Security Force to set up regular meetings at border points like Munabao and Khokrapur, and even exchange information by wireless about the sighting of swarms.

The reasons for the current swarms still need to be analysed, but it should be noted that they are part of a pattern of recent outbreaks in countries like Somalia and Yemen where civil war and attacks by militarised groups is preventing effective implementation of any kind of monitoring and control efforts, as well as exacerbating general famine conditions.

This is a fairly direct example of how failures in governing can lead to the return of plagues once thought long past. When combined with evidence from Australia that their locusts are becoming increasingly adapted to the hotter and drier conditions created by climate change, it seems that the Indian description of them as the deadly horses of Shiva, the Lord of Destruction, may seem all too relevant again.

VISAKHAPATNAM: Even though the World Health Organisation has cautioned people against consuming raw or undercooked animal products as part of its list of basic protective measures against the new coronavirus , the virus is yet to make its effect feel on Andhra Pradesh ’s shrimp exports. AP is India’s largest shrimp producer, accounting for 30% of the produce.Although 23% of AP’s shrimp is exported to China, so far, the virus has not had an effect on the trade.Exporters in Visakhapatnam claimed that peak season for shrimp export to China is from September to December and Chinese importers place their orders during this time of the year. So, the effect of coronavirus is negligible on the export. “Keeping in mind the Christmas, New Year and the Chinese New year importers in China place bulk order from September till mid-December. During January to August the orders are low. And, whatever small amount of shrimps we export to China during January to August is still going on,” Pawan Kumar G from the Andhra Pradesh region Seafood Exporters’ Association of India (SEAI) told TOI.Exporters said that the US is the largest importer of shrimp from India (read Andhra) with 42% of the produce exported to the states. But, considering the present condition, they are not desperate to export shrimps in large quantity to the US. Rather, they are stocking the shrimps.Explaining the situation,Pawan Kumar said, “We don’t want to make a hasty decision and start exporting bulk quantities of shrimps to the US. This would bring down the price. We want to monitor the scenario for the next few months. If the situation improves in China there won’t be any problem with export during the peak season. Else, we can think about the next course of action.”There are around 60 large exporters in Andhra Pradesh and most of them specialise in shrimp business. According to figures available with Marine Products Development Authority, under the ministry of commerce and industry, on an average Andhra produces 2,500 to 5,000 tonnes of tiger shrimps per annum.",visakhapatnam,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74022872,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-24384,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/coronavirus-no-impact-on-aps-shrimp-export/articleshow/74015592.cms
462,['8/02/2020'],"Top hospitals’ budgets cut, AIIMS gets just 0.1% hike","This story is from February 8, 2020

Almost all hospitals funded by the Centre – including the AIIMS, Delhi, JIPMER, Pondicherry and PGI, Chandigarh— had their outlays slashed in the 2020-21 Budget or were given an increase that is not even enough to cover inflation. Since none of these hospitals, which treat lakhs of patients free each year, can cut corners on fixed costs like salaries of employees, public health activists fear that they will have to either cut down services or start charging patients, either way impacting the poorest patients.

Most of these centrally funded hospitals have shown more than 100% utilization of funds originally allocated for the current year, as is evident from a comparison of the budget estimates for 2019-20 and the revised estimates, a reassessment of what will actually be spent by the end of the year. Yet, most of them have faced budget cuts when this year’s allocation is compared to the revised estimates.

Kalawati Saran Children’s hospital in Delhi is the only case where the increase of almost 6% just about covers inflation if we assume that to be of about 5%. For all other hospitals, there’s either a decrease or an increase of under 0.5%, which clearly doesn’t cover inflation, meaning in real terms their budgets have been cut.

Public health experts expressed the apprehension that the hospitals might be forced to generate their own revenue by charging patients, and in the case of hospitals which are also training MBBS and post-graduate doctors, they might be forced to increase students’ fees.

While some argue that the hospitals will be able to make up for the budget cuts by getting reimbursement for treatment done under Ayushman Bharat , an analysis of Ayushman allocations and spending patterns from the current year suggests this is a tall ask. The scheme was allocated Rs 6,400 crore in the budget for 2019-20 and an identical amount in the latest Budget. According to the reported reply given by the government to an RTI query, only Rs 2,130 crore or 33.3% of its allocation was spent till November 21 last year. The National Health Authority , which administers Ayushman also revealed that 66% of patients who availed funds under the scheme used private hospitals.

Hence, assuming all of the Rs 6,400 crore allocated in this Budget is spent under the scheme, if roughly a third comes to government hospitals, that amounts to just over Rs 2,000 crore.

This amount would be spread over 10,000 government hospitals across India empanelled under the Ayushman scheme.

While it is true that the bigger hospitals would get more patients and hence a larger share of the expenditure under Ayushman, it is still extremely unlikely that the 12 central government institutions that have collectively faced a budget cut of Rs 555 crore will be able to make up for this through Ayushman reimbursements.

With government tertiary care hospitals facing such budget cuts, thousands of patients thronging these hospitals, the experts apprehend, might be forced from the public system into a predatory for-profit private tertiary care system which faces little or no regulation.

Raju cited examples of small cities as capitals such as Canberra in Australia, Washington DC in America and others. He said the government should not take land forcibly from public in the name of land pooling.

Raju said the government had borrowed Rs. 47,000 crore loan in last eight months.

Now, the government is trying to vacate companies from Millennium Towers in the SEZ. “To vacate a company from SEZ, the state has to de-notify it,” he said.

He asked the government to retain the capital in Amaravathi and decentralise development, not administration.

“If Vizag becomes executive capital, traffic would increase, the city would face water scarcity and many other issues. There is was plan for road-widening. If we get cine capital here it would bring development and income as well,” he said. BJP city unit president M Ravindra Reddy was also present during the interaction with media.

Women protesters at Morland Road in Nagpada on Thursday

MUMBAI: The Nagpada police late on Friday night registered an FIR against Mumbai Bagh protesters under Section 341 (punishment for wrongful restraint) of the Indian Penal Code after assistant municipal commissioner Alka Sasaane filed a complaint.

Sasaane claimed that the protesters were blocking the ongoing road construction work on Morland Road and causing traffic congestion. Relevant sections of the Criminal Amendment Act have also been invoked. The police said 200-300 women were siting on the road demanding the rollback of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC), despite a notice to vacate the area by Thursday 5pm.

During a press conference earlier in the day, the protesters demanded that the state government pass a resolution against NRC in the assembly session, which will begin on February 24.

The Mumbai Bagh protest , on the pattern of Delhi's Shaheen Bagh, began on January 26 with a few dozen women sitting on Morland Road. With each passing day, more women joined in. Till Thursday, more than 2,000 women would sit in protest in four shifts.

Earlier in the week, home minister Anil Deshmukh of the NCP, had requested the Mumbai Bagh delegation to call off the protest as it was held without police permission. He gave the delegation a written assurance that not a single citizen of the state would lose citizenship. Though the NCP and a group of locals appealed to the protesters to call off the sit-in, fearing possible clashes with a pro-citizenship law rally called by the Raj Thackeray-led MNS on Sunday, the women refused to budge. ""From day one, the police wanted the women to vacate the area,"" said Rubaid Ali Bhojani, a volunteer at Mumbai Bagh. ""...The women protesters were not informed about the meeting with Deshmukh. It has now been decided that now only the women protesters will lead the protest and meet state officials, if required."" A committee, comprising mostly women, is likely to formed at Mumbai Bagh, said a source.

Police have carried out flag marches in parts of the city to show they were in control of the law and order situation.

466,['8/02/2020'],‘Repel US push to lift price cap on med devices’,"This story is from February 8, 2020

NEW DELHI: Ahead of US President Donald Trump ’s visit to India, civil society has urged Prime Minister Modi to reject any proposal from the US to negotiate price control policies and demand to remove price caps imposed on medical devices, particularly stents.

In a letter to the PM, public health groups said India must not negotiate price control policies in trade and rather ensure public health policies are kept outside the purview of trade agreements.

The move comes in the wake of reports that India and the US are likely to strike a deal centered around medical devices.

“There is no precedent of India negotiating price control policies in trade and it is critical that policies meant to protect public health are kept outside the purview of trade agreements,” said the letter signed by 30 civil society organizations including Campaign for Access to Medicines-India, All India Drug Action Network and various other public health advocates and experts.

It also raised concerns about the US putting pressure on India to adopt “TRIPS-plus” intellectual property provisions, highlighting that this will extend patent protections for medicines and confer longer monopolies making drugs and other pharmaceutical products inaccessible for many patients.

“We urge that if India accepts the “TRIPS-plus” demands of the USA, it would seriously undermine the availability of affordable generic medicines in India and result in pushing more people below the poverty line due to out-of-pocket expenditure on medicines and increased costs of healthcare. Conceding to US demands for “TRIPS-plus” provisions would have a devastating impact on all the national health programs,” the letter said.

Trump is set to visit India sometime between February 21 and February 24.

So far, India has maintained a firm stand on price control, especially stents and knee implants – which were exorbitantly priced by multinationals before the government imposed price caps around three years ago. However, there is strong lobbying from the US which is home to several multinational medical device manufacturers, mainly stent makers who are trying to influence policy in their favour.

With trade talks between the two countries at a critical stage, India of late has started to evaluate and consider implementing other mechanisms including trade margin rationalisation to check prices instead of a direct price cap.

However, a price cap is certainly more effective than trade margin rationalisation which deals with only profiteering by the trade supply chain such as distributors and retailers. Unlike price cap where the government fixes the price of a medicine, in case of trade margin rationalisation the company is free to price the drug.

India imports nearly 75% of its medical devices and around 80% of this includes high-end and complex medical devices like cardiac stents and orthopaedic implants used in critical care. The US is the largest supplier of medical devices to India, catering to one-fifth of the total exports.

Visakhapatnam: Telugu Shakti president BV Ram said on Friday that politicians, both at the state and national level, are making a fool of the public on the capital issue by claiming that it does not come under the purview of the central government. “Capitals of all new states are decided by the central government,” he said.

“Who decided the capitals of Jharkhand and Uttarakhand? Who decided on the capitals of all states post independence? Who made Hyderabad the joint capital of AP and Telangana for ten years?” asked Ram while asserting that it was the central government that put Amaravati on the map after the state was bifurcated.

The Telugu Shakti president further questioned as to who appointed the Sivaramakrishnan committee. Ram said that the central government had published Amaravati as the capital of Andhra Pradesh in its gazette. He further said that people are going to see through the false statements being made by politicians of various parties.

Visakhapatnam: The women police station in the city receives at least two complaints every day. Most of these complaints are related to family disputes, differences between couples and harassment allegations. The women police station will soon be upgraded as the Disha police station with additional infrastructure and staff.

Police informed that the city’s women police station received a total of 860 complaints in 2019. A majority of these complaints were related to domestic violence and harassment by in-laws or husbands.

Around 690 complaints were disposed through counselling sessions and FIRs have been registered in 170 cases.

Prem Kajal, assistant commissioner of police of the women police station said, “Call it awareness or fight against injustice, women irrespective of academic qualification and status are approaching the women police station.”

The ACP further said that since most complaints are to do with domestic violence, experts are helping solve cases by counselling both parties.

Speaking to TOI, city police chief RK Meena said that crimes against women have come down slightly in 2019 from 2018. “The women police station is receiving more and more complaints about dowry harassments and domestic violence. Counsellors and Mahila Mitras are playing an important role in the disposal of cases,” added Meena.

Police sources said that even after the women police station becomes the Disha police station, complaints related to domestic violence and harassment will be lodged there, although the Disha Act will not be invoked in all cases its invocation will depend on severity.

Officials said that the quality of investigations in cases related to crimes against women will improve in the near future.

MUMBAI: A metropolitan magistrate's court sentenced a son to three years' rigorous imprisonment for cheating his stockbroker father by fraudulently transferring shares and bonds in his name by forging his signature. He purchased 6.5kg gold with the money, which police attached during investigations.

The court on Thursday directed that Rs 2.3 crore be paid to the father, Shripal Jain, by selling the seized gold and money lying in a bank account which was frozen during the probe. ""The remaining amount will be given to accused (Manoj Jain) after the appeal period is over.""

Economic offices wing (EOW) of Mumbai Police investigated the case, and investigating officer Milind Desai had submitted evidence in court, stating that Manoj sold the shares and bonds of his father and used the money for purchase of gold.

Jain owned SPJ Stock Brokers, where he had an 80% stake, while his sons, Manoj and Rajiv, held the remaining stake. Jain had a demat account in the name of his company, and two joint accounts with his sons. He kept a large part of the shares and bonds in the company account, and some were divided among his sons. Jain was looking after the business, while his sons were handling some other business, he told EOW in his complaint.

All were staying as a joint family in Andheri, and Jain shifted to Borivli after his wife's death in 2003. A woman, Manisha (43), would take care of him at Borivli. Jain had set up a trust in the name of his late wife, and Manisha headed the trust.

In 2015, Jain was admitted to Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital, and after discharge he found out that Manoj had transferred all shares and bonds of the company, and those in the joint account, to his account two months before, after forging his signature on the delivery instruction slip, used for transferring shares from one demat account to another.

Jain filed a case of forgery after Manoj refused to return the shares and bonds to him.

475,['8/02/2020'],‘My attackers getting timely food in jail. I languish in hospital in pain’,"This story is from February 8, 2020

Nagpur: The 20-year-old acid attack survivor from Gondia, who recuperating at the burns ward of Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), has urged the government to ensure that the perpetrators of Nirbhaya and Hinganghat cases reach the gallows for sending exemplary message to deter more such incidents.

State home minister Anil Deshmukh met the survivor on Friday assuring every possible help for her rehabilitation.

On December 18 last year, she was attacked with acid by two bike-borne persons near a bus stop at Gondia on her way to the city. Her family had high hopes from the survivor who had scored grade ‘A’ in polytechnic, following which she got direct admission in the 2nd year of BE civil in a reputed college.

The survivor, who has now missed her third semester, banged her fist on the bed in support of Telangana police’s decision to kill four alleged rapists and murderers of a Hyderabad vet in an encounter. She said justice is met when the action is stringent enough to match severity of the crime.

“I intend to express myself before the home minister that the laws should be so stringent that examples are set and crime against women are prevented,” she said, welcoming Deshmukh’s proposal for enactment of a law in Maharashtra on the lines of Andhra Pradesh, where justice is fast-tracked within 22 days. TOI met the survivor a few hours before Deshmukh.

The survivor’s elder sister, who is beside her round the clock, is her window to the world relaying information, especially the ones related to atrocities on women like the rape and murder in Hyderabad, the latest incident in Hinganghat and various legal tactics of the defence counsels in Nirbhaya case which have led to delay in hanging of the accused.

Showing solidarity for the Hinganghat victim, the 20-year-old said she is keen to become her voice and demand noose for the perpetrators. She wished her and her family luck to survive the ordeal just like her.

Expressing doubt whether the film ‘Chhapaak’, which revolves around acid attack induced the idea to assault her in similar a way, she said, “The trailer of the film was already released when the attack on me took place.”

The engineering student said crimes have increased and will rise against women in the coming days. “A man flees after the attack, the woman is left to suffer on the bed. Tell me who is going through this pain and ignominy? Me or those who did this to me?” she asked.

“What is there in the jail for them? Timely food, sleep and other cares. That’s what they are getting in jail. I am languishing in the hospital bed with medicines churning my stomach and unbearable swelling and pain of injections round the clock,” she said.

“I want to appear for both third and fourth semesters in the winter and complete my engineering following which master’s degree is my aim. So far, my family members have stood beside me and hopefully they would continue to do so,” said the survivor.

Her elder sister, who has been goading the survivor to go for civil services and become an officer or collector, questioned the system which has been deferring the hanging of Nirbhaya perpetrators. “Why a defence counsel for such accused?” she asked.

Dr Surendra Patil, head of the department of plastic, re-constructive and maxillofacial surgery, said the GMCH authorities ensured that the entire treatment of the survivor was free of cost through government schemes. “We have so far performed two surgeries. She has recovered. The grafting of the facial skin has been done too and we need to see how outcome in the next few months,” he said.

The family of the farmer had a lofty ambition around the survivor who had scored grade A in Polytechnic following which she had got a direct admission in the second year BE Civil in a reputed college.

Tell me, who is going through this pain and ignominy today? Me or that person who did it to me?” she asked rather diligently despite a feeble voice. “What is there in the jail for him? Timely food, sleep and other cares are what he is getting in jail.

“I want to appear for both third and fourth semesters in the winter and complete my engineering following which master’s degree is my aim.

Nagpur: Reports of three suspected novel coronavirus (nCoV) patients from Nagpur whose swab samples were sent to National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, have tested negative. Also, no new suspect was reported from Nagpur or surrounding region till Friday evening.

Doctors have advised people to take necessary precautions to avoid contracting any infection.

Till date, three suspects were reported to GMCH. One of them was a businessman who had returned from China on January 6. He was admitted to the GMCH isolation ward for three days. After NIV lab sent his reports as negative, he was discharged on Sunday.

On Wednesday (February 5), a girl student pursuing medical studies in China and had returned to India in January, had approached the GMCH authorities.

The same day, a businessman from Aurangabad who too had been to China in December, had approached the GMCH when he developed flu-like symptoms in Nagpur. Swab samples of both the suspects were sent to the NIV. After their reports arrived negative on Thursday evening, they were allowed to go home.

“Both government hospitals in Nagpur — GMCH and Mayo hospital — are all set to handle the coronavirus situation. The GMCH has an isolation ward ready in case of more suspects report to the hospital. The Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital (IGGMCH) is ready with the coronavirus testing lab. Citizens should not panic,” said Dr Sagar Pandey, assistant medical superintendent of IGGMCH.

Doctors have advised people to stay alert and report to any of the government hospitals in case people having China travel history develop symptoms like fever, runny nose and respiratory problems. They have also made it clear that common viral infections may occur more often in the present weather conditions and there is no need to panic.

“Viral infection cases have already surged due to sudden temperature fluctuations because of unseasonal rains. It would be better to stay safe in this atmosphere,” said physician Dr Prerna Mundhada.

Most common viral infections are due to influenza-a virus and are preventable by maintaining basic hand and respiratory hygiene, safe food practices and avoiding close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing, she said.

Reduce The Risk

Wash hands regularly with soap

Cover mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing

Thoroughly cook meat and eggs

Avoid contact with anyone showing flue-like symptoms

Avoid unprotected contact with wild or farm animals

Nagpur: Around 100 tourists, including foreigners, were held up for 1.5 hours on Friday at Kolara gate by local Gypsy owners, who have been banned by the Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR) management for encroaching upon forest land around the park.

Kolara gate near Chimur is 115km from Nagpur and, hence, is mostly preferred by tourists. Visitors who were waiting at the gate around 6am were caught off guard when their entry was blocked by kin of 8 Gypsy owners.

TATR conservator of forests (CF) & field director NR Praveen said, “These Gypsy owners are among 34 registered with us but we banned their entry as they have encroached upon forest land around Kolara and are cultivating it for the last 4-5 years.”

“Three months ago, we had asked these locals to vacate the said land to which they agreed on the condition that once they harvest the standing crop, they will free it. However, they are still in possession of the forest land. Hence, we took a decision to ban them,” Praveen told TOI.

“You cannot have best of all possible worlds. The basic aim of ecotourism is to pass on the benefits to these locals which they are getting. Instead of paying back to Tadoba, these locals are damaging tiger land which is their prime livelihood source. They want to benefit from all directions which is not possible. The ban will continue till they given an undertaking that they will vacate the encroached forest land,” Praveen added.

“These encroachments were done in last 3-4 years and don’t fall under the Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006. There are examples that locals have sold their agriculture lands to resort owners and are now eyeing forest land to encroach upon them. This is despite these locals getting benefited under various schemes like subsidised LPG connection etc,” forest officials told TOI.

Tourists expressed resentment against the behaviour of Gypsy owners. “The action against encroachers is a good move but punishing tourists is really disappointing and gives a bad name to the park, especially when there were groups of foreign visitors. No responsible officials were present at the spot to handle the early morning situation,” said Devendra Jain from Nagpur.

“Tourists missed tiger sightings in that crucial 1.5 hours. The officials should take police help for damage control in future. Tourists pay through their nose for entry. Why should they suffer? The park has a full-fledged battalion of Special Tiger Protection Force (STPF) which should have been summoned immediately,” Jain added.

Taking a cue from the incident, TATR has decided to bar entry to locals with wildlife criminal background. “We will cross-check record of guides, Gypsy owners, and temporary forest labourers (van majoors). We will see if there are any preliminary offence reports against them before involving them in works. This will also include those having offences against encroachments,” said Praveen.

The 12-year satellite imageries from February 2007-2019 show a lot of deforestation, cultivation and encroachments in the TATR landscape. A survey by TATR last year also confirmed fresh encroachments in the buffer zone after the FRA cut-off date of December 13, 2005.

After the Chinese(3.69 lakh), Indians at 2.02 lakh constitute the second largest group of international students, according to the last Open Source data, issued in November. Under the new policy memo issued by the US Citizenship and Immigration Services that came into effect from August 9, 2018, the unlawful presence clock was turned back to the date on which the international student first fell ‘out of status’.The violation of student status could be inadvertent or owing to no fault of the international student. Even a simple failure to update the designated school officer of a change in address, an unauthorised job such as babysitting, a clerical error by the DSO in entering information into the SEVIS system (database for international students) such as additional hours of on-site campus work beyond those permissible could result in a student being regarded as ‘out of status’.The repercussions were extreme. For instance, if an international student has unknowingly violated his or her student status, and this was discovered years later, it was likely that the 180 day or even 365-day period would have been crossed. An individual who accrues more than 180 days of unlawful presence before departing from the US can be barred from re-entry for three years. An individual unlawfully present in the US for more than a year is barred for 10 years.Rajiv S Khanna, managing attorney at Immigration.com , told TOI, “This decision is laudable in three respects. First, the court correctly interpreted the law and held that the USCIS had implemented a policy against the plain language of the statute. Second, the court invalidated incorrect procedures. And finally, the court refused to accept all the standard arguments the government makes in similar cases, viz, they were creating a policy and not a law.”Adam Cohen, attorney with Siskind Susser , an immigration law firm, told TOI, “Most significantly, the district court determined that the unlawful presence memo conflicts with the Immigration and Nationality Act, since under this Act, one is not deemed to be unlawfully present until ‘after the expiration of the period of stay authorised by the Attorney General’.TOI had front paged the lawsuit in its edition of October 26, 2018. The plaintiffs had submitted that the previous policy was objective. Earlier, the clock to calculate the number of days of unlawful presence began to tick from the day a government official or immigration judge adjudicated the international student as being ‘out of status’. If required, individuals could leave US within 180 days and avoid imposition of a three or 10-year re-entry.“The new policy’s use of a backdated unlawful-presence clock will render tens of thousands of international students on F, J and M visas subject to three and 10-year re-entry bars without any opportunity to cure,” the petition had stated.These educational institutions had challenged the implementation of the new unlawful presence policy memo on the grounds that the Trump administration did not engage in the required notice and comment rulemaking process, the policy was arbitrary and it violated statutory text and due process.“The government's action smacked of obvious unreasonableness and a desire to hamper legal immigration. As the court noted, international students could inadvertently break the law, causing irreparable harm to their legal status by merely moving from one dormitory to another without notifying the government,” Khanna said.Earlier, as was covered by TOI in its edition of May 6, 2019, the judge had issued a preliminary injunction from application of the policy, pending disposal of the lawsuit.Fwd.US, a group of business leaders whose founders include Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg and other known personalities has stated: “This decision is a huge rebuke to the administration’s continued efforts to restrict legal immigration avenues. This decision by the court upholds decades of precedence for how unlawful presence is counted and enforced for international students.”“The government now has 60 days to file a notice of appeal if they so choose, but as it stands, this decision is a strong rebuke of the Trump Administration’s attempt to skirt the proper notice and comment rulemaking process and to redefine immigration law,” it sums up.",world,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74023526,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110746,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-policy-that-restricted-international-students-re-entry-blocked/articleshow/74019032.cms

481,['8/02/2020'],‘Israel nearly shot down passenger plane in Syria’,"This story is from February 8, 2020

MOSCOW: Russia’s defence ministry said on Friday that Israeli air forces nearly shot down a passenger jetliner in Syria during a missile strike on the suburbs of Damascus a day earlier.

The allegation comes as tensions run high in Syria, where fighting has escalated in the northern province of Idlib. Syrian government forces, backed by the Russian military, have clashed with Turkish troops that support the opposition there after failing to observe a cease-fire. A spokesman for the Israeli PM did not respond to a request for comment.

The news of the alleged near-miss came amid jitters just a month after a Ukrainian passenger plane crashed shortly after take-off from Tehran, killing all 176 people on board. Iran said the plane was mistakenly shot down by its paramilitary Revolutionary Guard.

In a statement released on Friday, Russian defence ministry spokesperson Igor Konashenkov said the strike was carried around 2 am local time on Thursday. He said four Israeli F-16 fighter jets hit the suburbs of Damascus with eight missiles without taking into account that a passenger plane with 172 civilians on board was preparing to land in the city’s airport around the same time.

Konashenkov didn’t name the airline or flight number, saying only that it was an Airbus-320 en route from Tehran that “came near to entering the zone of a deadly anti-aircraft missile and artillery fire”. The plane had to make an emergency landing at the Hmeimeem Air Base some 300km north of Damascus, which is operated by the Russian military.

482,['8/02/2020'],PIO doc gets 3 life sentences for sex assault on patients in UK,"This story is from February 8, 2020

LONDON: An Indian-origin doctor, who exploited women’s cancer fears to carry out invasive intimate examinations, has been given three life sentences for 90 sexual assaults on female patients in London on Friday.

Manish Shah assaulted 23 women and a 15-year-old girl while working in London and was described by the sentencing judge as a “master of deception who abused his position of power”. “You made up stories which got into heads and caused panic,” said Judge Anne Molyneux at the Old Bailey court. “Your behaviour was not only sexual but was driven by your desire to control and on occasions humiliate women,” she said.

The 50-year-old doctor who claimed the assaults were “defensive medicine” was found guilty of 25 sexual offences against six victims at Mawney Medical Centre last autumn. At an earlier trial in 2018, he was convicted of offences relating to 18 other people, bringing the total number of offences to 90.

The general practitioner (GP) was found guilty following a trial in December last year, when the jury heard how he used a news story during consultation with one patient about Hollywood star Angelina Jolie having a preventative mastectomy, before asking if she would like him to examine her breasts.

“He took advantage of his position to persuade women to have invasive vaginal examinations, breast examinations and rectal examinations when there was absolutely no medical need for them to be conducted,” prosecutor Kate Bex told the jury during the trial. “Fear is an incredible motivator and few health concerns are scarier than cancer. Shah exploited that and used it for his own personal gratification,” she said.

Shah was suspended from the medical practice in 2013 when complaints came to light, resulting in investigation.

WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump said on Thursday that the US at his direction has conducted a counter-terrorism operation in Yemen that killed Qassim al-Rimi, an al-Qaida commander who claimed responsibility for last year’s deadly shooting at Naval Air Station Pensacola, where a Saudi aviation trainee killed three American sailors.

Al-Rimi is a founder of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula. “We will continue to protect the American people by tracking down and eliminating terrorists who seek to do us harm,” Trump said.

While Trump confirmed reports that al-Rimi had been killed, he did not say when the operation was conducted or offer any other details. Al-Rimi had said in an 18-minute video that his group was responsible for the December 6 shooting at the base. He called the shooter, Saudi Air Force officer Mohammed Alshamrani, a “courageous knight” and a “hero”.

The shooter opened fire inside a classroom at the base, killing three people and wounding two sheriff's deputies before one of the deputies killed him.

Al-Rimi, 41, was among the few remaining al-Qaida leaders whose terrorist pedigree traces to the era before the September 11, 2001, attacks

MUMBAI: Visitors at Dadar Chowpatty may soon be able to enjoy uninterrupted view of the sea and capture images of the Bandra-Worli Sea Link in the background, standing atop a viewing deck planned at the spot.The BMC recently discussed a proposal with the Coastal Regulation Zone, seeking its approval to set up a viewing deck resembling a jetty which visitors will be able to freely access.Corporator from the area Vishakha Raut, who is from the Shiv Sena, said that the jetty is proposed to go over a stormwater drain that is now defunct. “The stormwater drain was built for discharge of rainwater from mills in the area. But now with the mills no longer functional, the stormwater drain too has become redundant. We were, therefore, keen on setting up the viewing deck which can become a tourist site by itself,” she said.The deck, proposed to come up near Chaityabhoomi, might have ramps which will provide accessibility to the differently abled and senior citizens. It will also be lit up after sundown.Aaditya Thackeray too has been positive about the facility, said civic officials.Assistant civic commissioner Kiran Dighavkar said that coastal regulation zone - 1 (CRZ) rules apply to the site. “We’ve sought approval of the authorities. There are no plans to build anything. The existing area will have a jetty over it,” he said, adding that a design will be shown to the CRZ authorities soon.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74019040,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-595288,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bmc-plans-viewing-deck-at-dadar-beach/articleshow/74019030.cms

Saarah Yob, 23, of Florida was on a trip to New Orleans when she discovered someone had stolen her purse.

Later that day, James Elmes , 21, spotted the purse sitting on a curb with only her camera in it . He posted a photo Yob had taken of her onto Twitter on the remote chance someone would see it. Within 16 hours and 800 retweets later, he did find Yob, who was immensely grateful to get her purse back.

487,['8/02/2020'],Back to forgotten ‘analog’ basics,"This story is from February 8, 2020

Kolkata: While this column has focused mainly on the pleasures and pains of joystick-wielding gamers, there is now an imminent need to focus on the worldwide resurgence of interest in board games (or ‘analog games’, as they are now termed). Kolkata has already been responding to this new trend with board games in cafeterias (there was even a board games cafe here briefly) and toy stores, with a range of global board games and gaming events. The city has, however, come up with something even more unique: an exhibition of old board games by collectors.

‘Kolkata Koto Katha’, an initiative by bric-a-brac collectors of the city, organised a rather unique exhibition called ‘Khelar Ekal o Shekal’ (the past and present of games) last month. The exhibition focused on all kinds of games, game magazines or brochures (for example, the first issue of the Sportstar magazine or the programme of the 1945 IFA Shield match) and even matchboxes that had a games-related theme. Be it rare books on board games, Santhali toys, a strange round bagatelle board or the beautiful Ganjifa cards from Odisha and Bengal, the collectors had brought them all to the exhibition.

Apurba Kumar Panda, senior civil servant, also an avid collector and the curator of his very own museum of everyday life called Tarar Chhayay, displayed his pasha or chaupar boards together with the ivory and wooden men and the rectangular bone dice. He also possesses unique versions of the Bengali variant of snakes and ladders or Gyan Chaupar, also known as Golok Dham. As the visitor tries to work out his karmic journey on the Golok Dham board (Sri Ramakrishna commented on the game’s representation of the Hindu cycle of rebirths in his Kathamrita), right next to it is displayed the more mundane Bengali version of Monopoly. Now virtually impossible to find, the Notun Byaboshai (New Businessman) game was quite common even a couple of decades ago. Panda’s considerable collection notwithstanding, he is not exclusively a collector of games. Other collectors brought their rare sets of Ganjifa cards. Originating in Persia, the round cards come in suits of 120 or 96 and in mainly two variants, the Dashavatara and the Naksh. The rules of the game are complex and almost forgotten and the cards themselves are rare; not all sets are complete and they come from Bishnupur in Bengal (where the Foujdar family still makes them), Raghurajpur in Odisha and other parts of India.

Moving on from the Ganjifa to the European playing cards, there were numerous decks arranged in showcases. Various kinds of chessboards, the game of snakes and ladders on advertisements and toys such as tops, shuttlecocks, bagatelle boards and cowrie shells from bygone days were all on display. It’s a unique event: civil servants, cancer research scientists, journalists and amateur and professional collectors brought their life’s collections, sometimes encompassing entire sections of the hitherto neglected ludic (‘relating to games’) history of India.

Rather strangely, despite having such a rich ludic culture and being a country where many games have been invented, India does not have a museum of games and objects related to play. As far as board games are concerned, most of the research has been done by scholars from outside India; the trend, however, is seeing a change. Not from the academia or the government, but from the quotidian lives of common people and also some startups that have woken up to this lacuna in our cultural lives, there are now some initiatives to save our ludic heritage.

An exhibition of games and play by the collectors is a start, and one hopes that hallowed organisations such as the Indian Museum (with its rich collection of games and toys, including those from the Indus Valley Civilization), the Victoria Memorial Hall, the Gurusaday Dutta Museum (with its complete collection of the Bishnupur Ganjifa cards) and other museums from all over the country will also come together to showcase the rich heritage of games and play in India.

Just before leaving the exhibition, someone pointed out an item on display — an Autobridge. Dating back to 1938, this game allows one to play bridge by oneself through a mechanical device and slides. Before the arrival of the digital solitaire, now on almost every computer, this was a game that showed the shape of things to come. In an age, where the risk of losing our cultural assets is so great, let there be more exhibitions such as this one.

Kolkata: The opposition welcomed the West Bengal governor’s stance in the assembly on Friday but said that the “overflowing courtesy” from both the governor and the government, and the preceding war of nerves between the two could be “made up”.

“What has struck us is the fact that the state government, in the 25-page speech it prepared for the governor, didn’t mention a single word against the Centre. Did the governor exert his influence to bring the state government to such a position? Some say that the entire exercise was got-up,” said leader of the opposition Abdul Mannan.

Left Front legislature party leader Sujan Chakrabarty called the entire episode a “high-voltage drama”.

489,['8/02/2020'],"Jagdeep Dhankhar reads out govt-prepared speech in House, slams CAA","This story is from February 8, 2020

KOLKATA: The war of nerves between the government and the governor gave way to a truce with Jagdeep Dhankhar reading out the state government-prepared speech, including paragraphs on “contentious” issues like the new citizenship law, demonetisation and GST, at the start of the Budget session of the assembly on Friday.

“The state government is strongly against the division of people in the name of steps like the National Population Register or the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. The West Bengal assembly has passed a resolution on January 27 urging the Centre to take effective steps for repealing CAA without delay,” Dhankhar read from the prepared text. The Bengal governor, in the last few weeks, has repeatedly stressed that people holding constitutional posts should not take to the streets against the new citizenship law.

Dhankhar also read out paragraphs stating that the sudden demonetisation and GST were “bad blows to the national economy”. “There is a general air of intolerance, bigotry and hatred that is straining the variegated thread of unity. The centuries-old tradition of religious pluralism has been challenged by the tyranny of majoritarianism donning the guise of democracy,” he read out. The BJP-led government at the Centre and the Trinamool Congress-led Bengal government have taken diametrically opposite views on all these issues.

Dhankhar, in reading out from the government-prepared text, kept to his Thursday’s promise of not crossing the constitutional “Lakshman rekha” while delivering the governor’s speech. “I delivered the address in the high traditions of the Constitution. I do hope all will pay due obeisance to the Constitution. This is the only way to serve the people and enhance democratic values. I urge those in authority to desist from methodology not sanctified by the Constitution,” he tweeted after the day’s proceedings.

Dhankhar also chose to summon the three state principal auditors-general to Raj Bhavan after the day’s proceedings to scrutinise the numbers provided by the state government. (The governor, according to the Constitution, is responsible for the annual financial statement given in the Assembly.) Dhankhar later met state chief secretary Rajiva Sinha and state finance secretary H K Dwivedi for over an hour after the PAGs left. He later gave his assent to the annual financial statement.

The tone of the day was set in the morning, with Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee coming down to the Assembly portico to receive Dhankhar as he arrived for the budget session. The governor, too, approached Banerjee with folded hands and greeted her before walking into the Bidhan Sabha along with assembly Speaker Biman Banerjee.

Then, in a break from protocol, Dhankhar went straight to the Speaker’s chamber, where he spent about half-an-hour talking to the CM and others over tea.

The CM and the Speaker then saw off the governor to his car parked at the assembly portico.
