She says, “I was travelling and finishing some personal commitments once Vish wrapped up. I auditioned for two shows and bagged this one first. The supernatural genre offers great scope to perform. It’s thrilling to adorn different make-up and play larger-than-life characters.” After her stint in 'Vish', she will again be seen in a negative role in 'Aladdin'. Ask her if she has developed a liking for mean characters and she replies, “I like to take up performance-driven roles, irrespective of whether they are positive or negative. I have played both convincingly and that shows my strength as a performer. I hope I am cast in an out-of-the-box character, someday.”",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74208134,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-97057/74208134.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/hindi/debina-bonnerjee-joins-aladdin/articleshow/74208167.cms
1,['20/02/2020'],Rajini’s Marana Mass had the perfect tempo for us to perform: V.Unbeatable,"After ranking fourth in popular reality show America’s Got Talent ( AGT ), last year, Mumbai-based dance troupe V.Unbeatable wanted to redeem themselves for the latest season. This is when they settled to make Marana Mass from Rajinikanth ’s Petta their musical muse. Little did they know that the performance would go on to fetch them the coveted title of the show.“It has been our dream to win the show, and it has finally happened,” beams Om Prakash Chauhan, the co-founder and choreographer of the group. The team, who danced to the peppy Anirudh Ravichander composition, got exceptional comments from judges Heidi Klum, Simon Cowell and Howie Mandel. Songs from the south film industry have an amazing tempo, Om notes, adding that the song perfectly matched the group’s dance styles.“When we got invited to perform in the latest season (AGT Champions) season, we decided that we wanted to something extremely different and grand this time around. Our style is a mixed bag of genres that includes hip-hop, acrobatics and b-boying. So, we wanted a certain tempo in the song. There is a south Indian in the team, who often listens to songs from the south. He suggested this song. Marana Mass had the perfect tempo for us to perform,” explains Om.But, this is not the first time the team is performing to a South Indian film song. The team grooved to Maari Thara Local in the last season. The latest season came with added pressure, Om observes.“We came fourth last time and we were a bit heartbroken because we had worked continuously for six months. So, when we got an invitation for AGT Champions, we were a bit hesitant because we had very little time to prepare.It is a big deal for us to beat the world’s biggest champions,” adds Om, who choreographed the performance along with Rohit Jadhav.Their final act, which had intricate choreography involving cycles as props, took around 20 days to prepare. “We wanted the choreography to be different in the song, so that is why we used cycles. We also make sure the kids in the team are comfortable with the moves. It was important to clean up all their moves to impress the judges,” he adds. The team battled against American trapeze artistes in the finale. “Simon (Cowell) sir is extremely strict. When he feels the team is lacking even in one small move, he presses the red buzzer. Howie (Mandel) sir does not like dance much. But he loved V.Unbeatable because we do acrobatics in a unique way. He has always appreciated us for our distinct performances. We had to keep all our moves clean and prepared for two performances under a month,” Om recalls, adding that the win is a huge boost to the children in the team.Founded by Om and the late Vikas Gupta in 2012, the dance troupe includes children and teenagers from impoverished backgrounds in Mumbai. “All these kids stay in chawls and some of their families did not even have the money to pay their rents initially. Some parents are supportive and some are not. Some of them think they are not privileged enough to take up dance. But now, all the kids are settled because we have started getting a lot of gigs of late. The children are all happy because we have finally reached the position we wanted to with this big win,” Om says. And what does the future hold for the Om and his team? “Lots and lots of dance,” he adds with a grin.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74209602,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1326087/74209602.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/movies/news/rajinis-marana-mass-had-the-perfect-tempo-for-us-to-perform-v-unbeatable/articleshow/74209602.cms
2,['20/02/2020'],"Went unrecognized when we shot in public, says Dhananjaya","It is hard to get the team talking about a Suri film, and even more so with Popcorn Monkey Tiger , which has not even had a trailer release ahead of its date with audiences this week. However, when the three leads, Dhananjaya Amrutha Iyengar and Sapthami , came to our office, they let slip some details that really piqued our interests.The title, teaser and the song have given a glimpse into the story. The movie shows how my character Seena’s life journey transforms his personality. Given that it is a Suri film, one can be sure that there are interesting characters, especially the ladies, to watch out for. It is an intense, thought-provoking movie that will leave you with lots to mull over.Everyone was very professional on set. I was a techie that Suri sir spotted by chance. And the experience I have had with this team has motivated me to quit my job and pursue a filmi career.There was more focus on learning than having fun when on set. I used to get so invested in my character that when I had to cry, I could not hold back tears even after the camera stopped rolling. That is how engrossing the whole experience was. And Suri sir would insist on keeping things real. For instance, on my first day on set, Suri sir asked me to go meet Dhananjaya, but I could not spot him at all. He was sitting in a ditch, sporting a long beard. I did not even want to shake his hand — that is how convincing he looked. For the female characters too, Suri sir ensured that we were not unnecessarily dolled up and had actually asked us to put on weight. He would sometimes not even reveal where the cameras are and just ask us to focus on acting.Given how realistic it was, there were many instances where people did not recognise us. When shooting in Hubballi, Mysuru and even at the Majestic area in Bengaluru, I would often venture out, disguised as my character. On one occasion I even pretended to beg for alms.(Interjecting) Sapthami: Their rapport was such that they needed no dialogues. The two of them would communicate to each other with just their eyes (chuckles).Dhananjaya: Since I had brainstormed with Suri sir before the shoot began, there was a great level of understanding as to what was needed. My experience of working with him has been so ideal and seamless that I want to collaborate with him time and again.Dhananjaya: Given that I came from a theatre background, learning to act for the camera was a skill that I picked up gradually. But most newcomers today are well-prepared when they make their debuts. Having said that, I often shared my experiences with the newcomers on the set of Popcorn Monkey Tiger. I spoke to them about understanding the way in which the industry works, learning how to handle people, etc., so that their growth in the industry can be much faster than mine was.Dhananjaya’s advice was extremely insightful and helpful. He would tell us how to be professional and remain disciplined.I like his advice on acting the best. ‘Keep things natural,’ he’d say. I would often wonder if my makeup is out of place, but he would ask me to stop worrying about things like that and instead focus on the performance.We did not have a chronological order in mind. For instance, I started off with my natural look, then shaved my head for the ‘Monkey Seena’ phase of my character. And then, once my hair grew back, we shot the next phase. Therefore, while showcasing that journey was challenging, the brainstorming sessions with the technical team helped achieve it.Initially, whatever I knew about the underworld was from watching films and reading books. During my college days, I contested elections and was elected general secretary. Back then, there were instances of rowdyism on campus and people would call on their underworld connections to sort out tiffs. But those were one-off instances. I learnt more after playing Daali in Tagaru . In Popcorn Monkey Tiger too, the underworld is only a part of the narrative. However, with the upcoming Jayaraj biopic, I will learn a lot more about that world.I firmly believe that one cannot get typecast into negative roles because all characters have positive and negative shades. And I am taking on a variety of films too. Be it Badava Rascal or the latest family entertainer that I have signed. The latter will see me collaborating with my Jayanagar 4th Block (his popular short film) team, including D Sathya Prakash and Ajay.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74208304,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-169967/74208304.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/movies/news/went-unrecognized-when-we-shot-in-public-says-dhananjaya/articleshow/74208304.cms
3,['20/02/2020'],Coronavirus scare: Are you wearing protective masks effectively?,"Noticed how every other person these days is sporting a surgical mask to guard themselves against infections, including the deadly Coronavirus (COVID 19)? With local chemists, e-commerce websites and online pharmacies selling a variety of masks, how do you choose the right mask?Delhi-based cardiologist Dr KK Aggarwal explains, “A good mask is one that covers the mucous membranes well to prevent a person from contracting the infection. There are only two kinds of masks that need to be considered — N-95 and three-layered surgical masks. The N-95 and N-99, which filter out 95% to 99% of bacteria less than 0.3 microns in size, are expensive for the common man, and are recommended to be used by doctors and healthcare personnel who are in close contact with Coronavirus cases. The three-layered surgical masks can be worn by patients and those who want to protect themselves from an infection.”Clean hands with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water. Cover mouth and nose with mask and make sure there are no gaps between your face and the mask.Avoid touching the mask while using it; if you do, clean your hands each time with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.Replace the mask with a new one as soon as it is damp.Do not re-use single-use masks.To remove, do it from behind (do not touch the front of mask); discard immediately in a closed bin; clean hands(Source: Karnataka Health Department)“Yes, there has been a steep increase in demand for masks on the online platforms. From an average of 1,000-odd a month, we suddenly have orders for 6 lakh masks. This just shows the panic that the Coronavirus has created and that people are moving towards taking a preventive approach to health. Earlier, the demand for masks was metro-centric given the rising pollution levels. But now masks are being ordered from all over thecountry, including smaller cities.”— Meera Iyer, Chief Marketing Officer of an online pharmacy",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74208342,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-234750/74208342.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/health-fitness/health-news/coronavirus-scare-are-you-wearing-protective-masks-effectively/articleshow/74208342.cms
4,['20/02/2020'],Karan Patel: No man is perfect. Everybody needs a second chance in life and I am glad I got it.,"There was a time when actor Karan Patel was accused of unprofessional attitude. But not anymore. He says that today, he is a changed man with a more positive and diligent approach towards life. After being out of work for a long time, he got a new lease of life with the show, ' Ye Hai Mohabbatein ', which wrapped up a few months ago, after running for six years.Karan, who will now be seen in the reality show, 'Khatron Ke Khiladi', shares, “I messed up badly. Stardom got to my head, and I got too big for my boots during the course of my show, 'Kasturi' (2007-2009). I would report late, that too, drunk, on the set. I thought that I could get away with it because I had become an overnight star. But not everyone will tolerate that kind of behaviour for long. The show ended and I was out of work for a couple of years.”That phase was an eye-opener. The actor says, “I realised that stardom is a good thing to achieve, but it’s more important to know how to accept, digest and maintain it. So, I consciously made an effort to rectify my approach towards work. Now, I have disciplined myself. I used to drink on the set, which I don’t anymore. I still don’t make it on time for the shoot, but I am not as late as I used to be. I am getting there, slowly. I remember apologising to Ekta (Kapoor) for the mistakes I made in the past and telling her that I won’t repeat them. But I also told her that I will make newer mistakes. No man is perfect. Everybody needs a second chance in life and I am glad that I got it.”While tales of his fights with co-actors would often hit headlines earlier, Karan has forged a great bond with his fellow contestants on the reality show. He says, “We got along like a house on fire. In fact, we broke the ice at the Mumbai airport itself. It’s fun to meet new people. You always have a perception of others based on what you have heard about them. It’s amazing to have that perception shattered and realise that people are totally different from what you thought of them.”Talking about perception, Karan has lived with the ‘bad-boy’ image for the longest time, both on and off screen. The actor, however, says that he loves the tag and wouldn’t want to change it. He shares, “I kind of like my bad-boy image, and consciously try to maintain it. Because then, nobody can take me for a ride. Otherwise, serial actors ko bahut ullu banate hain. Having said that, I don’t do anything to earn that tag. Whatever image you have of me is your own perception. I am not putting on an act; I am just myself.”On the personal front, Karan got married to actress Ankita Bhargava in May 2015. Ask if marriage has changed him personally and professionally, and he replies, “Marriage changes everybody, be it a man or a woman. Anything that matters to you, changes you. If your marriage matters to you, it will change you and the same applies to your work. If there is something that I hold close to my heart, I will make sure to not do things that might make me lose it.”It’s just not marital bliss that he is soaking in currently. Karan embraced fatherhood in December 2019, with the birth of his daughter, Mehr. Unfortunately, the couple had a miscarriage in 2018. He shares, “Fatherhood is the best feeling in the world. We lost a daughter and then we got a daughter. I think she is back. She is just two months old and is too small to respond, but just seeing her smile lights up my day.”While he is a happy man both personally and professionally, someone else has also moved on in her life. We are talking about his former girlfriend, Kamya Panjabi . The actress tied the knot with Shalabh Dang on February 8. Karan says, “I am as happy as any of her family members. I don’t wish ill for anybody. I wish her a happy married life. More than the couple, I am thrilled for Kamya’s daughter, Aara. Kamya has been an independent and self-made woman. Everybody deserves happiness in life. I got my share, so should she and everyone else.”",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74208670,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-77906/74208670.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/hindi/karan-patel-no-man-is-perfect-everybody-needs-a-second-chance-in-life-and-i-am-glad-i-got-it-/articleshow/74208369.cms

Here are some of the tributes....I worked with Kishori ma’am in the beginning of my career in Kempe Gowda. She played my grandmother in the film. She was very lively and full of energy on the set.

Repurposing the ‘trash’

With sustainable living and lifestyle being the current watchwords for being woke and eco-conscious, there’s a village, only three-and-a-half hours drive away from Chennai, where you can actually walk this sustainable talk and check out for yourselves if this lifestyle statement will work for you in the long run. Spread across 70 acres of land, Sadhana Forest , near the Morattandi toll gate is a full-fledged project in sustainable living. Here, people are vegans, they live in huts, and they don’t use fans and air conditioners. There are no concrete roads, and rainwater is allowed to soak the soil and flow down and get collected in the pond-sized pits.On our visit, one of the volunteers, Noa, welcomed us and detailed the dos and don’ts to be followed on the campus. After the registrations, we were given a bedsheet, blanket, pillow cover and an organic soap bar, and we were taken to one of the huts. The two-storey huts are made of bamboo and tree waste, and to sleep, there is charpoy with mattress and mosquito nets. Interestingly, there are no walls and only the pillars support the hut structure.They use sustainable toilets — one for the day and the other for the night. After dusk, only the night toilet is equipped with electricity as everything else in the forest runs on solar energy. Noa says, “The compost toilet offers a two-fold benefit. A standard flush may need 15-20 litres of water per use but a compost toilet uses only about a litre per use. We use the solid waste as humanure.” There are no water taps inside these toilets and one is not allowed to pour/use water in the poo pit. Noa adds “There are two different pits — one is used only to poo and not a drop of water should enter the pit. After one is done, one has to take sawdust from the steel container kept next to the pit, and spread it over the poo until it is completely covered and close it with the pit cover. To wash oneself, one must come to the toilet that is for urinating and use the water from the steel container kept next to it.”For hand wash, big steel containers are kept near kitchen, outside toilets and huts. Noa explains, “We have handwash stations. To use water for hand wash, we have a steel mug that has a hole beneath. Next to it, there are used plastic bottles with soap water in it and the cap of the bottle has a hole. These are all suspended at handwashing height. One can pour water as much as one needs to clean the hand; but in this way, one will realise the count of each water drop.” For laundry and bathing, the volunteers carry water in buckets from a distance to the bathroom. “When you fill the heavy buckets and carry it to the bathing area, you realise how important every mug of water is. Also, before leaving, the volunteers must wash their respective sheets, blankets and pillow covers,” informs Noa.Founders of the forest, Yorit and Aviram Rozin from Israel tell us about their passion to revive the lands, bring back forests and practise sustainable living. “We have a strong love for nature and decided to devote our lives for creating forest on a barren land. ‘Sadhana’ is a Sanskrit word that means ‘a spiritual practice/discipline for self-realisation’. Our spiritual practice is centred on compassion and we strive to embody compassion in every action that we do,” says Yorit.Started in 2003, this forest in Auroville is the first project the couple started. “Since then, we have established a project in Haiti in 2010 and in Kenya in 2014. This land in Auroville belonged to the Auroville Foundation for many years and was offered to us in 2003,” says Aviram.They say that in the first year itself, they understood that planting trees is not enough. Aviram says, “The main factor in the creation of forest here is water. We started digging on contour swales and bunds, and earth dams for water conservation.” Aviram says that this work has made a huge difference in both the water table and the growth of the trees. They also plan to extend the project to the south of Tamil Nadu and to North-East India.Mary Ann McGarry, Associate Professor of Environmental Science and Policy Department, at Plymouth State University Center for the Environment, New Hampshire had flown down to learn about sustainable living and reforestation. She says that the tree planting process here is quite different from the forestry practices followed in her country. “I was impressed by their procedure. I participated in digging the uphill trench to collect water, collecting rich topsoil from different species to provide a variety of micro organisms, collecting acacia leaves for mulch, mixing the topsoil with compost (humanure that has digested for a year) and urine on charcoal, then adding this around the tree with the acacia leaves on top so that the latter will hold in moisture and cool the new saplings until the leaves are devoured by termites, providing more nutrients. Another step is inserting a plastic water bottle with a wick next to the tree. The wick releases water at a rate that can be sent in a controlled way to the top of the roots of the new tree. Opening the cap controls the flow of moisture to the tree’s roots. It’s been a learning experience.”No games or activities are encouraged on the campus as they believe that it paves way for competition. The volunteers say that competition creates ‘winners’ and ‘losers’ and that’s not aligned to the vision of a cooperative community.Waste generated on the campus is primarily sorted at their on-site recycling centre. Volunteers collect labelled bins and segregate the trash into categories of plastic, glass, paper, organic waste, metal, sanitary waste, and mixed items. These are then divided into smaller sub-categories to see which materials can be reused and repurposed.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74210161,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-788078,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/get-a-feel-of-sustainable-living-in-this-village/articleshow/74209794.cms
11,['20/02/2020'],India dedicates $2 billion a year to DRR,"This story is from February 20, 2020

NEW DELHI: The Centre has put Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) on top of its agenda with allocation of over Rs 28,000 crore for 2020-21 towards meeting disaster losses of states, half of which will be dedicated to disaster mitigation. Close to $2 billion in dedicated DRR funds annually is a new concept with the Centre gradually moving towards compensating states more on building disaster resilience than just providing for relief and rehabilitation.

Disaster losses have increased over the years and so have the reconstruction and rehabilitation of displaced population. The recovery cost of Kerala disaster (2018 floods), for instance, has been estimated at Rs 31,000 crore, whereas of Odisha (2019 cyclone Fani) is Rs 29,000 crore. Annually, for the last 20 years, India on an average, has suffered economic losses of $10 billion to disasters. Now, for the first time, based on the 15th Finance Commission recommendation, the government has allocated huge funds for DRR that aims at building resilient infrastructure and enhance mitigation efforts.

“It is also for the first time that the government has constituted National Disaster Risk Management Fund (NDRMF) which will combine both response, mitigation and long term recovery, including capacity building” said Santosh Kumar, head of governance division at the National Institute of Disaster Management , Union Home Ministry .

Similarly, the states will have Sate Disaster Risk Management Fund (SDRMF). In the next financial year starting April 1, the SDRMF have found an allocation of Rs 28,983 crore as per the recommendation of the finance panel. The Centre has contributed Rs 22,184 crore towards its share, which is 114% more than the Rs 10,344 crore provided for SDRF (State Disaster Risk Fund) in the previous year, Kumar said.

Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad and Pune with population of five million and above and facing flood risks have been allocated Rs 500 crore for DRR by enabling them to build integrated flood management infrastructure in each of these cities. An allocation of Rs 100 crore each for the three metros of Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata have been recommended and of Rs 50 crore each for Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad and Pune.

In yet to be notified rules for disaster mitigation, it will be difficult for states to demand anything in terms of relief and rehabilitation in a post-disaster scenario. “The Centre has proposed a mandatory joint study, post-disaster needs assessment (PDNA), in case of disasters of rare severity for allocation to states for reconstruction and rehabilitation,” said Kumar. This will also help India build an authentic database for disaster losses, he added. The PDNA will cover economic losses and estimation of funds needed for recovery and reconstruction of different sectors, including housing, infrastructure and livelihood. The Home ministry will issue detailed guidelines by July 2020 for recovery and reconstruction assistance.

It has also been proposed that all the 10 Northeastern and Himalayan states will undertake DRR programme to address earthquake and landslide risks. These states have been provided with an allocation of Rs 150 crore from the proposed NDMF for seismic and landslide risk reduction programmes in the coming fiscal year. Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand will get Rs 50 crore each.

Another major disaster loss is from fire incidents for which the government has provided Rs 1,000 crore for building fire safety infrastructure across the country. The NDRF will also provide Rs 1,200 crore for mitigation measures to prevent coastal and river erosion and also towards resettlement of displaced people.

14,['20/02/2020'],No solution on Day 1 of dialogue at Shaheen Bagh,"This story is from February 20, 2020

NEW DELHI: The first attempt for a dialogue between the Shaheen Bagh protesters and two senior lawyers – appointed by Supreme Court as interlocutors – resulted in an exchange of views on Wednesday. The protesters articulated their position, turning emotional at times, and the lawyers conveyed the SC’s concern and the need to find a solution. There was no breakthrough and the dialogue will continue on Thursday.

Welcoming this initiative to “hear each one of them”, the women expressed a deep sense of disappointment at having been ignored by the authorities so far. They gave an emotional account of what they had experienced during their prolonged agitation against CAA-NRC.

A huge crowd surrounded the stage from where senior lawyers Sanjay Hegde and Sadhana Ramachandran were speaking. They assured the crowd that SC had taken note of their right to protest and that engaging in a dialogue was the only way they could find a solution. “We're here to listen,"" they said, adding: “CAA had been challenged in SC but it doesn't mean that your right to protest will be taken away. But there are also rights of the people who have to commute on this route...shopkeepers have to open their shops, doctors have to reach Apollo Hospital and students have to go to schools.” Hegde had earlier read out the SC order, verbatim.

The lawyers waited for the clamour to subside. They also requested mediapersons surrounding the dais to move out of the arena so that the interaction could be held without any intervention or in-camera. This, however, upset the protesters. The lawyers then tried to clarify that they were unable to see people sitting on the ground due to the video cameras lined up in front of them.

Ramachandran, subsequently, said: “SC has sent us to tell you that a solution has to be arrived at. We want to hear you out. Do you want to talk to us?” The crowd responded in unison, “We also want to talk to you.” Ramachandran responded with: “We'll find a solution that will be a precedent for the entire world.” Former bureuacrat Wajahat Habibullah , also tasked by the court, visited the protesters later in the evening.

The first day was mostly about listening to the protesters. A young woman in the crowd asked when their concerns hadn’t been addressed while protesting at Shaheen Bagh, what was the guarantee that there could be a resolution if they moved their protest elsewhere. “We sat in extreme cold, when it rained heavily...did anyone come to see us even once? Are we not citizens of this country?” she asked, her voice breaking.

Another youngster said the entire narrative of the protests had been turned into an issue of inconvenience. “It's being projected that people are facing inconvenience. Is our convenience less than that of those who are stuck in traffic jams? We are fighting for our existence. The Shaheen Bagh model is being emulated elsewhere in the country. Ending this would bring an end to all those protests. Lies are being spread that we don't allow ambulances,” she said in a choked voice. “Solutions can be found only through a dialogue.”

Hegde, who was listening to her keenly, lauded her speech for being “clear and articulate.” He said, “Azaadi logon ke dil me basti hai….Aap agar leke chalenge toh azaadi barkarar rahegi. Azad bharat ke nagrik hain. Hum sab ke upar zimma hai. Hum sunne aaye hain. Hum sunenge.” (Freedom lives in people’s hearts. If you carry it, it will remain alive. We are people of a free India and all of us have a responsibility. We are here to listen. We will listen.”)

One youngster who had spoken earlier said, “Our voice is not of privilege. We are people who have faced struggle. We believe in the apex court of our country.” To this, Ramachandran said, “SC recognises your struggle.”

The lawyers were informed by a burqa-clad youngster that the protesters were facing threats. “We've been shot at. Our home minister says ‘aisa button dabao ki Shaheen Bagh waalon ko current lage'. The PM says people can be identified by their clothes. Am I a terrorist because I dress differently? Why is the government not engaging in a dialogue? Don't we deserve a dialogue? We’ve seen the Assam model and how people have been left out of the list of citizens,” she said.

She blamed a section of the media for the situation. “We face slander. People say women have taken five hundred rupees to sit here. You are listening to us. Do you think like that? We're educated,” she said.

One common fear expressed by these women was that if they shifted, their rights would be gone as “we don't know how many of our future generations will have to prove that they are Indian citizens.”

SARMADA, SYRIA : In Syria’s Idlib, there’s no escaping the war, so Abdullah al-Mohammed says the only way he found to reassure his daughter Salwa was to turn the shelling into a game.A video in which she laughs every time an explosion goes off was widely shared on social media in recent days as a heartening but grim reminder of Idlib residents’ daily lives.“Is it a plane or is it a mortar?” he asks as a whizzing sound grows in the background. “A mortar,” the three-year-old answers. “When it comes, we will laugh.”The video of the pair playing the game has been viewed more than two million times and drawn comparisons to the Roberto Benigni film “Life Is Beautiful”, in which a Jewish father shields his son from the horrors of a Nazi concentration camp.In another video, Salwa is standing in her father’s lap in their living room and her hearty laugh is set off by the sinister thunder of a bomb dropped by a warplane.“Tell me Salwa, what did the plane do?” the father asks his daughter. “The plane came and I laughed a lot. The plane just makes us laugh, it tells us: Laugh at me, laugh at me,” she says.Abdullah and his daughter are currently living at a friend’s house in the town of Sarmada in Idlib after being forced to flee their home in Saraqeb, which has already been retaken by Syrian regime forces and has been partly levelled by air raids.Abdullah explains that when Salwa was still 12 months old, she started crying when she heard fireworks in the neighbourhood. He had to explain that it was only the sound of children playing for Eid-ul-Fitr. “I taught [her] that it wasn't scary and she should laugh. She thinks the sounds of bombs are toy weapons,” he explains. “One day, she will know that this is the sound of death but by then, she will have understood who we are and what our story is,” Abdullah says.The north of the province of Idlib is a dead-end for hundreds of thousands of civilians displaced from other former rebel bastions across Syria. It has been described by aid groups as the world’s largest de facto open-air displacement camp.Hundreds of people, many of them children, have been killed in recent weeks as pro-regime bombardment spares nothing, from homes to hospitals.According to the United Nations , 900,000 people have been forced to flee their homes and shelters since December alone.Tens of thousands of them are left to sleep rough in the thick of winter, with temperatures dipping to -7°C in some areas last week.More than half of the displaced are children and at least seven of them have died from the cold and the bad living conditions.For those who have a shelter, the trauma of the intensive shelling is an issue that overwhelmed health services and relief organisations can scarcely address.After nearly nine years of a conflict that has killed more than 380,000 people, Salwa's father says he no longer has dreams or hope.“We are tired of sending messages, we have no aspirations. We just want these children to have a decent life,” he says.",world,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74216763,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-96692,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/a-beautiful-game-syrian-teaches-his-3-year-old-daughter-to-laugh-during-air-raids-to-drown-noise-of-shells/articleshow/74216746.cms

NEW DELHI: The last-minute tips they got from the Central Board of Secondary Education defused some of the tension that Class X and Class XII exams candidates were under. There was amusement as the edgy students read the ever-welcome tips they received from their board. “Pimples? Zero. Blackheads? Zero. Entry allowed after 10 am … ZERO”, said one of them, cautioning the students in an affectionate manner that they wouldn’t be permitted to enter the exams halls after the stipulated time.Instead of what students described as the customary “boring” and “sermonising” instructions and guidelines, CBSE has been communicating since February 15 in their own language of memes and rap, sharing one creative every day. These cool advisories are the brainchild of Anita Karwal , the board chairperson, who herself attributed the inspiration to the schoolchildren. She explained that communication becomes effective and fun when done in the language the students have embraced.There was a poetic meme on Wednesday. The ditty concerned an important aspect of the exams and read, “In exams it is compulsory to write in pens blue/ Ballpoints of any kind or gel pens will do/ Now don’t say later ‘I didn’t have a clue’”. While amused, the students were actually grateful for clarity on the point. Karwal disclosed that in a day or so, a rap song on the exams composed by a student would be released.The memes, with hashtags such as #YouCanDoIt, #beontime, #theunstoppableyou and many others, are trending on social media. Students too have been reciprocating and engaging with the memes. From expressing their “shock” at seeing the board resorting to pop expression to humorous responses along similar lines, students have taken to the ploy. Many, of course, are also getting their queries answered directly by CBSE officials.The meme saga started with one that showed a fist-pumping youngster with the text reading, “Completed syllabus before everyone else”. This was followed by others, among them subject-related ones. For the legal studies, the meme showed a tot in lawyer’s robes saying, “Hard work pays Mee Lord — there is evidence to support this statement”. For physics, a kindly looking Albert Einstein (should have been Isaac Newton perhaps) warns, “Gravitation cannot be held responsible for you not getting up on time for study and exams”.Buoyed by the reaction of the students, Karwal said, “We think we will continue this practice of modern communication even during non-exam days, though the frequency will be need based.”It all started with a brainstorming session in which the youthful mode was identified and confirmed. CBSE sources said that an ad agency was approached, though the in-house effort was guided by Karwal herself creating some memes. The CBSE chairperson said, “The credit goes to the students for making us learn their language and style of communication. The students are also creating the memes for us.”",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74216956,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-436464,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/laughter-is-cbses-medicine-before-exams/articleshow/74216953.cms
28,['20/02/2020'],"Image, voice match to help authenticate migrant voters","NEW DELHI: Apart from Aadhaar authentication through proposed Aadhaar-voter ID linkage, the EC plans to use image matching with liveliness test and voice biometric authentication to conclusively identify migrant voters as they vote remotely at designated ‘national polling stations’, away from the constituency where they are registered.EC sources had on Tuesday told TOI that the government had indicated to the poll panel that a Cabinet note was being readied proposing suitable amendments in the law to empower EC to link voter ID and Aadhaar number. This would enable the electoral registration officer to identify a voter with his unique 12-digit Aadhaar ID and also allow Aadhaar verification as a prerequisite for the polling agent to identify a person prior to voting.While EC had originally proposed amendments to both R P Act and Aadhaar Act to legally empower itself to link Aadhaar number with voter ID, the latest legal opinion — as indicated by an EC source — states that an amendment to R P Act should suffice without any need to change Aadhaar law. “The SC had in its 2018 verdict called for Aadhaar authentication only with statutory backing. R P Act amendment will offer that statutory backing to EC,” said an officer.As per the scheme drawn up by EC to roll out ‘remote’ voting by persons beyond the boundaries of their own assembly/Lok Sabha constituency, they will be required to indicate to the returning officer an intent to vote remotely so that the EVM vote at their respective polling station can be cancelled. They would then have the option to vote electronically at national polling booths set up at a chosen remote location.Voting shall be done remotely on a secure, standalone and whitelisted computer device deployed by EC. “However, with technical improvements over time, we expect to enable a voter to vote anywhere, anytime and using any device,” said an EC officer.On voting day, three types of technologies are proposed for authentication of ‘remote’ voters. The first involves Aadhaar authentication through biometrics like iris and fingerprints. Second is face recognition technology with in-built liveliness test where a person must move his head as directed to rule out the possibility of his being a photo or wearing a mask. Third is voice biometric authentication. Since Aadhaar does not provide for storage of data, the trail of this voter authentication will be preserved through video recording and webcasting. This will help maintain a record that the same person and not just anybody has voted. An electronic postal ballot will be issued to the voter for his respective constituency along with a QR code . The ballot will be encrypted.A blockchain-enabled controlled environment voting protocol, which is still under R&D stage, may be used by the voter. A hashcode, which will change if the vote is tampered with, will he generated to allow concerned candidates, political parties and returning officers to know that such a voter will be voting remotely for a particular constituency, track that the vote was cast and subsequently tally the same with remote votes up for counting on counting day.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74219692,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-81816,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/image-voice-match-to-help-authenticate-migrant-voters/articleshow/74217040.cms

NEW DELHI: The government has appointed former IAS officer and secretary to the President Sanjay Kothari as the central vigilance commissioner. Former information and broadcasting secretary and senior-most information commissioner Bimal Julka was named the central information commissioner.

The decision to fill the two top posts was taken at meeting of the respective selection panels comprising PM Narendra Modi , leader of the largest opposition party in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury and home minister Amit Shah on Tuesday.

While the CVC’s post was vacant since the retirement of KV Chowdary in June last year and vigilance commissioner Sharad Kumar had been holding charge, the CIC’s post has been vacant for more than a month following Sudhir Bhargava ’s retirement in January Chowdhury is said to have raised objections to anomalies in the selection process and infirmities in the search committee. He termed the appointment as unconstitutional and illegal but refrained from submitting a formal dissent note.

Congress on Wednesday slammed the government and claimed that both “procedure and propriety” were “thrown to the winds at the level of the PM and home minister”. “We demand that the entire process be scrapped in its entirety and a de novo process started by inviting applications afresh. There needs to be proper application of mind,” Congress spokesperson Manish Tewari said, pointing to the “anomaly” that a member of the search committee — former finance secretary Rajiv Kumar — was also an applicant for the post of CVC.

NEW DELHI: As they line-up funds to pay the telecom department following the order of the Supreme Court on AGR (adjusted gross revenue) matter, stressed telecom companies Vodafone Idea and Airtel are understood to have made a series of suggestions to the government to help them tide over the difficult times. Among them is a plan to give more time to the companies to make the AGR dues payment, while also giving them access to easier funding facilitated by the government so that payments can be made accordingly.Sources said the companies have been saying that a government bailout is essential at this point in time, especially as the relief offered by the high-powered Committee of Secretaries (CoS) — which is now disbanded — was “insufficient, and not in line with the current needs of the industry”. The CoS had given a two-year moratorium on spectrum payments to the industry, and had measured its value at Rs 42,000 crore.Vodafone Idea chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla and Airtel chief Sunil Mittal have been holding a series of meetings with the government now, where they have particularly focused on increasing the viability of the sector. They have held meetings with high-ranking officials of the department of telecom (DoT), as well as finance ministry functionaries.Vodafone Idea has been clear that the survival of the company hinges on a support package from the government, as the company has failed to receive any relief from the top court so far.Interestingly, Reliance Jio — the biggest telecom company — has so far not made any particular demand for a larger bailout package, especially as it remains profitable and has been witnessing rapid growth. The stand of Jio and its potential opposition to any special package — only for the financially-weaker mobile operators — may also dissuade the government from working out a special plan only for a few. Unlike others, Jio’s AGR dues were a meagre Rs 200 crore, which it paid by January 23, the last date of payment that had been fixed by the top court.The request of Vodafone Idea and Airtel for a relief comes at a time when the DoT is initiating steps to recover their dues, including potentially invoking the bank guarantees of the companies for failure to clear full dues. The ministry is taking legal opinion on the matter, including a view from the Solicitor General Tushar Mehta.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74219419,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1020440,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/voda-idea-airtel-seek-bailout-package-more-time-to-pay/articleshow/74217179.cms

HUBBALLI: Striking out on a less-trodden path, a Lingayat mutt in Gadag district of north Karnataka is set to make a Muslim youth its pontiff. Diwan Sharief Rahimansab Mulla, 33, who will be incepted on February 26, said he was influenced by the teachings of 12th -century reformer Basavanna since childhood and would work towards his ideals of social justice and harmony.Sharief will become pontiff of the Murugharajendra Koraneshwara Shantidhama mutt in Asuti village, which is linked to the 350-year-old Koraneshwara Sansthan mutt in Khajuri village in Kalaburagi. They rank among the 361 mutts of Sri Jagadguru Murugharajendra mutt of Chitradurga, which draw lakhs of followers from across Karnataka and Maharashtra , besides other parts of the country.“Basava’s philosophies are universal and we embrace followers irrespective of caste and religion. He had dreamed of social justice and harmony in the 12th century and following his teachings, the mutt has opened its doors to all,” said Murugharajendra Koraneshwar Shivayogi, pontiff of the Khajuri mutt.Influenced by Shivayogi’s discourses in Asuti, Sharief’s father, the late Rahimansab Mulla, donated two acres to set up a mutt in the village. Shivayogi said the Asuti mutt has been functioning for 2-3 years now and construction of the premises was on.“Sharief is dedicated to Basava’s philosophy and has been living by those tenets. His father was also a staunch follower and had obtained ‘linga deeksha’ from us. Sharief took ‘deeksha’ on November 10, 2019,” the pontiff said. “We have trained him on the various facets of Lingayat religion and Basavanna’s teachings over the past three years.”Sharief said he was drawn to Basava’s teachings since childhood. “I used to run a flour mill in neighbouring Menasagi village and, in my free time, conducted discourses on the Vachanas authored by Basavanna and other Sharanas of the 12th century. Murugharajendra Swamiji recognised my small service and took me under his wings,” Sharief said. “I will move on the same path propagated by Basavanna and my mentor.”Sharief is married and father to three daughters and a son and appointment of a family man as pontiff is still uncommon in Lingayat s. “Lingayat religion believes in sadgati (salvation) through sansar (family). A family man can become a swami and take up social and spiritual work,” said Shivayogi. “All devotees of the mutt have backed Sharief to be made pontiff. It is an opportunity for us to uphold Basavanna’s ideal of a ‘kalyana rajya’ (welfare state).”Dyamanna Hadli, Sharanappa Karkikatti and Santosh Balutagi , who are among the prominent members of the mutt, said they were proud of their village setting an example. “We have seen hate and violent struggles on grounds of caste and religion. And such fights break out even over who will become pontiff of a mutt,” said Hadli. “But our Koraneshwar Mutt is charting an inspiring path by appointing a Muslim as pontiff of a Lingayat mutt.”“Irrespective of caste and religion, all devotees of the village are followers of this mutt. We have unanimously backed Sharief,” said Balutagi.In Video: 33-year-old Muslim to head Lingayat mutt in Karnataka",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74217293,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-279363,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/muslim-to-head-lingayat-math-in-karnataka/articleshow/74217296.cms

37,['20/02/2020'],Mamata Banerjee blames Centre’s ‘vendetta politics’ for Tapas Paul’s death,"This story is from February 20, 2020

KOLKATA: Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday blamed the Centre’s “vendetta politics” for the “untimely demise” of former Trinamool Congress MP and matinee idol Tapas Paul .

Paul passed away at a Mumbai hospital early on Tuesday after a cardiac arrest. People close to him have said “he was not the same person” after spending 13 months in custody following his arrest for alleged involvement in the Rose Valley scam.

Mamata, while condoling the bereaved family before Paul’s last rites, said the actor-turned-politician had “left before he came to know what his fault was”. She went on to add that Paul was not the “sole victim”. Bengal former minister Sultan Ahmed and former TMC MP Prasun Banerjee’s wife, too, died early because of the “humiliation” they faced because of the Centre’s “retaliation conspiracy”, she added. Both Ahmed and Prasun Banerjee were named by CBI in its FIR in the Narada case.

“I am being forced to repeat something that I have said earlier. Some mistook me at that time and felt what I had said was out of political compulsion. But that was not the case. Tapas felt mentally shattered, ruined after an agency put Bengal’s number-one actor behind bars for no less than one year and one month. He could not take the insult any longer. He left us before he came to know what his fault was,” the CM said, alluding to Paul’s CBI arrest and time spent in custody.

“I came to know from Sudipda (Trinamool Lok Sabha leader Sudip Bandyopadhyay ), who too was in custody, that Tapas was arrested because he drew salary as a director of an entertainment channel run by the company that was under CBI scanner. Tollywood stars work with several production houses and entertainment channels. Some are also brand ambassadors. But they are falling victim to vendetta politics. Is this fair?” Mamata said.

Referring to Ahmed’s death, Mamata said: “I came to know from his family that he got a letter and a phone call and then went to the washroom and died.”

Mamata’s comments drew sharp criticism from Union minister and Paul’s tinsel-town friend Babul Supriyo, who condemned “the nasty politics” over the actor’s death. “I want to ask her why she chose to avoid Paul when he was in custody in a room next to Sudip Bandyopadhyay’s. She went to Bhubaneswar and paid a visit to Bandyopadhyay but ignored Paul,” Supriyo tweeted.

38,['20/02/2020'],State BJP president hits out at PK,"This story is from February 20, 2020

PATNA: State BJP president Dr Sanjay Kumar on Wednesday made a blistering attack on poll strategist Prashant Kishor by calling him names.

On Tuesday, Prashant opened his cards by announcing that he intends to change the political scenario by adhering to the ‘five to ten year strategy” with an eye on transforming the state’s economic and social life through the participation of youths. He also said that discussions would be held under the programme ‘Baat Bihar Ki’, guided by his ideology of ‘egalitarian humanism’ rooted in Gandhian values and tied to the philosophy enshrined in the Preamble of the Constitution, i.e. liberty, equality, fraternity and secularism. Known as a man who thinks in terms of numbers and data, Kishor also laid bare his ambition of enrolling 10 million members for his campaign by June this year.

In his post on the social media released on Wednesday, the state BJP president dismissed Prashant’s claims of transforming the state. He called it as an exercise in self-delusion, besides calling him names – like ‘speaker’ or ‘bhonpu’ of the old loudspeaker system, ‘political businessman’, a ‘booth-looter’ of the 1990s era, who himself intends to become a public representative.

As to Prashant’s eminence as a poll strategist, Jaisawal dismissed it saying: “The singular point about him is that he first gives free service to a winning political party in any state and then claims its victory as his own.”

“The ‘Chai Pe Charcha’, which Prashant had introduced during the run up to the victory of the BJP in the 2014 parliamentary elections under the leadership of the party’s PM candidate Narendra Modi was a successful venture. However, Prashant failed miserably during the 2017 assembly elections in UP by organising ‘Khaat Pe Charcha’ that adversely affected the success of the two so-called youth leaders – the then UP CM Akhilesh Yadav and former Congress president Rahul Gandhi,” Jaisawal added.

39,['20/02/2020'],Vijay Shankar Rai new NOU registrar,"This story is from February 20, 2020

PATNA: It seems that the experiment carried out by the then governor-cum-chancellor Satya Pal Malik in April, 2018 for streamlining the administrative structure of the universities in Bihar by appointing retired army personnel as registrars has failed to yield the desired results. One after another these officials are being eased out.

The service of Nalanda Open University (NOU) registrar, Wing Commander S K Sharma, was terminated by governor-cum-chancellor Phagu Chauhan on Wednesday on the ground of his “unsatisfactory performance”. He had been appointed as the registrar on December 10, 2018.

Malik had appointed retired army personnel as registrars in 10 of the 12 universities in the state on April 4, 2018. This was in distinct departure from the conventional practice of appointing academics or civil servants as registrars. However, academics had expressed their apprehension on the success of the experiment.

After terminating the service of Sharma on Wednesday, Chauhan appointed Vijay Shankar Rai as the new registrar of NOU. Earlier, a confidential performance appraisal report was sought from all the vice-chancellors (VC) regarding the performance and conduct of registrars in universities. On account of the report of Sharma’s “unsatisfactory performance” received from NOU VC Gulab Chand Ram Jaiswal, the chancellor ordered for the termination of his service. Rai was appointed as the new registrar from among the names figuring in the panel submitted by the VC.

Meanwhile, the Patna high court on Tuesday stayed the termination of NOU registrar (examinations) S P Sinha, who had earlier been granted two years’ extension on contact basis after his retirement and removed from the post in the middle of his extension period. In the meantime, Sanjay Kumar of Patliputra University had joined as the new registrar (examinations) of NOU.

40,['20/02/2020'],"CBI traces ex Carbide official to Nagpur, produces him in court","This story is from February 20, 2020

Shakil Qureshi has been bed-ridden following a paralytic attack

Bhopal: Shakeel Qureshi, the only eyewitness and accused hailing from Bhopal among the eight Union Carbide of India (UCIL) officials put to criminal trial for Bhopal gas disaster of 1984, was produced in the district court on Wednesday. Qureshi, who had gone missing, was traced to Nagpur by the CBI and brought to Bhopal in an ambulance as he is bed-ridden due to paralysis.

District & sessions judge, R K Verma, who had directed the CBI to trace Qureshi and produce him in court, came up to the ambulance himself to see his condition and later granted him bail on medical ground.

Qureshi, who was a supervisor at the Union Carbide Bhopal factory and shift in-charge on the intervening night of December 2-3 when the deadly MIC gas leaked into the atmosphere and turned Bhopal into gas chamber, was the only accused who was a regular during hearing of the criminal case against Indian officials of UCIL at the trial court – the court of chief judicial magistrate. Rest of the accused had received exemption from personal appearance at the outset of trial itself and was later seen in court on the day of verdict in June 2010.

But, after he, was awarded a suspended sentence of two years like all the other accused and released on bail, he disappeared and stopped attending hearings of the case in the appellate court of district & sessions judge, where both the CBI and the convicts filed appeal against the CJM court order. While CBI has prayed the court for a more stringent punishment to the convicts, the latter have sought acquittal, pleading not guilty.

During hearing in the sessions court, Qureshi’s absence didn’t raise eyebrows initially since he was on bail and it was not mandatory for him to be personally present during hearing in the court though people talked to each other about his absence and was it because of bad health, but later, it turned out that he was “missing”.

Meanwhile, counsel for two of the accused in the case, Anarbon Roy, started arguing in the court that the only person who knew the “whole truth” about the MIC leak and how it happened was Shakeel Qureshi since he was not only the shift in-charge that night but was also present in the MIC room when the gas leaked. It was an extension of the “conspiracy theory” which defence lawyers had pushed in the beginning of the trial stating that someone from among the Carbide staff had deliberately mixed water in the MIC tank that led to its evaporation and escape into the atmosphere.

During past couple of hearings, district & sessions judge, Bhopal, R K Verma, had insisted with the CBI officials that Qureshi must be traced and produced in the court. He had asked for personal presence of CBI SP if the agency fails to produce Qureshi on the next hearing. An arrest warrant was also issued against him.

On his arrival at the court, it was revealed that Qureshi along with his family had shifted to Nagpur, where he had started a business but of late, he has been bed-ridden following a paralytic stroke.

The judge after examining his condition granted him bail on medical grounds on furnishing personal bonds of Rs 1 lakh each and payment of a penalty of Rs 10,000.

The seized lamp and calendar

Bhopal: Even after 24 hours of seizing a truck load of Nawab and British-era documents, crime branch cops were in a fix whether to register a case in the matter or not. Officials from district administration, including revenue, land record and archaeology department, investigated the seized goods the entire day on Wednesday, but could not reach any conclusion. Now a team of national archives, Waqf Board and Aukaf-e-Shahi will investigate the documents on Thursday and decide whether there was any irregularity.

The crime branch has detained two Gujarat-based collectors who allegedly purchased the documents as scrap from an heir of Nawab family for Rs 1 lakh. The detained men told police that they collect letters and documents having autographs and monos of erstwhile kings and nawabs.

Police said that the Gujarat-based men had purchased scrap from Nawab heirs earlier too. In 2014, they purchased the items throught a middleman, recently, they contacted the Nawab family directly.

Police had received a tip-off, and as soon as the truck left Ahmedabad Palace, the crime branch team nabbed the buyers. They were identified as Bhavik Barod from Ahmedabad and Vipul Mehta from Morbi in Gujarat. Barod says he is president of Gujarat Coin society. Mehta too is in a similar profession and traces erstwhile royal families.

ASP Nishchal Jharia said, the goods seized include letters, hand-made maps, invitations, two lamps, a metal calender and other documents. Most of the documents have been destroyed by termites. Police suspect that the signatures and mono of Nawab family could be misused and it is being investigated.

ASP Jharia said that Barod and Mehta could not produce satisfactory documents for purchase of antique documents or to prove that they have held exhibitions in the past. The matter is under investigation.

Surat: The Diamond City has also started feeling the heat of US president Donald Trump’s visit next week. Surat Fire and Emergency Services (SFES) have deployed 10 firefighters at multiple locations in the city prior to the US president’s visit. The firefighters have been deployed at these locations to tackle any fire incident within a short time.

The firefighters have been deployed at Piplod, Godadara, Limbayat, Pandesara, Yogi Chowk, Begumwadi, Sarthana, Rander, Mini Bazaar in Varachha and Singanpore. The firefighters are deployed on spots that are on the main road and from where nearby area is easily accessible.

“As part of the instructions from top officials we have deployed the fire fighters in ready-to-move position at 10 locations in the city. The firefighters will be deployed at these locations till the US president’s visit ends. This is being done to prevent any major fire incident and also to address any fire within minutes,” said Basant Pareek, chief fire office, SFES.

“Where the distance between two fire stations is more we have deployed these firefighters in centre so that they can reach the spot of fire immediately. These locations have been identified strategically, considering the density and reachability of nearby areas,” said the officer.

“Earlier if it took five minutes for the firefighters to reach the spot from fire station, now it would take two to three minutes,” the officer added.

Begumwadi near Textile Market area, Sarthana, Pandesara and Singanpore are some of the areas where fire incidents get reported on regular interval.

“It is surprising that fire department is taking preventive actions for Trump’s visit in Surat that is over 260 km away from Ahmedabad. Fire department should show the same alertness on regular days for common citizens,” said Aslam Cyclewala, Congress councillor in Surat Municipal Corporation.

Surat: The Surat Municipal Corporation’s (SMC) town planning department on Wednesday started a mega demolition drive for the widening of the road on the Pal-Umara bridge route in Umara.

The demolition staff reached the spot with JCB machines and started the demolition of the compound walls and other properties for the 80-feet widening of the road connecting the Pal-Umara bridge in Umara area. About 40,000 square feet of construction including compound walls, entry gates, sheds and a portion of a public garden will be demolished.

Sources said there was an altercation with few residents when the demolition staff reached the spot with three JCB machines and a staff of more than 20 civic officials and policemen. After the intervention of senior civic officials, the residents decided to cooperate with the demolition exercise.

It must be noted that there are about 20 families residing on the 1,800 square metres of land obstructing the construction of the approach end at Umara. The civic body has been trying to convince the families to vacate their houses, but only seven families have agreed so far. However, the civic body has issued notices inviting suggestions from the residents till February 26. The road alignment will be announced after getting the approval of the standing committee.

Ketan Patel, deputy municipal commissioner and head of town planning department, told TOI: “We have started the exercise of clearing encroachments in 40,000 square feet area for the 80 feet road widening on the Pal-Umara bridge route from Wednesday.”

“We have set the target of clearing all the encroachments including the 20 houses under the occupied land of the bridge’s approach end in the next one month,” added Patel.

According to Patel, the civic body has reached a compromise formula for the 20 families for giving them alternate plots equal to the size of their present residential property with cumulative construction amount of Rs 2.50 crore. Even the families have been offered Rs 12,000 monthly rent till their new houses get ready.

Akshay Pandya, executive engineer of SMC’s bridge cell, said, “About 95% of the bridge has been completed for the last two years. But due to the issue of the residents occupying the land, we are unable to construct the approach end. Once the bridge is completed, it will help more than 15 lakh people travelling in Pal and Umara areas.”

44,['20/02/2020'],Patna temples decked up for Mahashivaratri tomorrow,"This story is from February 20, 2020

PATNA: Adorned with flowers and illuminated with colourful lights, temples across the city are making arrangements for Mahashivaratri , which will be celebrated on Friday.

Talking about the importance of Mahashivaratri, Dhananjaya Upadhyay, a priest at the Shiva Temple in Khajpura, said, “As the name suggests, Mahashivaratri is a grand festival. It is believed that worshipping Lord Shiva on this day can fulfil all your desires and wishes.”

Thousands of devotees from across the city visit the famous Khajpura temple on Mahashivaratri. Programmes like ‘bhajan-kirtan’ are also organized on the occasion.

Another priest, Arvind Pandey, told this newspaper on Wednesday, “As per Hindu mythology, Lord Shiva married Goddess Parvati on Mahashivaratri. Hence, the day has great significance among couples and unmarried girls.”

A number of devotees also perform rituals like ‘rudrabhishek’ on Mahashivaratri.

Harikant Prasad, an official at the Mahavir Temple near the Patna Junction, claimed, “There are three ‘shivalingas’ in the temple. Around 50 devotees perform ‘rudrabhishek’ here on Mahashivaratri and are given an hour’s time for the rituals. Others chant mantras and pray to the Lord,” ,

The Jaleshwar Mahadev Temple in Kankarbagh also witnesses a huge rush of devotees on Mahashivaratri. Temple secretary Ajay Yadav said, “More than 1,000 devotees visit the temple, which is decorated with flowers and lights. They offer flowers, milk and honey to the ‘shivalinga’.”

Meanwhile, the district administration is gearing up to tighten security arrangements across the city in order to keep tabs on the large number of devotees, who will visit Shiva temples on Friday. Plans for an alternate traffic arrangement are also being made.

City SP (central) Vinay Tiwari said additional police personnel would be deployed for crowd management in temples, especially the one in Khajpura. “Several processions from different parts of the city culminate at the Khajpura Shiva Temple due to which the area remains crowded throughout the day. Cops will also be deputed on routes that lead to the temple,” he added.

Drug peddlers with the consignment

Varanasi: A team from the Varanasi unit of the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) seized 20 quintals of ganja , worth Rs 3 crore, on Wednesday and arrested two members of an interstate gang of drug peddlers.

DRI officials said they acted on a tip-off and cordoned off the area between Tengra turn and Dafi toll plaza.

The team intercepted a truck (UP 63 T-2869) and arrested the men, later identified as Mataru Shankar Bind of Kachhwa, Mirzapur district, and Mohammed Khurshid of Koraput, Odisha.

The ganja was packed in plastic bags. During interrogation, Bind and Khurshid confessed that they were smuggling ganja for a long time for druglords in UP, Haryana and Delhi. They mostly procured ganja from Odisha and brought it to UP via Chhattisgarh.

This was the second major ganja haul by the DRI in recent months. It had seized 12 quintals, being supplied to Varanasi and Mirzapur, in October 2019.

46,['20/02/2020'],Cayman 1st on fin secrecy index,"This story is from February 20, 2020

Lubna Kably | TNN

Mumbai: Switzerland no longer retains the top position in the newly released financial secrecy index (FSI-2020) — a slot occupied by it since 2011. Cayman Islands is ranked first, moving up two slots from the 2018 ranking. The US continued to retain its second position.

Tax Justice Network (TJN), an independent international entity that pushes for transparency, ranks countries on the size and secretiveness of their financial sectors every two years. It examines how intensely the country’s legal and financial system allows wealthy individuals and criminals to hide and launder money.

Parameters used in the ranking include automatic exchange of information and registration of beneficial ownership. According to TJN, an estimated $21-32 trillion of private financial wealth is located, untaxed or lightly taxed in secrecy jurisdictions (tax havens) around the world.

Switzerland’s reduced role in financial secrecy is partly due to the increasing number of countries with which it automatically exchanges information under the ‘Common Reporting Standard’.

It is also partly owing to a reduction in the volume of financial activity conducted in Switzerland by non-residents, states TJN.

India is among the 75-plus countries with which Switzerland’s Federal Tax Administration has shared information on financial accounts under the automatic exchange route. The first tranche of such information was made available to India in October last year, which will help tax authorities here to take action against black money stashed overseas.

The US is yet to sign up on the Common Reporting Standard. Primarily, an increase of 21% in the volume of financial services provided to non-residents has pushed Cayman Islands to the first slot. In its release issued late night (India time) on Tuesday, TJN is quick to point out that the ranking is about the present. Its goal is to draw attention to the top countries who are currently the largest contributors to global financial secrecy.

The fact that a country is no longer in the top 10 does not mean that it got any better, perhaps other countries got much worse, adds TNJ. A quick comparison of the top 10 countries in the last and current index shows that Japan , Netherlands and British Virgin Islands (BVI) are now among the top 10 in the FSI. On the other hand, Germany, Taiwan and Guernsey have dropped off the top 10 indices.

Countries such as the US, Singapore , Japan, the Netherlands and the UAE — which figure in the top 10 list of FSI-2020 (and are perceived as actively promoting secrecy in global finance) — are also among the top 10 FDI investors to India (see graphic).

TJN’s FSI ranking is based on a combination of a country’s secrecy score and a scale-weightage based on the country’s share in the global market for its offshore financial services. Thus, for instance, even though India’s top FDI investor Mauritius has a secrecy score of 72, it is ranked lower at 51 as compared to Singapore since Mauritius accounts for less than 1% of the global market for offshore financial services.

Singapore is India’s second-largest FDI investor and has a lower secrecy score of 65 points, but is ranked at fifth position in the secrecy index as its financial services account for over 5% in the global market.

In 2017, Mauritius signed the multilateral instrument (MLI) under the OECD-led ‘Base Erosion and Profit Shifting’ (BEPS) project, aimed at preventing treaty abuse. However, it kept its treaty with India outside the MLI, stating that it will engage in bilateral negotiations.

While the UK, which is the sixth largest FDI source for India, is not in the top 10 FSI-2020, it has increased its secrecy score more than any other country, catapulting it from 23rd on the 2018 index to 12th on the 2020 version. Additionally, Cayman Islands and BVI are also British Overseas Territories where the UK has full powers to impose or veto law-making.

The three-day mega meeting of Jain monks in Surat ended on Tuesday.

SURAT: Prominent monks from 18 different Jain sects have exhorted the community and followers to specifically mention ‘Jain’ as their religion in the upcoming census.

This was one of the key decisions taken at the three-day meeting of Jain monks held in the city to discuss important issues concerning the religion.

“Everyone was of the opinion that Jains only mention details of their sub-sects and don’t name the religion categorically. Therefore, the monks have urged everyone to mention ‘Jain’ as religion , which will also help get the exact numbers of community members in the census,’’ said a prominent Jain leader who participated in the three-day brainstorming sessions.

As many as 36 prominent Jain monks met at Guru Ram Pavan Bhoomi at Pal in Surat.

According to the last census, there are 44.52 lakh Jains in India.

Shree Tapagachchiya Shraman Sammelan , the first such meeting to discuss reforms in Jain community, was held in temple town Palitana in 2016. The Surat meet was called to discuss the outcome of the first meeting. Eighteen sects of Shwetambar branch of Jainism had come together to discuss the common issues and nearly 2,500 monks and nuns had participated.

“Monks reviewed the resolutions passed in Palitana. Asking followers to clearly mention their religion as Jain in religion section in census was one of the four important decisions taken,’’ Jain leader Shrenik Vidani , told TOI.

Besides this, the monks also called upon the Jain youths to refrain from commenting or forwarding social media posts criticizing the ascetics.

“Monks deliberated on various important issues and resolutions which had been passed in 2016 meet but its’ outcome has not been declared so far, ’said a Jain leader.

Among those who attended the Surat mega meet included Abhaydevsuri Maharaj and Dolatsagarsuri Maharaj. Acharyas of all 18 sects along with the Jain leaders were present at the event.

PATNA: Agencies laying sewerage network under Namami Gange project and those laying gas pipeline will now have to take permission from executive engineer of road construction department (RCD) before digging the roads. The executive engineer will hold weekly meeting with the agencies concerned in this regard. The agencies will have to inform him about their work plans.

These decisions were taken at a high level meeting attended by road construction department (RCD) and urban developmental and housing department (UDHD) officials as well as several MLAs and ward councillors on Wednesday.

“Officials of the two departments have been asked to work in close coordination and make plans before digging up the roads,” RCD minister Nand Kishor Yadav said. He added that digging will now be allowed only on those roads which can be repaired before June. “The remaining work will be done after monsoon,” the minister said.

At the meeting, the officials were also asked to initiate measures to avoid waterlogging during monsoon.

Among others, this meeting was attended by UDHD minister Suresh Kumar Sharma, MLAs Arun Kumar Sinha, Nitin Navin, Sanjeev Chaurasia, Asha Sinha, RCD principal secretary Amrit Lal Mena, UDHD secretary Anand Kihsor and Patna divisional commissioner Sanjay Kumar Agarwal.

Prashant Kishor

PATNA: Expelled JD (U) functionary Prashant Kishor ’s announcement to launch a campaign targeting the state’s youth has set the ball rolling for political machinations to begin ahead of the assembly election slated to be held later this year.

Despite his two-hour long interaction with mediapersons here on Tuesday, Prashant has kept the media and poll pundits guessing about his plans behind enrolling 10 lakh youths from the state in 100 days. “These youths would choose a leader to usher the state into a faster pace of development, and bring Bihar among the top 10 in the next 10 years,” Kishor had said.

Social scientist and professor of economics at Patna-based A N Sinha Institute of Social Studies, DM Diwakar, is of the view that Kishor is testing the waters in the state’s poll arena, which is why he did not make any direct attacks on either the ruling or the opposition alliance.

“With numerous claims and counter-claims made on Tuesday, Kishor has only thrown a stone in the water and will watch ripples form ahead of the elections. He is looking for opportunities for the upcoming elections and has floated this idea of a forum for the youth only to show a sizeable support of youth with him,” Diwakar said.

Senior BJP functionary and Bihar deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi accused Prashant of constantly trying to break the NDA in Bihar. “Kishor could not digest the return of NDA in Bihar, hence he kept making attempts to bering Nitish and Lalu together again. When he could not succeed, he used CAA as an alibi to target Nitish Kumar,” SuMo said on Wednesday.

RJD vice-president Shivanand Tiwari conceded that Kishor had met him around six months ago to talk about Nitish’s leadership. “It is true that Kishor came to meet me around six months ago and talked about Nitish’s leadership, with the idea of bringing Nitish to RJD- fold. I gave prior information about this meeting to Lalu Ji as well. However, later we realized that Nitish might be trying to play a game by portraying it to BJP that he has invitation from us as well,” Tiwari told TOI on Wednesday.

SuMo claimed that Kishor is working for RJD. “He is working for Lalten party that is why he is neither able to see the corruption in RJD nor the fact that NDA government brought electricity in every village. The consumption of electricity in Bihar has increased by five time since 2005 but Kishor seems to have taken the contract of taking back Bihar to Lantern era,” he said on Wednesday.

Kishor had said in his presser on Tuesday that though electricity has reached every household in the state, but per capita energy consumption in Bihar is still the lowest in the country.

Kishor had also mocked the governance model of Nitish. “Since there is no one to say anything to Nitish Ji on governance here, he is following the agenda that whatever he has done, is enough... Bihar no longer wants to know what you have done in comparison with previous governments but what you will do in the next 10 years.”

Political observers claimed that Kishor’s development agenda is going somewhere similar to the agenda of upcoming Yatra of recently appointed LJP president and Jamui MP Chirag Paswan christened ‘Bihar first, Bihari first’.

“After Delhi, if elections in Bihar are also held on the agenda of development, then it will provide direct benefit to people of Bihar. I am quite sure that elections in Bihar will be fought on the agenda of development. The Bihar first, Bihari first Yatra to be launched from February 21 is aimed at linking Bihar with the wheel of development,” Chirag had tweeted on Tuesday evening.

Key points of PK’s statements:

Accept decision of Nitish to sack him from JD (U)

Not working for any party of leader

Piggybacks cannot lead Bihar

To rope in 1 crore youth with Baat Bihar Ki

Development has been sluggish

Quality education is lacking

Gandhi and Godse cannot go together

50,['20/02/2020'],West Bengal adopts carrot-&amp;-stick policy to rein in pool cars,"File photo of cop checks on pool cars

KOLKATA: The state government on Wednesday adopted a carrot-and-stick policy to discipline pool car drivers, penalizing errant operators and offering an incentive to the law-abiding ones. The transport department has warned operators that their permits would be cancelled and their vehicles scrapped if they did not comply with the government safety guidelines, but at the same time, it promised to provide single-window clearance to all permits to owners/drivers who would graduate to safer and newer commercial vehicles.The move came after at least two vehicles ferrying schoolkids recently met with accidents—two children injured in one of the mishaps have been on ventilation—and another driver, while transporting 11 children home, was found drunk near Kolkata Station. Nudged into action by these incidents, the transport department decided on a zero-tolerance stand against non-compliance of vehicular safety.While police have already launched a crackdown on these vehicles—most of the sector is unregularized but parents are unfortunately forced to send their children to school in those unsafe vehicles—the department has decided on checks immediately after Madhyamik. Tyres, brakes, speed-governors and drivers’ experience would be given maximum importance, said a senior transport department official. Re-soled tyres, faulty brakes, absence of speed governors and less-than-five-years’ experience of drivers would lead to the scrapping of the vehicle, he added.A recent check by police revealed that a lot of pool cars did not have speed-governors, and those installed in a few vehicles did not work. “This is the problem with retro-fitting speed-governors. This is why, we want the operators to shift to new, safer vehicles, which come with speed-governors installed in them,” said a transport department official. Transport department and police want the operators to align their GPS with the vehicle-tracking system of the Kolkata Police so that cops can keep tabs on the vehicles. Transport officials said police had started a survey on the mode of commute preferred by parents for their kids: bus, pool car or private car. Based on the report, prioritizing of school vehicles will be strategized.Police said it planned another round of crackdown on vehicles the end of the board exams. “Hardly a few days will remain for summer vacation to set in after the Madhyamik gets over. It will allow enough time for pool car owners to rectify mistakes after they get pulled up for disobeying basic rules,” an officer said. “On our part, we will insist on a few rules: valid registration, carrying capacity, following basic traffic norms and all documents in place,” said an officer at Lalbazar. A SOP on the dos and don’ts is likely to reach all 25 traffic guards soon. Police said the traffic guards had sought permission to carry out checks once the vehicles reached the schools. “They often get away, citing the kids would get late for school. They also try to fudge the number of kids they ferry. So, we need to carry out checks outside schools. We have also identified a few zones in Kolkata, where maximum violation of rules takes place. During the crackdown, we will put men from other zones in these spots,” said an officer from a traffic guard in central Kolkata.On the other hand, on request from the city-based West Bengal Pool Car Operators’ Association, the state has reportedly agreed in principle to provide single-window clearance for all documents required to ply pool cars. “The transport department also promised to consider our plea for a waiver on interest, both on pending permit fees and road tax,” said Arupam Dutta, secretary West Bengal Car Pool Operators’ Welfare Association.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74217583,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-487816,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/state-adopts-carrot-stick-policy-to-rein-in-pool-cars/articleshow/74216081.cms
51,['20/02/2020'],India pips China in fintech deals for Q2,"This story is from February 20, 2020

Chennai: A single deal- Paytm’s $1.6 billion fund raise helped India retain the lead for the second successive quarter over China in the fintech space in the October-December period. India’s total funding for the quarter stand at $1.8 billion. But for the investment, India’s funding would stand at $212 million, while China stood at $298 million, research firm CB Insights said.

In the previous quarter, India beat China by $13 million. India’s fintech deals were powered by investments in UPI-based startups, payment companies etc. While the quarter was India’s highest, it was China’s lowest in CY 2019.

“Prime continues to focus on being the premier early-stage fintech investor in the country — with companies like Ezetap, Happay, Niyo, KredX, Moneytap and OTOCapital are all growing very nicely in their respective areas. In future, with IndiaStack, GST, and UPI already hitting meaningful scale, we will continue to back Fintech startups across the board,” said Sanjay Swamy, managing partner, Prime Venture Partners.

Digital lending, however, saw a slowdown in investment. Accounting for the drop in digital lending, some investors add that 2019 has been a mixed bag in an otherwise booming investment space for the fintech sector. Sneha Rajan, vice president, Unitus Ventures said that while investments were the highest ever, capital for fintech lending businesses dried up due to slowdown in the NBFC market. The fund is bullish on the sector and is now looking at different sub sectors within the space. “After having invested in education and micro loans, digital group savings, last mile distribution and insurtech startups, we are now looking for businesses that digitise the MSME space. These could range from helping small businesses sell online, collect receivables better or finance invoices digitally,” she added.

52,['20/02/2020'],RBI nod for Kotak’s share dilution plan,"This story is from February 20, 2020

Mumbai: Kotak Mahindra Bank on Wednesday said the RBI has granted its final approval to the lender’s proposal to cap promoter’s voting rights in lieu of bringing down promoter shareholding.

In a statement to the exchanges, the bank said it had received the RBI approval through a letter dated February 18.

In terms of the proposal submitted by the bank to the regulator last month, Uday Kotak and family, who hold almost 30%, will cap promoter voting rights at 20% of paid-up voting equity share capital until March 31, 2020. From April 1, the promoters’ voting rights in the bank will be capped at 15% of equity share capital.The bank has also committed to bring down promoter shareholding to 26% within six months (August-end 2020). Given that the bank had a market capitalisation of Rs 3.25 lakh crore, the promoters will have to sell shares worth Rs 14,000 crore. Alternatively, the bank can dilute promoter holding by either selling fresh shares or through an acquisition through share swap, which would dilute capital.

As part of the deal, Uday Kotak will not purchase any shares of the bank until the promoter holding in the bank falls to 15% or such higher percentage as may be permitted by the RBI from time to time.

According to banking sources, the special dispensation to Kotak Bank might prompt some small finance banks, which are required to dilute promoter holding, to offer to take the limited voting right route.

54,['20/02/2020'],Stalls under rly stn FOBs to be relocated,"This story is from February 20, 2020

On February 13, a portion of a ramp collapsed at Bhopal railway station’s platform number 2

Bhopal: Taking measures after last week’s accident at Bhopal railway station, where a part of the foot-over bridge (FOB) ramp collapsed, Bhopal railway division issued a circular on Wednesday to relocate stalls and other constructions under FOBs at all stations under Bhopal division.

On February 13, a section of the FOB ramp — which was certified safe less than a year ago — collapsed sending eight people plunging 20 feet to the platform below and severely injuring them.

After the accident, a probe committee was formed which recommended removal of kind of construction or stalls under the FOB and ramps, sources said. When contacted, Bhopal divisional railway manager (DRM) Uday Borwanker said the decision was taken as per the norms. “There will be complete relocation of all construction and stalls. They will be relocated according to available space. No one will be adversely affected by this,” said Borwanker.

Bhopal railway station has a total of six platforms and people are usually seen standing under the ramps or FOBs as food stalls are mostly located there.

It is important to note that at the time of the accident, the Sampark Kranti Express had just pulled in on platform number 2 which was crowded with passengers, including those who got injured. Also, there was no crowd around the food stall as someone had dumped sacks there, forcing people to buy snacks from stall further away from the spot.

All eight injured were immediately admitted to hospitals. One of them, RGPV teacher Anupam Sharma, suffered a spinal injury while a 15-year-old boy sustained head injuries.

The 50-foot-long ramp, built in 1992, was certified safe in March last year by a high-level railways inspection team. On February 13, the Sampark Kranti pulled into platform no. 2 around 9am. A group of 40 people from the same family alighted from the train and joined the crowd shuffling up the ramp towards the foot-over-bridge. Ten minutes later, the section connected to the FOB caved in, taking down eight to 10 people.

CCTV footage of the incident shows a cloud of smoke rise as the ramp crashes. Concrete beams and iron supports lie on the ground as passengers — some still holding plates of samosa or poha in one hand — race to save those trapped.

Surat: In a latest revelation , because of a blunder committed by top officials of Veer Narmad South Gujarat University (VNSGU), the charges against a 19-year-old engineering student, who was allegedly caught clicking pictures of girls in the toilet, would never be proved.

The university authorities took custody of the phone of the accused and kept it with them for over 24 hours before presenting it to the police. Due to the delay, the accused student got enough time to get legal advise and refused that the phone was his, informed police sources.

The accused was caught by students in campus of VNSGU on Monday when a girl noticed that someone is taking photos and video on a mobile phone in girls' toilet. The accused had placed the phone in a gap in wall between girls and boys toilet in Bioscience department.

The accused was taken to office of the registrar where his phone was checked. No video or photos of the girls were found. Fearing legal actions the accused wrote an apology letter. He was later allowed to go by university officials.

However, on Wednesday, Umra police arrested the second year student of Sarvajanik College of Engineering and Technology (SCET) and was later released on bail.

“The accused has refused that the phone seized by VNSGU officials was not his. We did not find any photo or video from phone. We are trying to get it examined at the forensic science laboratory (FSL),” said a police officer at Umra police station.

Despite several attempts Shivendra Gupta, vice chancellor of VNSGU and Rajendra Patel, registrar of VNSGU were not available for their comments.

Kochi: Ombudsman for local bodies has observed that case can be initiated against Maradu municipal secretary on the charges of maladministration. The move is in the wake of continued failure from the part of the secretary to turn up before the ombudsman in connection with a case lodged by an RTI activist based on audit objection. The ombudsman ordered that complaint can be registered on the charges of maladministration and probe can be conducted.

But, the ombudsman, Justice K K Dineshan, has ordered that a final decision in this regard can be taken after hearing the explanation from the municipal secretary. The next hearing of the case has been posted to June 16, 2020. According to the report prepared by auditors for local bodies, Maradu municipal authorities failed to explain why they purchased land at a price above the valuation certificate. The auditors have found that the purchase of 19 cents from private individuals for a project implemented for the welfare of scheduled caste caused financial loss to the local body. Another finding by the auditors is that the local body is not charging licence fee from those operating parking facilities in its limits.

Based on the audit report, K T Cheshire, an RTI activist, lodged a petition before the ombudsman for local bodies that the municipal authorities committed corruption.

Meanwhile, Maradu municipal secretary Mohammed Arif Khan said: “I couldn’t appear before the ombudsman because of an error in the note prepared by the municipality section concerned. I will be appearing before the ombudsman at the next meeting.”

PATNA: Police on Wednesday arrested two persons for stealing Rs 9.7 lakh from the ATM kiosk of Canara Bank at Tiranga Chowk under the Sadra police station area on late Tuesday evening in Saharsa.

The arrested accused were identified as Dilip Kumar, a native of Supaul district and Lallu of Baijnathpur in Sahrasa. Police also recovered Rs 7.62 lakh from their possesion. The arrested duo were employees of a private company which was outsourced by the Canara Bank to upload the money and for security of the ATM.

The incident came to light when the bank’s branch manager Amit Kumar Singh found that the ATM was short of cash. The bank officials checked the transactions and found out that only Rs 2 lakh were withdrawn by the customers and the rest were missing. Based on this, a complaint was registered with the Saharsa sadar police station area.

Saharsa sadar police station SHO Raj Mani told this newspaper on Wednesday that Dilip and Lallu had loaded Rs10 lakh in the ATM kiosk around 4pm on Tuesday and they stole the money around 7.30pm, the same day.

“The way, the crime was committed shows that the accused knew a lot about machine security. There was no outbreak. They simply opened the ATM machine and decamped with the money. They have the duplicate key of the ATM as they regularly load money in the machine,” Mani said.

He added, “As soon as Dilip and Lallu entered the ATM kiosk, they covered the CCTV cameras installed inside with a paper. We identified the accused through the CCTV footage.”

Police are investigating the matter to nab other people who are associated with this crime. “We believe that there are more people involved in this ATM robbery and trying to recover the remaining amount of Rs 1.9 lakh,” the SHO said.

ARA: Posters and pamphlets have been pasted by CBI in Ara town in Bhojpur district announcing Rs 10 lakh reward to any person for providing substantial lead in Ranvir Sena chief Brahmeshwar Nath Singh alias Brahmeshwar Mukhiya murder case.

Brahmeshwar, the chief of Ranvir Sena, a militia of upper caste landlords, was murdered by unidentified criminals on June 1, 2012 at about 4am, near his residence in Katira locality of Ara, when he was on out for his morning walk. His murder led to widespread violence in Ara and Patna.

As the CBI is still clueless about Brahmeshwar’s murder, the investigation bureau has announced a reward of Rs10 lakh for info on any clue about the sensational murder.

This is the third attempt of announcing cash reward for information in Brahmeshwar’s murder. Earlier, the CBI had announced a similar reward of Rs10 lakh in the case in December 2016 and again in July last, but failed to get any concrete lead.

In one of its posters pasted at the gate of Ara sadar hospital, issued in the name of the CBI special crime branch, Patna, it has been promised that the name of the informer will not be revealed. It has provided four phone numbers for giving any vital clue about the murder and a cash reward of Rs10 lakh has been promised to anyone who gives accurate and adequate information to crack the case.

Nawada police station in Ara has already filed a chargesheet against eight named accused but it is believed that the main accused is still unidentified.

Brahmeshwar, who was a resident of Khopira village under the Pawna police station area of Bhojpur district, was known for his organizational skill for congregating the landlords under the banner of Ranvir Sena.

61,['20/02/2020'],I-T department moves HC against Flipkart’s ITAT ruling,"This story is from February 20, 2020

BENGALURU: The income tax (I-T) department has taken Walmart-owned Flipkart to high court over its Rs 110-crore demand. The case relates to the treatment of discounts as capital expenditure instead of revenue expenditure, according to court listings reviewed by TOI. Flipkart was issued a notice last month to appear and represent its case following the tax department’s petition.

The matter had first moved to the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT), which had given a ruling in 2018 allowing Flipkart to treat the marketing expenses and discounts as a loss. The tax demand here is for the financial year 2015-16, which has now got into another legal wrangle. Flipkart had argued earlier that it cannot pay taxes on what it terms as ‘fictional income’. Sources in the court also said the tax department is now pursuing the matter after the ITAT order in favour of Flipkart.

The contention of the I-T department has been that Flipkart earned an enduring benefit via aggressive cash discounts, which in turn resulted in losses. In simple terms, under I-T laws, if an expenditure results in an enduring benefit, it is to be capitalised. On the other hand, a revenue expenditure is deducted from the income of that particular year to arrive at the taxable profit or losses.

In Flipkart’s case, capitalisation of the discounts and marketing expense would mean an adjustment to the income. Rebutting this, Flipkart had pointed out that a product has to be sold at a particular price, and revenue that is not earned cannot be treated as capital expenditure and added back to the income.

“This is a standard notice issued by the court in all appeals. The current ruling from the ITAT is in our favour. We will await the listing of the appeal by the court for hearings and will respond accordingly,” a Flipkart person said in an emailed response.

64,['20/02/2020'],No HC relief for disqualified directors,"This story is from February 20, 2020

(Representative image)

MUMBAI: The Bombay high court has in an interim order declined to stay a 2017 circular issued by the corporate affairs ministry and granted no relief to directors of various companies against disqualification due to failure in filing of returns. The circular was a list of directors who were disqualified for non-filing of returns of their respective companies.

The HC was of the prima facie opinion that, regarding the re-appointment of a director of a company that “has not filed financial statements or annual returns for any continuous period of three financial years, would mean that the person can continue…till the end of the extant term, but would not be eligible for re-appointment for another five years thereafter, then, there is sufficient opportunity to enable him to correct the affairs of that company.”

So if the company in which the person is or has been a director has not filed financial statements or annual returns for any continuous period of three financial years on the date on which the company fails to do so, a disqualification is incurred. It is a ministerial or administrative act of filing that is to be performed by the company.

Therefore, if such financial statements or annual returns for any continuous period of three financial years have not been filed, then the action is triggered, said the HC bench of Justices S C Dharmadhikari and Riyaz Chagla in a February 7 order, uploaded recently.

The HC clarified, however, that “if such a director had been appointed within six months of the company becoming a defaulting company, he would not incur disqualification”. “It is clear that section 164 of the Companies Act, 2013 provides for disqualifications for appointment of director,” said the HC bench, rejecting prayers for interim relief as sought by the directors. “We do not think that the interim relief as sought can be granted. A blanket stay or a relief having far-reaching legal consequences as sought cannot be granted,” said the bench.

The order was passed in a batch of around 70 matters tagged and heard together. Some petitions were filed in 2018. The main plea according to the additional solicitor general (ASG) was “virtually to stay the operation, enforcement and effect of the law itself”. “The petitioners were asking the HC to go into the issue of the individual directors’ disqualification and, in that process, the court is requested to virtually re-write the section,” argued the Centre’s ASG Anil Singh.

The directors who had moved court relied on judgments passed by the high courts of Gujarat, Delhi, Telangana, Madras and Allahabad to argue that the list of September 2017 cannot have a retrospective effect or could not have been implemented prior to October 2017 as was sought to be done. But the Centre said that if returns are not filed continuously for a period of three years, then disqualification is invited.

The HC said after having also heard Cyrus Ardeshir, Zal Andhyarujina and some other counsels for the directors, an earlier order it had passed in October 2019 raising legal queries “sufficiently protects the interest of both sides”. The matters will be finally heard to decide particularly the Constitutional challenge raised against the law.

65,['20/02/2020'],Bihar DGP Gupteshwar Pandey to launch women safety app on February 27,"This story is from February 20, 2020

Bihar DGP Gupteshwar Pandey

PATNA: Bihar DGP Gupteshwar Pandey will launch a mobile application, ‘ Hello Di-Di ’, at the police headquarters here on February 27 to ensure safety of women, ADG (headquarters) Jitendra Kumar said on Wednesday.

Jitendra said specific information about the mobile app would be provided on the day of its launch. “The mobile app for women safety has been developed by a private IT solution firm. It will be the first-of-its-kind app in the state aimed at ensuring women safety,” he said.

The ADG added that if a woman senses danger, she can raise an alarm by using the mobile app. “They can press the panic button which will automatically send the information to police control room. Accordingly, the police will act to offer help to the women in danger,” Jitendra said.

He said the women can also lodge complaint through the app and police personnel will take necessary action.

Women will be required to download the app on their cellphones and fill the details, such address and phone numbers of family and friends who can be contacted in case of emergency.

Meanwhile, women in Patna have expressed happiness over the launch of the app. Medha Shree, a student of Magadh Mahila College, said with rise in crime against women, such measures were the need of the hour. “It is the responsibility of the state government to provide safe environment to girls,” she said.

However, Sonali Kumari, a student of J D Women’s College, said Patna Municipal Corporation had launched a similar mobile app about a year ago, but it failed. “I just hope the new app will work so that women feel safe in the city,” she said.

66,['20/02/2020'],"Tejas to CM: Don’t harp on liquor ban, listen to DGP","This story is from February 20, 2020

PATNA: Two days after DGP Gupteshwar Pandey spoke sternly on sale of liquor in the state and involvement of cops in it, leader of opposition in state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav on Wednesday took a dig at CM Nitish Kumar, asking him to listen to the top cop instead of “giving sermons on liquor ban”.

Tejashwi said ever since total prohibition was enforced in Bihar, a parallel nexus of police, administration and bootleggers has been at work in the state.

He added, “What we have been saying on liquor ban stands vindicated today. Do we say more when the DGP himself admits bootlegging is rampant in Bihar with blessing of police, ruling politicians and administration? Prohibition remains a grandiose PR (public relations) exercise by Nitish ji. Unmasking has begun now.”

The DGP had stirred a controversy last Sunday when he held thanedars (incharge of police stations) and chowkidars (village informers) — two grassroots level functionaries of the state administration — responsible for smuggling of illicit liquor in ‘dry’ state.

Pandey, known for his controversial statements, had said at a function in Aurangabad on Sunday that prohibition in the state would be a complete success only when the thanedars and chowkidars support it.

The DGP had said that liquor was sold and transported from one place to another with the tacit support of the incharge of police stations concerned and the chowkidars in the villages and panchayats. “If they are not aware of the happenings around — whether good or bad — under their jurisdiction, they have no right to continue at their respective posts,” he had told the gathering.

He had also said that the bootleggers can’t operate without the support of the police. “The quantum of liquor recovery in the last four years has indicated that a well-oiled syndicate is active. There is an urgent need to strike at the root of the problem,” he had said, adding the erring cops won’t be spared.

The DGP had also issued stern warning to people for violating provisions of the Bihar Excise and Prohibition Act 2016. “Those cops found to be lax in implementing the provisions of prohibition will be sent to jail. Kanoon sabke liye barabar hai (all are equal in the eyes of law),” he had said.

Reacting to the DGP’s statement, Bihar Police Association state president Mritunjay Kumar Singh said it was true that some policemen were involved in liquor sale. “Action should be taken against the erring cops. But the entire police force should not be blamed or questioned and that too from a public forum,” he added.

67,['20/02/2020'],Young netas take lead as yatras gain momentum,"This story is from February 20, 2020

PATNA: With assembly elections barely few months away, yatras by netas have gathered pace in the state. Senior leaders of prominent political parties, especially the new generation leaders, have planned to embark on separate yatras to gauge the mood of voters and consolidate their support base.

While the RJD’s CM face and leader of opposition in state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav (30) has decided to undertake a statewide ‘Berozgaari Hatao Yatra’ from February 23, Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) chief and Jamui MP Chirag Paswan (37) will embark on ‘Bihar First-Bihari First Yatra’ from February 21.

Former JNUSU president and CPI functionary Kanhaiya Kumar (33) is already visiting different parts of the state as part of his month-long ‘Jan Gan Man Yatra’ against CAA, NRC and NPR. Congress MLA from Kadwan (Katihar) and former student leader of the JNU Shakeel Ahmad Khan is also accompanying Kanhaiya in the yatra.

Tejashwi’s ‘Berozgaari Hatao Yatra’ has already generated much heat in the state’s political circles. While a few legislators of the ruling JD(U) have welcomed the RJD leader’s initiative to highlight the burning issue of unemployment and migration, the BJP leaders have said Tejashwi is taking out the yatra to end his own ‘berozgaari’.

“Tejashwi himself is unemployed these days. Hence, he has decided to undertake this yatra. His family had made lakhs of youths unemployed during 15-year RJD rule in the state,” Union minister of state for health and Buxar MP Ashwini Kumar Choubey said.

Tejashwi has also hired a swanky air-conditioned bus for his yatra which will begin from Veterinary College’s ground in Patna on February 23. The bus had hit headlines after JD(U) leader and state’s information and public relations minister Neeraj Kumar alleged that it was registered in the name of a person from BPL category.

“Tejashwi undertook some political yatras in the past also. But he could not complete any of his yatra,” JD(U) leader and state’s building construction minister Ashok Choudhary told TOI.

LJP spokesperson Shravan Kumar Agarwal said Chirag would cover at least two districts each day as part of his yatra beginning from February 21. “On the first day, he will visit Muzaffarpur and Vaishali,” Agarwal said, adding Chirag will visit different parts of the state to invite people to participate in the party’s proposed state-level rally at Patna’s Gandhi Maidan on April 14.

Besides these young leaders, CM Nitish Kumar had also finished his ‘Jal Jivan Hariyali Yatra’ in the second week of January this year. He had visited all 38 districts as part of his yatra to spread awareness about environment protection and impact of climate change.

68,['20/02/2020'],Home secy finds CAG report incorrect,"This story is from February 20, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: Dismissing the comptroller and auditor general ( CAG )’s observations of irregularities, additional chief secretary (home and vigilance) Vishwas Mehta gave a clean-chit to the police department on Wednesday.

Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, on Tuesday, had asked Mehta for a report on the irregularities—the CAG had pointed out—in utilizing central funds.

Contradicting the CAG report, Mehta’s report said physical verification had found that none of the Indian small arms system (Insas) rifles had gone missing. Clerical errors in various registers at the police chief store and other units had given rise to such a suspicion.

Besides launching a formal investigation, it has also been decided to computerize the details of arms and ammunitions, the report said.

Regarding the audit remark that vehicles were purchased for use by senior officers ignoring operational needs of police stations, the home secretary said the acquired vehicles, such as Toyota Innova, were operational ones and have been allotted to units such as those on highway patrol.

The secretary also pointed out that senior officers, too, participated in such operations.

Refuting allegations of shortage of vehicles at police stations, the secretary’s report said the CAG’s findings were incorrect.

Mehta’s report also justified the purchase of various equipment through Keltron—allegedly in violation of store purchase manual and central vigilance commission guidelines. He reported that it was unfair on the part of the CAG to be critical of Keltron, a total solution provider for several departments.

The state police chief was not wrong in instructing to purchase tablets for vehicle-mounted GPS systems from Panasonic, Mehta said.

The Japanese electronics major enjoyed 65% of market share in the segment, and the other two companies in the same space—Gtec and DT Research—have no service centres in the country, the report said.

Considering the security aspect, it was justifiable to purchase bullet-proof vehicles for VVIPs through limited tender process, the report added.

Justifying the construction of villas for the state police chief and ADGPs, Mehta’s report said the funds sanctioned in 2013-14 for upper subordinate quarters were not utilized till 2017-18. The funds were on the verge of getting lapsed even after it was granted through supplementary demands for grants. The secretary said since the funds, by then, were insufficient for construction of quarters for subordinate officers, and it was decided to construct villas before the allocation period lapsed.

Meanwhile, questioning the authority of home secretary to whitewash the adverse findings of CAG, opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala said the public would reject Mehta’s report. He was speaking after visiting the state police chief’s official residence. The was based on the CAG report that the funds were diverted to construct the villa.

Surat: Anti Ragging Cell (ARC) set up by the University Grants Commission received an anonymous complaint of alleged ragging by a first year MBBS student of a government medical college.

The college’s anti ragging committee probed into the complaint on Wednesday and found that no student was ragged and some student must have filed the online complaint for fear of possible harassment.

ARC received the complaint on mail and the college was sent details of the allegations levelled by the student. The college authorities treated it as an anonymous complaint and top officials questioned a few students privately. However, no one has come forward with any complaint so far.

The complaint was filed on February 15 and a meeting of the college's anti ragging committee was held on Wednesday. An inquiry was done by dean Dr Jayesh Brahmbhatt and other officials of GMC but found no no student of being harassed.

In the complaint the first year MBBS student alleged that, “I was asked to come to the playground on the GMC campus at Majura Gate after college hours. I did not go as the seniors were making junionrs clean and level the ground and work like labourers. The students were being asked to carry soil in buckets. The ground is being prepared for some event.""

The student, who requested the ARC not to identify him, further alleged that, ""Those who did not go to work in the ground were identified by the seniors who kept a watch at the entry of the hostel and then forcibly took the absent students to the ground and made them work till 2 am. Those who did not cooperate were again called to work at 7 am in the morning.""

The complainant named two seniors and alleged that they are involved in harassing the students and also submitted screenshots of the text message on WhatsApp in which the first year students were asked to come to the sports ground.

""The WhatsApp messages that were submitted as evidence were sent by first year students to their batchmates and not by seniors. When checked it was a general call for all those who wish to participate in preparations for the sports events,"" said Jayesh Brahmbhatt, dean, GMC.

""When I checked, no first year student confirmed harassment even in private. Further, the anonymous complainant is not claiming that he has been harassed but is claiming of noticing harassment of others. The committee found that it was a more a complaint out of panic by some student,"" said Brahmbhatt.

""I was part of the meeting and based on the discussion over findings it seems that the incident is not of nature of ragging. No one confirmed of harassment and it is a group activity,"" said a police officer of Khatodara police station.

72,['20/02/2020'],Jharkhand’s tribal killings bring spotlight on ‘Satipati movement’,"This story is from February 20, 2020

Seven people were beheaded in Jharkhand village in January

Surat: The brutal killings of seven people at Burugulikera village of Jharkhand in January has brought focus back on Satipati movement which has roots in Gujarat.

Jharkhand Janadhikar Mahasabha, a civil rights organization made up of several tribal rights groups, came up with a fact-finding report with regard to the beheading of seven people at Burugulikera in West Singhbhum district. The report claims that the killings were an outcome of the growing influence of 'Satipati cult' in Jharkhand.

However, those associated with the movement claim that Satipati movement’s objective is to protect nature and tribal rights and it does not believe in violence.

Former office-bearers of the movement in south Gujarat claimed that till date none of its members has ever been found involved in violence anywhere. Satipati movement denounces government of India and has its own seal and stamp. Its followers do not accept laws of the land, but their involvement has not been found in any violent activity so far.

Sources say that the Satipati movement among tribals is gaining ground in districts of South Gujarat. It has presence in tribal dominated villages in Tapi, Dangs and Valsad districts.

They further added that the origin of this group traces to Katasvan village in Vyara taluka of Tapi district in South Gujarat. Kunwar Keshri Singh was the founder of the group.

“Initial media reports indicated pro-pathalgadi faction in the village had murdered members of anti-pathalgadi faction for opposing its movement. To understand the role of Pathalgadi in the killings, a fact-finding team comprising activists, writers and journalists associated with Jharkhand Janadhikar Mahasabhha and owing allegiance to Adivasi Buddhijivi Manch, Adivasi Adhikar Manch, Adiwasi Women’s Network, National Alliance of People’s Movement (NAPM), Johar, Marxist Coordination Committee and Ulgulan Sena visited Burugulikera,” reads a statement by the fact-finding team.

“The fact-finding team found more than half of the total number of families in the village were followers of anti-Christ kutumb pariwar, also known as Satipati cult. The cult led by Ranasi Budh and a few others are accused of killing James Budh and six others of the village. The cult, active in the village for the past one year, had asked people to submit their ration cards, Aadhaar cards and voter cards and stop use of all government schemes,” the statement reads.

Pathalgadi is a traditional practice of Munda Adivasis where they erect stone slabs (pathals) in honour of their ancestors or to simply mark village boundary.

“Local media had published police's claim that the killings were result of a clash between supporters of Pathalgadi and those against it. However, the fact-finding team found involvement of Satipati cult followers in the killings,” said Aloka Kujur, convener of NAPM Jharkhand.

The current movement leaders refuse to speak to media.

WHAT IS SATIPATI MOVEMENT?

Founded by Kesari Singh almost four decades ago to assert tribal rights and their identity, the system denounces government of India. It has its own seal and stamp. Its followers do not accept laws of the land and keep their own identity cards. In many pockets, they do not take benefits of government scheme or even in some cases, do not vote in elections. However, their leaders deny having any links with violence in Jharkhand incident or elsewhere.

Chennai: With growing demand for better and efficient customer services in the BFSI sector, analytics and big data training institutions have recorded an average of 4x rise in the weightage of courses offered with newer AI and ML-driven tools and skills.

Gaurav Vohra, co-founder and CEO, Jigsaw Academy, said, “Weightage from traditional statistical algorithms towards newer demand for Machine Learning (ML) algorithms has increased from 10% to 50% in the last 5 years in the courses we offer. While, weightage for open source tools has moved from 5% to 60% in the same period.”

Even when open source analytical toll turned popular, BFSI was the last industry to jump on that bandwagon. Vohra said, “So, even five years before they were continuing to use proprietary paid expensive analytical tools for lot of their analysis and their inter-management. Only in the last five years, there are actually moving towards open source tools, and adoption of big data technology.”

The BFSI sector witnesses more reliability on ML algorithms to support operations like credit risk, KYC norms.

upGrad co-founder Mayank Kumar said, “We have seen 5x increase in the weightage for courses offered for BFSI sector. In reality, BFSI sector started using data science way earlier, unlike other ecosystem today. One of the kind of work we do at BFSI- visualization and driving insights. Data science tool on prediction, upselling, cross selling of financial products and also to check on fraudulent activities. If one applies for a savings account, then with that data the bank tries to push an insurance for the family.” Agencies are witnessing a churn in course content too. Hari Krishnan Nair, co-founder of Great Learning said, “From offering two or three program matching the skill demand in the BFSI sector, we now offer about 15 courses. About 25% of our course structure gets revised every year to match the constantly changing demand from the market.” To improve customer service insurance company Bajaj Allianz General Insurance had introduced AI-driven Motor On The Spot (Motor OTS) facility for private car owning customers, where it capitalizes on huge and rich repository of loss data available with the organization. With this move, the insurer had settled over 10,000 claims, with a turnaround time reduced to 30 minutes, thus reducing the hassles of document in-warding and claim registration.

77,['20/02/2020'],Facebook leads $110 million funding in Unacademy,"This story is from February 20, 2020

(File photo)

BENGALURU: Education technology startup Unacademy has raised $110 million in a new round of funding led by social networking giant Facebook , private equity firm General Atlantic and existing backer Sequoia Capital India.

The five-year-old startup, which links educators giving lessons to students through online videos for competitive exams, is expected to be valued at $500 million in the new round.

The new round of funding signifies the increasing attractiveness of the education technology sector and also Unacademy, which had closed its previous round of funding in June. That round of $50 million was led by Hong Kong-based hedge fund Steadview Capital and valued the company at over $200 million.

The deal is Facebook’s second bet on a startup in India after it backed Meesho, a social commerce player that leverages the Silicon Valley-based social networking giants’ application WhatsApp.

For General Atlantic, this would be the second major education technology bet in India after Byju’s, which is valued at $8 billion.

Unacademy was founded by Gaurav Munjal, who sold his first startup Flatchat to Commonfloor, along with Hemesh Singh (former CTO at Flatchat) and former IAS officer Roman Saini. Its existing investors already include SAIF Partners, Nexus Venture Partners and Blume Ventures. Individual investors include Flipkart CEO Kalyan Krishnamurthy, Sujeet Kumar (co-founder, Udaan) and Haptik’s Aakrit Vaish.

In February last year, the startup had launched its paid subscription programme — Unacademy Plus — which Munjal recently said in a tweet that it has reached $30 million in annualised recurring revenues (ARR). The startup has more than 90,000 active subscribers, with 70% coming from tier-2 and -3 cities.

The capital will be used by Unacademy to expand into new categories, expand its educator base of 10,000 and invest in product and technology.“We started monetising last year in February with Rs 2 crore a month and have now reached about Rs 18 crore, which is about a 9x growth. The growth has been coming from across all major exams like UPSC, IIT-JEE and Bank PO,” said Munjal. The startup said it has 150 million monthly views on its own platform and its channels on YouTube.

Agra: The students of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) on Wednesday demanded immediate resignation of UP CM Yogi Adityanath for his statement in the Vidhan Sabha. In his statement, CM Yogi held students responsible for the violence during anti-CAA protests on December 15.

Students said, “CM’s remark that AMU students used stones, petrol bombs and weapons against police is false.”

“The CM is trying to skirt the terror unleashed against the students of AMU on the fateful night. After seeing the photographs of the clash between AMU students and police, Allahabad High Court Chief Justice Govind Mathur said that police made a war-like situation,” former students union president Salman Imtiaz said.

“We urge the President of India to take notice of his false claims and seek his removal,” students said.

Former members of AMU Students’ Union urged the judiciary to look into the matter and save the lives of citizens and their right to protest. The students urged the judiciary to take a serious note of Yogi’s statement.

Bhopal/Jabalpur: Secretary of Bhopal Masajid Committee, S M Salman, appeared before a division bench of M P high court on Wednesday but Bhopal Shahar Qazi didn’t turn up. Both of them were asked to be personally present in the court on Wednesday by the division bench of Justice Sanjay Yadav and Justice Atul Sreedharan in connection with a contempt petition.

When the court expressed displeasure over Shahar Qazi’s absence, it was informed that the train he was scheduled to board at Bhopal for Jabalpur was cancelled at the last minute because of non-interlocking work being carried out near Jabalpur. The court, then, asked Salman and Shahar Qazi, Mushtaq Ali Nadvi to appear in court on Monday.

The contempt petition filed by Mohd. Wasim Khan contended that Bhopal Masajid Committee and Shahar Qazi had committed contempt of court by not discontinuing the practice of hearing marital disputes of Muslim couples and passing orders in cases where separation, divorce or any other relief may have been sought. This despite the high court order on a petition filed in 2009-10 by Mohd. Zakir Khan, seeking a ban on ‘parallel’ court run by the Bhopal Masajid Committee and the Shahar Qazi. The court had allowed the petition and ordered ban on this practice but it is still continuing.

The court had asked the Shahar Qazi and secretary of Bhopal Masajid Committee to be present in court during the hearing of the petition on Wednesday.

Picture used for representational purpose only

HYDERABAD: The Hyderabad office of the Unique Identity Authority of India (UIDAI) has recommended deactivation of some 400 Aadhaar cards across Telangana in past one year. The authority had sent the card-holders notices after receiving complaints that they had obtained the card on false pretences. Many of these people were untraceable or had not responded to the notice, while others have presented their case before the authorities.

UIDAI has made the recommendation at a time when there is a raging controversy over 87 residents in the Old City receiving notices over complaints that they were not Indian citizens or had obtained the Aadhaar card falsely.

“We regularly inquire into complaints of an applicant obtaining an Aadhaar card with fake documents or fake biometrics. We receive complaints against enrolment agencies and operators as well. If we don’t get a proper explanation from the card-holder, we recommend deactivation,” an official told TOI.

Final decision on deactivation is taken by the UIDAI headquarters. The official, however, refused to give details of the number of cards that have been deactivated.

“In most cases, we can’t trace the people after sending the notices. If we find them, we ask them to correct their address and identity proof. In rare cases we recommend deactivation,” the official added.

Sources added that UIDAI prefers not recommending too many deactivations as it reflects on its own functioning.

Officials added that there were three types of cases of false pretences – using another person’s fingerprints with the help of the operator or taking advantage of the rush during enrolment; taking advantage of Aadhaar rules which have an exception for people without fingers; providing false identity documents or address proof.

Sources added that that even in the early days of the enrolment, the authority had recommended deactivation of cards after finding some irregularities. During enquiry, even the operator who takes the biometrics and documents is questioned. Many enrolment agencies hired by UADAI in the initial days were suspended.

I was the only one in my family, back then, to study in a private school,” said Goel, adding his parents were shocked when he failed in maths.“My mother was teaching maths for class 11 and class 12. I was their eldest kid and there was tremendous pressure on me to score high marks,” he said, adding that ironically now he is known for being good with numbers.Goel said that as he scored a “mere” 68% in class 12 board examinations, he couldn’t get into the science stream or even into a regular day college. “All I could manage was to get enrolled in B Com at an evening college. Slowly, I started improving my performance and I could get into a regular college in the final year of the degree,” he said.Goel, an alumnus of Harvard Business School and Harvard Design School, said that things started falling into place in his final-year MBA. “I took an evening job with Ernst and Young and was paid about Rs 7,500 per month.

CHANDRAPUR: Local Crime Branch (LCB) has detained 24 coal trucks carrying subsidized coal, meant for small scale industries, but allegedly being unloaded at a private coal depot near village Nagada. Cops are investigating the links between small scale industries, Maharashtra State Mining Corporation (MSMC), and private coal barons for siphoning away subsidized coal for sale in open market.

Sources informed that MSMC allocates the monthly quota of coal to small scale industries for use at subsidized rate. This coal is supplied by different coal mines as per dispatch order, and the concerned company is meant to pick up their quota from the designated mine. It is suspected that these companies are selling their subsidized quota of coal to private players.

Hundreds of private industries get such kind of subsidized quota amounting to thousands of tonnes of coal every month. The fact that coal meant to be taken directly to the industry was being unloaded at a private depot indicates foul play, sources said.

“We had inputs in this connection and our LCB team has detained 24 trucks. We are verifying the documents and taking opinion from MSMC officials to verify if there is any foul play,” in-charge SP Prashant Khaire told TOI.

MSMC general manager Premchand Tembhare confirmed that the police have approached him for investigations. “I have asked police to take action and send me a report. Based on their report we will decide on blocking supplies and cancelling quota of coal for such companies,” he said.

LCB in-charge OP Kokate informed that their teams have detained 24 trucks carrying coal to seven different small scale units from Pavni and Govari coal mines. Three of these industries are based in Jalna, one in Aurangabad and one each in Nagpur, Yavatmal and Bhandara districts. “We have dispatched separate teams to verify if any of these industries are closed, and still lifting coal. Functioning units have been told to produce documents authenticating that all the subsidized coal taken from mines was brought to the industry and on what authority coal was unloaded at a private depot. We have also asked MSME to look into other technicalities in operation and give their say in the matter,” he said.

Sources claimed that it could be a big racket under which thousands of tonnes of coal every month is lifted at subsidized rate for small scale industries across the state and sold in open market at higher rate.

Agra: In a freak accident on Tuesday, a 13-year-old boy lost his hand in a series of unfortunate events which involved his pet cow and a few monkeys. The boy, who has been taken to a Delhi hospital, is said to be in a critical condition.

Returning from school, the boy identified as Ansh Yadav untied his cow near the house and was about to return home. Ansh, a resident of Maitahan, had tied the cow's rope around his hand. Here, a biker coming from behind honked which scared the cow. The cow then began to run. Ansh lost his balance and grip, and fell. He was dragged for around 100 metres by the cow.

Being dragged along the road, the boy’s leg then got stuck into a car parked on the roadside and his right hand, which was already tied to the rope, was ripped off from the body. By the time local residents could come for help, a group of monkeys attacked the boy and badly injured his face.

Taking the separated hand in a polythene bag, the boy’s father Gopal Yadav rushed to the SN Medical College. Doctors at the hospital were unable to help much and the boy was taken to Delhi, later in the evening.

Local residents said the entire incident took place within a span of few seconds. Before anyone could rescue the boy, “his hand had separated from the body”.

Agra: Mathura district police slapped the stringent National Security Act (NSA) on Shubham Chaudhary, on Tuesday, for setting his own car on fire outside the SSP office in September last year. Chaudhary has been behind bars for the past five months and NSA charges were slapped on him after he applied for bail recently.

Mathura SSP Shalabh Mathur told TOI that the case was registered against Chaudhary as there were apprehensions of breach of public peace if he was released from jail. Mathur said the suspect had earlier opened fire in the air at a public place besides burning his vehicle in front of the district court and police office.

According to police, 23-year-old Chaudhary had created a ruckus on September 25, after his dalliance with a married woman was exposed. He had fired in the air and threatened that the woman accompanying him would shoot herself if anyone tried to stop him. Police later managed to nab him and the married woman, who was accompanying him. Both were booked by the police under section 307 (attempt to murder) and section 7 CLA Act.

The SSP told TOI that Chaudhary was scheduled to get engaged to a local girl the day before his arrest but the same did not materialize as the woman’s husband disclosed his relationship with his wife to the girl. He had then decided to take revenge against the woman’s husband by accusing him for all wrongdoings and took this step, he told police during interrogation.

On September 25, Chaudhary dressed in a lawyer’s attire, set his vehicle S-Cross (UP-50-CI-7533) on fire in the evening. He had come there along with the woman and her three children. They claimed themselves to be representative of a private company. The accused had a portable public address system and addressed the people standing on the road. He talked about corruption in the country and the political system and hurled abuses at the politicians of the day.

92,['20/02/2020'],"Babaria defends Scindia, says he’d have said the same thing","This story is from February 20, 2020

Bhopal: AICC general secretary in charge of Madhya Pradesh, Deepak Babaria, on Wednesday sought to suggest that all’s-well in state Congress, defending Jyotiraditya Scindia and saying he has not spoken anything that should be perceived as going against the Kamal Nath government.

“I have seen the entire video clip of what he (Scindia) told a gathering of contractual teachers. There is nothing objectionable in what he said,” Babaria said at the PCC office in Bhopal on Wednesday. A day ago, chief minister Kamal Nath had said that he was not annoyed with Scindia.

On February 14, Scindia had told guest teachers, who are on strike for regularisation of service, that he would “hit the streets with them” if the Congress government didn’t fulfil its manifesto promise. He reiterated it a couple of days later despite the controversy it created. Soon, BJP was taking potshots at Congress over the “faction fight”.

On Wednesday, Babaria spoke up in defence of Scindia. “There was nothing wrong in what Scindia said in that meeting. He said that Congress does not believe in jumlebaazi. Manifesto promises made by Narendra Modi and Amit Shah, when they promise to give Rs 15 lakh in every bank account, can be jumlebaazi. But in Congress, we mean what we promise. We are committed to our manifesto promises and from the first day initiated the process to fulfil farm loan waiver. The first phase has been implemented, and the second phase is on. In five years, all farm loans will be waived,” he said.

“Scindia, in his speech, explained that there are many issues, like regularization of contractual teachers’ issue that need to be resolved,” Babaria said. “But the Union government has drastically cut funds for Madhya Pradesh because there is a Congress government here.”

“Pressures like this come in a democracy. The issue of contractual teachers requires a reasonable solution. There may be hindrances in the path of finding a solution but we stand with contractual teachers in that journey,” Babaria said, adding: “I would have said the same thing had I been in Scindia’s place because we have made a commitment in our manifesto.”

On the controversy over Scindia leaving a Congress coordination committee meeting in Delhi early on February 15, Babaria said: “The entire issue is a matter of perception. Scindia had told me that he had an appointment at 12 noon. He said he would come for the meeting but would have to leave at 11:45am. A section of media wanted to show Congress in a bad light. So, there came the walkout story.”

Works under way on the super-specialty block

Kochi: General Hospital (GH), Ernakulam, which is awaiting a sea change in the patient care and facilities through e-health project, will soon get digital x-ray facility . The state government has given administrative sanction for procuring the machinery using Rs 1.75 crore from the asset development fund of T J Vinod, MLA.

Digital x-ray facility will help patients get the results immediately. According to Vinod, the Ernakulam GH has become first general hospital in the state to get the facility. “GH authorities have informed that they will take immediate steps to procure the machine. We expect that the facility can be launched within a couple of months,” said Vinod. “We also plan to introduce more facilities at the hospital,” he said. The process to float tender for procuring the machine will be started soon. In a week, around 400 patients undergo x-ray tests at the hospital. As of now, the patients depend on the more than 15-year-old x-ray machine.

The digital x-ray facility will also support the e-health project being implemented in the hospital. Meanwhile, there is a slight delay in the implementation of e-health project, which should have become operational by the end of February. Now, the project may be launched by April end, hospital authorities said. “Laying of cables as part of the e-health project is fast completing,” said an official associated with the project.

“Once the e-health project becomes a reality, patients don’t have to stand in queues for registration. All the treatment details will be available at the hospital’s computer systems. Moreover, the results of diagnostic tests will reach the doctors immediately. This will improve the quality of patient services at the hospital,” said the official.

The construction of Rs 86-crore super-specialty block also is progressing. “The contractors have offered to complete the work by June,” said a hospital official. The project is being funded by Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board. As per the proposal, super-specialty wings would be introduced in nephrology, neurology, urology, gastroenterology, neurosurgery and medical oncology.

Though construction of the building may be completed soon, deployment of staff and doctors will be a difficult task. An additional of around 60 doctors, including specialists, assistant surgeons and casualty medical officers, will have to be deployed for the super-specialty wing. For the nursing department, 12 head nurses, 164 staff nurses, 75 nursing assistants and 55 technicians will have to be appointed.

95,['20/02/2020'],KMDA to hire agency for a year to maintain Bypass,"This story is from February 20, 2020

Kolkata: The Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority ( KMDA ) plans to engage an agency for a year to repair , restore and maintain the Ultadanga-Garia stretch of E M Bypass , which is damaged apparently due to shoddy work by different utility service providers every year, especially during the monsoons.

“The firm that will be selected for a year will be given the responsibility of taking up urgent repair and restoration of damaged spots as and when required. The agency will look after the maintenance of the Bypass stretch for one year,” a KMDA official said, adding most of the potholes and craters were created owing to some fault on the part of a utility service provider on the thoroughfare. The total value of work has been fixed at a little over Rs 1.9 crore. According to the terms and conditions of the tender floated, only “bona fide, reliable and experienced firms or individual contractors who have experience working with government and government undertaking bodies, having completion certificate of executing at least 40% value of similar nature of work on a single contract within the last five years”, are eligible to place bids.

KMDA authorities pointed out that despite patchwork on their part, potholes springing up on Bypass, especially near Metro construction sites, had become a yearly problem. “Potholes appearing on the Bypass stretch have become a regular affair, especially during the rains. For the rest of the Bypass, we took up repairs whenever required. But repairing craters created by utility service providers becomes an additional burden on us,” an official said.

KMDA and RVNL has for the past few years trading blames of the repeated deterioration of certain portions of the Bypass stretch between Ultadanga and Garia , where Metro construction has been on. While KMDA claimed the road near Metro sites was damaged due to the constructions and that RVNL should repair them, RVNL insisted they had been taking up repairs in their areas . One such stretch was below the Hemanta Mukherjee station, which RVNL reportedly repaired. However, the agency made it clear that it will not be responsible for road repairs near stations after their work was completed.

Kochi: The third year electronics and communication engineering students of the School of Engineering (SoE), Cochin University of Science and Technology (Cusat), successfully conducted the demonstration of a reusable payload retrieval system developed by them. The payload retrieval system safely brought down the weather forecast system payload, which scaled up to a height of 30,000m, and sent data to earth on Wednesday. The demo of the project ‘Mission 100kft’ was held during the SoE’s tech fest ‘Dishna 2020’, which was inaugurated by Indian Space Research Organisation former chairman G Madahavan Nair.

“The objective was to prove that the payload, developed by Advanced Centre for Atmospheric Radar Research (ACARR), Cusat, for weather research, could be launched to high altitudes using nitrogen-filled balloons, tracked, retrieved and reused. Sensors and equipment like radiosonde worth Rs 12,000 could be sent up like this and brought back and reused avoiding the loss of huge amounts for each launch,” said Timothy Simon Thomas, a student and the mission director.

“The payload retrieval system developed by Cusat students will lead to a long range of experiment prospects regarding space,” Nair said. Registrar K Ajitha, School of Engineering principal George Mathew, ACARR director K Mohankumar, electronics and communication division professor Rekha K James were present.

BMC officials said implementation of the new rule will take time

BHOPAL: A day after BMC mayor-in-council approved vehicles to ply within dedicated BRTS lane along metro rail construction zones, the gates were locked for non-BRT traffic. Bhopal city link limited (BCLL) wardens were not aware of the new rule.

“It is for the metro rail construction company to place track diversion signages along the BRTS. Notification was only passed yesterday. It will take time,” said BMC additional commissioner and BCCL CEO, Pawan Singh. The relief to commuters moving from Board Office to Hoshangabad road is expected to ease the ride for thousands. MPMRCL offcials said they were not intimated about the new proposal to permit all vehicles through BRTS lane.

On Wednesday, some of the drivers took advantage of open BRTS gates near Habibganj railway station. However, others were stopped from entering the BRTS lane. Almost 50% of the 8km stretch from Board Office to Misrod is not manned by BRTS traffic wardens.

The traffic flowing between the BRTS along Habibganj added to more chaos. There were a few near fatal accident situation with BRTS bus drivers not warned about the new rule. Other public transport including Mini Bus took advantage of the BRTS bus stop.

BMC mayor in council on Wednesday passed a resolution permitting all vehicles to play within dedicated BRTS lane in locations where metro rail development work is in progress.

98,['20/02/2020'],HC orders police to book man for forging bank’s NOC,"This story is from February 20, 2020

Representative image

AURANGABAD: The Aurangabad bench of Bombay high court recently directed city police to register a case against a man for forging a bank’s no-objection certificate (NOC) and submitting it to the regional transport office (RTO).

The man had forged the letter to show that the Paithan-based bank had issued him the NOC to sell his vehicle that he had bought by taking loan from the bank. The truth came to fore after the RTO officials wrote to the bank seeking confirmation about the NOC.

Subsequently, the bank filed three separate applications with the police. However, when police failed to act, the bank — Shivaji Nagari Sahakari Bank Ltd — moved high court by filing a criminal writ petition through lawyers MS Karad and SS Thombre, seeking directions for the police to register a case against the defaulter under appropriate provisions of the law.

Other than the 47-year-old suspect, Sanjay Bhikaji Salve, the petitioner had made the state government, Aurangabad commissioner of police and inspector of Satara police station as respondents.

On September 27, 2019, when the matter came before the high court, the bench had passed an order in this case following submission of Salve’s lawyer that “he will make payment of the loan amount (to the bank)”.

Salve had stated in his statement to police that he had given the vehicle to a person for use, but that man did not return the vehicle.

The bench comprising justices TV Nalawade and MG Sewlikar, on February 10, observed: “Not a single paise has been deposited by the respondent No.4 (Salve). Admittedly, the NOC was not issued by the bank, but such document was made, created and used and subsequently the vehicle was also not found with the respondent. All these circumstances show that there was intention to deceive the creditor and with that intention the aforesaid steps were taken by the respondent No.4.’’

It added: “When the application is given to police of aforesaid nature and there is record of the aforesaid nature, it is the duty of the police station concerned to register a crime. It is a cognizable offence, but no crime as such is registered and nothing was communicated in respect of the aforesaid correspondence. In view of all these circumstances the petition is allowed. Direction is given to the police station concerned to register the crime on the basis of the aforesaid record the applications given in the police station.”

Kochi: The high court , on Wednesday, dismissed a public interest litigation ( PIL ) seeking a CBI probe into the alleged missing of 25 rifles and 12,061 live cartridges from Kerala police.

A division bench comprising chief justice S Manikumar and justice Shaji P Chaly dismissed the PIL filed by George Vattukulam of Thrissur. While dismissing the plea, the court said the petitioner was not able to bring any materials regarding the case before the court other than media reports and that it cannot order a CBI probe based on media reports alone.

Senior public prosecutor Suman Chakravarthy had argued on behalf of the government that the PIL based purely on media reports is premature and that the state government is taking sufficient action.

The PIL had stated that the missing of rifles and cartridges, which was pointed out in the CAG report, has serious implications on national security. The petitioner had alleged that neither the state government nor the state police chief are conducting a proper investigation. Police force is trying to cover up the matter and a fair probe is not being conducted, the petitioner had alleged.

Even as the court dismissed the PIL seeking a CBI probe on Wednesday, yet another plea was filed before the court raising the same demand. The petition filed by P P Ramachandra Kaimal of Changanassery demanded an order for a probe by either CBI or NIA. tnn

TimesView It's heartening that the visit of the US President has brought good health to the Yamuna. A clean river in the backdrop of the Taj is not only a tourists' delight, but also a boon for the residents. The authorities should take it forward from a two-day affair and make efforts to ensure a permanent solution for the river's rejuvenation. Both tourists and the Taj city residents deserve a clean Yamuna.

AGRA: Ahead of US President Donald Trump’s visit to the Taj Mahal on February 24, an additional 500 cusec of water has been released from the Upper Ganga Canal to improve the ""environmental condition"" of Yamuna river that flows beside the monument and to meet water scarcity in Agra. This will flush away the dirty water and muck, and the relatively clear water in the river will add to the majestic view of the Taj.According to a letter issued by the Uttar Pradesh government, 500 cusec water has been released from the Kot escape in Gautam Budh Nagar on February 17 evening and it will reach the Yamuna in Agra via Mathura on February 22 evening.Talking to TOI, irrigation department superintending engineer Dharmendra Singh Phogat said the aim was to maintain a certain level of water in the Yamuna till February 24. “If 500 cusec of water has been released to control pollution in the river, it will certainly have an impact. This will also improve the oxygen levels in the Yamuna in Mathura and Agra. This move may not make the water in the Yamuna fit for drinking but could reduce the foul smell emanating from the river and improve the water quality,"" he said.Phogat told TOI that 150 cusecs of water is released throughout the year from Harnol escape, Vrindavan. But this time, additional 500 cusecs of water has been released from the Kot escape in Gautam Budh Nagar that will flow into the Hindon river 18 km downstream and then into the Yamuna in Noida and finally reach Mathura and Agra.Irrigation department’s superintending engineer, Agra circle (III), GP Srivastava told TOI that 1,500-1,600 cusec of water is flowing in the Yamuna here (Agra) at this time. “Additional water will increase the level of water in the river by nearly 1 ft,” he said.Agra district magistrate Prabhu N Singh said the Yamuna is also being cleaned. ""It is part of the preparations for US President’s visit to Agra.”An activist, Gopeshwar Nath Chaturvedi, who had filed a petition in the National Green Tribunal (NGT) and the Allahabad high court for cleaning and maintaining the ecological flow of the Yamuna, told TOI, ""The move will surely have a positive impact on the river, but only for a day or two.

Ahmedabad: A man will have to spend 20 years in jail for eloping with a minor girl on two occasions. A special POCSO court in the city sessions court on Wednesday handed down 10-year jail terms to the person in each of two cases, which he has to serve separately because they were separate offences.

In this case, Bhimabhai Bavari, 34, a father of four children, first eloped with the 16-year-old girl from his neighbourhood in Sardarnagar on June 18, 2015. They lived for a brief period in a nearby area. Three days later when they were found out, Bavari escaped. An FIR was lodged for abduction of the minor, rape and offence under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. While on the run, Bavari returned and eloped with the same girl again on August 2, 2015.

He took the girl to Ajmer, hired a room and lived there till August 21, 2015. Bavari was arrested and booked under sections363, 366, 376 of the Indian Penal Code as well as POCSO Act for raping her.

On both occasions, Bavari’s friends too were booked for abetment.

During the trial, assistant public prosecutor Bharat Patani examined 16 witnesses to prove Bavari’s guilt. Since the victim was a minor at the time of incident, the aspect of her consent did not count. Special POCSO judge N P Saiyed found Bavari guilty.

The court, however, acquitted Bavari’s friends.

105,['20/02/2020'],‘People should bring change in edn system’,"This story is from February 20, 2020

Trichy: Celebrating knowledge is an Indian tradition, but the same has now become a burden, said Atul Kothari, national secretary, Shiksha Sanskriti Utthan Nyas.

Saying that all the national-level issues in the country are because of the flaws in the education system, he said discussing problems in the education system has been an academic activity across the country. But the task of finding solution to it is left to the government.

“A democracy where the society and intellectuals depend on government will never succeed. Therefore, Gyanotsav 2020 is organised as a base to start a movement to bring in solutions to the prevailing problems in the education system, he said.

A good government will frame good policies, fund and support good institutions. But bringing in change in the basic education system must be realised by the people.

Value education is discussed a lot these days, which is part of the new education policy. While it will be introduced across the country through syllabus, Kothari said that “no value education can be inculcated among children through textbook syllabus unless teachers and parents are ready for it.”

Government and society need to work together for the change and discuss solutions. There cannot be any alternative to motherland and mother language. Our education system should be based on mother language and there is a need for a positive movement, he said.

“Moral education was an integral part of education system but slowly the system changed, and we dropped it from our curriculum,” Bharathidasan University vice-chancellor P Manisankar said.

NCT principal R Sundararaman said that our education system is far from ideal even after 70 years of Independence. All the reforms, internal assessment and autonomy have not yielded the required results. We need to reorient the purpose of education. The purpose of SSUN is to reinvent traditional wisdom, which will help provide quality education, he said.

The team found that sub-standard materials were used and standard norms were violated while constructing these 272 flats.

The report said the walls have not been plastered properly, and the concrete on the roof has come off at several places, exposing the iron mesh. There are cracks on the columns. Besides, the sewer line was not laid properly, the report said. Following the report, these flats have not been allotted.

Role of nine engineers associated with the project is being investigated.

Under the Basic Services for Urban Poor (BSUP), the UP Housing and Development Board in 2008 started construction of 632 flats for economically weaker section (EWS) category. The construction of the one-bedroom flats was completed in January 2020 with a cost of Rs 22 crore.

A year back, following complaints of poor quality of construction, the state government ordered a probe, following which experts from IIT Roorkee were roped in to conduct an investigation.

A senior officer of section-29 of UP Housing Board said, ""A total of 272 EWS flats at Kalindi Vihar are not suitable to live in. Soon after the orders of the state government, all these flats will be demolished. A proposal has been sent to the state government in this regard”.

Thrissur: A team of police surgeons, on Monday, inspected the house in Kodungallur where four members of a family were found hanging last week.

Police surgeons Dr Manu Johns Chowalloor and Dr Neeraja inspected the home in the presence of Kodungallur CI P K Padmarajan and SI E R Byju. The police team said the four had committed suicide . The bodies of Kozikkada resident Thiaparampath Vinod, 44, wife Rema, 38, daughter Nayana, 17, and son Neeraj, 9, were found hanging inside their home on February 9.

Last week, the police received audio messages which were allegedly sent by Rema to a shopowner. The voice messages say that Rema had quarrelled with her husband and he had threatened to hack her. Irinjalakkuda deputy SP Famous Varghese said, “Rema, who worked in Regal Stores at Vadakkenada near Kodungallur, had sent voice messages to the shopowner Abbas which said that she had a verbal spat with her husband over working in the shop.”

“Rema had joined the firm 24 days before her death, but she had worked there several years ago under another management. The voice messages show that Vinod was upset about Rema working in the shop and they quarrelled over it,” said Varghese. “The family members had no contact with relatives or neighbours. As per evidence collected, the family committed suicide,” Varghese added.

Police also decoded messages which Nayana had sent to her friend. However, they found nothing unusual about the message and ruled out any link with the suicide.

Earlier, Agra SSP spoke about the need for “all hands on deck” during Trump’s visit.

After the Agra SSP order, there was concern among cops, and after the ADG’s intervention, SP protocol was asked to sanction leaves for such cops after proper procedure.

120,['20/02/2020'],"Coronavirus aftermath: Govt mulls stimulus, faster green clearances to back local manufacturing of APIs","NEW DELHI: The government is mulling a fiscal stimulus package and faster environmental clearances to support local manufacturing of some identified active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) used as raw material in medicine formulations, official sources said.The move comes in the wake of concerns of shortage of some key medicines amidst the coronavirus outbreak in China – which is the major supplier of API to not only India but across the globe.In a high level meeting on Wednesday, chaired by NITI Aayog chief executive Amitabh Kant, the government assessed the present situation and discussed several measures including an API policy to revive local manufacturing of API and bulk drugs.“The government assured that it will recommend fiscal package and benefits for the API industry, similar to what has been extended to mobile handset manufacturers in the budget to boost local manufacturing,” an official, present in the meeting told TOI.India imports around 80-85% of APIs from China. While some major pharma companies like Lupin, Sun Pharma and Dr Reddy’s Laboratories manufacture APIs locally for some medicines, but it is mostly for captive use.Local manufacturing for API has been unviable in India as China supplies them at 10-15% lower cost. For past many years, the government has been contemplating a policy to revive the local API manufacturing through incentives etc. However, the policy is yet to be finalised.Apart from officials from the government’s think tank, the meeting at NITI Aayog was attended by senior officials from the department of pharmaceuticals (DoP), National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA), Central Drug Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) and senior executives from the pharmaceutical industry Meanwhile, the DoP has sought orders from the directorate general of foreign trade (DGFT) restricting export of the 12 APIs and formulations. In a letter to DGFT, the department suggested companies should be temporarily restricted from exporting 12 drugs including antibiotics, hormones and vitamins – raw material from which is largely sourced from China’s Hubei and Shandong provinces.However, the industry maintained that there are adequate stocks of both API as well as formulations to continue till mid-May.“The shortage is a perceived shortage. The market always has a stock of medicines for 45 days. In addition, we have a stock of 30 days in our factory. Apart from this, most of the industry – mainly the large players – keep a 90 day inventory of API. Only small scale players are doing panic buying. There is no real shortage,” head of one of the leading pharmaceutical companies said.However, the government maintains that it needs to take precautionary steps to avoid any cascading impact on supplies of essential medicines. “We need to think from the perspective of public health and ensure that supplies continue. Therefore, we have recommended a temporary restriction so that there is no shortage or price hike for patients,” an official said.Though new cases of coronavirus in China appears to be slowing, the death toll from the infection in mainland China crossed 2,000 on Wednesday. China's National Health Commission reported 1,749 new cases, the lowest daily rise since January 29, while Hubei province - the epicentre of the outbreak - reported the lowest number of new infections since February 11.

Ahmedabad: A family court in Ahmedabad has ordered that the custody of two minors, aged eight and six respectively, be given to their earning grandparents rather than to their jobless mother, who herself takes shelter at different family members’ homes.

The family court judge Nizar Ali Karovadiya ordered in a judgment pronounced on February 13 that if the custody of kids was changed then it would traumatize them as the children have been staying with their grandparents constantly and not with the mother.

In August 28, 2017, a Saraspur resident, Sunita Patni, mother of the two kids, had filed a petition with the family court seeking custody of her children from their grandparents — Kanu and Meena Patni, residents of Bapunagar.

Sunita states in the petition that her husband Vijay Patni died on March 19, 2015 following prolonged illness. Later in July 2016, Sunita had gone to her parents’ place as her father fell sick. Sunita had alleged that her in-laws harassed her and did not allow her to meet her children.

On other hand, Kanu and Meena Patni’s advocate Shahenaz Saiyed contended that the kids were brought up by their grandparents only, who provided them education, health and shelter unlike their mother who herself is not earning and depended upon her family members.

The family court judge observed that the court has to decide on the point of welfare of the children and not on the rights of the parents.

“The children are living with the opponents (grandparents) before and after the death of their father and hence sudden change in their custody would traumatise them. Applicant mother failed to prove that in paramount interest and welfare of the minors, the custody of minors requires to be given to her. It is very clear from the evidence on record that the applicant is not entitled to get the custody of the minors,” the court ordered.

The court observed that children should not be deprived of their mother’s love and ordered that she could take their custody in the evening of every second Saturday and bring them back to their grandparents on Sunday morning.

Nashik: The Bombay high court has summoned Nashik municipal commissioner Radhakrishna Game, asking him to be personally present before the court on Thursday.

The bench comprising Justices S Kathawala and Milind Jadhav gave the instructions on February 17 while hearing a writ petition filed by the parents of two school students. The petitioners were seeking a direction to the civic body to make the Don Bosco Road area hawker-free as five educational institutes, including a hostel, were located there.

“During the hearing, the court directed the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) to remove the illegal hawkers and encroachments near the schools within eight days. However, the civic body had sought more time. That is when the court directed the municipal commissioner to be personally present before the court on February 20 at 11 am,” said Sachin Shinde, the lawyer for the petitioners.

Game confirmed to TOI that the court has directed him to be personally present on February 20.

In their petition, the parents had pointed out that the problem of illegal hawkers began on that road, towards the Thatte Nagar stretch, from June 2018. “Due to the presence of these illegal hawkers, problems like illegal parking, sale of junk food and littering of the area have surfaced. It also leads to traffic congestions, posing threat to the safety of students,” claimed the parents in the petition.

According to them, various hawkers park their food trucks not more than 20m from the school premises and the adjoining educational institutions. “The students were affected due to the sale of junk food. The increase in traffic and illegal parking has also made the area unsafe for the school children, who travel on bicycles or by foot, the parents added

The petitioners also drew the attention of the court to the fact that due to the nature of hawking, it attracts anti-socials who consume alcohol and create nuisance on that road. Some of these anti-social elements also harass the students.

According to the petitioners, parents and school authorities have taken up the issue with the NMC at least six times. “But the NMC failed to realise the seriousness of the problem,” said the parents.

NMC sources said that removal of encroachments takes time as due process has to be followed and, therefore, has sought more time.

Thiruvananthapuram: The state government has decided to ask all local self governments to find three cents of land each along the state and national highways to construct toilet complexes.

The cabinet meeting on Wednesday decided to construct 12,000 such toilet complexes along the highways. Each of the toilet complexes will have separate male and female toilets .

Dearth of public toilets is causing difficulties for people, especially women and children, while travelling by road across the state. There is also a situation that toilets at petrol pumps are restricted to its customers, observed the cabinet meeting. It is against this backdrop that the government has decided to come up with toilet complexes across the state. Agencies willing to cooperate with the project would be made partners. Plots belonging to government, public sector undertakings and cooperative institutions would be utilised for the purpose.

Complexes will also have small shops and snack parlours in potential areas, according to the cabinet decision. The construction and maintenance expenses of the complexes would be borne by respective local self governments.

Finance minister Thomas Isaac had promised this proposal in his budget speech for the year 2020-21. In his speech he had said 12,000 public toilets will be constructed in 2020-21.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Sree Chitra Thirunal Institute of Medical Science and Technology (SCTIMST) has developed affordable aortic stent graft and its delivery system for the treatment of thoracic aortic aneurysm .

An aortic aneurysm is a ballooning or enlargement of the aorta. Aortic aneurysm is a disease affecting about 5% of the population in their late sixties and can be fatal in case of rupture.

Most patients with aortic aneurysms do not have any symptoms at all. The aneurysm is usually discovered by X-ray during a routine health exam for some other, unrelated condition.

“As there is no indigenous device available in the market for thoracic aortic aneurysm, the institute decided to develop an indigenous affordable stent graft and its delivery system. The imported stent graft (along with its delivery system) costs at least Rs 3.5 lakhs,” said Dr Asha Kishore, director of the institute.

The stent graft is made of polyester fabric in tubular form and are scaffolded by NiTi (Nickel Titanium alloy) rings (stents), which are sewed in to the tubular fabric. The NiTi rings were made in collaboration with National Aerospace Laboratories, Bangalore (CSIR-NAL).

The stent graft is crimped to a lower diameter and is inserted in to the catheter sheath (small diameter delivery tube) of the delivery system.

The stent graft has been developed by the project team headed by Dr Sujesh Sreedharan, Engineer-F, division of artificial internal organs, biomedical technology wing, Dr Jayadevan E R, additional professor, imaging sciences and interventional radiology, Dr Santhosh Kumar K, additional professor, imaging sciences and interventional radiology and Dr Unnikrishnan M, professor, cardiovascular and thoracic surgery.

The stent graft expands and fixes firmly on the inner aortic wall because of the super elastic property exerted by the NiTi rings. Once the stent graft is in place, blood flow occurs only through the conduit created by the stent graft, thus excluding the aneurysm and preventing its rupture.

TRICHY: A man was arrested by the all women police station (AWPS), Jeeyapuram in Trichy on Tuesday for branding his 11-year-old daughter with a hot stainless steel spoon.

The accused has been identified as T Govindaraj, 48, of Kallikudi.

Last week, the girl went shopping with her aunt without the knowledge of her father. Enraged, Govindaraj heated a stainless steel spoon and branded the girl on her right shoulder, right thigh, left armpit and right cheek.

Some relatives noticed the injuries when the girl attended a marriage on February 13. One of them called Childline and alerted officials.

Childline coordinator Muralikumar rescued the girl on February 14 and produced her before the Child Welfare Committee (CWC), Trichy. The committee referred the girl to Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital (MGMGH). After treatment, the parents took her home. But her mother was reluctant on filing a case against Govindaraj.

“The family members including the mother attempted to cover up the incident since he was her father. Since we were aware of the issue and the girl was severely wounded by the branding, it was our duty to bring the culprit before the law,” Muralikumar told TOI on Wednesday.

On the direction of the CWC, Muralikumar filed a complaint based on which the Jeeyapuram all-women police registered a case and arrested Govindaraj. He has been remanded in judicial custody.

This is the second such incident within one month reported from the district.

In the earlier incident, a24-year-old man was arrested for sexually assaulting his 12-year-old minor stepdaughter and branding her with hot iron on her body in Woraiyur on January 25.

Thanjavur: Coconut trees in nearly 7,500 acres in and around Thanjavur district have been affected by Rugose Spiraling Whitefly (RSW) infestation, farmers said. Farmers have stressed the need to control the menace in their plantations. However, officials from the agriculture department have asked them to follow a few scientific methods to control the insect attack.

Farmers have raised coconut trees in 95,760 acres in Thanjavur district. Of them, around 7,500 acres are affected by the Rugose pest. Rugose Spiraling Whitefly has been noticed in coconut trees in Peravurani, Pattukottai, Orathanadu taluks and some other places in Thanjavur district. The insects suck sap and causes damage to leaf fronds by secreting a honeydew-like substance on the leaves. It induces the development of sooty mould fungus and because of this leaves turn black reducing photosynthesis rate, joint director of agriculture department, Thanjavur, A Justin said. A Palanivel, a progressing coconut farmer from Kuruvikarambai in Peravurani taluk in the district, has coconut trees in 35 acres.

The pest was spotted on his coconut trees, he said. “Several coconut trees in our taluk have been infected by the pest. Agriculture department officials should visit coconut groves and help farmers to control the pest immediately. Last year farmers lost their trees in Gaja cyclone. This year the pest may cause loss,” he said.

Meanwhile, the agriculture department has suggested various measures to control the menace. They have asked farmers to conserve natural enemies of the pest like encarsia parasitoids, chrysoprase and coccinellids in coconut ecosystem by avoiding insecticides. Placing yellow sticky traps smeared with castor oil or horticultural mineral oil can be used for monitoring the population. If needed spraying neem oil @ 3% or neem seed kernel extract @ 5% could help minimizing the population build-up.

Naidu launched his state-wide ‘Praja Chaitanya Yatra ’ with a public meeting at Murtur in Prakasam district on Wednesday.

Speaking at the meet, Naidu said the state government owed an explanation to the people as to why big firms like Reliance and Adani backed away from putting their money in the state. He said that Kia Motors was contemplating to leave the state due to panic created by the government.

“What is the use of having 75% reservations in industries when no industry is coming to the state,” Naidu asked. He said that the state has lost nearly Rs 1.8 lakh crore investments in the last nine months.

He said that Jagan had taken a Tughlaqian decision to create three capital cities for the state only out of his vengeance against his plans to build an economic super power capital city Amaravati. He said that a big capital city would have created many jobs.

“Amaravati is being seen as the capital of a one particular community. Can any city survive with one community? Can we find any town or village in the state with a population of one particular community? Is it not a smear campaign?” Naidu said.

He said that Jagan has stalled development in the state. He said that revenue touched rock bottom with the government struggling to pay salaries. Naidu listed out nine major blunders of the YSRC government committed in the last nine months. He said that Jagan has taken u-turn on many promises including Amma Vodi.

AHMEDABAD: A chartered accountant (CA) from the Satellite area of the city on Tuesday filed a complaint of cheating against a builder and two others for cheating him of Rs 42 lakh by selling the same flat and giving its possession to another person which was already sold to the CA.

In his FIR with Ananadnagar police, Malhar Mehta, 39, said that he also works for a Mumbai-based firm which invests in properties. In 2015, Mehta had fixed a deal of buying a flat in a housing scheme named Stavan Avisha made by the builder Mihir Desai through its firm Sambhav Infrastructure Private Limited in the Jodhpur area.

It was decided to pay Rs 42 lakh for the flat out of which Rs 40 lakh was paid though RTGS (Real Time Gross Settlement). On November 20, 2015, Mehta was given the allotment letter, possession letter and he was handed over the flat.

Mehta states in the FIR that he was not provided the documents of the flats. After this, he approached a local court which in January 29, 2018 ordered the builder to give the documents to Mehta. Even after that, Desai did not provide Mehta any documents, states the FIR.

On July 22, 2019, Mehta had sent his employee to the flat for its maintenance work. When Mehta’s staffer, Kalpesh Rabari reached there, he found that someone else was living in the flat. On inquiring about it, Mehta came to know that Desai had first sold the same flat to an Isanpur resident Bharat Padia who had given the flat on rent to another person named Pratik Patel, a resident of Anandnagar.

Later, Mehta approached police and filed a complaint of cheating, breach of trust, forgery and criminal conspiracy against Desai, Padia and Patel.

My father and my mother never had birth certificates.” The book Sen released is the outcome of a collaborative research project undertaken by The Asiatic Society and his Pratichi Institute.

Asked about the World Population Review report ranking India as the fifth largest economy in 2019, overtaking France and the UK, Sen said, “There is nothing to be proud of India emerging as the fifth largest economy in the world. It is not surprising that India’s total transactions are greater than that of France and UK. Ours is a much larger population. China is the only country with a population larger than ours.”

Asked about the economic wellbeing of Adivasis in ‘new India’, Sen said, “I find nothing new in the new India. I would have been happy had it been a newer India. People have sought votes of Adivasis with many promises for them. But the reality is that nothing much has been done for them.”

After releasing the book, Sen spoke of deprivation of Adivasis in Bengal and rest of India, a factor leading them to suffer from lack of self-respect. “Their achievements have been constrained because of the disadvantages in their circumstances. There is no question about their deprivation, be it in education, healthcare or social security,” he said

134,['20/02/2020'],West Bengal: Examinee held with mobile; candidates with gadgets to face expulsion and legal action,"This story is from February 20, 2020

Two Madhyamik examinees, Sujata Singh and Sonali Mahato, from Keshiarai in West Midnapore met with an accident... Read More

KOLKATA/MALDA: On a day a Madhyamik examinee was arrested for using a smart phone at an exam venue in Malda’s Samsi, the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education said that any candidate found with a mobile phone or electronic gadget inside the examination hall shall forthwith be expelled from the examination. The candidate’s mobile will be seized and sent with the answer script to the Madhyamik Board notified as Reported Against (RA). Legal action will also be initiated against the candidate, the board said.

The decisions were announced after state education minister Partha Chatterjee called board president Kalyanmoy Ganguly following the arrest of the student. Six other mobile phones were confiscated from students across exam centres in the state.

A senior board official said: “If a candidate is found to have taken a picture of the question paper with mobile phone and sent it to another person, the officer-in-charge of the main venue shall, on behalf of the board, lodge an FIR with the local police station against the candidate and the recipients of the photographs.”

Even teachers and non-teaching employees will be slapped with charges for violation of any order. As per the decision taken by the Board of Discipline, if any teaching or non-teaching employee is found to contravene restrictions of the board and be involved in any malpractice, they may be debarred from entering the venue to take part in the examination process. Also, after completing a disciplinary committee report, the person may be suspended or disciplinary proceedings may be initiated against him/her. “We hope the decisions will act as a deterrent against such malpractices,” added the board official.

In Malda, the arrest sent ripples among all concerned amid the allegation of question leak for the second day of the examination. What made the situation worse was that apart from several photographs of the English language question papers being circulated through WhatsApp, another set of question paper went viral through TikTok in the first hour.

The boy who was arrested was a student of Baharal High School of Ratua and he was taking his examination at Baidyanath High School of Samsi. He allegedly took the picture of the question paper just after the examination started and sent it via internet. After some time, the invigilator found the mobile with the candidate and detained him. He reportedly admitted that he had committed the misdeed. The school authority informed police and a force from Ratua police station reached the school to arrest the candidate. Police superintendent Aloke Rajoria said: “We have arrested the examinee for taking the mobile phone with him in the exam hall and he would be produced in juvenile court tomorrow.”

Meanwhile, a TikTok video with the photo of the English question paper, which became viral during the examination, was found to be a fake one. Police are trying to find out the source of the video and the question paper seen in this video.

Biplab Gupta, convener of the examination in Malda, refused to comment on the allegation of the paper leak.

Over 100 containers, with 14 tonne of grapes in each, had been stranded on the Bangladesh border for the past ... Read More

NASHIK: More than 100 containers of grapes from Nashik , which had been stopped on the Bangladesh border due to lack of certain permissions, have finally left for Bangladesh after the Union ministry of commerce intervened to resolve the issue.

Over 100 containers, with 14 tonne of grapes in each, had been stranded on the Bangladesh border for the past two-three days. Dindori BJP MP Bharti Pawar had taken up the matter with Union minister Piyush Goyal, who immediately sorted out the issue.

“I had received complaints from some exporters and farmers about the grape containers being stranded on the Bangladesh border. I took up the matter with the commerce minister and settled the issue. Now, all the containers have left for Bangladesh,” said Pawar.

Meanwhile, grape exports from the Nashik district to various European countries have gathered momentum.

So far, the Nashik district has exported around 27,000 tonne of grapes to European countries, including 20,000 tonnes to the Netherlands, 3,000 tonne to Germany and 2,900 tonne to the United Kingdom.

During the same period last year, Nashik district had exported 32,000 tonne of grapes to the European countries.

There has been a drop in grape export when compared to the corresponding period last year. This is because the unseasonal rain in September and October had damaged the vineyards. That had resulted in a drop in export of grapes, said Manik Patil, a senior member of the Maharashtra Rajya Draksh Bagayatdar Sangh, an association of grape growers.

KOLKATA: A neurologist has served a legal notice on the West Bengal Medical Council (WBMC), asking it to pay Rs 20 crore for defamation, Rs 60 lakh compensation for loss of income and 7 lakhs for legal cost. The council had barred the doctor from practicing for a year in 2017, holding him guilty of medical negligence while treating a patient in Durgapur. But the Supreme Court set aside WBMC’s verdict in February 2019, exonerating him of the charge. Sources in WBMC said this was the first time the council has received a legal notice for defamation and compensation.The council had suspended neurologist Snigdhendu Ghosh’s registration in July 2017 for one year while pronouncing him guilty of medical negligence in a 2010 case. Challenging the WBMC, Ghosh moved the Calcutta HC which, in turn, quashed the council’s verdict, asking it to reinstate the doctor’s registration.The council, however, filed an SLP at the SC. The apex court too exonerated Ghosh on February 20, 2019, upholding the Calcutta HC judgement passed of 19 July 2018. The HC, while delivering its verdict, had also observed that Gosh could petition for compensation for the time he could not pursue his profession. Ghosh could not practice for 11 months.“I will wait for two months for the council to respond to the legal notice. If they fail to respond, I will file a defamation suit and also seek other damages,” said Ghosh, who now heads the neurology department at Mission Hospital, Durgapur.WBMC registrar Manas Chakraborti said: “We received the legal notice on Tuesday. To my the best my knowledge this is the first time the council has got such a legal notice for paying up a doctor whose licence was cancelled. We are consulting our lawyers and we will move the court against the demand for damages as WBMC has no provision for such compensation.”The case of the medical negligence dates back to December 2010. A teenage girl had died in a hospital in Durgapur a day after she was shifted from another hospital where Ghosh had checked on her, filling in for another doctor, under whom the patient had been admitted. Accusing Ghosh of medical negligence, the girl’s father approached the WBMC.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74223239,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-360347,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/doc-seeks-rs-20cr-in-damages-from-state-medical-council/articleshow/74215285.cms

Trichy: Tamil Nadu governor Banwarilal Purohit on Wednesday said it is good to be religious minded as it will prevent people from committing sins. He also spoke about making India corruption-free.

The governor was speaking here after inaugurating Gyanotsav 2020 - an educational conclave organised by Shiksha Sanskriti Uthan Nyas, New Delhi.

“Human beings have weaknesses. We tend to commit sins thinking that no one is watching us. But if we are religious and fear God, our inner sense will prevent us from committing sins,” he said.

Speaking about a corruption-free India, the governor said former President of India A P J Abdul Kalam had stressed on leading a simple life by being content with “whatever we have.”

“Limit our necessities. Then, even if someone tries to bribe us, we will find it useless as we will not be driven by greed,” he said.

He asked educational institutions to become centres for social transformation.

“Institutions shall adopt villages, provide them support, enlighten them about various schemes of the Centre and the state government and contribute to the welfare of the society,” he said.

He added that over two-third of India’s population comprise youth and if this population is provided with proper skill sets, they shall provide the country with potential quality work force for the next three to four decades.

AHMEDABAD: A consumer court here has ordered Air India to pay compensation to a US-based couple for the inconvenience caused to them due to flight cancellation following a pilots’ strike in 2012.

Indravadan and Ila Amin, an elderly couple originally from Vadodara and based in Austin in USA, had sued the airline in 2013 and the Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum, Ahmedabad city last week ordered Air India to pay them Rs 40,000 compensation for mental agony and hardships.

In this case, the Amins booked their ticket for an Air India flight to Ahmedabad on May 21, 2012. But because the airline’s pilots were on a strike, at Newark airport the couple along with other passengers were sent to a motel, which was full. From there, they were redirected to another motel. After nearly four hours of wandering, they received a call from the airline that they should return to the airport and board a flight to New Delhi. The couple was made to wait at the New Delhi international airport till May 23 morning, when they were given passes for an Ahmedabad-bound plane.

The couple approached the consumer court complaining that they were put to unnecessary inconvenience by the airline and had to travel in a bus in USA from one to the other motel with luggage. They were not even offered a glass of water. They also complained about the delay in New Delhi. The airline defended its case.

After the hearing, the consumer court said that the couple was meted out undue hardships and deficiency in service. “They were made to suffer inconvenience and hardships at Newark and New Delhi airports without their fault. Under such circumstances, it was the duty of Air India to treat the passengers in a very cordial and harmonious manner at both the airports,” the court observed while fixing the compensation at Rs 15,000 for each passenger with 9% interest and Rs 10,000 for expenditure they had incurred on litigation. The couple had demanded Rs 2.51 lakh in compensation.

Trichy: A non-surgical procedure used to remove kidney stones, was performed on a 39-year-old woman at the Pudukottai Medical College Hospital on Saturday (February 15).

The procedure - percutaneous nephrolithotomy - which may cost around Rs 1 lakh in a private hospital, was successfully done free of cost in this hospital under chief minister’s comprehensive health insurance scheme.

The patient, Mala from Poondi of Thanjavur district, was admitted in the hospital on Thursday with complaints of abdominal pain.

On examination, it was found that she had right pelvic stone, which is 15mm in diameter. The doctors decided to break the stone without surgery by a procedure called percutaneous nephrolithotomy, which is performed when kidney stones cannot pass on their own from the body.

“Normally, the ureteric stones would be broken by ureteroscopy. But this patient had a stone in the renal pelvis,” said dean Dr Meenakshisundaram. This requires a procedure for which 15 days hospitalization is required and chances of incisional hernia would be high. Therefore, percutaneous nephrolithotomy was planned, he said.

He added that this was the first percutaneous nephrolithotomy procedure done in the government Pudukkottai medical college hospital. He said the hospital did not have the specific nephroscope for this purpose. It was mobilized from outside for the patient.

A team led by dean Dr A L Meenakshisundaram, along with Dr Senthilnathan, Dr Latha, Dr David and Dr Saravanan, performed the procedure.

The surgery lasted for four hours and three units of blood were transfused. The patient was discharged on Wednesday.

Nashik: The women and child welfare committee of the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has accused the civic administration of diverting its funds — which amounts to 5% of the total budget — elsewhere.

The committee members alleged that the civic administration is also not taking cognizance of the committee’s decisions.

Mayor Satish Kulkarni has called a meeting of the committee members and the civic officials on Thursday.

“As per norms, 5% funds of the total budget amount is allocated to the NMC’s women and child welfare committee. However, the funds are diverted elsewhere without taking us being taken into confidence. This is a matter of grave concern,” said Hemlata Kandekar, the chairperson of the committee.

“This has been happening for the past three years. By calculation, 5% of the total budget is close to Rs 100 crore. But these funds are being diverted elsewhere by the civic administration,” Kandekar added.

“We have no rights over anything and our works are also not implemented by the civic administration. The repair works at a few angawadis of the municipal corporation had been approved by the general body last year, but they are yet to be taken up,” said Kandedkar.

Kandekar alleged that the committee had also approved the proposal to provide training to women to operate pink rickshaws in the city two years ago. It took almost two years to send this proposal to the general body meeting for its approval. “I don’t know when the civic administration will implement it,” she said.

Committee members Samina Meman, Ranjana Borade and others also the same thing.

The mayor has taken the serious cognizance of the allegation and has decided to call a separate meeting of civic officials and members of women and child welfare committee.

145,['20/02/2020'],"Soon, cuts on dividers to ease commuting woes","This story is from February 20, 2020

Allahabad: The district administration has decided to provide road cuts on dividers at 21 points across the city, especially at important public utility points, to facilitate commuters who have to cover long distances to reach their destinations.

TOI had raised the issue in October last year.

Many road dividers were constructed in the city as part of smart city project which run for long distances without any cuts or openings. As a result, the commuters either have to jump the dividers, or cover long distance and take a U-turn to reach their destination.

According to officials, the administration has decided to provide cuts at 21 points on different roads including MG road, Nawab Yusuf road, Stanley road, Thornhill road, Kutchery road, PD Tandon road, Master JH road, Prayag Street, Elgin road and Church lane road.

Mission manager of smart city (technical) Sanjeev Sinha said, “As per the norms of the Road Safety Act, commuters should be provided with the facility of zebra crossing. Soon, roads in the city will be provided with cuts and zebra crossings.”

MG Road in Civil Lines area has dividers but planners did not provide a cut and a zebra crossing at Civil Lines bus depot and several other public utility spots on the stretch.

Commuters and passengers on this specific place are more vulnerable because of the fact that it is not only a bus depot but adjacent to it is a mall and state-owned hotel which are frequented by large number of locals as well as people coming from other cities.

Amit Srivastava of Jhunsi said, “Who is asking for a broad opening in dividers? The authorities should at least think of passengers, especially women, for whom crossing the road is a tedious job.”

Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International (SVPI) airport in Ahmedabad

AHMEDABAD: In a bid to prevent incidents of bird strikes at the city airport, authorities of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International (SVPI) airport in Ahmedabad have asked the civic body to maintain cleanliness in airport neighbourhoods. The concern has been raised specifically in the wake of the upcoming visit of US President Donald Trump. The US president will land at the city airport around noon on February 24.

Some 37 bird strikes were reported at the SVPI airport in 2019, against 87,875 aircraft movements throughout the year. This makes it an average 4.1 bird strikes per 10,000 movements.

“Open disposal of waste in areas near the airport including Meghaninagar, Kubernagar and Sardarnagar often attracts birds. These areas fall in the take-off and landing route of aircraft, causing a safety threat. The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation ’s (AMC) support has thus been sought by the AAI to keep surroundings of the city airport clean,” said a source.

A Bengaluru-bound flight suffered a bird-strike on Tuesday itself, while rolling for take-off. The Airbus 320 aircraft was eventually grounded. A source also revealed that a few other factors that impact bird movements around the airport and along the funnel area i.e. the take-off and landing route of aircraft, include the Pirana dumpsite and erratic disposal of meat waste around the Asarwa fish market. A series of such representations have been made in the past by the AAI to the civic authorities, in an attempt to curb bird strikes.

Acoustic devices in addition to shot launchers, firecrackers, grass cutting machines and a team of bird chasers has been deployed at the city airport to keep the birds in check.

Nashik: The state government has increased the limit of serving 1,000 Shiv Bhojan thalis in Nashik district to 2,000 a day and the district administration has started scouting for new centres that would stand by the terms and conditions laid down by the government.

The Shiv Bhojan thali is offered to the needy at just Rs 10 through the state government’s scheme. The thali is served at specified centres across the district. There are six Shiv Bhojan thali centres in the city, of which, four offer 150 thalis a day and two offer 125 per day.

There is one centre at Malegaon that serves 150 thalis a day as part of the government’s subsidized lunch initiative.

The state government pays Rs 40 for each thali and Rs 10 is to be contribute by the beneficiary.

“As per earlier conditions, every city was able to provide food to 700 people per day as every centre could provide 150 thalis. The revised government resolution said that food could be provided to 1,000 people in the city and every centre should deliver 200 thalis,” Nashik district supply officer Arun Narsikar said.

The district administration is now looking for hotels or institutions that can provide Shiv Bhojan thalis to people along with agreeing to the terms and conditions laid down by the government.

“The government has laid down the condition that the Shiv Bhojan thali centre should be a non-profit organization and preferably be run by women self-help groups. The organisation/centre should be able to easily cater to the needy or people coming to the city for work,” the officer said.

Ahmedabad: US president Donald Trump is likely to abort his plan to his visit the Sabarmati Gandhi Ashram on February 24. A detailed press release from the foreign secretary’s office in Delhi states that on February 25 morning — the a day following the Ahmedabad visit — President Trump and first lady Melania Trump will be accorded a ceremonial welcome at the forecourt of Rashtrapati Bhawan. “From there, President Trump and the first lady will go to Raj Ghat to pay respects at the samadhi of Mahatma Gandhi.”

A senior state government official told TOI that it is likely that Trump may drop his plan to visit the Sabarmati ashram as he and Melania are visiting Raj Ghat in Delhi the very next day.

Elaborating on Trump’s Ahmedabad plans, foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla at a press briefing in Delhi on Wednesday said, “The highlight of the programme in Ahmedabad will be the exhibition of India’s rich and diverse culture and heritage to President Trump in a public manner that has few parallels in India or elsewhere.” As many as 28 stages representing various parts of the country are being set up along the 22-km route of what is being called the ‘India Road Show’. Trump’s visit will be brief but intense, with all essential elements of a state visit, and two additional legs in Ahmedabad and Agra, all squeezed into less than 36 hours, a release from Shringla’s office said.

It adds, “The Ahmedabad road show route will feature decorations depicting different events in the life of Gandhiji, whose association with the city are so well known. The route of their travel to the stadium is expected to have tens of thousands of ordinary citizens of India as well as artistes showcasing the performing art from different states and Union Territories of India. There will be public to greet President Trump outside the Motera stadium. Inside the new stadium, President Trump and Prime Minister Modi will address a capacity audience, which will include people from various parts of India and all walks of life, reflecting the diversity of India. The release states, “President Trump will address the ‘Namaste Trump’ event jointly with Prime Minister Modi at the newly-built Motera Cricket Stadium in Ahmedabad. It will be similar to the landmark ‘Howdy Modi!’ event hosted by the Indian-American community in honour of Prime Minister Modi during his visit to Houston in September 2019, in which President Trump participated.”

Hardik Patel

AHMEDABAD: A magisterial court at the Mirzapur rural court campus has issued a non-bailable warrant against Congress leader Hardik Patel , who was also the former convener of the Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS), in connection with an FIR registered for taking out a rally in Bopal in 2017 without permission.

As Patel did not attend court proceedings in this case, the court issued an arrest warrant. This is the second arrest warrant issued against Patel for skipping court proceedings.

On February 7, a city sessions court issued an arrest warrant against him for his absence during the trial in a sedition case, in which he had obtained bail last month on the promise of attending court proceedings without fail.

On Monday, the Gujarat high court refused him anticipatory in an offence registered by Vastrapur police more than four years ago, for violence that occurred at the GMDC ground on the evening of August 25, 2015, after Patel took up a fast, following a mammoth rally to push the demand for reservations for the Patidar community.

Patel approached the high court after a city sessions court on January 30 refused to grant him legal protection to him from possible arrest. Citing this possible arrest, Patel had sought exemption from attendance in the sedition case proceedings on February 7, but the sessions court refused to accept his demand and instead issued an arrest warrant for not honouring his word.

Thiruvananthapuram: For the first time since its inception in 2014, APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University is organzing a pooled campus recruitment for engineering students.

The recruitment drive, planned exclusively for Infosys , say university sources, would be a boon for meritorious students who missed out on campus recruitment opportunities owing to location disadvantage of their colleges. Major recruiters are often reluctant to go to colleges in far-flung areas. However, students from major colleges are not barred from participating in the pooled drive.

The first batch of BTech students graduated from the varsity in 2019. The pooled drive planned is for students completing their course with impressive academic track record in 2020. The drive is likely to be held on February 27, 28 and 29.

“Infosys has requested the university for such a pooled drive. It would be held in the last week of February at Saintgits College of Engineering in Kottayam district. The college has volunteered to host the pooled drive and Infosys too has expressed satisfaction over the facilities available there,” sources said.

Over 4,000 students have already registered for the combined selection drive, and among them a majority are students from self-financing engineering colleges. “The number of students who applied for the drive from government, aided and government run self-financing colleges are very few, compared to private self-financing colleges,” sources said.

According to them, it could either be because the students from government and aided colleges have already received very good offers through campus placements or have not properly been informed about it by the college authorities.

No registration charge would be levied on students who participate in the pooled drive. The partnering college would be providing all infrastructure facilities, including online testing facilities for over 250 candidates at one go.

University authorities would ensure that students get worthy offers and are not entangled in oppressive bonds by the recruiters.

Arresting a year-on-year slump, admission figures in engineering colleges in the state has recorded an 8% upsurge in 2019, as per the student registration details collated by the university.

KOLHAPUR: The Juna Rajwada police have arrested five suspects for allegedly kidnapping four youths and extorting Rs 12 lakh from one of them by posing as police.

The Juna Rajwada police said the suspects had threatened to invoke charges under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act against one of the kidnapped youth . Three more suspects involved in the case are at large and police are on their lookout.

The arrested have been identified as Yogesh Shankarrao Patole (32, resident of Medhe Park, Near Shingnapur water tank, taluka Karveer), Tahir Shabbir Magdum (30, resident of Azad chowk, Herle, taluka Hatkanangle), Noman Dilawar Shekh (19, resident of Temblai Naka, Railway gate no.2), Suraj Sunil Bhosale (24, resident of Herle, near KDCC bank, taluka Hatkanangle) and Gajanan Sachin Thorvat (30, resident of SaneGuruji Vasahat, Kolhapur).

All were produced before local court on Wednesday and the court sent four of them into police custody up to February 24 and Thorvat to magistrates custody.

Police have registered a case under sections 364 (A) (Kidnapping for ransom, etc.), 386 (Extortion by putting a person in fear of death or grievous hurt) and section 170 (Personating a public servant) of the Indian Penal Code. Shahu Sandip Powar (19, resident of Sane Guruji Vasahat, Kolhapur) lodged complaint in this regard.

Pramod Jadhav, inspector in-charge of Juna Rajwada police station, said, “Powar is a college student. On the afternoon of December 4, 2019, four suspects approached Powar’s friend, who was loitering at Gandhi maidan and forcibly took him in their car. They enquired about Powar’s financial background and later released him.”

“On December 5, when Powar and three of his friends, including the one who was earlier kidnapped, were standing at a cyber chowk, the suspects kidnapped them. The suspects pretended that they were police officials attached with local crime branch and had picked them as they had information that the four youths were involved in criminal activities,” Jadhav said.

Jadhav said that the suspects demanded that Powar pay Rs 34 lakh. “They threatened to book Powar under charges of rape and robbery and invoking MCOCA against him and his friends. Powar initially stated told them that he would not be able to pay them the money, but finally conceded to pay Rs 12 lakh. On the same day, Powar handed over them Rs 5.40 lakh and on December 6, he gave them Rs 6.60 lakh,” he said.

“However, when the suspects again contacted him on January 5, January 10 and February 17 and demanded Rs 6 lakh from him and threatened to kill him, he lodged a complaint with us,” Jadhav said.

Jadhav said that the police set a trap to catch the suspects. The police told Powar to contact the suspects and tell them that he was ready to pay Rs 6 lakh. The suspects asked him to meet them at Kedar park area on February 18.

“We accordingly set the trap and when the suspects approached Powar to collect cash, a team of policemen nabbed them. However, three suspects managed to ran away and we have launched search operation to nab them,” he said.

157,['20/02/2020'],Registration for Pashu Aadhaar begins in dist,"This story is from February 20, 2020

Visakhapatnam: Around eight lakh cattle and buffaloes in Visakhapatnam district are set to get their Information Network for Animal Productivity and Health (INAPH) tags or Pashu Aadhaar in a couple of months as the animal husbandry department has begun the registration and tagging process for the 5.19 lakh cattle and 2.55 lakh buffaloes in the district.

The animals would be tagged with tamper-proof ID, which will have details of their age, colour, height, lactation, sex and breed among other details along with the owner’s name. Apart from this, the animals’ health and vaccination details would also be entered into the INAPH application database, which has been developed by the National Dairy Development Board.

As per the schedule, the registration and tagging process should be completed within 45 days. But officials are likely to need more time as they have to cover interior pockets and hilly terrain in the Agency.

“We have started the tagging process. We have to register all the cattle under the National Animal Disease Control Programme. This has become a compulsory process for all the states in the country,” the joint director of Visakhapatnam animal husbandry department, D Ramakrishna, told TOI.

The Aadhaar-like system for animals was introduced last year, following a government committee recommending UID for cattle and buffaloes to prevent animal trafficking after the Supreme Court in 2015 directed the government to address cattle smuggling.

Presently, the government has initiated INAPH for cows, bulls, oxen and other domestic animals. So far, 1.52 lakh animals have been tagged with the unique identification number in the district, Ramakrishna said.

The officials are going to register another 6.24 lakh animals. Presently, the vaccination programme has been going on in the district and along with this the tagging programme was also taken up, sources in the animal husbandry department said.

Allahabad: With no let up in law and order situation and repeated complaints from citizens, state’s top brass is set to revive the beat police system under which a sub-inspector and beat constables would investigate crime in their area.

Of the total 100 police stations selected by the state police authorities across UP for revival of beat system, five are in Allahbad range — Kydganj and Khiri in Allahabad, Fatanpur in Pratapgarh, Malwa in Fatehpur and Manjhanpur in Kaushambi.

IG (Allahabad range) KP Singh told TOI, “Sub-inspector and beat constables have already been given Radio Transmission (RT) set, CUG mobile phone and motorcycles. They will soon be allotted body-worn cameras in order to facilitate prompt action on crime spot, including collection of evidence.

Emphasizing on the pros of beat system, an official said, “Beat policemen are in direct touch with the residents of their respective areas. With the revamped beat system, they can address the problems of their areas in a better manner.”

This is the first time that state police have initiated the process to provide smart gadgets like RT sets, body-worn cameras, bikes and CUG mobile sets to the beat staff.

The staff have also been directed to compile data such as details of prominent citizens, arms license holders, criminals, people aiding criminals, important and trouble-prone places, hotels/guest houses and religious places of their respective areas.

In addition, beat constables have also been encouraged to interact with prominent citizens of their areas to keep track of day-to-day activities and brief senior police officials on a routine basis, an official said.

If successful, the revived plan would also be launched in rest of the police stations, said another official.

159,['20/02/2020'],"Cyber frauds thrive, over 800 cases pending in four districts","This story is from February 20, 2020

Allahabad: Investigations into at least 836 cases of online fraud are pending in the four districts of Prayagraj range, with Allahabad police having the maximum backlog of 748 cases, followed by Pratapgarh (33), Fatehpur (31) and Kaushambi (24).

The startling numbers came to the fore after the range police brass on Wednesday reviewed the status of pending cyber fraud cases registered with various thanas in the four districts. They found at least 361 cases where the investigations are pending for over six months.

IG (Prayagraj) KP Singh is learnt to have instructed district police authorities to take “effective and prompt measures” to solve the 800-plus cases at the earliest. He has also asked his men to take up mass awareness campaigns among internet users.

During the review, the range police brass found that probe into 799 cases — 717 in Allahabad, 33 in Fatehpur, 27 in Pratapgarh and 22 in Kaushambi — were pending since 2019.

In January alone, 59 online fraud cases (44 in Allahabad, 9 in Pratapgarh, five in Kaushambi and one in Fatehpur) were registered, taking the total number of cases to 858 by the end of last month.

However, range police claim to have solved 22 of these cases (13 in Allahabad and three each in Kaushambi, Pratapgarh and Fatehpur districts). They also claim to have submitted charge sheet and final report in nine and 13 cases, respectively, by January-end.

Nevertheless, probe is pending in 836 cases as per January data. There are at least 334 cases (298 in Allahabad, 18 in Fatehpur, 12 in Pratapgarh and six in Kaushambi) where investigations were pending for three to six months.

A total of 760 cases of online fraud were registered in 2019 in the range while the number stood at 465 in 2018.

Investigations suggest majority of the cases (76%) involved fraudulent withdrawal of money from bank accounts. Police have solved around 14% cases, tracking down the culprits to Noida and eastern UP districts, besides Jharkhand and a few southern states.

Unsuspecting citizens were conned in online marketplaces as well. Conmen posing as buyers for used cars, bikes, electronic goods and other expensive items swindled them out of money.

“Setting up of a cyber thana (as proposed in the state budget on Tuesday) will certainly help police tighten the noose around fraudsters,” IG Singh maintained. He said besides roping in Crime Branch sleuths to nab cyber crooks, they were also focussing on generating public awareness against online frauds. “We are appealing to citizens to not disclose their bank details to anyone,” he added.

KOCHI: In a clarification video posted on Facebook on Wednesday evening, Kochi Music Foundation (KMF), which organized Karuna music concert on November 1, 2019, said that nearly 4,000 persons attended the event while tickets were bought by 987 of them. KMF said the rest watched the event without paying a dime.KMF had announced that proceeds from the event would go to chief minister’s distress relief fund (CMDRF). As per documents released by KMF, 1,492 tickets were complementary and several persons ‘walked in’ after the event started. This is the third explanation by KMF.However, the 40-minute video did not explain why so many tickets were given for free when one of the aim was to raise funds for CMDRF. The event posters had claimed that ‘proceeds would go to CMDRF’. On one hand KMF claims the event was not announced as a fundraiser, but a few seconds later they add that ‘it is not wrong to label it a fundraising programme’.“We are not saying this for the sake of argument. It was conceived as programme that would announce great events in future. Nothing wrong in saying that it was a fundraising programme as we promised to give money from ticket sales to CMDRF. Karuna was a programme with several dimensions,” KMF said in its Facebook video. The video showed Sithara Krishnakumar, Bijibal, Shahabaz Aman and Aashiq Abu , among others.Commenting on the venue, Regional Sports Centre (RSC), that was given for free, Abu said that when they applied to RSC, KMF was asked to pay Rs 1.5 lakh as rent, besides GST and other expenses. “ Rs 1.5 lakh as day’s rent was pretty huge. We then explained that we also intend to donate the ticket revenue to CMDRF. We also told them that the artists were performing for free. This was a festival of musicians. So obviously they won’t take remuneration for their own programme. All of them attended it like a festival. The rent was waived and we bore other expenses. This is what happened in the case of the stadium,” he said.“After nearly 1,000 ticket holders, the rest had complementary passes. Our friends and relatives, establishments like libraries, office of MPs, music students, film students, political parties were given these tickets. The programme was not entirely a business. The correct number of complementary tickets will be clarified soon. During a music night, people would come once the rush is over and seats are remaining. We didn’t want people to wait outside just because they lacked a pass. Many watched without passes and they are included in this numbers,” KMF said.The issue pertains to KMF depositing Rs 6.22 lakh, the ticket revenue received from Karuna, to CMDRF on February 14, hours after TOI published a story based on an RTI document that showed KMF had not remitted the money.In the Facebook video, KMF said they were legally bound to deposit the money only before March 31 (end of the financial year) but did so in haste so that the campaign to tarnish their image is stopped. KMF claimed that its women members faced a vicious hate campaign in the previous days.",kochi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74230356,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-82959,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kmf-sold-only-987-tickets-for-karuna-music-fest/articleshow/74216250.cms

162,['20/02/2020'],Central kitchen system on cards for social welfare dept hostels,"This story is from February 20, 2020

Nashik: The social welfare department is toying with the idea of implementing the central kitchen system for its hostels and residential schools so that the beneficiaries get quality food.

The system was being chalked out on the basis of the one being followed in the tribal development department where the quality of food has improved significantly with efficient monitoring of the process.

Social justice and special assistance minister Dhananjay Munde expressed the idea to run the central kitchen services in hostels and residential schools across the state for which the ministry has sought the details of the central kitchen system that is currently being run by the tribal welfare department.

After a meeting with the minster, the commissioner for social welfare and justice department ordered the assistant commissioners in Thane, Palghar and Nashik districts to file an in-depth report about the tried and tested system through which the children get piping hot breakfast, lunch and dinner in tribal schools in the said areas.

The department runs hostels and residential schools for children belonging to scheduled castes where the food is locally cooked and served. Also, there have been several complaints about the quality of food or the facility being not up-to-the mark or, at times, the food being bland, among other things.

The ministry has been thinking over ways and means to get rid of the situation and, hence, has stumbled upon the system that is being implemented in the tribal schools and ashramshalas located in rural and remote areas.

The deputy commissioners have, therefore, been asked to collect all information in detail about the process in which the food is cooked, the way in which the quality is monitored and the system through which the food is delivered to the beneficiaries.

Information has also been sought on the number of students served food through the entire system, the numbers of delivery vehicles, number of schools and children attached to every delivery vehicle, the distance the delivery vehicle covers, the modes of monitoring the quality control on a daily basis, the menu provided to the beneficiaries, the safety and security involved, etc.

The officers have been asked to visit the schools and ashramshalas that are providing the same and prepare a report that has to be presented to the ministry which will then take the future measures for safe and quality food delivery to the beneficiary.

Drums are usually played on auspicious occasions.The state youth and cultural affairs department got in touch with tribal persons from Sanali village in Danta taluka of Banaskantha, and informed them that they would be part of the welcome accorded to President Trump in Ahmedabad.These traditional dhol players of Banaskantha district have performed at several state-level functions and were also invited to perform at the airport when Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Ahmedabad in September 2014.“We are proud that our tribal music and dance will be showcased at the airport when the US President arrives.

Ahmedabad: Worries about getting to their exam hall on Monday have been added to the exam anxiety of Class X and XII students of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE). A part of the city will be cordoned off for security reasons due to US president Donald Trump’s visit to the city on February 24.

This area has four schools — Podar International School, Rachana School , KV Shahibaug, KV Cantonment. Some 417 students are to take their exams at these four centres. Class X students will take their Gujarati paper, while Class XII students have their Physical Education exam.

The issue for students is how to reach the exam hall at 10am, as these areas will be blocked for 3-4 hours before the visit and will open only after Trump’s departure. The exam time for students is 10.30am to 1.30pm. Students will thus have to get to their exam centres by 8.30-9am. They will likely have to wait till as late as 6.00pm, till after the VVIPs have left.

The CBSE city coordinator and principal of Prakash School said, “I had a word with the police commissioner, who assured me that students will not face any problems. Students with hall tickets and school uniform will be allowed to commute.” He added, “The controller of examinations has been apprised of the situation and I am confident a solution will be arrived at.” Rachana School principal Gopa Ghosh said, “The board has been informed of the situation and we are waiting for their guidance in this regard.”

168,['20/02/2020'],‘Some houses of Jamtara villagers bigger than Big B’s’,"This story is from February 20, 2020

What made you take up a topic like phishing in Jamtara ?

An article in an English daily on phishing in the town caught our attention. It spoke of how school dropouts from Jamtara duped tech-savvy people in big metros. The economy of the village is driven by phishing. Almost each and every villager is involved in the crime. It all began when shops started giving away SIM cards for free. Though the village has a population of 2,000, it accounts for 80 per cent of India’s cybercrime cases.

We always imagine this kind of crime to be based out of big, technologically advanced cities, but phishing was happening in a town as small as Jamtara. We thought it would be an amazing story to tell.

What is Jamtara like now?

The people of Jamtara have palatial homes. Some houses have remote-controlled gates and some are bigger than the Big B’s house. Earlier, there were only tiny mud houses. The town is extremely well-kept, clean and green. It feels like a village with zero crime. One wouldn’t have the slightest indication of it being the hub of cybercrime in India.

The crime has gone to another level in the past few years. It has spread like cancer. Now it is run like a family business.

Aren’t the youths scared of getting arrested or punished?

They don’t care about what’s happening outside Jamtara. They are willing to break the law and know there’s money to be made. The sense of morality is missing. People are making crores of rupees now. They think of it as their time to make it big. They enjoy political backing and some are even contesting elections. The local administration and police are not only aware of the crime, they are closely involved in the network.

The situation there is complex. The socio-political structure the youths grew up in pushed them towards crime. A large part of India, including the state of Jharkhand , is mired in poverty and runs on caste divisions. I think improving access to education in rural areas can be a game changer.

The ones making the calls are mostly below 18 and it’s a soft crime. So, registering a case or getting them arrested is not easy.

Do you think pro-active policing could have prevented the crime from occurring on such a large scale?

It could have lessened the intensity of the crime, but I don’t think pro-active policing would have stopped it. There is a breaking point for everyone. The youths of Jamtara have never seen this kind of money and they couldn’t care less about what rules they are breaking while making it. Somewhere, we all are guilty of complicity.

We have seen The Mahabharat being worked into the narrative. Why?

‘Lower’ caste groups didn’t have much access to mythology. Literature was always part of the upper caste. And India’s past and castes are still alive. Whatever little knowledge these people gathered of mythology was from unofficial sources. We wanted to show how caste controlled people’s lives.

What kind of cinematic liberties, if any, have you taken?

We didn’t show much of phishing as it involves very little use of technology. Anyone with a smart phone can do it. The youths involved in the crime aren’t hackers. The series is more on the characters than on the crime. I think minimalism was the key. The credit goes to the writing team. They did the research and mixed reality with fiction, without altering the essence of Jamtara. It was a team effort. There was a lot of freedom as well as challenges.

We see strong female leads in the series. Was that deliberate?

Women in Jamtara are extremely strong. I believe strong characters make their own story. It is a great time to be a story-teller in India. We have seen enough male-dominated stories and we are bored. The audience wants variety.

Small (town) is now big in web series and Hindi films, but Odisha’s towns and villages have stayed below the radar. Do you think it’s time to tell the Odisha story?

The transformation has begun. Big city stories have been exhausted. Small towns and villages have a lot to tell and show. Odisha will catch up, too. I am looking forward to telling stories from the state. I didn’t have the chance to explore it much, but I will soon.

169,['20/02/2020'],People slam state govt for not passing resolution against CAA,"This story is from February 20, 2020

Trichy: Muslim outfits under the banner of Jamaath Ul Ulama staged a protest near the Trichy collectorate here on Wednesday demanding the state government to pass a resolution against the Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ), National Register of Citizenship (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR).

After police denied permission to the Jamaath Ul Ulama to lay siege, which was organized as part of a state-wide call, the agitators staged the protest on the road adjacent to the collector’s office.

More than 1,500 people including women joined the protest that started around 10am. Besides criticising Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah for pushing CAA, the Ulama leaders hit out at chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami for not passing a resolution against the Act in the assembly.

Though the BJP-led central government won’t budge to the states’ opposition, Tamil Nadu government should register the opposition of the people to the central government by moving a resolution in the on-going assembly session, the leaders said.

They said that CAA, NRC and NPR were an attempt to drive a wedge between Muslims and Hindus as they are living in harmony. A significant number of protesters dispersed from the venue around 12 noon, while the leaders continued their speech till 1pm. The organisers asked the crowd to move to Uzhavar Sandhai grounds where around 300 people including women were staging a sit-in protest from Monday night.

Trichy city police led by commissioner of police V Varadharaju made elaborate security arrangements with superintendent of police, Trichy district, Zia Ul Haq and deputy commissioner of police, law and order, N S Nisha monitoring the protests and traffic arrangements.

The Thillai Nagar police registered cases against Usman and 100 others for staging the sit-in protest at Uzhavar Sandhai on Tuesday. The KK Nagar police also booked 63 college students for picketing the road opposite to Jamal Mohammed College (JMC) on Tuesday.

Protests were held in 18 places in Pudukottai, Karur, Perambalur, Ariyalur, Thanjavur, Tiruvarur and Nagapattinam districts in the central region. The SDPI, PFI, Muslim Jamaath, All Jamath Federation, and Iykkia Jamath Saba also participated in the agitations.

173,['20/02/2020'],‘Cycle Bank’ project for tribal girls hits roadblock,"This story is from February 20, 2020

Nashik: The proposal by the district administration for having a ‘cycle bank’ for tribal students under the Manav Vikas Mission (MVM) has hit a roadblock with the commissioner of the project has stayed the project.

Based on the human development index and women literacy rate in selected talukas, the girl students of class VII to XII are given bicycles to travel a maximum distance of five km distance to their respective school/college. “The bicycles would remain with the students and we proposed to get them back and present them to the next batch of students,” the officer from district administration said.

The commissioner of MVM, however, has said that since there was no provision of keeping the bicycles with the department and no provision for maintenance, the proposal was not feasible. The MVM is implemented in 125 talukas across the state and evaluation is based on poor human development index, the poor literacy rate among women, health issues and many other factors.

Every year taluka under the MVM gets the aid of Rs 2 crore from the state government for taking measures like female literacy, mother and child welfare works, children education, etc. “Since the project of presenting bicycles started in the year 2013, there are hundreds of the children whose bicycles now either remain unused, or the parents are using them – after the children have finished their Class XII or even dropped out,” the officer said.

The officer said that their aim is that these bicycles should be brought into the mainstream for the students, who have to travel for their education purpose.

In Nashik district eight out of 15 talukas - Igatpuri, Trimbakeshwar, Peth, Surgana, Kalwan, Dindori, Baglan and Nandgaon – are included in the MVM.

During the last five years, the administration presented bicycles to 21,702 girl students from the government schools in Nashik district at the cost of Rs 6.87 crore. In the year 2019-20, the administration is planning to distribute 4,000 bicycles to the needful girl students.

“The aim is that the girls do not have to skip schools if they live in about a radius of 5 km from the schools. For all the girl students, who have to travel longer distances, the MVM has started blue-buses that pick and drop students besides running on the various routes at the times other than school-timings,” the officer said.

HYDERABAD: Students taking up apprenticeship in Telangana have doubled in the last one year with many companies coming forward to train students on new age technologies such as artificial intelligence, internet of things, drone technology etc.Students take up three to six months of apprenticeship in a focused area that helps them undergo on-the-job training along with academics. According to data tabled in the Lok Sabha recently, Telangana registered a 102 per cent rise with total 7,785 students having secured apprenticeship in 2019 as against 3,852 in 2018.The data indicates that almost 65 per cent of the total apprenticeships were rolled out in Hyderabad and neighbouring districts such as Rangareddy and Medchal-Malkajgiri. Of total apprenticeships, 5,123 were rolled out in Hyderabad, Rangareddy and Medchal-Malkajgiri.The rise in number of apprenticeships is attributed to introduction of new age courses in 12 national skill training institutes and greater awareness among students and industries. “To improve employability, students are now willingly opting for apprenticeships to get hands-on training in focused areas such as artificial intelligence, internet of things etc. For companies as well, apprenticeship is a platform that they offer to students to train them and absorb them in a full-time job based on performance,” said Ramana Rao, director, National Institute of Technology, Warangal.Experts attributed the rise in number of apprenticeships to smoother process introduced by the government.“Our Apprenticeship Act came into being as early as in 1987. According to it every company is regulated to have a certain percentage of apprentices. But so far, nobody was implementing it seriously and one of the primary reasons behind this was that 19 forms had to be filled to complete the process. Now, the government has brought it down to three,” said BVR Mohan Reddy, executive chairman, Cyient and head of the All India Council of Technical Education committee on new-age courses.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74220581,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-189871,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/takers-for-apprenticeships-double-in-t-hyd-top-pick/articleshow/74216244.cms

NASHIK: Two senior citizens were murdered by their respective sons in two separate incidents in the rural Nashik over Monday and Tuesday.

In the first case registered with the Surgana police, a 60-year-old woman was killed by her son for allegedly not forcing his wife to work on the farm. While in the other case registered with Niphad police, a 73-year-old father was killed by his son for intervening during his fight with the in-laws. Both the suspects have been arrested by the respective police.

On Monday at around 6 pm, an argument sparked between 37-year-old Devidas Laxman Gavit of Satkhamb village in Surgana district with his mother Sonabai Laxman Gavit, when the latter was working in the farm.

As the argument heated up, Devidas, who was carrying an axe with him, attacked his mother with the same on her face, neck, and stomach and killed her on the spot.

As per the complaint registered by the man’s wife, Sarla said that her mother-in-law, who was under the influence of alcohol had an argument with her son for not making her wife work in the farm. Sarla said that as she used to suffer from painful menstrual periods she could not work in the field following which her mother-in-law picked an argument with her son.

Frustrated over the same, Devidas went into the farm and hacked his mother to death. Soon after getting information, the police rushed to the village and arrested Devidas on Tuesday evening.

In the other case, a 73-year-old man Nivrutti Nirbhavane was killed by his son Baban Nivrutti Nirbhavane (50) in Sonewadi village in Niphad taluka on Monday at around 11 pm.

According to the complaint registered by the suspect’s elder brother Kamlesh Nivrutti Nirbhavane, the police said that they arrested Baban soon after the incident was reported to them. Police said that Baban used to constantly harass his wife over small issues. Subsequently, his wife Sarla had gone to her parents' place in Sonewadi.

As her wife didn’t return for over 15 days, Baban went to in-laws house and started arguing with his wife for not returning home. As the argument heated up, Baban charged upon his wife with the axe in his hand, when his father Nivrrutti intervened and drove his son out of the house.

In the heat of the moment, Baban struck his father’s head with the axe killing him on the spot. Baban’s brother Kamlesh immediately called up the police after which the former was arrested.

178,['20/02/2020'],Trump's visit: Monkey menace keeps Ahmedabad airport authorities on their toes,"This story is from February 20, 2020

One of the langurs caught by the team at the city airport on Wednesday.

AHMEDABAD: Birds are not the only fauna keeping city airport authorities on their toes, there are also monkeys venturing on to the tarmac, delaying flights and putting take-offs and landings in jeopardy.

Thus, the airport authorities were in a quandary on how to no slip-ups during the visit by US president Donald Trump along with PM Narendra Modi on February 24. They roped in a city-based NGO and the state forest department to find a feasible solution.

“Unlike the birds, monkeys cannot be scared off by the same means for a long time. If you create noise or light firecrackers, they will be scared for a few days and then get used to it. The only way is to relocate them,” said Raag Patel, associated with the NGO that signed an MoU with the airport and the forest department.

Forest department officials stationed at the airport for past fortnight said that three cages and closed enclosures near the runway fence have been created. A survey to determine these locations took place over three days.

The monkeys are into the cages with food and are then sent to a distant location. Department officials denied that these monkeys were being released in Dahod.

“They are released in semi-arid regions within Ahmedabad district ,” said an official.

Patel said that in the past 10 days, they have caught 45-odd monkeys. “Kotarpur is natural habitat for gray langurs. They come in search of food to areas such as Sardarnagar, the cantonment and Shahibaug. The airport lies in the middle. Earlier, they would would just pass through, but have now begun started staying here, creating a problem for the authorities,” he said.

He added that their feeding due to religious beliefs in several parts of the city are also responsible for the presence of monkeys.

Will the monkey catching continue after the Trump visit? “I don’t know – but I believe it will at least for some time. Monkeys are territorial animals and this set is sent somewhere else, another group will take its place,” said Patel.

182,['20/02/2020'],K-RERA orders builder to pay 15% interest of sale amount for default period,"This story is from February 20, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: In its first order, Kerala real estate regulatory authority (K-RERA) asked a builder to pay interest at 15% of the amount received from the buyer covering the period starting from expiry of agreed time of delivery till handing over of the apartment. K-RERA issued the judgment after considering the complaint filed by CR Subhash against CJ’s Haritha Homes in Kottayam .

As per the complainant, he had entered into an agreement with the builder in 2014 to purchase an apartment measuring 1,167 sq ft. It was agreed that the construction would be completed with all facilities on or before December 31, 2016. The builder received an amount of Rs 49.5 lakh on the date of agreement and as per the agreement remaining sum of Rs 2.24 lakh would be given at the time of possession of the apartment. The complainant approached K-RERA citing that handover process was delayed.

The complainant sought a relief that the construction should be completed within a month (including lift and car parking) and the sale deed should be executed within 30 days by the builder on receiving the balance amount and the flat should be handed over to him. He further prayed that in case of default, he should get an amount of Rs 49.5 lakh with 12% interest from the date of agreement till realization and an amount of Rs 10 lakh as damages.

The builder contended that the complaint cannot be considered by K-RERA since the agreement was made in 2014 while Real Estate (regulation and development) Act, 2016 came into force only in 2016 and K-RERA was constituted only in January 2020.

K-RERA responded regarding validity of the complaint citing that completion certificate of the project was not obtained till date and that project was nearing completion only by June 2020 as admitted by the builder. K-RERA hence considered it as an ongoing project as per Section 3 of the Act.

It directed the builder to register the project and complete the project and take occupancy certificate within June 30, 2020 without fail. Further, it ordered that the builder shall pay interest at the rate of 15.2% for Rs 49.5 lakh starting from March 1, 2017 till the actual date of handing over the possession of the apartment. The date from which interest must be paid was calculated after the end of grace period following agreed timeline for handover. The interest was fixed as per SBI benchmark of prime lending rate plus 2%.

K-RERA, which has begun hearings on complaints, will hold next sessions on February 24 and 26. A few interim orders have been finalized considering certain complaints till date.

183,['20/02/2020'],98% NU results out in 30 days despite exam date changes,"This story is from February 20, 2020

Nagpur: The Nagpur University has declared 98% results of the 935 winter exams in just 30 days. Just five results were declared after the 45-day deadline while two were announced after 31 days from the last paper date.

The NU exam section had undergone a change of guard with new director Prafulla Sabale taking over just at the beginning of the exam season. There were apprehensions about the section not being able to declare results on time after several reshuffle due to assembly elections, clashing of exam dates and refusal of teachers to assess answerbooks.

As on February 17, 925 results have been announced in all. Just nine results remain to be announced while one is held up because of practical marks. The pending results, including the BPharm 3rd-semester as one of the papers, was allegedly leaked.

The NU had conducted the winter exams in three phases with the first commencing from October 2 followed by October 22 and November 13. A couple of exams in the fourth phase are yet to start while results of some are under processing.

In the first phase, most number of 402 exams were held. Out of them, results of 401 were declared in 30 days while one is pending. The second phase included 159 exams of which 149 results came in 30 days, two up to 45 days and 3 after both the deadlines. Five results from this phase are undeclared.

In the third phase, 374 exams were conducted. Out of them, 368 results are out while four remained undeclared and two came after 45 days.

In several cases, the exam section faced the biggest hurdle in the form of stiff resistance from several teachers who refused to report to valuation centres. For days, the answerbooks were lying without assessment, compelling the exam section to issue show cause notices.

Acting pro-VC Vinayak Deshpande said that this is not an individual task but was made possible because of contribution from all teaching and non-teaching staff of the university. “We try to achieve the target but the volume of work is humongous. Fortunately, everyone chipped in and contributed well. There were some who initially were reluctant leading to a delayed start but we adopted tough measures to make them obilige,” he said.

Regarding the pharmacy results, he said an inquiry was conducted and the report has been submitted. “We are yet to open the report. Soon, a decision would be taken and the result would be announced,” he said.

A scene from the NH-766 stretch passing through the Bandipur Tiger Reserve in Karnataka where night traffic ba... Read More

KOZHIKODE: Kerala has filed an additional affidavit before the Supreme Court questioning the basis of the decade-old night traffic ban on Bandipur forest stretch of NH-766 saying that the restriction was not based on sound scientific finding or recommendation from forest department or MoEF .

The affidavit said the proposed alternative route (Kutta- Gonikuppa-Hunsur) which passes through Nagarhole Tiger Reserve (NTR) in Karnataka and Tholpetty Wildlife Sanctuary in Kerala would have higher number of animal casualties than NH-766 as it passes through dense forests. The affidavit added that 250 hectares of dense forests must be destroyed if the existing state and district roads on that stretch are to be upgraded to NH standards.

When the case came before SC on August 7, 2019, it had directed MoEF to file an affidavit with suggestions as to how NH-275 and SH-90 (alternative routes through Kutta and Gonikuppa) be made equal to NH-766 which may then be closed.

Subsequently, National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) filed an affidavit giving three options, including upgrading SH-90 to a four-lane way from Hunsur to Gonikuppa to Kutta with a fully elevated two-lane road along the stretch passing through NTR (8.6km) and another elevated road from Tholpetty to Kattikulam (7.5km) passing through WWS.

Alternatively, NTCA suggested upgrading SH-90 into a four-lane way with overpass for vehicles/underpass for animals through both forest stretches. As a third option, NTCA suggested upgrading SH-90 into four lanes; excluding the forest stretch passing through NTR where the road is to be maintained in the present form with automated speed-detection cameras. However, it stated that it may induce a ‘barrier effect’ which may hinder animal movement.

State government in its affidavit urged SC to lift the night traffic ban and allow an elevated highway through Bandipur stretch. It said that the argument that wildlife had adapted itself to the night-time traffic ban is an unproven claim. It said that NTCA is mandated to develop and implement strategies for managing all 50 tiger reserves in India and it hadn’t done scientific studies or sought night traffic in tiger reserves.

185,['20/02/2020'],Maharashtra PWD to seek nod of MoRTH for preparing DPR of elevated corridor,"This story is from February 20, 2020

NASHIK: The national highway division of the state public works department (PWD) has decided to seek the approval of the Union ministry of road transport and highways ( MoRTH ) to prepare a detailed project report for the proposed elevated corridor project from Sarda Circle to Datta Mandir Chowk.

In January, the Nashik unit of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), which was supposed to make the DRP and implement the project, asked the state PWD (NH) to take over the project due to financial reasons.

“Although our department is under the state government, we have to get the nod from the MoRTH as funding of all our projects comes from the ministry. Unless we get the ministry’s green signal, we would not be able to kick off the process,” sources in the PWD’s national highway division said. According to the officials, the letter seeking MoRTH’s permission would soon be sent.

In 2016, Nitin Gadkari, the Union minister for road transport and highways, had announced the project and the state PWD (NH division) was assigned the work. But two years later, on local MP Hemant Godse’s request, Gadkari directed the NHAI to take over the project and implement it. Godse said he is pursuing the matter with Central and state PWD authorities.

“I met the ministry authorities about 10 days ago and discussed the matter. I have insisted that the ministry must earmark funds for the project so that the NH division of state PWD can start the groundwork. I am still confident that the project will see the light of the day,” Godse told TOI.

The estimated project cost of the 6-km flyover is about Rs 1,800 crore. Apart from the elevated four-lane corridor, there would be service roads to enter/exit the flyover. It would help Nashik city decongest the Dwarka circle area, which is the most chocked part of the city, as well as the Nashik Road area.

The stretch on which the elevated corridor is proposed witnesses bumper-to-bumper vehicular traffic during the peak hours as it connects the Mumbai-Agra highway and the Nashik-Pune Highway from Sinnar Phata.

Nashik: During Tuesday’s general body meeting of the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC), municipal commissioner Radhakrishna Game promised action against 13 erring central kitchen contractors within eight days.

He also ordered the civic administration to take charge from the executive engineer of the electric department until further notice following his alleged involvement in the LED streetlights corruption case.

During last month’s general body meeting, mayor Satish Kulkarni has issues directives to the civic chief to ensure that necessary action is taken against erring central kitchen contractors and that charge is taken from the executive engineer. However, his directives were not followed.

The issue was highlighted by the corporators, following which Kulkarni expressed grave concern and, for the second time, directed the civic chief to take all the necessary action.

After a nine-and-half-hours-long heated discussion during the meeting, it was decided that the contracts of 13 erring central kitchen contractors who were entrusted with the responsibility of providing mid-day meals to students of municipal schools under the central kitchen scheme will be cancelled.

Game assured the corporators that the civic administration would come down heavily against the contractors.

Besides LED streetlights corruption case and central kitchen contractors row, a number of other issues were discussed during the meeting. One such discussion was related to the civic administration’s proposed plans to acquire land reservations at the cost of Rs 150 crore. The proposals were expected to be tabled in the standing committee meeting scheduled for next week.

However, corporators from the opposition parties had opposed the decision of the civic administration and had sought to pay compensation of those farmers whose lands have already been acquired by the civic body decades ago. They also alleged that the farmers are yet to get compensation for their lands from the NMC.

Kulkarni directed the civic administration to table the proposals of the land acquisitions in the general body before submitting them to the standing committee for approval.

Police officers said around 10,000 police personnel will be deployed for the Namaste Trump event.

Asaram is serving a life sentence for a minor’s rape in Jodhpur in Rajasthan. He and his son Narayansai are facing trial in a rape case filed by two Surat sisters. The father-son duo had last year got a clean chit in deaths of two children in their ashram in 2008.

“Nearly 200 cops who will be deployed near Asaram Ashram near the cricket stadium will stay at the ashram from Thursday till the event is over,” said a police official.

DCP Zone-2, Dharmendra Sharma told TOI, “They (Ashram people) have come forward and offered arrangements for the cops.”

Sources in the Asaram Ashram said that the cops will be staying at different sheds in the ashram. “We will only provide lodging for the cops but not food,” said a disciple of Asaram.

“This is not the first time for police personnel to lodge at the ashram. Earlier, they had stayed at the ashram when bandobust for cricket matches was done,” said an Asaram disciple.

190,['20/02/2020'],Mining dept imposes hefty fines on illegal quarrying in Prakasam dist,"This story is from February 20, 2020

Amaravati: The mines department has imposed hefty penalties on granite quarry leaseholders in Prakasam district, ranging between Rs 250 crore to Rs 300 crore.

The department is also contemplating criminal action against leaseholders for excavating and transporting granite in excess of approved quantities. The department in its notices to the leaseholders said that evading seigniorage and violating approved mine plan was a serious offence.

With many of the leaseholders belonging to TDP , the tough stance by the mines department has created ripples in political circles. The government has decided to go ahead with the move as it has gathered comprehensive information about largescale illegal mining activities.

The vigilance and enforcement carried out an inquiry into illegal mining operations in Prakasam district for five months. The vigilance and enforcement wing spent several days in quarries and monitored the activities. The officials have videographed the inspection and recorded measurements in the presence of the managers of the leaseholders.

Many of the leases were either granted or renewed during the previous TDP regime. Thanks to the backing of previous government, the leaseholders made money through illegal mining activities. “We have noticed grave violations regarding approved plans in many quarries. While some of them excavated granite from unauthorized areas in the adjacent fields of the approved quarry, many went deep than the sanctioned limit. They have excavated massive quantities of stone and paid taxes for 10 percent of the stone,” said a senior official.

Sources said that the firms owned by Addanki MLA Gottipati Ravi Kumar, former minister Sidda Raghava Rao, Rajya Sabha member Garikapati Mohan Rao, who joined BJP from TDP, were among those received the notices.

“Criminal action will be initiated against the lessees under Sec. 21 (1) of MM(DR) ACR,1957 read with Rule 26(1) of APMMC Rules 1966, Rule 12(5) (h) (iii) of APMMC, 1966 for having excavated and transported granite without payment of Seigniorage fee in contravention to condition 5 of grant r/w Rule 12(5) (h) (iii) of APPMC, 1966 and under Rule 47 of Granite Conservation Development Rules, 1966 as they have conducted mining operations in gross violation of Rule 18(2), 19(1), 3l(1),37 and 41 (a) & (b) of Granite Conservation and Development Rules, 1999,” a senior official.

191,['20/02/2020'],Additional spillway work on Hirakud dam hits roadblock,"This story is from February 20, 2020

Sambalpur: Tata Projects and AGE Group of Turkey, which had been entrusted to carry out the construction work on the additional spillway of Hirakud dam, have backed out after undertaking some preliminary work, raising question mark about the project’s future.

Work on the additional spillway began in January 2019. The firms excavated around 4 lakh cubic metre soil and received a payment of Rs 12 crore against it. But recently they wrote to the state government saying they are withdrawing from the project owing to the delay by the government in handing over the site for construction work.

The project is worth Rs 369.53 crore. The firms have even started moving away personnel from the site.

Executive engineer of the spillway division, Hirakud dam, Himansu Mishra dismissed suggestion there had been delay in handing over the site for construction. “The construction firms completed the work over a patch of area, which had been handed over to them in the first phase. But they backed out from the spillway project when we handed over land for the second phase of work,” Mishra added.

He said the state government will take a decision on whether or not the contract with Tata Projects and AGE Group will be terminated and fresh tender will be floated.

Spillway a structure built in a dam to divert surplus water from a reservoir after it is filled to its capacity. The work on the additional spillway is a World Bank-funded project. The Central Water Commission (CWC) recommended enhancing the flood water discharge capacity of the dam, following which an additional spillway for Hirakud dam was proposed. Meteorological change, climate change and flooding were looked into while the decision to enhance the flood water discharge capacity was taken.

Official sources said the length of the proposed spillway will be 91 metres. There will be five sluice gates. The proposed spillway channel will originate from near Gandhi Minar on the left dyke of Hirakud reservoir and meet the river Mahanadi near Jawahar Uddyan.

At present there are 98 gates, including 64 sluice gates and 34 crest gates, to release flood water from Hirakud dam. Around 15 lakh cusec of water is released through the 98 gates at a time. However, with the construction of the additional spillway, the water discharge capacity of Hirakud dam will increase to 18 lakh cusec.

194,['20/02/2020'],Delhi Metro News: Metro snags give you blues? Your travel could be smoother in less than 2 years,"File photo used for representational purpose

NEW DELHI: Delays and slow-moving trains on the Blue Line are going to be a thing of the past by the end of 2021. At least that is what Delhi Metro Rail Corporation is working at. It is upgrading the signalling system to introduce the concept of ‘virtual signals’ to reduce delays by up to 80%, having identified glitches in the 14-year-old existing signalling system as being the main cause of the snags on the corridor running from Dwarka to Noida Electronic City/Vaishali.At 65.5km, the Blue Line is one of the longest corridors in the Delhi Metro network and also the busiest with 16 lakh passengers using it daily. Usually, a glitch at any point affects train movement on the entire corridor and the slightest of delays causes massive crowding, particularly during peak hours.“The existing centralised viewing and monitoring system of Blue Line trains at the operation control centre in Metro Bhawan is more than 14 years old. At the time, the provision of ‘hot redundancy’ (system backup) did not exist since the network was small and had only a couple of interchange stations,” said Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications). He said this sometimes led to the system losing train identification numbers, point flash and interlocking glitches, etc.From the signalling point of view, the corridor is divided between ‘interlocking sections’, the portion between stations where trains can change tracks. For example, both Laxmi Nagar and Anand Vihar are interlocking stations and the section between them comprising three stations — Preet Vihar, Nirman Vihar and Karkardooma — is an interlocking section. A signalling snag at any point in such a section disrupts the entire stretch. This affects movement because train operators have to acquire target speeds from each station in the manual mode. The speed is restricted to 20-25 kmph for the safety of passengers, but causes bunching of trains with a cascading effect on the entire corridor.Now, virtual signalling hopes to keep the trains operating at the normal speed of 35-37 kmph, except for a distance of 500 metres from the affected zone. “A virtual signal is an intermediate entry and exit location displayed on the signalling monitor,” explained Dayal. “It may be used, wherever required, to divide the routes between two fixed signals. It is not a physical signal and only controls trains with automatic train protection.”Dayal said that the system would be in place by end of 2021 as testing and commissioning of the system can be done only in the short period of non-revenue hours without affecting the existing signalling system. “When DMRC started Blue Line operation in 2005, there were technology constraints,” Dayal said. “To increase line capacity during failures, DMRC plans to introduce virtual signals initially on the Blue Line and subsequently on the Red (Rithala-Shaheed Sthal New Bus Adda) and Yellow (Samaypur Badli-HUDA City Centre) lines. Lines added in Phase II and Phase III adopted virtual signalling at the time of commissioning itself.”DMRC said that apart from easing movement during a signalling glitch, the focus of virtual signals would be to ensure that trains reach the nearest interchange system faster. For example, at Karkardooma interchange station in the Laxmi Nagar-Anand Vihar interlocking section, passengers other than those changing trains will also have the option of interchanging to another corridor not affected by a snag. They will be helped to take such decision through announcements in the trains.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74217718,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-148054,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/metro-snags-give-you-blues-your-travel-could-be-smoother-in-less-than-2-years/articleshow/74216275.cms

Allahabad: State secondary education department has started the process of filling up 606 posts of teachers of various subjects in government-aided secondary schools and colleges of Uttar Pradesh by recruiting candidates from waiting list.

The seats, left vacant under the Trained Graduate Teachers ( TGT ) Recruitment Examination-2013, are now being filled by selecting candidates from waiting list. Counselling for selections started from Tuesday.

The process of filling up of vacancies began after the Allahabad high court, on December 28, 2019 and January 22, 2020, ruled in favour of waitlisted candidates and ordered the director (secondary education) to fill vacant seats by recruiting candidates from waiting list.

On December 29, 2013, UP Secondary Education Service Selection Board had started recruitment process for filling up 6,028 TGT posts in government-aided secondary schools. The results were declared in 2017.

When selected candidates in many subjects did not join their respective institutions, many candidates on waiting list moved the high court with the plea that they should be recruited to fill vacant posts.

Deputy director (secondary education) Ramchet issued cut-offs for various subjects for filling up of these posts through an order issued on February 13.

“Counselling of eligible candidates, being carried out from 10am to 2pm, will continue till February 22 at the office of director (secondary education) in Allahabad,” said Ramchet.

The department held counselling for Hindi, Arts, Commerce and Physical Education on Tuesday and for Science on Wednesday.

Thiruvananthapuram: Two cafes were gutted and two other shops were partially damaged in a major fire that broke out at Varkala beach here on Wednesday. According to sources at the Varkala fire station, the fire broke out around 3am on Wednesday.

Boatman’s Café that functioned in a building owned by Rajeev Fernandez of Kollam and Cafera Matica owned by Bindhu of Palayamkunnu are the cafes that were completely gutted in the fire.

Both cafes were located adjacent to each other near Thiruvambadi beach here. Both cafes were built of wood and thatched with palm leaves. The other shops that suffered damages in the fire are Soul of Kashmir, a curios shop owned by Shahina Mohalla of Srinagar, Kashmir and Magic Peacock, a perfume shop owned by Zacharia of Haripad.

The fire reportedly originated in Boatman’s Café. The cause of fire is yet to be known. There were three-fully filled LP gas cylinders inside the café that exploded in the fire, making it worse. It soon spread to Cafera Matico nearby and then to the other shops.

Fire and rescue personnel received the call at 3.25am and they soon rushed to the spot. Two units of fire tenders from Varkala and Attingal stations and one unit from Paravoor station in Kollam took part in the operation. It took two hours to douse the fire.

KOLHAPUR: The vegetable prices have dropped drastically in the Kolhapur Agriculture produce market committee due to a better supply of produce from the border areas and from the district on Wednesday.

According to the market committee officials, the main reason behind the falling of vegetable rates was due to the completion of sugarcane crushing season. The farmers have now focused their attention on the vegetables until the next season of sugarcane.

The rates of the vegetables such as cabbage at the agricultural produce market committee on Wednesday was around Rs 20 per 10 kg, which comes to paltry Rs 2 per kg, while for Brinjal it was Rs 30 per 10 kg, which comes to Rs 3 per kg. The minimum rate for Okra or ladyfinger was Rs 100 per 10 kg in the market.

Tomato prices which had skyrocketed earlier to 60 Rs per kg, were available at Rs 20 per 10 kg, which comes to as low as Rs 2 per kg on Wednesday.

Mohan Salape, secretary, Kolhapur Agriculture produce market committee, told TOI, “Well, this is the general scenario in this season and it will continue to be like this till April end. The vegetable produce from the Maharashtra-Karnataka border villages and from the district areas like Shirol are huge and it has a lot of impact on the rates.”

He added that since there is a gap in the demand-supply, the prices have fallen further. But the prices for the best quality vegetable will still fetch good prices for the farmers.

Namdev Parit, a farmer from Mhalunge village around 30 km from the city, said that they are aware of the downfall in the prices, and have no choice but to sell the produce in whatever prices they can fetch.

Kolhapur: Civic chief Mallinath Kalshetti has issued a show-cause notice to four civic officials over alleged irregularities in assessment of properties and collection of tax that have led to revenue loss for the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC).

A probe was ordered around a month ago after allegations of irregularities in the assessment of the property tax were made by several activists and corporators. A senior civic official claimed that the investigation will reach to its logical end and before taking any action against the officials notices have been issued to record their version.

Former chief property tax superintendent Diwakar Karande is among the four officials and has been shunted out a month ago. He was moved to Kolhapur Municipal Transport (KMT) as assistant manager. The remaining three officials are the property tax inspectors.

“We have found that some of the allegations are true. Many of the rented properties are kept out of the property tax ambit or they have been not assessed properly. The officials have to reply to the notice in seven days after which the action will be taken,” the official said.

According to a primary estimate, the assessment of over 3,000 properties is faulty and owners are paying less tax. The firm appointed to assess these properties is also under scanner.

The civic body has withheld the payment of over Rs 3 crore to be paid to the firm. The corporators have alleged that the surveyors of the firm are recording the lower property tax for several buildings.

“We aim to increase the revenue of the property tax department which has so far collected just 45% of the estimated tax revenue target. Action to be taken against the guilty officials has not been fixed yet. Most probably they will be suspended,” the official added.

Kannur: When the 22-year-old Saranya , who allegedly killed her one-and-a-half-year-old son by throwing him on the sea wall in the early hours of Monday, was brought to the spot of the crime on Wednesday, public protest crossed all limits and it was with great difficulty that police managed the crowd.

It was around 9.30 am that Saranya, a resident of Thayyil, was brought to the spot as part of collecting evidence and she was directly taken to the sea wall where the body of her son Viyan was found.

When she started explaining how she threw him on the stones, and pointed towards the spot, a crowd of local residents turned furious and they showered all kind of swearwords and abuses.

Then she was taken to her home and there also she was almost composed but the family members were yet to cope with the reality and were in tears.

According to police, the woman was not happy with her husband and wanted to live with her lover. But the lover was not aware of the development and even when she was being interrogated, he called her, and the conversation was heard by police too. The murder plan was plotted by her only, they said.

The woman had clearly planned the murder and she had no guilty feeling about it, and hence she was a hard nut to crack, said a senior investigating official.

“Her plan was to implicate the husband in the murder and escape and she had planned everything accordingly, so we had to use psychological method to break her down and confess, after we got the scientific evidence,” said Kannur DSP PP Sadanandan, who led the investigation.

After the evidence collection, she was presented in the JFCM court (ii) here, which sent her in judicial remand for two weeks.

Kolhapur: The district administration is planning to increase the Shiv Bhojan thali centres to cater to more people in the city.

The initiative by the state government to provide lunch to poor citizens at just Rs 10 has become a big hit. At present, four centres are operating in the city. The centres open between 12 pm to 2 pm, however, the prescribed number of thali’s — 150 per centre — ends within an hour every day.

The officials claim that the new centres will come up at least at four places in the city such as CPR Hospital, Shahu Market Yard, Gangavesh KMT Bus Stop and Central Administrative Building.

Recently, the state government has increased the quota of thalis for each of these centres. The state government is paying Rs 40 per thali to the centres which have made this scheme a highly subsidised scheme.

District collector Daulat Desai said, “The demand to start Shiv Bhojan thali centres at other locations in the city is being made by the citizens. We are currently identifying new locations in the city. Already we have invited the applications from NGOs, women self-help grounds and restaurants to start the centre. The establishments should have their own space to provide thali to 25 citizens at one time. We will not compromise on the quality.”

The district office will receive and scrutinise the applications. At present, the centres are at the district collectors office, Savitribai Phule Hospital, Parikh Bridge and Mahalaxmi temple Kapiltirth Market. The applicants have to ensure that they have adequate space within 50 meters of these establishments. The foods and drugs administration (FDA) officials have been tasked to check the quality of food served at these centres.

The thali has two chapatis, one cup of vegetables, one cup of curry and one cup of rice. The photos and mobile numbers of the beneficiaries are recorded in the mobile application provided to the centre operator.

Arvind Kejriwal

NEW DELHI: Within days of assuming office for the third consecutive term, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday called his first official meeting with senior bureaucrats to prepare a detailed road map to fulfil the 10 promises made by him in the guarantee card released in the run-up to the assembly polls.

A senior Delhi government official said the chief minister had given one week to the heads of various departments to prepare the action plan along with a tentative timeline and budget requirement for each project. Kejriwal will start meeting the officials of individual departments from next week to have a detailed discussion and regular monitoring of each project.

After the meeting, Kejriwal said he did not keep any portfolio so that he could monitor the functioning of all departments. “I believe it is the responsibility of the chief minister to oversee the performance of all ministers and the operations of their departments,” he said.

On the basis of the tentative cost estimation, funds will be allocated in the 2020-21 budget, which is likely to be presented in the assembly in the third week of March. Kejriwal also made it clear that all free schemes launched during the previous tenure would continue, an official said.

The high-level meeting was attended by all cabinet ministers, Delhi chief secretary Vijay Dev and the secretaries and the heads of all departments, including education, health, home, power, transport, environment, urban development and Delhi Jal Board .

Re-elected with a huge mandate — 62 seats in the 70-member House — Kejriwal and his council of ministers took oath on Sunday. All ministers have said implementing the 10 promises is their top priority. The promises include replacing overhead electric cables with underground ones apart from providing 24-hour power supply and 200 units of free electricity; round-the-clock clean piped water to every household; quality education to all till graduation; cheap, accessible and better healthcare; strengthening public transport; reducing pollution by one-third; cleaning and beautifying Delhi; making city safer for women; providing basic infrastructure in all unauthorised colonies; and pucca houses for all slum dwellers.

After the meeting, Kejriwal said his government would work at a faster pace this time. “A significant meeting was held today where I met all ministers, secretaries and department heads to have a detailed discussion on each of the 10 guarantees of our manifesto,” he added. A senior official said the bureaucracy had “a blueprint ready and a proper plan will be put in place in the next few days”.

In the meeting, Kejriwal also thanked the bureaucracy for helping the political dispensation complete various projects in the last term and sought similar cooperation this time, said the official.

K Chandrasekhar Rao

HYDERABAD: State-run universities will finally get regular vice-chancellors. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Wednesday directed senior officials to expedite the process of appointing VCs to the universities. The chief minister wanted the entire exercise completed within three weeks.

Presently, the universities are being headed by bureaucrats. The government had appointed civil servants as in-charge VCs in July last year.

The move attracted criticism from various quarters as some of the bureaucrats appointed as in-charge VCs had too many tasks to handle.

For instance, municipal administration principal secretary Arvind Kumar was appointed in-charge VC of Osmania University , the biggest state university that has many academic and affiliated college-related affairs to be taken care of on a daily basis.

KCR also directed the officials to appoint members to the executive councils immediately in the universities. A notification for appointment of VCs was issued earlier. Some of the universities which do not have a regular VC include OU, Kakatiya University, Telangana University, Palamuru University, Mahatma Gandhi University, Telugu University and Dr BR Ambedkar Open University.

Search committees constituted for the process received 984 applications. Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan, who is also chancellor of all the state universities, will take a final call on the appointment of VCs.

BENGALURU: Direct flights between Kempegowda International Airport ( KIA ), Bengaluru and several international destinations are expected to begin this year, including one to the US West Coast in October, which will be operated by American Airlines.

Several new services will begin operations next month. Japan Airlines has announced it will operate a daily direct flight between Bengaluru and Narita, Tokyo from March 29, 2020. This will make Bengaluru the second South Indian city after Chennai to have a direct flight to Tokyo.

On March 29, IndiGo is also expected to kick off another direct service between Bengaluru and Jeddah, which is currently serviced by two non-stop flights — IndiGo and Saudia. On March 16, IndiGo will operate an additional daily direct flight between Bengaluru and Doha, a route currently being serviced by Qatar Airways and IndiGo.

Lufthansa has announced that in April 2020, it will launch a direct service between Bengaluru and Munich (five times a week) using the A350-900 aircraft.

Japan Airlines had earlier hoped its Bengaluru-Tokyo flight will offer travellers from Bengaluru connectivity to the US West Coast and Canada via Tokyo. The announcement from American Airlines has, however, changed things.

American Airlines recently announced Bengaluru’s first direct connecting flight to the West Coast. The airline plans to operate a 285-seater Boeing 787-9 aircraft on the route. With this, passengers from Bengaluru can reach the destination in 16 hours. It’s expected to provide seamless travel options to those employed with tech firms in Bengaluru and Seattle.

Virgin Atlantic, as part of its Heathrow expansion plans, has identified Bengaluru-Heathrow as a new route, on which it will start flights after 2020.

Several new direct flights were launched last year from KIA to destinations like Addis Ababa by Ethiopian Airlines and Amsterdam by KLM Royal Dutch Airlines.

Accused Aman and Rahul in police custody

INDORE: A youth was stabbed to death by two persons over an old dispute on a busy street of Banganga late on Tuesday.

The youth - Akash alias Lalla had entered into a scuffle with the accused - Aman alias Choti Solanki, resident of Ganeshdham Colony and Rahul Nath Sitole, resident of Sukhlia, four days ago during a wedding function. They had a dispute over dancing during the wedding. Since then the accused had been planning to attack him, police said.

“On Tuesday night, Aman and Rahul called Akash near Shyam Transport on Sukhliya railway crossing road to strike a compromise. When Akash came they made him consume alcohol. Thereafter, Aman attacked him with a sharp-edged weapon,” ASP Prashant Choubey said.

The duo committed the crime fearlessly in front of half a dozen people. The incident was recorded in CCTVs installed in the area. Aman could be seen holding Akash by his collar against a truck and stabbed him using a knife. He stabbed him at least ten times before attacking him on his head with blunt force.

After the accused fled the spot with the blood stained weapon, locals rushed Akash to hospital, where doctors declared him brought dead. His family was informed about the incident.

Police officials immediately started looking for the accused after they identified the accused based on the CCTV footage and talks with locals present at the spot.

“Choti owns two dogs. After committing the murder, he locked the dogs in the house and fled with his family members. He was, however, tracked within a few hours,” said ASP Choubey.

Police finally tracked the accused based on their mobile phone locations and arrested them.

Aman works for Rahul, who operates a tent business in the area.

Around 57,141 farmers were initially identified for the scheme across the district

KOLHAPUR: The list of beneficiaries of the state government’s ambitious Mahatma Jyotirao Phule Farmer Loan Waiver Scheme will be published on February 28.

According to officials of the finance and co-operation department of Kolhapur, data of around 50,600 farmers has already been uploaded online. It accounts for nearly 99% of the total beneficiaries’ data.

Amar Shinde, deputy registrar, finance and co-operation department, told TOI, “Once the list is published, farmers can reach out to the banks from where they had taken loan and will be required to review the details that they had provided to the banks while seeking the loan. Details such as Aadhaar number, loan amount, loan account number, etc. will be reviewed. If there is any mistake in it, farmers can lodge a complaint and get it resolved. On the other hand, if the information is correct, it will be verified with biometrics or one-time password (OTP) and the respective amount will be deposited in their account.”

According to Shinde, around 57,141 farmers were initially identified for the scheme across the district. However, the figure has been reduced to around 51,000, as few figures were found to be inflated from the nationalized banks and have now been corrected.

Shinde said that as per the scheme, loan of up to Rs 2 lakh taken between April 1, 2015, and March 31, 2019, and which has not been repaid till September 30, 2019, will be eligible for waiver.

In January, the state government had issued a resolution which stated that the farmers whose crop loan and restructured loan is above Rs 2 lakh will not be eligible for any benefit under the scheme.

RMC councillors from BJP, Congress exchange bitter barbs over recently passed budget on Wednesday

Rajkot: The general board meeting of Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC) held on Wednesday remained a stormy affair with BJP councillors and opposition Congress members exchanging bitter barbs over the recently passed budget.

The Congress also accused BJP members of insulting women councillors with their remarks. The main agenda of the general meeting was to pass the budget for 2020-21.

It all began when BJP councillor Kashyap Shukla, who was expressing his views about development work done by the ruling party, was interrupted by Congress’s Jagruti Dangar. When Dangar confronted his claims, a visibly irritated Shukla shot back saying, “You don’t have a say in your own house.” This comment enraged women councillors of the Congress who claimed that it was an insult to women. They demanded an immediate apology from Shukla, setting off a pandemonium in the meeting.

Congress also raised the issue of giving relief to the self-finance educational institutes in property tax. Leader of Opposition Vashram Sagathia and other councillors Atul Rajani, Gayatri Vaghela, Ghanshyam Jadeja, Jagruti Dangar and others rushed into the well. They sought to know from the mayor the logic behind the tax relief at a time when SFIs are collecting high fees from students.

The tax rate has also been reduced for banks, corporate companies and mobile towers. The opposition alleged that RMC was lenient in collecting the tax from government properties, but sealing the private ones.

215,['20/02/2020'],GVMC prepares for summer with Raiwada desilting plan,"This story is from February 20, 2020

Visakhapatnam: The Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation ( GVMC ) has drawn up an action plan to mitigate water supply issues in the city this summer at an estimated cost of around Rs 6.3 crore.

The civic body has proposed that desiltation work in the Raiwada canal be taken up at a cost of Rs 2.5 crore.

Earlier, the GVMC used to draw about 16-17 million gallons per day (MGD) through the canal from theRaiwada reservoir, which has now decreased to about 12 MGD due to lack of maintenance in the past decade. The GVMC now wants to close the canal for a few weeks for desilting work to improve water supply.

The GVMC has proposed setting up around 130 new borewells in various parts of the city. As part of the summer action plan, the civic body will take up the repair of existing hand borewells and the pipeline network while additional tankers will be hired to improve the supply water to tail-end areas of the city.

Speaking to TOI, an official with the GVMC said that some sandbag works will also be taken up on the riverbeds of the Sarada and the Gosthani to prevent the flow water near wells and improve the seepage capacity of infiltration galleries. “Flushing of the existing hand borewells, installation repairs, pipeline maintenance works and other miscellaneous works would also be undertaken. The hilly areas and water scarce areas are on our priority list,” said the official.

Currently, water levels in the reservoirs that supply water to the city are above normal on account of heavy rainfall in September and October 2019. At present the water level in the Yeleru reservoir, which meets a major share of the water needs of the city, stands at 83.3 meters against its full capacity of 86.5 metres, averting the need for the civic body to divert water this year from the Yeleru canal to other reservoirs as was done in 2019.

The GVMC had drawn about 350 cusecs from the Yeleru reservoir in 2018-19 to compensate for poor water levels in other reservoirs and to sustain them till the onset of the monsoon.

Of the water drawn in excess, the GVMC had pumped eight MGD water into the Meghadrigedda reservoir from the Yeleru left main canal, through the old Raiwada pumping main from November 12 to December 15, 2018.

This was further increased to 16 MGD till January 6, 2019. From January 7 to May, eight out of 16 MGD was released to the Raiwada water treatment plant while the balance eight MGD was released to the Meghadrigedda reservoir.

NEW DELHI: Vinay Sharma , one of the four Nirbhaya case convicts lodged in Tihar Jail number 3, allegedly injured himself by hitting his head on the wall of his cell on Monday.Jail authorities said the wardens in-charge of keeping an eye on the death row convicts managed to stop Sharma and took him to a hospital where he was given first aid and discharged.Sources said Sharma had even tried to fracture his hand by sticking it between the grilles of the cell. AP Singh, Sharma’s counsel, claimed that the incident occurred on February 16 and the convict’s mother informed him the following day when her son refused to recognise her. Singh claimed that Sharma’s mental condition had become unstable since the fresh death warrant was issued.However, jail officials said that no such indications were found during Sharma’s counselling. “He is in perfect health and responded positively to the psychometry tests conducted on him recently,” said an official.A senior officer said that since the latest death warrant was issued, the four convicts had been behaving aggressively with the jail wardens and guards. There has been a stark change in their behaviour. Though their food habits are normal, Sharma and Mukesh Singh had refused meals and eaten after much convincing.The four men have been kept on suicide watch. Wardens have been tasked to monitor the CCTV cameras installed in their well-lit cells round the clock. Guards have been placed outside their cells to keep a watch. Their interaction with other inmates have been made minimal so that no one develops sympathy for them.Though they are allowed to meet their parents, sometimes they have refused to meet them. All efforts are being made to keep them mentally alert.Sources said death row convicts sometimes act violent to cause injuries to themselves so that they can appeal for clemency. Jail officials said if a convict is found injured or underweight, the death penalty can be deferred till they turn fit.In Video: Nirbhaya convict hits head against wall to hurt self",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74217388,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-585998,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/nirbhaya-convict-hits-head-against-wall-to-hurt-self/articleshow/74216292.cms

While one wing of the flyover will land towards Market Yard, the other will go towards Gangadham Chowk.The elected representatives held a visit to the proposed flyover site on Tuesday and urged the PMC authorities to extend the landing of one wing of the flyover up to Gangadham Chowk, which has become the busiest junction in the area.“We do not have any issues pertaining to the flyover’s landing towards Market Yard. But the wing landing in the direction of Gangadham Chowk is not suitable as it will lead to traffic chaos, considering shops of wholesale traders are located on Nehru Road, where the wing is supposed to land. Heavy vehicles will face problems while turning if the ramp of the flyover lands near the shops,” corporator Pravin Chorbele said after the site visit.He said adequate space was available near PMPML’s existing Market Yard bus stand for the landing of the flyover’s wing. “The administration should re-study the proposal and make necessary changes,” the corporator said.Parvati MLA Misal said the proposed landing of the two wings of the structure would solve the prevailing traffic problems on the stretch only partially. “The civic body should modify the proposed landing to accommodate future requirements of the area and increased vehicular traffic. Funds worth Rs 10 crore have been set aside for the flyover,” Misal said, adding that adequate funds would be made available as per requirements in the future.A delegation of Market Yard traders’ association has also made a similar suggestion to the PMC.Civic officials said they would work on the suggestions made by the elected representatives and traders’ association to work out the best feasible solution.The PMC has already started construction of a flyover on Nehru Road.

The woman also claimed that there were no female cops at the police station and she had to wait for several hours. “Throughout my presence at the police station, I had to interact with male cops,” she tweeted.

Inspector, Raipurwa, Sunil Kumar, however, denied allegations. “Her allegations are not true. Both the parties settled the dispute on their own,” he said.

IG Range Mohit Agarwal said, “I have asked the SSP to initiate a probe in this regard and act accordingly against guilty cops.”

Kanpur: Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) has given permission to tanneries of the city to run their units uninterrupted but with a condition that they would be operate at 50% capacity and follow the roster released by the board for holy baths in coming days.

The letter to this effect, issued by the UPPCB to the Regional Pollution Control Board (RPCB) Kanpur on Tuesday evening, was received by the latter on Wednesday, said RPCB officer S B Franklin.

""It is a big relief for the tannery industry. Now they can run their business properly"", said an office-bearer of Small Tanners' Association.

After a long time, we got some relief, and now we can fulfill our international commitments, he added.

Last week, the RPCB gave notices to the tannery owners to shut their units from February 19 as the limit granted to them had expired on that day, and that all tanneries would remain closed till further orders.

Earlier, there were around 500 tanneries in the Jajmau area of the city but due to back-to-back closure at present around 280 units are in working condition. The fate of the tanneries was hanging in balance after the state government had closed them on November 18.

The RPCB official while talking to TOI stated that UPPCB has given permission with certain conditions that are different for each tannery. The RPCB office would serve the order regarding the operation of the units in a couple of days after examining the condition of each tannery, he said.

The UPPCB, he said, had allowed 255 tanneries to operate in November 2019 for around two months with 50 percent capacity while permitted 28 tanneries to run even in the closure period with certain specific conditions, he added.

Firoz Alam of Small Tanneries Association said, at last, the tanneries have been given permission to do their business because they are following the norms set by the UPPCB and RPCB. They would get permission letter in a day or two.

""The UPPCB has given sanction to even those 11 tanneries which were closed since last one year for not following the set standards”, he added.

As around 70 percent tanneries were exporters they would now be able to fulfill their international commitments, Firoz said. General secretary, Leather Industries Association, Asad Iraqi while hailing the decision of the board to grant permission said that it would pave way for the leather industry to flourish.

Representative image

KOLHAPUR: The Kolhapur Chamber of Commerce and Industries (KCCI) has appealed to the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) to take action strict against those supplying plastic bags and other plastic packaging material from Gandhinagar .

Gandhinagar is a trading town located in the outskirts of the city. The Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) does not hold the authority to act against those supplying plastic carry bags from Gandhinagar. The health officials of the municipal corporation have alleged that plastic carry bags are being supplied to shops in the city from Gandhinagar. They said that they have found a chain of network connecting the manufactures to suppliers and eventually buyers. They said that this chain comprises traders and roadside vendors which needs to be broken to ensure effective implementation of plastic ban in the city.

Sanjay Shete, president of KCCI said, “We have information about 16 suppliers of plastic packaging materials from Gandhinagar. They supply huge amount of plastic bags to traders in the city. We have asked the MPCB to take action against them as Gandhinagar does not come under the jurisdiction of the KMC. We have also found that plastic carry bags are being manufactured in Karnataka state. The chain needs to be exposed. At the same time, we as the apex body of traders, will ensure that awareness about plastic bags and its ill-effects on the society is created among the traders and vendors from the city. If we find that no action is being taken by the MPCB, we will protest outside their office.”

Grampanchayats have the jurisdiction to implement plastic ban. However, the village panchayat lacks adequate staff for the same. The KCCI has also demanded the increase in number of plastic waste collection centres in the city. At present, the KMC has started centres at 13 places, mostly in the divisional ward offices and KMC-run schools. The trader’s body claims that the system of taking back plastic bags and bottles has not yet been set up by many traders, especially milk dairies who sell milk in pouches which are sold in lakhs every day.

In the general body meeting held on Tuesday, civic chief Mallinath Kalshetti said that the KMC will soon start penalising the traders and suppliers from a certain section of the Gandhinagar area which comes under the KMC’s jurisdiction.

On Monday, DFS had suspended the fire NOC of the hotel

NEW DELHI: Nearly 24 hours after the fire clearance certificate of The Park was suspended, Delhi Fire Service (DFS) revoked its earlier order contending that the shortcomings had been rectified by the hotel. On Monday, DFS had suspended the fire NOC of the hotel, following which the Delhi Police licensing department had written to NDMC seeking cessation of operations.

In a letter to the NDMC chairman and the licensing department of Delhi Police, DFS said, “An inspection carried out by officers of the fire department has shown that the shortcomings communicated to the hotel have been seen to.”

Atul Garg, DFS director, said, “The major issue was that the pressurisation and ventilation was on manual mode instead of automatic. In any tragedy or a fire situation, everyone rushes to the exit making it difficult to switch on the devices that are on manual mode.”

A senior NDMC official said, “We received a letter from Delhi Fire Service on Wednesday restoring the fire safety certificate of The Park. However, we have not taken any decision on the revocation of the hotel’s health/trade licence. Our department will first verify the status and then reach a decision.”

A statement issued by The Park said, “We had received a suspension notice from the fire department to undertake certain fire prevention improvements to ensure better safety. We had actioned all the suggestions made in the notice and complied with it. The fire department officers visited the premises and conducted an inspection to verify the compliance of safety norms on February 18.”

“We have been doing regular drills and are completely safety compliant. After a thorough check by the fire department, the hotel received a clearance and the fire safety certificate has been restored. Additionally, Delhi Police has also revoked the cessation order of the hotel and has allowed continuation of operations,” the statement said.

Meanwhile, the lodging and dining services of the hotel continued to operate on Wednesday as the 48-hour notice period had not lapsed, a source said.

On Saturday morning, a fire had broken out in the basement of the hotel. Though the blaze was doused by the hotel staff, the smoke reached the above floors through the air-conditioning ducts. Instead of informing the fire department and police, the hotel authorities used their staff to evacuate the guests.

Police were informed around 12.30pm by authorities at the hospital where the guests had been taken for treatment. Following the incident, a team of fire officials visited the hotel and listed out 11 shortcomings in the premises.

225,['20/02/2020'],Maharashtra: Painted Stork sighted six years after tagging,"This story is from February 20, 2020

An ibis

PUNE: A Painted Stork was sighted by bird watcher Sandeep Nagare on February 2, six years after it was tagged (wing tag number A 40) by Pune-based Ela Foundation, in association with the state forest department and the National Institute of Virology (NIV), as part of the bird flu surveillance programme.

This is the first such long-term recovery of the bird and the stork was seen about 4.5km from the site where it was first tagged, said ornithologist Satish Pande, founder-director of Ela Foundation.

The foundation, NIV and the forest department have been jointly conducting the wild bird monitoring programme for bird flu surveillance since 2008. The study is supervised by Pande, Shailesh Pawar, NIV and Nitin Kakodkar, forest department.

Pande said on May 12 and 24, two bird flu survey studies were carried out in Bhadalwadi Wetland, near Bhigwan in Pune. As many as 51 birds of several species were studied. These included Painted Storks, Black-headed Ibis , Grey Heron, Night Heron, Pond Heron, Little Egret and Small Cormorant.

“Their cloacal and tracheal samples were taken and blood was taken for bird flu scrutiny. Their wing length, tail length, leg, toe and talon (nail) length were measured. The weight of all birds was recorded and the overall health status was examined. All birds were either ringed and/or wing-tagged with numbered, lightweight, red tags on both wings. The birds were immediately released in the wild,” Pande said, adding that all birds tested negative for bird flu.

After a year, one Black-headed Ibis (wing tag A 27) was re-sighted 4km from the ringing site. One Painted Stork (wing tag A 47) was re-sighted at Bhigwan after four years, in 2017.

“Interestingly, one more Painted Stork (wing tag No A 40) was re-sighted by bird watcher Sandeep Nagare on February 2 this year. This is the first such long-term recovery of the bird after six years. This stork was seen about 4.5km from the site where it was first tagged. It confirms that the stork was alive for six years after tagging,” Pande said.

At the time of tagging in 2014 the A 40 tagged stork was aged around six weeks, weighed 2.5kg and was about to fledge. “After six years, this stork was found healthy and seen feeding with other Painted Storks, Grey Herons and Ibises. It was seen in the same general area indicating the importance of Bhadalwadi-Kumbhargao wetlands for aquatic birds,” Pande said.

Hyderabad: A day after a 25-year-old bank employee was murdered in Gajwel, police took an engineering graduate, who confessed to slitting her throat, into custody.

The suspect, K Venkatesh Goud, surrendered before police at Vemulavada town police station on Wednesday evening. “Gajwel police took him into custody for interrogation,” said Vemulavada Town circle inspector (CI) Sridhar.

Around 8 pm on Tuesday, E Divya, an employee of AP Grameena Vikasa Bank, was killed by unidentified persons at her house in Gajwel shortly after she returned from work.

Police sources said Venkatesh killed Divya as she spurned his marriage proposal and instead was preparing to wed another person.

Preliminary investigation revealed that the 25-year-old victim was all set to get married to a bank employee from Warangal on February 26. Divya had joined AP Grameena Vikas Bank as a clerk in September 2019 and was staying in Gajwel town with her parents for the past three months.

In their complaint Divya’s parents said they suspect involvement of Venkatesh Goud, 27, in their daughter’s murder.

“Due to my business, I stayed in Vemulavada for some time in the past and Venkatesh met my daughter there. He has been harassing my daughter for the past four years asking her to marry him. About four months ago, Venkatesh agreed that he will stop following my daughter and even gave an undertaking at the Yellareddypet police station. We suspect he killed Divya,” the victim’s father alleged.

Police also found that Venkatesh had earlier come under the radar of the OU police for causing nuisance at a hostel where Divya was staying a few years ago.

Pimpri Chinchwad: Water supply to Alandi has resumed at low pressure after a two-day closure. Normal supply will begin from Thursday.

Vaijayanti Umargikar, president, Alandi Municipal Council (AMC), said, “The town needs 5MLD to 7 MLD water. We began the alternate day water supply a month ago for which the town has been divided into four zones. The old water pipelines from the British era have rusted and are leaking leading to contamination. The Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran (MJP) has been allotted the work of laying new water pipelines and constructing elevated storage reservoirs.”

She said the newly laid main water pipeline from the bund on Indrayani river burst two days ago. There was no water supply to the town for two days. “The municipal council provided water tankers in some areas to tide over the shortage,” said Umargikar.

The civic officials asked the Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran to divert water through old pipeline, which enabled resumption of supply on Wednesday.

BHUBANESWAR: The state government has raised its disaster management funds to Rs 3,200 crore from last year’s Rs 2,000 in the annual budget presented on Tuesday.

For Odisha, which faces cyclones almost every year, this is the highest allocation in disaster management in the last four year. Of the total amount, Rs 1,711 crore will go to the state disaster response fund, Rs 1,000 crore to the national disaster response fund, Rs 428 crore to the state disaster mitigation fund and Rs 43 crore to the national disaster mitigation fund.

Sources in the finance department said the significant jump in the allocation could be attributed to the additional grants of Rs 2,139 crore to the state by the 15th finance commission.

The allocation is designed to increase assistance to the affected people. “A large amount of the money will be spent on building infrastructure such as multi-purpose shelters, training community people, necessary repairs post disasters and strengthening the capacity of mitigation institutions,” a senior government official said.

“As the government is aiming to develop disaster-resilient infrastructure in the state’s power, housing and telecommunication sectors, the allocation will be useful,” the official added.

The state’s geographical location makes it extremely vulnerable to natural disasters and has faced at least 18 major calamities like cyclones, floods and drought in the past 20 years. It has been hit by about 35 per cent of all cyclonic and severe cyclonic storms that crossed the eastern coast of India, causing colossal damage to its public properties.

The state government had received international recognition for its disaster preparedness during cyclones like Phailin (October 2013) and Fani (May 2019).

There are 20 specialized units under the Odisha Disaster Rapid Action Force (ODRAF) equipped with modern facilities for relief and rescue operations. This apart, there are 879 multi-purpose cyclone shelters in different parts of the state.

Meanwhile, adequate funds have been allocated for the road and energy sectors under different ongoing schemes.

The government has allocated Rs 2,272 crore for road development programmes. It includes Rs 500 crore for improving roads and bridges and Rs 100 crore for double laning of state highways under the state highway development programme.

In the energy sector, the state government has allocated Rs 184 crore for setting up of 33/11 kv sub-stations under the Odisha Distribution System Strengthening Project.

Similarly, Rs 200 crore has been given for laying underground cables in Bhubaneswar and Cuttack under the State Capital Region Improvement of Power System.

The state government has not announced any new scheme for these sectors.

Representative image

KOLHAPUR: The Solapur district and sessions court has sentenced nine people, including two women, for beating up, verbally abusing, stripping and parading a Dalit woman in 2016. The accused have been sentenced to five years of rigorous imprisonment.

The incident had taken place in the North Solapur taluka of Solapur district 13 years ago and had evoked sharp reactions from all quarters. The Dalit woman has since been given police protection.

District and sessions judge D K Anbhule held nine people guilty under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. Heavy police force was deployed in the village after the court announced its judgment on Tuesday.

According to the prosecution, the nine accused had a doubt that the woman had complained about their illegal and illicit activities in the village. They held a grudge against her for a long period as she was consistently following up on the complaint.

In March 2006, the woman was waiting at a bus stop along with her son at 9 am . All the accused were also standing at the bus stop. They forcibly stopped the woman and started verbally abusing and beating her. They also beat up the son. She was then stripped and paraded naked from the bus stop to the chawdi (a place where villagers gather). The woman lodged a complaint after the incident and a special investigation team was formed.

Public prosecutor Gandadhar Rampure said 16 witnesses, including the woman and her son, appeared during the hearing of the case. The court upheld the witnesses and other circumstantial evidences and declared the accused guilty. All the accused have been charged a total fine of Rs 2.43 lakh, which would be handed over to the woman.

The court held all the accused guilty under section 506 (2) (punishment for criminal intimidation) and under various sections of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. The accused were charged with section 3 of the Atrocities Act.

Representative image

NEW DELHI: Delhi high court on Wednesday said proactive steps should be taken by Delhi Police to trace missing children and issued a slew of directions to make it easier for the cops to trace them.

A bench of Justices Manmohan and Sangita Dhingra Sehgal said district anti-human trafficking units (AHTU) were currently functioning to investigate cases of children between ages of three and eight who were missing for four months or more, and cases where there was suspicion of links to trafficking and organised crime.

The bench directed AHTUs to be the nodal agency for all cases of missing children in a district. It also asked the unit to work in close coordination with the police and other agencies providing expert assistance in collection and analysis of technical evidence.

“Proactive steps should be taken by Delhi Police to curb the menace of missing children. To this end, within 48 hours, an officer not below the rank of additional DCP shall be nominated in each district, who shall thereafter hold at least one meeting a month with ACP (AHTU) and SHOs concerned, to identify sections/pockets of their respective districts that are worst affected,” it said.

The high court added that an action plan should be drawn with inputs from other stakeholders for steps to be taken in this regard.

The court asked Delhi Police to file an action-taken report by the next hearing on March 3. It was hearing a plea seeking directions to police to trace his 15-year-old daughter, who went missing in October last year. On being informed that investigating officers often face problems in getting prompt transport while tracking missing children, the court asked the department to make cabs available on immediate-basis at request. It added that reimbursements must be processed quickly and efficiently.

During the proceedings, the court also looked into the larger issue of children going missing from Delhi. On Wednesday, the girl was produced before the court where she stated that she would turn 18 on Thursday and had willingly gone with the man. She added she did not wish to go with her parents and was sent to Sanskar shram in east Delhi. The court directed the police to carry out ossification test of the girl to ascertain her age.

Visakhapatnam: NREGS funds have been allocated to the tribals of the nine hamlets of Pinnikota and Kivarla panchyats of Ananthagiri Mandal. The tribals, vexed with the delay in getting a road connecting their hamlets, took it upon themselves the task of laying the 12 km unpaved road.

A sum of Rs 15 lakh has been allocated under NREGS, with a total 8,000 work days granted to all the people put together. But a total of 80 people have job cards, while another 90 do not. As a result, NREGS authorities have decide to make the payments through customer service providers to the 90 who do not have job cards.

“About 100 people among those working on the road do not have bank accounts. This has become a major problem and has been brought to the notice of the authorities,” said Govinda Rao, district executive body member of CPM said.

Govinda Rao added that the ITDA authorities have drawn up plans to construct a BT road at a cost of Rs 15 crore but pointed out that for the BT road they would require permission from the forest department.

Speaking to TOI, ITDA project officer, D K Balaji, said, “The BT Road grant may be made in November.”

Hyderabad: India’s first private gold mine is expected to take off in the last quarter of 2021 if land acquisition for it is completed in the next six months at Jonnagiri in Kurnool district , Andhra Pradesh . After negotiating with farmers and completing exploratory mining, Geomysore Services India Pvt Ltd is in the process of acquiring the land.

Geomysore has acquired mining lease for 1,500 acres in Jonnagiri. “We have started the land acquisition process for 350 acres. We are hoping to complete it in the next six months. Once the land acquisition is completed, we will take 10 more months to set up the processing plant. Then we will start production. We have agreed to pay Rs 10 lakh plus Rs 2 lakh for each acre to the farmers, whereas the government value is Rs 1.5 lakh. Farmers are responding positively to the move,” said Jade Devenish, managing director at Geomysore Services India Pvt Ltd. The process of negotiation took eight months. So far, the company has invested Rs 160 crore into the exploration and is expecting investments of Rs 300 crore more.

Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board (APPCB) had earlier stopped the automatic renewal of Consent for Operation (CFO) based on a complaint. However, the CFO was recently granted to the company after an independent enquiry. Hanuman Prasad, a senior functionary of Geo Mysore, told TOI, “APPCB stopped auto-renewal based on a complaint. But after they have made an independent enquiry and found that there were no irregularities, they have renewed the CFO. One of the allegations in the complaint was that there were archaeological and heritage sites. But as per rules mining is allowed 300 metres away from the sites. Our mine is located three to four kilometres away from the archaeological sites.”

Prasad added, “As per the package being given to the farmers, for the first 350 acres, Rs 10 lakh will be paid upfront and Rs 2 lakh will be paid in first year of production as bonus. For the remaining 1,150 acres, we are going to pay a lease amount of Rs 16,000 per acre where farmers can grow crops. They must allow us to carry out exploration work if needed.”

Prasad added that there were a total of four blocks and initial mining will be done only in one. “Initially, Geological Survey of India (GSI) estimated 2.4 grams of gold per ton of ore, but those bores are not deep. We have done extensive studies and dug many bore wells and found it to be 1.68 grams per ton,” he said.

NEW DELHI: Three men , posing as Crime Branch sleuths , abducted a businessman from outside Tilak Nagar metro station . However, their quest for Rs 25 lakh in ransom money ended on a sour note after they were outwitted by the cops at their own game. One of them was arrested.

Police said they were contacted by the family of the businessman, Aman Kumar, around 9.40pm on Tuesday and told about the ransom demand. A team was immediately formed and a group of policemen posing as the victim’s relatives laid a trap. When the abductors reached the designated spot in Delhi Cantonment to collect the ransom, the policemen immediately swung into action.

When the cops asked the suspects to surrender, three of the abductors managed to flee after ramming their car into the policemen’s vehicle. However, one of them, Haripal, was caught. The businessman was rescued from a parking lot nearby after information from Haripal.

The accused told police that he wanted to start a business. To tide over the shortage of funds, he and his friends hatched a plot to abduct a businessman. They chose Kumar, who runs a call centre in Tilak Nagar, as they presumed that his business was doing well.

While Kumar was returning home from work, the three men, posing as crime branch officers, stopped him near Tilak Nagar metro station to make the “arrest”. They dragged Kumar out of his vehicle and pushed him into a Swift.

The men made Kumar sit in the rear seat and drove him around west Delhi for around eight hours. They used the businessman’s phone to call his family and make the ransom demand. After much haggling, they brought down their demand to Rs 10 lakh. They asked them to drop the money bag at a certain location in Delhi Cantonment.

Police said the hunt was on to nab the other two accused.

Coimbatore: Hours after the massive rally against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) that shook the city, federation of Muslim organizations and Muslim political outfits started a Shaheen Bagh-model indefinite dharna in front of a mosque at Athupalam here on Wednesday night. When the last report came in, around 9 ,000 people had gathered at the mosque to participate in the dharna.

Shamiyanas were erected in an open place adjacent to Irshadul Islam Shafia Sunnath Jamath mosque at Athupalam for the dharna, which commenced at 9pm.

Initially only around 500 people, comprising elders, women and children, were there. However, the number swelled to 9,000 in no time. The protesters held placards that read 'Kovaiyin Shaheen Bagh Athupalam'. The organizers said the dharma would be conducted peacefully. “It will be similar to the one conducted by women in Delhi.”

The protesters said the dharna would be continued till the Union government accepts to withdraw the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, the National Population Register (NPR) and the National Registry of Citizens (NRC).

Earlier in the day, tension had gripped the city after Muslim men and women came out in large numbers to take out a rally to demand that the state government pass a resolution against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, in the assembly.

The city police had deployed 1,384 cops to prevent any untoward incidents and used drones to keep an eye on the protesters. In view of the call given by the Coimbatore District Federation of All Jamaath and Islamic Organizations to besiege the collectorate at 10am, the city police had also blocked traffic on the Big Bazaar Street and the State Bank of India Road from 9am.

More than 7,000 Muslims, including 2,000 women, who had gathered near the Coimbatore Railway Junction, began the rally towards the collectorate around 11am. Police blocked the road to the collectorate using barricades. Rapid Action Force (RAF) personnel were deployed in the front row. Women cops from rural and city armed reserve police carrying lathis and shields were deployed in the second and third rows.

Police had also stationed a water canon vehicle and anti-riot vehicle Vajra that can lob tear gas shells.

City police commissioner Sumit Sharan and deputy commissioners L Balaji Saravanan (law&order), and ES Uma (crime) monitored the security arrangements.

The women protesters sat on the road and raised slogans demanding withdrawal of CAA. They had brought their children, who were waving tricolour flags. Two police drones recorded the protest.

Organiser of the outfit Raja Hussain, who addressed the protesters, said that AIADMK MPs supported CAA in the Parliament and the State government is supporting the Union government. “We are fighting against not only CAA, but the National Population Register (NPR) and the National Register of Citizenship (NRC) also. Several states have passed resolutions in assemblies against CAA. We want the State government to pass a similar resolution,” he said.

Muslims will continue the protest till the Union government withdraws CAA, NPR and NRC, Hussain said.

Traffic was restored through the stretch after the protesters dispersed around 12.30pm.

Subramanian Swamy

HYDERABAD: Rajya Sabha MP Subramanian Swamy left BJP red-faced on Wednesday by terming the Goods and Service Tax (GST) the “biggest madness” of the 21st century. He also raised several eyebrows by demanding the Bharat Ratna award for former Congress Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao.

Speaking on ‘India–an economic superpower by 2030’ at University of Hyderabad here on Wednesday, he advised government to not terrorise investors with GST and income-tax slabs.

Saying that the country had achieved 8% growth from time to time, Swamy said, “So how to get that 3.7% (efficiency factor to utilise investments)? (We need to) fight corruption and reward those who will invest,” he said.

According to him, the current problem of the country is shortage of demand as people do not have money to spend. “You want 10% growth rate. Then investment rate to the GDP should be 37% and 3.7% should be your efficiency factor and not 5% as it is today,” he said.

He is confident that India could become a superpower by 2030. He said Narasimha Rao deserved the highest civilian award for the economic reforms he unveiled during his tenure.

During the lecture, a section of students held a silent protest within the auditorium with placards stating ‘Say no to NRC, NPR, CAA’. On this, Swamy said: “What are they protesting for? In this election, a huge proportion of Muslim women voted for us. BJP removed triple talaq.”

RAJKOT: Weddings in many Darbar households are said to be incomplete without liquor, splurging of notes on drummers and a boisterous display of weapons.For generations, the community has been fiercely holding on to intimately entwined customs, notwithstanding the dangerous celebratory firing in grooms’ processions that have even snuffed out lives.But winds of change are blowing among the community members. Dabar and other sub-caste leaders recently met in Cher village of Dhandhuka in Ahmedabad district and Talaja near Bhavnagar and resolved to abolish these archaic practices.Talking to TOI, Mahendrasinh Chudasama, a community leader of Cher said, “Firearm in the hands of a drunk reveller is a very lethal combination. In such a scenario, people dying from misfiring or being injured in wedding processions are common. That is why we have decided to henceforth stop all these practices.”Cher is dominated by the Chudasamas, a sub-caste of Darbars . This decision stands to impact nearly 52 villages dominated by Chudasamas in the village’s vicinity.For a start, the Chudasamas of Dhandhuka and the Sarvaiyas of Talaja have decided to slap Rs 25,000 penalty on those indulging in any of these ritualistic practices.Another practice they are looking to abolish is ‘ghor’ tradition, wherein relatives of groom rain notes on drummers.“Financial condition of every family may not favour such extravaganza. Many even borrow money to maintain their prestige,” Chudasama said. Due to this ritual, the procession takes a long time to reach the marriage venue and it is during this time that some revellers open fire, some in inebriated condition.Bhupendrasinh Chudasama, executive council member of Dhandhuka Rajput Samaj said, “We will call a meeting of 52 villages of Chudasamas and put up a proposal to follow the decision taken by Cher village.”The Sarvaiyas in Pasvi village near Talaja had also taken the same decision a few months ago. Shaktisinh Sarvaiya, a primary teacher and leader of the community, said, “We have started abolishing these practices from the current marriage season itself. The villagers have also agreed not to indulge in the practices looking at the disadvantages of the traditional rituals.”Sarvaiya further said that the villagers have also agreed to boycott marriage functions where liquor is served to the guests. They will also ban entry of zonked guests in such functions.",rajkot,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74217919,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-176734,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/darbars-to-abolish-celebratory-firing-and-liquor-in-marriages/articleshow/74216402.cms

More Bottlenecks: Commuters complain that parking on both sides of the roads are leading to traffic congestion... Read More

Visakhapatnam: Traffic congestion in Rockdale layout on account of irregular parking has become a matter of concern for commuters. With vehicles, including buses and autos, parked on both sides of the narrow and steep roads, commuters are unable to drive in the area.

The neighbourhood has a school and a hospital, leading to high traffic flow at certain peak hours. Residents of the area said entering or leaving their apartments at these hours has become inconvenient given the rush of traffic.

Rakesh Kumar, a resident of one of the apartments in the layout, said, “It is very difficult to move out of our apartment, especially at 8 am and 4 pm. The traffic snarls have been disturbing us over the past few years now. Despite frequent complaints to the municipality and police, the issue has not changed.”

Another resident of the same apartment, Hemanth, said, “There is no parking sense among the people who park vehicles on the road. Last week, a car was parked so close to the entrance gate that my car hit it while moving out of the apartment. Many times we have observed that vehicles are parked in front of the gate, making it difficult for the residents. The cars are parked in a way that they partially block the main entrance.”

Hemanth added, “When a complaint was raised with the police officials, the police visited and raised e-challans on the vehicles parked irregularly. However, it was done only for two days and the situation has come back to square one.”

When contacted, assistant commissioner of police (ACP) Y Govinda said, “A police vigil will be kept in this area to regulate parking. The roads cannot be used for parking, hence we will be raising e-challans on a regular basis. A notice will also be issued to the school authorities and others who park vehicles on the road.”

The ACP added, “Vehicles cannot be parked adjacent to boundary walls of the apartments. If required, we will keep no parking boards so that rules are not violated.”

247,['20/02/2020'],Mandsaur civic body to procure latest tools to catch stray dogs,"This story is from February 20, 2020

The civic body had drawn flak for catching stray dogs with metallic pincers

INDORE: After taking the heat from animal activists for deploying untrained workers, who caught stray dogs with pincers and carried them in garbage vehicles in Mandsaur , district administration has ordered to purchase appropriate tools for the work and implement animal birth control (ABC) programme to check population of the strays in scientific manner.

“On instruction of Animal Welfare Board of India under ministry of environment, forest and climate change, conventional technique (use of pincers) for catching stray dogs will be discontinued. Also, animal husbandry department officials have been ordered to purchase required tools and use it for catching stray dogs,” collector Manoj Pushp said.

The collector’s order came in wake of a news published by TOI on civic body launching a drive to catch stray dogs after they ran riot and bitten over 20 people in Pipliya Mandi area on February 10. The team managed to catch over 10 dogs. But it had to face resentment of animal activists for using pincers and ropes to catch and tie the animals and allegedly even killing one of them.

According to animal activists, use of iron pincers to catch animals has been banned by Supreme Court and it is a clear violation of Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960.

Nagar Parishad Pipliya Mandi chief municipal officer Garima Patidar had blamed untrained staff and lack of equipment for the incindet. She had also accepted that procuring required tools to catch and control dogs along with providing training to staff is part of their job. But before the official could have initiated the process, she was transferred to Ratlam within a week.

Coimbatore: Hours after the massive rally against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) that shook the city, federation of Muslim organizations and Muslim political outfits started a Shaheen Bagh-model indefinite dharna in front of a mosque at Athupalam here on Wednesday night. When the last report came in, around 9,000 people had gathered at the mosque to participate in the dharna.

Shamiyanas were erected in an open place adjacent to Irshadul Islam Shafia Sunnath Jamath mosque at Athupalam for the dharna, which commenced at 9pm.

Initially only around 500 people, comprising elders, women and children, were there. However, the number swelled to 9,000 in no time. The protesters held placards that read 'Kovaiyin Shaheen Bagh Athupalam'. The organizers said the dharma would be conducted peacefully. “It will be similar to the one conducted by women in Delhi.”

The protesters said the dharna would be continued till the Union government accepts to withdraw the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, the National Population Register (NPR) and the National Registry of Citizens (NRC).

Earlier in the day, tension had gripped the city after Muslim men and women came out in large numbers to take out a rally to demand that the state government pass a resolution against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, in the assembly.

The city police had deployed 1,384 cops to prevent any untoward incidents and used drones to keep an eye on the protesters. In view of the call given by the Coimbatore District Federation of All Jamaath and Islamic Organizations to besiege the collectorate at 10am, the city police had also blocked traffic on the Big Bazaar Street and the State Bank of India Road from 9am.

More than 7,000 Muslims, including 2,000 women, who had gathered near the Coimbatore Railway Junction, began the rally towards the collectorate around 11am. Police blocked the road to the collectorate using barricades. Rapid Action Force (RAF) personnel were deployed in the front row. Women cops from rural and city armed reserve police carrying lathis and shields were deployed in the second and third rows.

Police had also stationed a water canon vehicle and anti-riot vehicle Vajra that can lob tear gas shells.

City police commissioner Sumit Sharan and deputy commissioners L Balaji Saravanan (law&order), and ES Uma (crime) monitored the security arrangements.

The women protesters sat on the road and raised slogans demanding withdrawal of CAA. They had brought their children, who were waving tricolour flags. Two police drones recorded the protest.

Organiser of the outfit Raja Hussain, who addressed the protesters, said that AIADMK MPs supported CAA in the Parliament and the State government is supporting the Union government. “We are fighting against not only CAA, but the National Population Register (NPR) and the National Register of Citizenship (NRC) also. Several states have passed resolutions in assemblies against CAA. We want the State government to pass a similar resolution,” he said.

Muslims will continue the protest till the Union government withdraws CAA, NPR and NRC, Hussain said.

Traffic was restored through the stretch after the protesters dispersed around 12.30pm.

Visakhapatnam: The Bureau of Energy Efficiency ( BEE ) held a workshop here, with the support of Andhra Pradesh State Energy Conservation Mission (APSECM), to introduce International Standard Organisation (ISO) 50001:2018 energy management standards in industries.

BEE director Sunil Khandare said implementation of ISO 50001:2018 energy management systems would benefit the industrial sector in the state. AP Energy Regulatory Commission (APERC) reports show that industries in the state consume 20,026 of the 59,162 million units (MUs) of electricity generated.

ISO 50001:2018 standards, Khandare said will support industries use energy more efficiently and deliver multiple benefits across the industrial value chain, leading to lower energy consumption, enhanced competitiveness, lower costs of environmental compliance, operation and maintenance as well as an improved working environment for all employees.

Citing a 2017 Niti Aayog report, Khandare said India is likely to account for 25 per cent of the rise in global energy demand by 2040.

At the same time, energy-related greenhouse gas emissions account for 75 per cent of all greenhouse gas emissions in the country, he added.

Energy consumption in industries in the country is expected to reach 443.4 millions of tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe) by 2031 as against the present consumption of 347 Mtoe, Khandare added.

NEW DELHI: Delhi Metro Rail Corporation on Wednesday extended the facility of e-rickshaw services to 12 more stations across its network, taking the total tally to 29 with an overall fleet strength of over 1,000 e-rickshaws.

A K Garg, director (operations) flagged off a fleet of 250 e-rickshaws — SmartE — from Patel Nagar station on Wednesday. These e-rickshaws will provide last-mile connectivity between 6am and 11pm.

“Over 800 e-rickshaws are already plying from 17 metro stations, facilitating over one lakh commuters to reach their destination or stations on a daily basis,” a DMRC spokesperson said. In the next three months, he added, 500 more e-rickshaws will be deployed at 12 more stations.

These GPS-enabled SmartEs are specially designed with covered cabin and full front windscreen to provide last-mile connectivity within an area of 3-4 km around metro stations. “The fares start at Rs 10 for the first two kilometres and Rs 5 for every subsequent kilometre. Commuters can also book vehicles through the SmartE app and pay digitally for their rides,” the spokesperson said.

According to the spokesperson, DMRC has, in recent years, introduced a number of eco-friendly initiatives to ensure a robust last-mile connectivity system, which enables commuters to prefer non-polluting public transport modes over personal vehicles.

At present, the metro operator runs 174 non-AC CNG feeder buses from 69 metro stations and on 32 feeder routes. DMRC has also started e-scooter rental services from Vishwavidyalaya, Mandi House, Dwarka Sector 9 and Nehru Enclave stations and plans to extend the service to Kashmere Gate, IIT and New Delhi metro stations soon.

Representative image

NEW DELHI: With the elections over, the sealing committee is back in action. The Supreme Court-appointed monitoring committee has directed the local bodies to prepare and submit the standard plans for all designated local shopping centres falling under their jurisdictions.

The three-member panel has noted that though a standard plan was prepared for the Rajouri Garden complex , no action has been taken. After the additional commissioner of South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC), Ramesh Verma, submitted that some clarifications had been sought from the Delhi Development Authority , the committee asked him to deposit its copy and clarify why standard plans hadn’t been prepared for other centres.

A sealing drive at the market has been a contentious issue for the past two years. Last September, the panel ordered the west zone to carry out sealing at Rajouri Garden but civic officials and councillors stonewalled the directive by citing a status quo in terms of the land-use notification. The committee said a new directive had to be issued as SDMC didn’t act on a similar order sent in May 2018.

However, the corporation argued no sealing action was possible as the notification on the change of land use for 351 roads had been pending with the Supreme Court, an official said. The market is situated on one of these roads identified by the erstwhile MCD in 2007 for commercial/mixed land use.

Lucknow: Sugriv Singh was lounging in his room after lunch when he suddenly had trouble breathing. He turned around to see billows of thick, black smoke blurring his window. Instinctively, he grabbed some belongings and rushed out with his family.

Singh was not the only one who panicked. A major fire at a neighbouring plywood factory in Aishbagh triggered a stampede-like situation with every family residing dangerously close to the unit scurrying for cover.

Three women, identified as Urmila Devi (52), Asha Devi (40) and Poonam (25), were injured when they fell on the road in the mad scramble for safety.

Some stood on the streets for the next three hours, apprehensive that flying embers would burn down their homes as well and praying for safety.

“I was taking bath when I heard commotion outside. I came out and saw the leaping flames. Without wasting a second, I rushed out of our house with my three children,” said Ajay Singh, who lives very close to the factory.

While most people began evacuating the place, some brave residents tried in vain to control the blaze by pouring buckets of water from their rooftops. But, once the plywood factory’s synthetic overhead water tanks began melting because of intense heat, people in the neighbourhood decided to keep safe distance until evening when firemen finally managed to extinguish the flames.

MHOW: Fed up of administration’s hollow assurances for decades, people of Anjanwada village in Alirajpur paved a seven km road by chiselling a mountain without heavy machinery and finally connected the isolated village with the mainland.

Falling under Sakarja panchayat, the only way to reach Anjanwada village is crossing Narmada river on a boat which takes around two to three hours.

The plight of around 350 residents of Anjanwada prevailed despite decades of pleading public representatives and administrative officials.

Alirajpur collector Surbhi Gupta said that she got to know about the issue after being posted there and she verified it. “80 families are residing in the village and we are trying to get a road constructed under MGNREGA scheme. There is a small stretch of forest in the way for which the forest department’s nod is essential and the process is underway,” she said.

Alirajpur MLA Mukesh Patel said that he had been elected for the first time and while campaigning, he could meet only a dozen people of Anjanwada in Sakarja. “They had come all the way after a boat ride to meet me and I had promised a road to the village but there were other priorities as per the election manifesto so I could not do anything in that regard,” he said.

As a last resort, the villagers, who are mostly manual labourers and farm workers, decided to pave way for the road by themselves and began working in September.

As of today, four-wheelers can easily reach the village via the three-metre-wide road stretching seven km.

Sarpanch of Sakarja Ap Singh told TOI that he was a resident of Anjanwada and as a sarpanch, he had tried all available means for getting the road constructed but nothing happened. The villagers achieved the target without any modern machinery or earth-moving machines, he said.

Panchayat secretary Rajesh Kanesh told TOI that it was a great example as even children and women of the village contributed to build the road. Now the children will be easily able to visit the school, five km from the village, he said.

NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday called on home minister Amit Shah at the latter’s residence to discuss a wide range of issues. The meeting, coming in the backdrop of highly charged election campaigns by AAP and BJP, was held in a cordial atmosphere and the two sides agreed to work together for the city’s development.

The CM described the 15-minute meet as fruitful. He tweeted, “Met Hon’ble Home Minister Sh Amit Shah ji. Had a very good and fruitful meeting. Discussed several issues related to Delhi. Both of us agreed that we will work together for development of Delhi (sic).”

It was the first meeting between the two since Kejriwal took oath as chief minister of Delhi for the third consecutive time on Sunday.

Kejriwal said various issues concerning Delhi were taken up. “Overall, there was an agreement that the Centre and Delhi government should work together for the development of Delhi. We both agreed to work together,” he reiterated at a press conference later.

Among the issues that were discussed were women safety, law and order and the role of Delhi Police. “Since there is a lot of division in power and responsibility (among different agencies) in Delhi, it was decided that we work together for all matters related to the development of Delhi,” Kejriwal added.

Asked whether there was any discussion on Shaheen Bagh, where hundreds of people have been protesting against Citizenship Amendment Act , Kejriwal said there were no such talks during the meeting. In the run-up to the elections, several BJP functionaries had targeted Kejriwal and AAP on the issue.

Seeking to put behind the heat generated during the poll campaigns, both sides continued to make the right noises as they sought to put Centre-Delhi relations in order. Kejriwal sought the cooperation of the central government in making Delhi a “world-class city” while thanking Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his congratulatory message on AAP’s victory in the elections.

At the swearing-in, too, Kejriwal had sought the PM’s blessings. Modi couldn’t make it to the ceremony as he was in Varanasi at that time. Shah had led the BJP offensive against Kejriwal in the assembly polls that saw AAP storm back to office, winning 62 of the 70 seats.

CHENNAI: They came, they stood their ground and after making a point, they left. Thousands of anti-CAA protesters, mobilised mostly by Muslim organisations, gathered on Wallajah Road on Wednesday with plans to march towards the Secretariat. But security was tight — barricades with barbed wire, around 5,000 of police personnel with drones and cameras. And the march towards the government headquarters ended before it could start.

Unlike the ugly scenes in Delhi, where protesters charged at barricades with blinkers on and police caned them at will, Wallajah Road remained peaceful. The only casualty was the traffic on Anna Salai that came to a crawl. With Kamarajar Salai, Wallajah Road, Swami Sivananda Salai blocked for traffic, vehicular movement on Anna Salai, Blackers Road and Dams Road was badly hit.

Around 9am, protesters began to assemble on Wallajah Road. Twenty-one Muslim organisations, including Manithaneya Makkal Katchi, Indian Union Muslim League and Indian National League, had mobilised anti-CAA protesters who, while rejecting CAA and NRC, demanded the state government to pass a resolution against the law.

The protest prop for the crowd, which mostly consisted of young men, included the national flag, portraits of B R Ambedkar, Mahatma Gandhi and Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, and placards. The women, who are spearheading the protest at Shaheenpet (a new name for Washermenpet) did not turn up in huge numbers.

At Chepauk, protesters told TOI that they intended to remain peaceful. Some though said they were ready to retort should the police crack down. That never happened and the talking was left to the placards they held.

‘Reject NRC, NPR, CAA’ caught the eye every now and then as did ‘azadi’ (a punchier alternative to freedom). “Our demand is simple — revoke CAA and do away with NRC and NPR,” said Ameer, a protester. “If the process takes long, we are ready to agitate longer,” he said indicating that protesters are ready to soldier on if required.

But on Wednesday, they decided to wind up by 12.55pm with leaders addressing the gathering near the Chepauk guest house and the protesters singing the national anthem.

M H Jawahirullah of Tamil Nadu Muslim Munnetra Kazagham said had CAA been brought a few decades ago, even MGR, born in Kandy, Sri Lanka, would not have been the chief minister. “This protest is on behalf of the people of Tamil Nadu,” he said.

T Velmurugan, founder of Tamizhaga Vazhvurimai Katchi, said the Muslim community played an important role in India’s independence struggle and it was “wrong to check their antecedents”.

Sea turtles are endangered species, protected under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. They are listed as ‘critically endangered’, ‘endangered’, or ‘threatened’ on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List.

While use of TEDs is mandatory in Andhra Pradesh and Odisha, compliance rates are poor due to lack of awareness and misconceptions regarding the operation of the devices.

R Raghu Prakash, principal scientist and project leader, gave a talk on the role of TEDs in sea turtle conservation. M Vinod, WWF-India team leader stressed the importance of compliance.

Protesters at Shaheen Bagh

NEW DELHI: Ruksaar Begum , a perpetual presence at the protest in Shaheen Bagh , was among the thousands who asserted on Wednesday that they would not shift elsewhere and thus open up the Kalindi Kunj road for traffic. They also asserted on Wednesday that it would not take them even two minutes to vacate the site of the 66-day-long sit-in if the central government addressed their grievance: the Citizenship Amendment Act and the National Register of Citizens.

“Nobody knew about Shaheen Bagh earlier. Now because of this Shaheen Bagh in Delhi, there are a hundred other Shaheen Baghs across the country,” said Begum. As for why they couldn’t shift the agitation to another place, the 50-year-old reasoned, “If the government does not hear our concerns despite the road being blocked, would it listen to us at some other site?”

Begum’s inflexibility was expressed on a day when two senior lawyers, of the three people appointed by the Supreme Court as interlocutors, reached Shaheen Bagh for a dialogue to clear the impasse. While Sanjay Hegde explained the concerns of the Supreme Court to the mostly women demonstrators, Sadhana Ramachandran promised to find a solution “together”. The latter cheered the hearts of the demonstrators when she said, “A country that has daughters like you can never face any threats.”

Glad that someone had at long last officially reached out to them, a woman who preferred to remain unnamed, said, “We felt marginalised that despite bearing the winter cold, nobody cared about us. Aren’t we citizens of India? Finally, someone has come to find out what exactly we are sitting in the cold for. We are grateful for this.”

However, there was no woman that TOI encountered on Wednesday who expressed comfort at the idea of shelving the agitation or changing the protest site. “If the Prime Minister listened to us, would we be protesting? If he amended the laws that we, as citizens of India, are demanding, we would immediately vacate the place,” said Rubina, 36, who has sat there for 45 days with her two-year-old son. “They claim to be sabka saath sabka vikas, but laws like these represent vinaash (destruction).”

Rubina said she brought her son to the protest even in cold weather because she wanted him to “witness the struggle so that tomorrow, with God’s grace, this country frees every citizen of the burden of CAA and NRC”. Many women talked of the struggle to sustain their sit-in. “We all have families to take care of, colleges to attend and hundreds of other chores. But where are we? We are here, protesting, so that we do not have to live in fear,” declared 40-year-old Nausheen. “They describe some people getting stuck in traffic because of the occupied 150 metres of the road as public inconvenience. But is their trouble bigger than our having to sit here night and day to secure the future of our children?”

Nausheen added that disbanding their protest would not do justice to the ‘Shaheen Baghs’ that have emerged in other states. Many others nodded their assent, convinced as they were that the central government had amended the citizenship law only to benefit its vote bank. “The leaders have been remarking about what we wear and what we eat. Why are we being stereotyped?” bristled Jannat Ruheen, Nausheen’s friend. “Does anyone have the courage to do the same to the PM?”

Ruheen also bared the frayed nerves of the protesters. “We are facing an existential crisis and it is becoming hard for us to sleep at night,” she exclaimed. “What have we done to deserve this?”

Representative Image

LUCKNOW: A day after Vikasnagar police registered a murder FIR in connection with the mysterious death of a 15-year-old girl, forensic experts analysed the crime scene on Wednesday and said it had been tampered with to make the case look like suicide.

On Monday, parents of the Class X student had told police that she shot herself with the licensed pistol of her father, a police head constable in the security department, after being scolded for not studying. The girl was rushed to KGMU Trauma Centre, but died during treatment. The postmortem examination, however, revealed that she did not have any gunshot wound and instead died of head injuries. Thus, a murder case was lodged.

A senior forensic expert told TOI that though the girl did not have any bullet injury, a pistol and an empty shell were recovered from the spot. There was also a hole in the wall, apparently caused by the bullet fired from the pistol.

“We traced the trajectory of bullet to the wall from the place where body was found, but it did not match scientific pattern. The lacerated wound on girl’s head seems to have been formed by some hard and blunt object, as mentioned in autopsy report,” he said.

“There is less noise in winters, hence, a 9mm Glock pistol that emits 160 decibel without silencer could not go unnoticed. The neighbours said they did not hear any noise at the given time,” he added.

The multiple abrasions on girl’s feet and left arm are antemortem injuries, which raise questions on handling of body after the crime. The FSL has recommended a crime scene reconstruction and Narco test on her parents. JCP (crime) Nilabja Choudhury said the crime scene would be recreated.

262,['20/02/2020'],Seized Chinese ship isn’t just a cargo vessel: Sources,"This story is from February 20, 2020

Rajkot: ‘Da Cui Yun’ , the Chinese ship which was seized by the customs department a few days ago based on intel reports, has been found to be more than just a cargo vessel.

According to sources, the ship which was found to be carrying suspected equipment used in missile manufacturing had visited Deendayal port nearly 15 times in last one year to discharge consignments here and thereafter leave for Karachi to deliver cargo. In all earlier shipments, the vessel had declared the same cargo as ‘machinery’.

According to sources the vessel belonging to Hong Kong flag of China Ocean Shipping company limited (COSCO) visited Deendayal port at least twice in a month in the past one year. It carried windmill tower as its deck cargo, while it declared the under-deck cargo as machinery or project cargo. After unloading the windmill tower at Kandla, the vessel left for Karachi.

The sources further said that in the last one and half years, a few other multi-port vessels too have gone to the UAE, Gulf and Bahrain after unloading cargo at Kandla. “The loading port — Jiangyin port in China — has always always remained the same for the earlier ships, while the destination of most of the ships was Qasim,” the sources said.

The Defence Research and Development organization (DRDO) which is probing the seized cargo is also investigating into how many times the ship had been carrying such type of cargo.

According to sources the suspected cargo is discharged and taken to a warehouse of Deendayal port. After this, the vessel is released from berth and shifted to outer tuna buoy (OTB). The DRDO is investigating inside the warehouse.

Da Cui Yun started its journey from Jiangyin port in China in January. Around 10 days ago customs department seized the vessel suspecting it to be carrying equipment that is used in missile manufacturing which was meant for unloading at Karachi. The custom officials are tight-lipped on the investigation so far, terming it an issue of national security.

Representative image

BHUBANESWAR: The opposition on Wednesday slammed the state government over the mismatch in the number of beneficiaries under Kalia scheme in the statements of two different ministers. While agriculture minister Arun Sahoo on several occasions said over 51 lakh beneficiaries have been covered under the scheme, finance minister Niranjan Pujari in his budget speech on Tuesday, said 43 lakh farmers have benefitted from Kalia. Pujari said Rs 5,115 crore has been transferred directly to the bank accounts of farmers.

Leader of opposition Pradipta Kumar Naik said BJD used the Kalia scheme to sail through the 2019 elections. Naik said many ineligible people, including government employees, have received assistance under Kalia. Agriculture minister Arun Sahoo did not respond to allegations of mismatch in the number of beneficiaries in two different statements. In a written reply to the assembly on Wednesday, Sahoo said as many as 45,965 ineligible beneficiaries have availed assistance under the Kalia scheme.

Steps are being taken to ensure that ineligible farmers return the money they availed under Kalia scheme, he said, adding that 1,863 farmers have so far returned the cash they received in their bank accounts, Sahoo said.

The state government has earmarked Rs 3,195 crore under Kalia scheme for 2020-21. It has also reduced the annual assistance from Rs 10,000 to Rs 4,000 crore under Kalia.

KOLKATA: One person was seriously injured and three vehicles were damaged when a gulmohar tree got uprooted around 11.25pm on Sambhunath Pandit Street in Bhowanipore on Tuesday.Kalighat Police, which is probing the case, said it was sheer “good luck” that a marriage procession had held up traffic on the road. Had it not been the case, the consequences of the accident could have been worse. The fact that the tree got uprooted without even a burst of strong winds left the KMC red-faced as it went about the entire Wednesday clearing the debris. Locals though claimed that without proper maintenance, at least two other trees in the vicinity is only awaiting a similar fate.Keshav Prasad (27), a pedestrian from Bhowanipore Place, who was watching a band party perform at the marriage ceremony, got injured after the tree fell on him. He is admitted at the SSKM Hospital with head injuries. Two yellow taxis and a Maruti Eeco have been damaged.Cops from local police and the disaster management group teams removed the tree to restore traffic movement. Later, KMC workers took over the task of removing the branches from the tree. No one from the KMC agreed to speak to TOI.“This tree is at least seven-decade old. As a child, we used to take care of this tree and was often rebuked for trying to climb it. I had bought my taxi in 2010. Like any other day, it was parked at the Kasaipara crossing. I rushed out of my residence after my friends informed me that the taxi was completely damaged. When I saw it, I could hardly control my tears. The bonnet was crushed and the rear portion sustained extensive damages,” said Md Zumman (45), owner of one of the damaged cabs.According to Pappu Roy and Sukesh Singh, two local residents aged over 70, rats pose a major challenge in the area. “The trees were guarded by a makeshift boundary earlier. Ever since it was removed two years ago, there was a lot of hue and cry and the rats moved in.

KOLKATA: Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation (KMRC), the implementing agency of the East-West Metro project, has changed gear after getting the high court nod to resume the tunnelling work. While it has restarted burrowing at Bowbazar, engineers are now taking extensive measures to make the entire stretch foolproof and build confidence among people.At Dalhousie, the agency has started taking a host of demonstrable measures, like installing tilt and crack meters to track even the slightest change in the heritage zone, where work is currently on to build a diaphragm for the entrance to the Mahakaran station from the pavement across Currency Building.A subway will come up from this side of the road so that commuters won’t have to cross the road to access Mahakaran station next to Laldighi. Shop-owners and office occupants said engineers from Afcons, contracted to build this part of the underground corridor along with Mahakaran station, were visiting multiple times a day to check for any deviation or cracks that may have developed due to the ongoing work.Before the construction began on the subway and entry-exit point, strengthening work was carried out in the adjoining buildings with fresh cement grouting. Officials from Afcons and KMRC have also informed the occupants to stay away on certain dates when the construction of the diaphragm wall will be under way.In June, 2017, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) had allowed the construction of Metro tunnels and a station (Mahakaran) close to three heritage structures in the Dalhousie area, removing a major hurdle in the path of a project with stop-start-stop history.Most shop-owners and occupants of offices in the neighbourhood expressed satisfaction over the way Afcons and KMRC were keeping an eye on the buildings. “Engineers come every evening before we shut our shop to check for vibrations. Before the work started, they did some fresh cement grouting to strengthen the foundation,” said Anubhav Biswas, owner of DN Biswas and Company, which deals in arms and ammunition.According to engineers of KMRC and Afcons, multiple instruments, including tilt, settlement and crack meters have been installed in the buildings to record the slightest change so that corrective measures can be taken, if required. “Surface settlement points and building settlement points have been identified for the slightest change while construction around the Mahakaran station is on. The meters are transmitting real-time data, showing any structural change of the buildings. The instrumentation is for heritage buildings like Currency Building and St Andrew's Church that fall within the radius of the impact zone,” the sources said.Engineers have also installed multiple mechanical crack meters to monitor the opening and closing of the “surface crack” in the buildings. “Engineers come every morning and evening to assess if the cracks have deepened or increased in size,” said Dilip Banik, who works in Khadi Gram Udyog on 11 BBD Bag.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74219395,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-882850,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/e-w-engineers-keep-tabs-on-dalhousie-bldgs/articleshow/74215535.cms

SALEM: Fire broke out in Uthumalai in the city on Tuesday night, destroying trees and herbs spread across a few acres. The forest department is yet to ascertain both the cause of fire and the extent of damage caused by the same.

According to a senior forest officer, local residents saw fire raging in the hills at night and alerted the forest department and Shevapet fire service station officials, who sprang into action to put it out and prevent it from spreading to more areas.

Quoting residents, the officer said thick smoke started to emanate from the hill area around 11pm on Tuesday. “The residents could feel the stench of burning dried trees and other waste material. The fire soon started to spread.”

He said they had removed dry leaves in the surrounding areas of the incident place to prevent fire from spreading to other areas.

“We, along with the fire and rescue services personnel, managed to put out the fire on Wednesday morning. An inquiry is on to identify whether it was a natural fire or man-made one,” the officer said.

Uthumalai is situated near Seelanaickenpatty in the city.

Visakhapatnam: Situated a little over 100 kilometres from Visakhapatnam city at an elevation of about 1,000 metres, Lammasingi is well-known for its misty climate, coffee plantations, strawberry farms and scenic landscape. But in spite of being a major tourist attraction in the state, the Lammasingi resort project of AP Tourism Development Corporation ( APTDC ) has been pending completion for three years now.

In August 2017, the then regional director of APTDC had said work would be over by end of December 2017. In June 2019, the executive director of APTDC said work was 90 per cent complete and the resort would be inaugurated within a few months before the tourist season commenced in October. The delay was attributed by APTDC authorities to a lack of funds on occasion and the state election.

With another financial year drawing to a close, the main building in the Rs 5 crore project is still awaiting completion. Civil works outside the building are incomplete as is work on water and electricity supply and other infrastructure.

Some temporary tents without amenities were put up during winter for visitors, with the price of accommodation varying between Rs 1,500-Rs 2,000 depending on the season and days of the week.

A resident of Visakhapatnam, who recently visited Lammasingi said, “Tourists and visitors will have a negative opinion if they stay in the tents available beside the main resort building. There are no toilet facilities nearby and visitors have to go to the incomplete main building among rubble and construction materials to use the barely functional toilet. There is no proper approach road or restaurants, reception counter, telephone facilities – nothing. Someone cooks limited items based on orders from guests. Even if the construction works resume now, it will definitely take eight months to a year for the resort to be fully functional with all amenities.”

When asked about the delay, CEO of AP Tourism Authority and managing director of APTDC Pravin Kumar told TOI, “We have identified 8 to 10 big impact tourism projects worth Rs 50 crore in the state such as resorts in Kovur and Srikakulam, ropeways and Lammasingi is one of the priority projects. Works will commence soon. As for Lammasingi, we did some revalidation of orders last year and this year, and fresh orders have been issued. Works will start immediately and will be completed in the shortest possible time.”

270,['20/02/2020'],Odisha government hints at jump in paddy procurement,"This story is from February 20, 2020

CM Naveen Patnaik

BHUBANESWAR: State food supplies and consumer welfare minister Ranendra Pratap Swain on Wednesday indicated the paddy procurement for the ongoing kharif season could exceed expectations with 43.38 lakh metric tonne (MT) having been procured till February 13 against the target of 51 lakh MT for the entire season that started in November last year and is set to be over in April.

The minister was responding during question hour as legislators cutting across party lines, including the ruling BJD, raised concern over discrepancies in the paddy procurement system. With the state government introducing a centralized token system for paddy procurement this year, the minister said as many as 8.13 lakh farmers have sold paddy through this process. In contrast, 7.77 lakh farmers had sold paddy in the same period last year.

“The token system has been introduced this year to ensure transparency in the procurement system and to check bogus beneficiaries from participating in the procurement system. The state government is committed to procure paddy from all genuine farmers,” Swain said. In a separate reply, the minister said as many as Rs 7,458 crore has been transferred to the accounts of farmers who have sold their paddy in the 3,500 mandis across the state while the remaining Rs 416 crore will be transferred to their accounts soon.

Senior BJD leader Bhupinder Singh said many farmers are yet to get tokens as a result of which they could not sell their paddy. He said some of the farmers who have received tokens could not even sell their paddy because of mismanagement at the ground level.

Raising the issue in the assembly, senior BJP leader Jaya Narayan Mishra alleged that farmers are not able to sell their paddy in the mandis. He urged the minister to hold meetings by involving local MLAs to streamline the procurement process. During the discussion, Congress leader Santosh Singh Saluja came down heavily on the state government over its failure to control unscrupulous millers who have been exploiting the farmers. Sensing the mood of the house, speaker Surya Narayan Patro directed Swain to hold meetings with district-level officers to take stock of the procurement status and to place a report in the assembly.

PUNE: The residents of Wagholi and people travelling through the area can expect a snarl-free commute along the arterial Ahmednagar road by May.The public works department (PWD) has started making the Pune-Ahmednagar highway’s Wagholi-Shikrapur stretch a six-lane road. Officials said the department was looking forward to complete widening of the Wagholi stretch of the highway on a priority basis and put an end to the daily snarls.The nearly 26km stretch from Wagholi to Shikrapur will have a lane each on both sides, making it a six-lane facility. The officials said the existing four-lane stretch was insufficient to cater to to the increased vehicular load and the entire road widening work was likely to take two years.The PWD has mobilized the machinery for the work on the Wagholi stretch. “Shifting of the underground utility lines, cables and removal of encroachments has been started along the 1,200m stretch starting from Wagholi. There is a plan to widen the road (3,300m stretch) by the end of May. This will cover the portion around Wagholi that often faces traffic snarls,” a PWD official said.Frequent commuters and local residents have been complaining about the chaotic traffic on Ahmednagar road.The issue was also raised during the recent meeting with district guardian minister Ajit Pawar to discuss various issues in Wagholi, which has been witnessing a significant rise in residential projects.The PWD officials said the six-lane project would not face any hurdles, as land acquisition was not required to widen the road. The officials said the department has the right of way that would help expedite work on both sides of the road.With the addition of one lane on either sides, the width of the road would be increased by about 7m — 3.5m on each side. The cost of the work is estimated at Rs219 crore.Vikas Patil, who regularly takes the stretch for commuting, said the road required urgent attention to address the daily woes. “The stretch up to Shikrapur cannot be called a highway, as it has lot of punctures. The road should either have a flyover or an underpass at the major junctions,” Patil said.Kharadi resident Ajay Sathe said, “The PWD should ensure that there’s no delay in the work. It should also ensure that the work does not obstruct traffic.”",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74217823,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-883661,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/snarl-free-drive-likely-in-wagholi-by-may/articleshow/74216483.cms

Potholes

RUDRAPUR: Numerous roads in Udham Singh Nagar district — in prominent towns like Rudrapur, Kashipur as well as other areas — are in a dilapidated condition, with potholes on the roads often leading to accidents. Even the two national highways — NH 74 and 87 which pass through the district —have not been completed, despite the deadline getting over in 2018.

According to residents, the Kashipur bypass road in Rudrapur, which takes the maximum load of traffic, is one of the most affected. Another road — from Civil Lines to National Highway-87 — along with roads inside residential colonies is also in a bad state.

Residents say that it is important to “macadamize the roads on priority.” President of the Rudrapur traders’ union, Sanjay Juneja, said, “People are facing immense hardships owing to dilapidated condition of roads which connect with the main town as well as rest of the colonies. In fact, a person cannot find 100 feet of stretch in Rudrapur without huge potholes.”

Former mayoral candidate belonging to the Congress, Nand Lal, said that the 1.5 km-long road connecting Rudrapur city to Transit Camp, which has a population of over one lakh, “cannot even be termed a road.” “CM TS Rawat had sometime back announced the construction of this road but it still remains a muddy drain. Complaints of residents have simply fallen on deaf ears,” he added.

When contacted, Rudrapur mayor Rampal Singh said that macadamized roads can only be constructed after the temperature goes over 16 degrees Celsius. “We will start constructing roads as soon as the temperature rises. Meanwhile, tile roads are being constructed in full swing to provide relief to people,” he said.

In Kashipur, too, roads are in a poor state, many residents said, adding that some streets are in such a condition that transporters often refuse to ply their vehicles there. A few residents added that the construction of two flyovers above railway crossings in the city have only added to the problem as the projects are running far behind schedule and are simply adding to the chaos on the road. “The main city road from Maharana Pratap Chowk to Haridwar road is dotted with potholes which proves hollow the tall claims of the government in improving road connectivity,” a resident added.

Kashipur's BJP legislator, Harbhajan Singh Cheema, when queried about the situation, said, “I assure that construction of the flyovers and other arterial roads will be completed this year, which will provide relief to residents.”

The ill-maintained park has turned into a den of anti-socials.

CHENNAI: A corporation park at Venkatrathinam Nagar, Adyar, has become a junk yard for old vehicles and a den for antisocial elements. A hotel nearby discards waste into the plot rendering it unusable for children and the elderly, for whom it was set up.

“The park now looks like a dump yard. Food waste and alcohol bottles are strewn all around. No one visits it now,” said K Akanksha, a homemaker and resident of the area.

Opposite the park is an urban community health centre where many pregnant women come for check-up. T Selvi, one of the patients, recalled an incident when two drunk men got into an ugly brawl, broke bottles on the road and stopped an ambulance. “They were joined by their friends. We had to call the police to bring the situation under control. It took 15 minutes for the ambulance to enter the main road which is only a few metres away,” she said.

Caretaker of the hospital said he locks himself in at night. “The moment it gets dark, you can find thugs in the park, drink and shout abuses. They sometimes try to pick fights with me so I stay locked inside the hospital,” he said.

Last year, the Venkatrathinam Residents Association spent more than Rs 1 lakh to redevelop the park. They installed swings, slides, benches and laid a small walking track. “For at least two months, we pooled in funds from all residents and maintained the park. But one month ago, we found old vehicles dumped inside the park and slowly things became worse,” said Shanthi Kamalasekaran, a resident. “We have asked corporation officials to develop this into a proper park, but nothing has happened,” she said.

Zonal officer N Thirumurugan said vehicles were dumped by a local police station. “They are all seized vehicles. Officers said they have no other space to keep them. But I have requested them to take it away,” he said. “This issue was not brought to our notice so far, but we will do the needful.”

LUCKNOW: An adult tigress was found dead in Kattaiya range of Kishenpur wildlife sanctuary of Dudhwa Tiger Reserve on Wednesday morning. The carcass was found by beat staff patrolling the area around 7.30am.

“We have got the veterinarian and other staff to investigate. We did not disturb the carcass till afternoon so that we could collect enough evidence,” said director of Dudhwa Tiger Reserve Sanjay Pathak. Prima facie, it appeared to be a case of infighting. The carcass was intact with no organs missing or mutilated. It was found lying inside the jungle in the core area of the reserve.

A postmortem examination report said the feline, aged about 10 years, died of a punctured trachea. Some of its ribs were also fractured. The flesh around the neck was ripped and had canine marks. Pugmarks of a tiger and blood were also found around the carcass. Besides, the claws of the dead feline had flesh of another tiger.

“We looked for the other tiger assuming it would be injured too but could not locate it. We will put up camera traps and try to locate it,” said the official. The viscera of the dead feline was sent to IVRI, Bareilly, for further investigation. Toxicological and histopathological reports would throw more light on the cause of the death of the feline.

277,['20/02/2020'],Kolkata: TBM modified to avoid Bowbazar repeat,"This story is from February 20, 2020

KMRC has razed 23 buildings in Bowbazar for extensive grouting

KOLKATA: TBM Urvi, which is completing the job left half-done by its twin Chundee after hitting an aquifer, has been refurbished in the most advanced way. Even if it hits a water pocket of sand aquifer, there will be no water seepage into the tunnel.

Chundee, the machine that was digging the west-bound tunnel of East-West Metro, hit an aquifer on August 31 and water started gushing into the tunnel, leading to large-scale subsidence in Bowbazar. Since Chundee has become defunct, Urvi will complete the rest of the eastward tunneling and then burrow the 800m of tunneling left unfinished by Chundee.

The seal of Chundee’s tail skin brush went off when it was boring a sand aquifer that contained large volume of water. Before Urvi started digging on Tuesday, it was fitted with new tail seal brushes, additional grease supply lines, cover plates for tail skin gap, extra grout holes and Bullflex seals for emergency sealing of any leaks.

Officials said that stringent monitoring schedule is being adopted to complete the rest of the tunneling. Twenty-one additional boreholes were drilled at the Bowbazar area for more detailed soil profiling and strengthening has been done accordingly. The strengthening measures included pressure-grouting and TAM grouting, which have considerably improved the soil strength.

While tunnelling is on, more frequent measurement of deformities within the soil will be carried out. There is improved coordination between the field staff and officials for quicker reaction times to prevent any untoward incident. While TBM Urvi digs through its own path, special care will be taken to inspect the tunnel lining around the affected TBM (Chundee) in the subsidence zone of Bowbazar, where 23 damaged house have now been razed. The ground remediation, officials said, will help in the foundation of buildings that will come up in the area once the two TBMs are pulled out through a retrieval shaft.

In case any severe distortion or movement observed after reaching down 14m to the location where Chundee is lying idle, the affected tunnel linings will be carefully replaced by providing temporary support.

PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The delay in installing a height restrictor on Babasaheb Ambedkar Road and the poor implementation of the heavy vehicle ban has increased traffic congestion on the stretch, which is in the Khadki Cantonment Board-limits.

Motorists coming from Pimpri Chinchwad via the old Pune-Mumbai highway use the Babasaheb Ambedkar Road to go to Vishrantwadi, Yerawada and Pune-Ahmednagar Road.

Manish Anand, an elected member of KCB, said, “The heavy vehicle ban on Ambedkar Road was approved in the 1990s but was not implemented effectively. The board installed a height restrictor before the PMPML bus terminus nine years ago after a student was killed in an accident while riding pillion with her mother. The height restrictor was damaged within a few months and it has not been replaced till now.”

Pramod Kumar Singh, KCB’s CEO, said the cantonment officials and elected members had raised these issues at a recent meeting convened by Pune MP Girish Bapat. “We have demanded the traffic police’s permission to install the height restrictor,” he said. Suresh Kamble, chairman of KCB’s finance committee, said, “There is a need for effective ban on heavy vehicles to reduce the daily congestion and pollution.” Kamlesh Chaskar, an elected member, said there was a need for effective implementation of P1 and P2 parking in Khadki bazaar.

A commuter Anand Kale said motorists faced daily congestion on Ambedkar Road Prasad Akkanouru, DCP traffic, said the KCB had made various demands to reduce congestion, which the traffic police were considering.

PALLIPALAYAM ( NAMAKKAL ): Overflowing garbage bins and piles of waste on roadsides are a common sight in all the panchayats in Pallipalayam taluk, where sanitary workers’ shortage has affected the overall cleanliness of the area.

According to the local residents, it has been more than two weeks since sanitary workers have turned up to empty the overflowing garbage bins and clean the waste that has piled up along roadsides.

TOI had on Tuesday visited Avuthipalayam , Ottamethai, Matheswaran Koil, Chinnarpalayam and Tharkadu panchayats and they all had the same story to tell.

A Shanthi, of Avuthipalayam, said, “The last time when I saw any sanitary worker in my area was around two weeks ago. As the don’t come for door-to-door collection, we are left with no other option but to dump garbage on street corners.”

Most residents admitted that sanitary workers were not turning up for door-to-door garbage collection.

Social activist A Aadhavan said instead of clearing the garbage, sanitary workers were just setting that on fire on roadsides or where ever that was dumped. “As a result, smoke envelop the entire residential areas, causing respiratory problems to the residents. Also, foul smell fills the air.”

The activist said many private hospitals in Erode city were also dumping medical waste in those panchayats, as they were situated close to that city. “Pallipalayam shares its border with Erode city. On one side is the Cauvery, while Erode is on the other side.”

A sanitary worker said there were only 12 of them to cover all the panchayats, which together have a population of more than 2,400 families. According to him, sanitary workers are paid a meagre Rs 2,600 a month as salary. “So, our daily wage comes around just Rs 87. Each one has to cover at least 100 houses that too with push carts to collect garbage. Then, we have to travel another 4km to take the garbage to the segregating place. How could one expect us to do all that daily for just Rs 87?”

When contacted, block development officer (village panchayats) S David Amalraj said he has been doing his best to manage the crisis with the available manpower. “They are all temporary workers. If I scold them for not collecting garbage a day, they won’t turn up for work the next day. I will, however, look into the issue with all its seriousness.”

Vasoya also scoffed at Sitharaman saying she is sure to get a ‘gold medal’ in tall empty talks.

Reacting to Vasoya’s jibe, BJP spokesman Raju Dhruv said, “Sitharaman had expressed a possibility that coronavirus can be reason for price hike because if it hits China’s economy, it will have a spiralling effect on India too. Congress MLAs are using such derogatory language out of frustration.”

Delhi government is likely to take an “early decision” on the prosecution sanction against former JNSU preside... Read More

NEW DELHI: Delhi government is likely to take an “early decision” on the prosecution sanction against former JNSU president Kanhaiya Kumar and nine others in a sedition case.

Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal told reporters on Wednesday: “I don’t have a say in the department concerned (home). I cannot change their decision, but will ask them to decide as soon as possible.” The CM’s comments come hours after a court directed Delhi government to file a status report by April 3 on the issue.

Delhi Police had booked Kanhaiya and nine others for “sedition” for allegedly raising anti-India slogans during an event on JNU campus in February 2016. The file is “under examination” in the home department, which is yet to take a final decision.

The Code of Criminal Procedure lays down that for offences against the state (like waging war against the government, sedition etc), the court cannot take cognisance of the police chargesheet without the sanction of the home department of the state concerned. In this case, police have invoked Section 124A of IPC relating to the charge of sedition against Kanhaiya and other students.

Delhi government has often questioned the urgency of Delhi Police in filing an “incomplete chargesheet without obtaining the prior sanction of the competent authority”. The home department had earlier pointed out that the investigating agency (Delhi Police) had sought its approval only after filing the chargesheet in the court.

While hearing the case, the court also directed police to send a reminder to the government seeking requisite sanctions to prosecute Kumar. The court passed the directions after police submitted that permission to prosecute Kumar and others had not been granted yet and the letter requesting sanction was pending with Delhi government.

On January 14, the police had filed a chargesheet in the court against Kumar and others, including former JNU students Umar Khalid and Anirban Bhattacharya, stating that they were leading a procession and supported the seditious slogans raised on the campus during an event on February 9, 2016.

Mumbai: The crime branch had prior information about gangster Abu Salem’s specific plan to kill music baron Gulshan Kumar , former city police chief Rakesh Maria has said in his book ‘Let me say it now’.

Gulshan Kumar got protection. “Both the protectors and protectee relaxed.” Their sloth and complacency were punished by the patient underworld...,” the book said.

Maria was posted in the director general’s office when he got a call from an informant on the night of April 22, 1997, indicating a plot to kill Kumar. Asked who was behind it, the informant said, ‘Abu Salem’. The gangster had also finalised his plan with his shooters and was to kill Kumar on his way to the Shiva temple he visited every day.

In the morning, Maria called film director Mahesh Bhatt who confirmed with Kumar if he indeed visited the temple daily. Bhatt conveyed the information to Kumar. Maria told Bhatt he would inform the crime branch and Kumar should not step out of home before he gets protection. The crime branch extended protection to Kumar.

On August 12, 1997, Kumar was shot dead while coming out of the Shiva temple. Maria learnt that the protection had been withdrawn after the Uttar Pradesh police commandos provided protection to Kumar’s cassette factory in Noida.

285,['20/02/2020'],Nilgiris to develop fire-line-scrapping to curb forest fire,"This story is from February 20, 2020

Udhagamandalam: The forest department has started to develop fire-line-scrapping, wherein it will remove vegetation for six metres surrounding every block of 10 hectares, in the Nilgiris forest division to curb the spread of forest fire.

The move comes close on the heels of the forest department successfully trying out the method in Korakundha forest area that caught fire a week ago. The fire-line-scrapping was also employed near Lovedale on Tuesday when forest fire broke out in a private land there.

Saravana kumar, assistant conservator of forests, said 10 hectares of forest land was completely destroyed in the fire at Korakundha forest area. “The fire spread to Korakundha forest from Kerala forest as dried grass was present between the two forest areas. Hence, we proposed the plan to develop fire-line-scrapping across the Nilgiris division of forests to prevent such incidents in future,” he said.

Meanwhile, in view of the prevailing dry season in the Nilgiris and especially in forest areas, a mock drill on fire prevention and firefighting will be conducted for forest staff attached to the Nilgiris division of forests soon, the assistant conservator of forest said.

With the dry winter weather still prevailing, forests in the Nilgiris, including the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve, have gone dry. Normally, February and March are the months when forest fire occurs in the mountain district due to the long dry spell.

Gulshan Kumar

MUMBAI: The crime branch had prior information about gangster Abu Salem ’s specific plan to kill music baron Gulshan Kumar , former city police chief Rakesh Maria has said in his book ‘Let me say it now’.

Gulshan Kumar got protection. “Both the protectors and protectee relaxed.” Their sloth and complacency were punished by the patient underworld...,” the book said.

Maria was posted in the director general’s office when he got a call from an informant on the night of April 22, 1997, indicating a plot to kill Kumar. Asked who was behind it, the informant said, ‘Abu Salem’. The gangster had also finalised his plan with his shooters and was to kill Kumar on his way to the Shiva temple he visited every day.

In the morning, Maria called film director Mahesh Bhatt who confirmed with Kumar if he indeed visited the temple daily. Bhatt conveyed the information to Kumar. Maria told Bhatt he would inform the crime branch and Kumar should not step out of home before he gets protection. The crime branch extended protection to Kumar.

On August 12, 1997, Kumar was shot dead while coming out of the Shiva temple. Maria learnt that the protection had been withdrawn after the Uttar Pradesh police commandos provided protection to Kumar’s cassette factory in Noida.

The book also speaks of Maria alerting the crime branch in 1996 of a plan to kill union leader Datta Samant. He was shot dead on January 16, 1997.

NEW DELHI: A few office bearers of Jamia Millia Islamia who are suspected to having leaked CCTV footage of Dr Zakir Husain library , which was posted on social media, are likely to be questioned by the Special Investigation Team of Crime Branch.An initial probe has revealed that the videos were uploaded by someone from Jamia Nagar, possibly to derail the probe. A police team that questioned a few students on Tuesday has zeroed in on a few suspects seen in the footage. Efforts are being made to track them.Police sources said that the videos were case property and copies of it were kept with the Jamia authorities to conduct an internal inquiry to identify people from the crowd who had entered the university. Senior officers said that while an inquiry is under way to identify the securitymen who had beaten students with lathis, releasing the video to an unauthorised group would affect the course of the investigation.On Sunday, the Jamia authorities had denied making the videos public. A separate FIR might be registered if foul play to help the miscreants is established.Earlier, the 17 youths who were arrested after the violence had told police that some student leaders had told them that they could take shelter in the university premises since police were not allowed to enter the campus without permission. It is suspected that the rioters, who had set fire to DTC buses and pelted stones at private cars on Mathura Road on December 15, had mingled with the students and entered the campus when cops chased them.Police scanned through the clips showing a few suspects rushing into the library.

292,['20/02/2020'],"Bhopal gas tragedy: CBI traces ex-Carbide official in Nagpur, brings him to court","This story is from February 20, 2020

BHOPAL: Shakeel Qureshi , the only local Union Carbide official facing criminal proceedings in the Bhopal gas tragedy, has been arrested by CBI. He was the shift in-charge that fateful night, and the only ‘eyewitness’.

He was missing ever since a court convicted all the accused in June 2009. The court of Bhopal district judge, which is hearing appeals of those convicted, had asked CBI to trace him and produce him in court, failing which the CBI SP was asked to present himself before the judge.

Qureshi was traced to Nagpur by CBI and brought to Bhopal in an ambulance on Wednesday as he is paralysed and bedridden. District and sessions judge, R K Verma went to the ambulance himself to see his condition, and granted him bail on medical grounds.

Qureshi, who was a supervisor at the Union Carbide factory in Bhopal, was the shift in-charge on the intervening night of December 2-3 when deadly MIC gas leaked into the atmosphere and turned Bhopal into a gas chamber .

Eight Union Carbide of India (UCIL) officials, including Qureshi, were put on trial on criminal charges. Qureshi was the only one who was a regular at the hearings at the chief judicial magistrate’s (CJM) court. The other accused had received exemption from personal appearance at the outset of trial.

Qureshi was seen in court on the day of verdict in June 2010. He was handed a suspended sentence of two years, like all the other accused, and released on bail.

He vanished after that and stopped attending hearings of the case in the appellate court of district and sessions judge, where both CBI and the convicts had filed appeals against the CJM court order. While CBI prayed for tougher punishment, the convicts sought acquittal.

Qureshi’s absence didn’t raise eyebrows initially since he was on bail and it was not mandatory for him to be present in court. But then, the counsel for two of the accused in the case, Anarbon Roy , started arguing in court that the only person who “knew the whole truth” was Qureshi since he was “present in the MIC room when the gas leaked”.

Bhopal district and sessions judge, R K Verma, asked CBI to trace Qureshi and bring him to court. An arrest warrant was also issued.

On his arrival in court on Wednesday, it was revealed that Qureshi had shifted to Nagpur with his family, where he had started a business. He is bedridden after suffering a stroke.

The judge, after examining his condition, granted him bail on medical grounds on personal bonds of Rs 1 lakh each and payment of a penalty of Rs 10,000.

Udhagamandalam: The Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR) in the Nilgiris has planned to transport water through tankers to refill waterholes in the forest to cater to wild animals if the dry spell continues beyond February.

Deputy director of MTR (core region) Shenbagapriya said, “The amount of water available inside MTR is manageable till February-end. In case of no rain, precautionary measures are being taken to fill waterholes in the reserve to cater to the animals.”

Based on the requirement, water will be transported through tankers to refill the waterholes in the reserve. Arrangements in this connection are underway, she said.

Besides 50 artificial ponds, there are around 209 small waterbodies located within the core area of MTR which are facilitated by natural streams. The ponds were desilted recently. The hills received adequate rain during the north-east monsoon. Majority of them have sufficient water, according to the official.

She added, “Keeping in mind the dry season, we had cleared the fire-lines running through the core area of the reserve to protect wildlife from forest fire. Anti-poaching watchers, fire-watchers, foresters and forest guards have been provided with walkie-talkies and wireless instruments so that forest fires could be reported instantly to take immediate measures”.

In a bid to tackle the forest-fire much effectively, tools such as blowers, sprayers and helmets have already been procured, the official said.

According to her, constant patrolling is underway in the MTR. Almost all debris of dry leaves on the sides of road are being cleared off to minimize forest fire. NH 67 runs through the MTR to a stretch of about 20km.

Usually March and April are the critical period for the reserve due to dry spell.

“Accordingly, the situation in the reserve vis-à-vis water and forest-fire is being reviewed for action periodically,” Shenbagapriya said.

Besides home to over 80 tigers, MTR is abode for several species of wild animals including leopard, Indian guar, elephants, sloth bear and hyena.

Vande Bharat Express, the first indigenous train of Railways that runs between Varanasi and New Delhi

LUCKNOW: Vande Bharat Express, the first indigenous train of Railways that runs between Varanasi and New Delhi and recently completed a year in service, may be diversified into a “long-route train without compromising on the comfort of passengers”.

The debut train set that rolled out in 2018 — earning it the sobriquet T-18 — was flagged off by the PM in February 2019, and had chair cars. The research wing of Indian Railways, RDSO in Lucknow, has reworked specifications of the train “for the better”. “In the future, T-18 may also have sleeper coaches. Passengers cannot be expected to sit through longer journeys,” a source at RDSO said.

Although the 44 new train sets that ICF will manufacture this year will have chair cars for now, given the revised specifications, it does not limit T-18 from diversifying into sleeper coaches as and when it is introduced on longer routes.

“In a sleeper coach, the load is not distributed equally as one side has more berths. The train might tilt to one side while running at high speed. The load, therefore, needs to be equally distributed in the underframe of the coach,” a source said, adding that the new specifications would allow the train save 20% journey time. The train sets with sleeper coaches may be called T-20, but will retain the same speed.

297,['20/02/2020'],From creating dreams to playing them out,"This story is from February 20, 2020

<p><br>Gautham Vasudev Menon</p>

Chennai: They began their film careers creating dreams from behind the camera. Now, they find they are equally adept in front of it, in a career they feel is as challenging as the first.

Gautham Vasudev Menon — who earlier appeared in a song or two in his films and lent his baritone to characters like Ilamaran in ‘Vettaiyaadu Vilaiyaadu’ or Pandiya in ‘Kaakha Kaakha’ — Karu Pazhaniappan, Mysskin, Samuthirakani, M Sasikumar and Ram among others are all finding acting exciting.

While directing a movie is no child’s play, particularly given the quality of today’s filmmaking — ask any of the multitudes of actors who took up the megaphone and gave it up after realising it was a tough task — there are twin benefits for directors who turn actors. Instead of wallowing in gloom after a few flops, which are inevitable, they get to make quick money; and, best of all, get to remain in the public eye.

Pazhaniappan, who was encouraged to don the grease paint by director Sundar C, says the media glare is on actors every time. ""They wait for an actor to come out of his residence, so they can get hot news. Where do we figure?"" Pointing out that he was approached to act in a film that is to be released this May, and not vice versa, Pazhaniappan says, ""Playing an antagonist, I can vouch it’s a ticket for success, though I have experienced the same as a director… A director loses his time if his work is not appreciated, although I must say that it’s not like I have quit direction. I can always go back to my roots.""

Gautham Menon, whose ‘Trance’ with Fahadh Faasil is in theatres this week, says most of the movies in which he acted had his friends as directors. ""Dhanush wanted me to be part of ‘Power Paandi,’ and Dulquer Salmaan was adamant I share the screen space in ‘Kannum Kannum Kollaiyadithaal.’ Stating that acting is less stressful, Menon says, ""I don’t have to worry about next day’s shoot and write my script in between shots. It de-stresses me, it’s a win-win situation. My family though insists I do less of acting and more of direction.""

Direction is a high pressure job, with one having to put up with star tantrums, keeping the crew together and handling unexpected situations, but many of those who have earned a name for themselves continue to opt to be in front of the camera. Why? Learning new things and engaging with others from the industry, says director-actor Samuthirakani, is the key to survival. ""My first love is direction, but I have worked in amazing projects like ‘Visaranai’, ‘Vada Chennai’ and ‘Subramaniapuram’. Simultaneously, I write dialogues, engage in dubbing and think about my next project. Keeping my mind busy and fresh.""

Manobala, who has acted in more than 950 films after making his debut as a director in the 1980s, says acting is easier. The industry too has changed. ""Young talent coupled with realistic cinema has taken it to a different level. I am not sure if the movies we did in the past would have received the recognition they did if made today. Besides, in today’s times, it’s an enjoyable experience to be an actor. I do what I am asked to perform, nothing more, nothing less.""

Having become an actor thanks to director Shankar, who got a sense of his sense of humour after seeing him at a gathering, Manobala says co-stars like Santhanam, Yogi Babu, Vadivelu and himself have given innumerable hits in a few years. ""I am content and wish to take up challenging roles in the future as well, he says, adding that Shankar’s upcoming ‘Indian 2’ has him essaying playing a unique role.

Until as late as the 1980s, directors were mostly invisible, with stalwarts like K Balachander, C V Sridhar, A C Tirulokchandar, Balu Mahendra, Mahendran and Panchu Arunachalam content in their space and satisfied with bringing out hidden talent. Even the celebrated Mani Ratnam, who managed to work wonders with the millennials, opted not to face the camera.

The new trend may also have to do with the reality that down south one needn’t have to be like an Arvind Swamy, an Ajith or a Surya to be a ‘hero’. Average looks with an aptitude for learning will do. The young directors who have opted to act are aware of this and are willing to walk the extra mile for success.

This has now been exempted,” the official said.“People would be reluctant to install lifts in residential buildings in several cases as the height for the floors had to be reduced.

Teesta Setalvad

NEW DELHI: Rights activist Teesta Setalvad ’s address at Shaheen Bagh became a subject of controversy after BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya alleged that she was “tutoring” the women protesters .

Malviya tweeted a 2.16-minute video with the caption: “Teesta Setalvad tutoring Shaheen Bagh protesters on what questions to ask the interlocutors, appointed by the Supreme Court... See how organic and spontaneous this movement is?”

The video shows Setalvad standing beside a woman in a pink hijab facing a sea of women. The woman narrates some questions that they want the interlocutors to address.

“Will changing the style or kind of protest change or weaken it? Who will guarantee safety of the protesters at another location? What do we have to say about the problems being faced by some people because of road closure?” the woman on the mic is heard asking. She also asks if opening one carriageway of the road is a possible solution. Setalvad then asks the women if the questions are okay.

Although Setlavad was unavailable for a comment despite repeated attempts by TOI, her organisation, Citizens for Justice and Peace (CJP), shared her response to Malviya’s allegations.

“The disgusting attempts by some pro-BJP and government TV channels to dare suggest malicious motives in CJP’s involvement in a pre-mediation process is nothing short of a despicable and desperate attempt to deny Shaheen Bagh women protesters their agency. Can anyone dare suggest that women who have sat through Delhi’s bitter cold for 65 days be tutored? It’s demeaning and a diversion,” CJP quoted Setalvad.

Women protesters agreed with Setalvad’s assessment of “infantilising” them. “We have sat here for over two months day and night. We know why we are here to protest. I wish people would not think we don’t know why we are here or we don’t know what to do,” said a protester.

“It is an open forum. Anyone can come to speak to the women protesters. Teestaji came yesterday and said she would come today too. She is a big person. She said she will ask the women some questions. We said okay,” the protester added.

AHMEDABAD: Faculty members at the B J Medical college fear that the college is set to lose nearly 100 postgraduate seats this year, if 70-odd faculty members are not transferred back to the college in time because the PG inspection by the Union government in Gujarat colleges is round the corner.

These faculty members were transferred in the last four months from the government colleges, where students study on subsidized fees, to those government colleges which are self-financed and run by the Gujarat Medical Education and Research Society (GMERS) across the state. These transfers took place when the National Medical Commission conducting inspection in medical colleges for undergraduate courses.

A senior faculty member at the BJ Medical College said that there are more than 250 teachers from different colleges, who were transferred to GMERS-run colleges but they have not been transferred back to their original workplace, though PG inspection is due now. “If BJ Medical College does not get its regular faculty members back, the college may lose nearly 100 PG seats in next academic session. This is because the seats are allotted in ratio of availability of faculty members,” he said.

Various representations have been made for restoring the transferred medical teachers to their original place, but the senior members think that the process has met a bureaucratic hurdle.

Sources said that the political pressure has worked in transfers, particularly in Bhavnagar medical college. “Because of intervention of BJP chief Jitu Vaghani, the administration transferred back all 27 faculty members who were shifted ,” sources in health department said.

Tirupur: The 47th edition of three-day ‘India International Knit Fair’ which concluded on Wednesday saw buyers from across the globe come down to Tirupur scouting for quality garments.

According to Apparel Export Promotion Council (AEPC), buyers from Sri Lanka, Mauritius, the UAE, Sharjah, the US, the UK, Bangladesh, Europe and Canada visited the fair. Sponsored by the Union textile ministry, the fair was organized by the AEPC. Thirty-nine leading exporters from Tirupur, Coimbatore, Chennai, and Kolkata displayed their products in the fair.

AEPC said the exporters were overwhelmed with the response and hope that the fair would yield business deals to the tune of Rs 300 crore.

The fair had summer/winter collections in knitwear, space dyed yarn garments, cotton, polyester, poly cotton, polyester-viscose blended fabric apparels, special garments made from banana cotton blend. The banana cotton blend with 80%cotton and 20%banana fibre with an inherent property of offering comfort, particularly attracted the buyers, according to AEPC. Garments with reverse print, cold pigment dyed, 3D print, acid spray styles, tie and dyed, bio washed, enzyme washed were also showcased.

Chairman of India Knit Fair Association A Sakthivel noted that the fair was organized in the backdrop of the current scenario where China’s trade is affected due to COVID-19, the UK has detached itself from the European Union and Vietnam and Cambodia are exempted from import duty due to Free Trade Agreement.

“This is expected to make India a preferred market for buyers from western countries. Also, countries which were depending on China have learnt a lesson that they should have an alternate market for sourcing,’’ he said. tnn

Representative image

NAINITAL: The Uttarakhand high court (HC) on Wednesday directed the district judge of Chamoli and district magistrate (DM) to send a team to investigate the allegations made by the inmates of the district jail against the warder.

The HC had taken suo motu cognizance of a letter written by a group of prisoners who alleged that the warder had brutally beaten up several prisoners and in some cases even draped them in blanket and then used a stick to deal severe blows on their feet. The letter signed by 26 prisoners also said that the warder doesn’t even allow them to perform basic activities such as puja and if his orders are not followed, the inmates are again harassed. The inmates alleged that the harassment and physical torture was very common in the jail and several inmates were on the verge of committing suicide.

The bench of Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan and Justice Ramesh Chandra Khulbe did not agree with the state government’s submission that several officials visit the jail continuously and no atrocities have been reported from the jail. “The complaint which has been treated as PIL has been signed by 26 inmates. We may not therefore be justified in brushing aside the allegations,” the court said.

In its order, the court added that the jailor who is alleged to have committed such an act would hardly admit to it and therefore the district judge should “depute a senior official along with the secretary, district legal services authority to visit Chamoli jail and interact with inmates and also those who signed the letter”.

The DM and the judge have been ordered to submit the report within three weeks and the court said that orders have to be handed over to them by a special messenger of HC.

306,['20/02/2020'],Mobilise people for tomorrow’s CAA rally: Goa church to parishes,"This story is from February 20, 2020

Representative image

PANAJI: After having asked the Centre to revoke Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ), the Goa church has upped the ante and issued a diktat to all parish priests to mobilise parishioners for an anti-CAA rally on Friday.

In a letter to all the parishes sent on Tuesday, the church has asked priests to announce the date of meeting at daily masses and encourage parishioners to come out in support of the agitation.

“Our fight to oppose CAA/ NPR/ NRC and to demand that it be revoked unconditionally continues both at the state as well as the national level,” said the letter to the parishes.

Ten days earlier, archbishop of Goa and Daman Filipe Neri Ferrao released a strongly worded statement appealing to the Centre to “immediately and unconditionally revoke the CAA and desist from implementing the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the National Population Register”. “The very fact that the CAA uses religion goes against the secular fabric of the country,” Ferrao had said.

Tuesday’s letter said that ‘Goa Alliance Against CAA-NRC-NPR’ is organising the rally and it would be followed by a public meeting at 3.30pm on Friday.

“The rally is not organised by the church and the other two organisations that held the last two rallies at Margao and Fatorda. The church through the Council for Social Justice and Peace has only extended support towards mobilisation of people for the rally,” Fr Savio Fernandes, executive secretary of the church body, told TOI.

“We sent out the letters on Tuesday to all parish priests and chaplains asking to mobilise parishioners,” he said.

The rally will be flagged off from Parade Grounds at Campal and will culminate at Azad Maidan with a public meeting.

Earlier in his statement, the archbishop had said the NRC and the NPR exercises would result in “a direct victimisation” of the underprivileged classes, who will “suddenly run the risk of becoming stateless and candidates for detention camps in their teeming millions”.

In response, chief minister Pramod Sawant had said he would meet the archbishop to convince him that CAA did not hurt any sections of society.

“It is observed, sadly, that these initiatives issuing forth from the government are forecasting a systematic erosion of the values, principles and rights which have been guaranteed to all citizens under our Constitution, and which citizens are called to protect and promote,” Ferrao had said.

Dehradun: The Dehradun Municipal Corporation (DMC) has become the first civic body in the state to be recognised with an ODF (open defecation free) Double Plus grade.

The ODF Double Plus grade will add extra 500 points in the municipal corporation’s kitty during the final evaluation of the Swachh Survekshan Survey 2020.

A team from the Centre had come last month which found that the city has ample amounts of public toilets run by the municipal corporation. The team also found that there are many community toilets in the slum regions. The toilets have exhaust fans and clean sheets and are in a decent hygienic condition.

Civic commissioner Vinay Shankar Pandey said, “We are extremely glad to receive an ODF Double Plus Grade. Also, we are glad to become the first municipal corporation in Uttarakhand to receive such an honour. With this, we have gained an extra 500 points and this will help us in getting a good ranking in the Swachh Survekshan Survey 2020.”

He added that the distinction has been achieved due to the relentless effort of DMC staff, including the sanitation workers. “The condition of public toilets across all 100 wards is good and we will continue to work in order to make sure that Dehradun remains free of open defecation,” he said.

308,['20/02/2020'],FC Goa now set for tiki-taka with Asia’s elite clubs,"This story is from February 20, 2020

Panaji: In the end, it’s only fitting that the most entertaining and consistent team gets the honour to become the first Indian club to take part in the high-profile AFC Champions League.

FC Goa have had four top-four finishes in five seasons, made it to the final twice, became the first team to record 50 wins in the Indian Super League ( ISL ) and have now broken their own record of most goals—46—in the league stage.

Though the team has not yet emerged league champions, they now have a record they can be proud of.

Goa’s 5-0 demolition of Jamshedpur FC at the JRD Sports Complex—a place their fans call the Furnace—on Wednesday gave the league leaders an unassailable 39 points and the top spot at the end of the league stage.

For their efforts, they will receive Rs 50 lakh and a ‘Shield’ introduced by the organisers for the first time. But most importantly, Goa will become the first club from the country to take part in the AFC Champions League group stage next season.

“From the beginning it was one of the objectives of the club to reach the group stages of the (AFC) Champions League by coming first in the league. Finally, to match that objective is a great feeling,” said Goa’s interim coach Clifford Miranda.

In the past, several Indian clubs, including Goa’s record-setting Dempo SC, have qualified for the Champions League playoffs but have never managed to cross the hurdle. All of Asia’s best clubs take part in the Champions League, while the rest test their might in the AFC Cup, Asian football’s second-tier club competition.

The AFC Champions League is second only to the European club competitions in terms of prize money and in addition to the $1 million increase for the winner and the runners-up from last season, they will now get an extra $500,000 taking the purse to $2 million.

While all Indian clubs have played the AFC Cup—or European football’s equivalent to the Europa League—they have received nothing in return. In fact, Dempo once gave the competition a miss, despite qualifying, since it did not make financial sense.

The AFC Champions League will be different as clubs have plenty to gain. Apart from the thrill and glamour of rubbing shoulders with the best clubs from Asia, there are added financial incentives too.

A fee of $40,000 is paid per team for each match they participate. There is $50,000 on offer for a club winning their match in the group stage, $10,000 for a draw, $100,000 for reaching the knockout stage and $250,000 for reaching the semifinals.

A spot for an Indian club among the elite in Asian football was made possible by the Asian Football Confederation’s decision to increase the number of teams from 32 to 40 for next season.

According to tentative groupings, when the competition starts next season in January 2021, Goa could be up against the might of clubs from Iran, Uzbekistan, Qatar and the UAE. The level of competition will be much higher than what any Indian club has faced.

But, for a start, Goa will be happy by just being there.

After five frustrating attempts to book an Uber, the 24-year-old advertising professional learnt that app-based commuting services were anything but dependable.College student Honey Verma’s Ola bike taxi experience was intimidating. The 18-year-old was abandoned in the middle of nowhere for mildly protesting against rash driving. And that after the bike taxi nearly ploughed into a shop wall.These are not stray incidents. In fact, they are fairly routine going by concerns raised by several app cab users on social media platforms. From being quizzed by drivers about destination and mode of payment to watching the cab circle on the map and incurring penalty as rogue drivers take eternity to arrive — every second user has a complaint to voice. In 2018, the New Delhi government had proposed a policy to impose a fine of Rs 25,000 on taxi aggregators for violation of trust.. In the absence of a monitoring mechanism, app cab riders in UP face harassment on a daily basis.“I was booking a cab home to Krishnanagar from Hazratganj around 11pm. The driver called to know my drop location and said he was coming, but five minutes later he cancelled the trip. Five more drivers did the same. I got sixth time lucky,” Sanjana told TOI. She said most drivers, planning to call it a day, look for riders who live closer to their homes.Honey who goes to college on Faizabad Road and depends on bike taxis said most drivers had their temper on a short fuse.Anushree Gupta, an Ola regular, said the taxi aggregator recently charged her for a trip she never took. “I tried booking a ride thrice, wasted an hour doing so and was made to pay even though my trips were cancelled. To top it all, the customer service was pathetic,” the Aashiana resident said, adding that often drivers ditched riders once they realised the payment mode was online.Uber acknowledged receiving an email from TOI, but didn’t answer the queries made. Contacted over WhatsApp, an official on November 22 said “someone from the team will shortly get in touch”, which didn’t happen.

GAYA: Suspected Maoists blew up a government school building in Gaya ’s Banke Bazar area late on Tuesday night and anti-NRC pamphlets were found at the spot, police said.

Gaya SSP Rajiv Mishra said, “Nobody was injured in the blast that razed the empty school building.” Hand-written pamphlets have been recovered, which bear slogans against “Brahminvadi, Hindutvavadi fascist BJP government,” and question the “occupation” of school buildings by security forces.

A CRPF contingent was stationed at the school until recently. “A team of 153 Battalion of CRPF had been camping here since March 18 last year when Naxals had carried out an attack ahead of the Lok Sabha polls. They had been putting up at the Sonedaha High School and shifted to a camp on February 08,” Mishra said.

“Three rooms were substantially damaged in the blast. About two dozen heavily armed Maoists were involved in the activity. More than 15 members of the squad took positions on the village outskirts to take on security forces, if they reached the blast site and the remaining activists triggered the blast.

Sharad Yadav

PATNA: Days after meeting incarcerated RJD chief Lalu Prasad in Ranchi, Loktantrik Janta Dal (LJD) patron Sharad Yadav on Wednesday made it clear that he was not in the race to be the Mahagathbandhan’s CM face for the coming assembly polls and backed Tejashwi Prasad Yadav for the position.

The LJD leader had held a closed-door meeting last week with the heads of smaller constituents of the alliance —RLSP chief Upendra Kushwaha, HAM (S) chief Jitan Ram Manjhi and VIP chief Mukesh Sahni. The three senior leaders wanted Sharad to convey to Lalu their “concerns” over RJD’s “big brotherly” stand of unilaterally projecting Tejashwi as the alliance’s CM face.

Sharad, while making it clear that his political arena is New Delhi, hinted that he could take up the responsibility of heading the Mahagatbandhan’s coordination committee.

“For Vidhan Sabha election, Tejashwi’s name is for CM candidate as RJD is the biggest party and he (Tejashwi) is the leader of opposition. Many people talk about me as CM candidate, but for 43 years my politics has been confined to Delhi,” Sharad told mediapersons on Wednesday.

Advising the Mahagathbandhan parties to stay united, Sharad added, “Tejashwi is the opposition leader and others should come together and fight the assembly election together.”

Talking to TOI, the LJD leader admitted that his name is being discussed as the patron of the opposition alliance’s coordination committee. On his meeting Lalu he said, “Meeting with RJD chief Lalu Prasad on Saturday was regarding strengthening Mahagatbandhan.”

Sharad’s name started doing the rounds for CM post after reports saying some opposition leaders, including RLSP chief Upendra Kushwaha, were inclined towards Sharad as possible CM face. The closed-door meeting between Kushwaha, Sahni, Manjhi and Sharad without RJD and Congress further fuelled speculation regarding a drift in the Mahagatbandhan.

But after the Friday’s meeting, LJD state vice-president Binu Yadav had told TOI that the alliance leaders had come together to discuss the issue of co-ordination committee and wanted him to take up the responsibility. Even Sahni had said that Sharad was not interested in Bihar politics and had hinted that he was not averse to Tejashwi as the CM candidate of the Mahagathbandhan.

PONDA: Chief minister Pramod Sawant said on Wednesday that Goa would not have suffered atrocities from colonial rulers if Maratha king Shivaji had conquered Goa.

Sawant said the Maratha emperor had established his rule over major parts of Goa region and had he not to return (to Maharashtra) to sign a treaty with the Mughals, Goa would have been free 300 years earlier.

Following a long-drawn freedom struggle, Goa was liberated from the Portuguese rule in December 1961.

According to historical books, Shivaji was forced to sign the treaty on June 11, 1665 with a Rajput ruler Jai Singh I, who was a commander of the Mughal empire.

Under the treaty, it was agreed that if Shivaji wanted to claim the Konkan area including Goa, which was at that time under the Bijapur sultanate, he would have to pay 40 lakh hons to Mughals.

He said Shivaji had established the reign over five talukas of Goa, including Bardez, Pernem, Bicholim, Antruz Mahal (Ponda) and Salcete. However, he had to return under the treaty of Purandar.

Sawant said Shivaji was called king of the masses as he had members of all castes and religions in his cabinet.

He said while it was not possible to have a Shivaji-like reign, his government would try hard to imbibe some of the values in its governance.

“We will try our best to emulate his values and perform better,” he said at a state-level function held to celebrate Shivaji’s birth anniversary at Ponda.

After garlanding the horse ridden Shivaji statue at Farmagudi fortress, the chief minister also said a huge fort would be constructed at the fortress site. An exclusive gallery would be set at the renovated fort and all the historical documents available at the archaeology department would be brought here.

The work for the fort construction would start within a year, he said.

315,['20/02/2020'],Delhi high court bar calls for strike over judge’s transfer,"This story is from February 20, 2020

Justice S Muralidhar was appointed judge in Delhi high court on May 29, 2006.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court collegium headed by CJI S A Bobde has recommended the transfer of Justice S Muralidhar from Delhi high court, where he was appointed judge on May 29, 2006, to Punjab and Haryana high court , leading to protests from the Delhi high court bar association that called for a strike on Thursday.

Justice Muralidhar, who was part of the high court bench that first ordered decriminalisation of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code to give freedom of sexual expression to the LGBT community, is number three in seniority in his parent high court. If the government accepts the recommendation, he will be number two in seniority in Punjab and Haryana high court after Chief Justice Ravi Shanker Jha.

He had run into criticism from certain quarters for quashing the transit remand and directing release of rights activist Gautam Navlakha from house arrest on October 1, 2018, in the Koregaon Bhima case even when the matter was pending in the Supreme Court.

Last year, a bench headed by Justice Muralidhar had convicted 16 former policemen of Uttar Pradesh in the Hashimpura massacre case and also sent Congress’s Sajjan Kumar to jail in one of the anti-Sikh riots cases.

Expressing “shock” at the collegium recommending Justice Muralidhar’s transfer, the high court bar association hoped the decision would be recalled, saying such transfers were “detrimental” to the institution.

“Unequivocally and in the strongest possible terms, the Delhi high court bar association condemns the said transfers... Such transfers are not only detrimental to our noble institution but also tend to erode and dislodge the faith of the common litigant in the justice dispensation system. Such transfers also impede free and fair delivery of justice by the bench,” a resolution passed by the association said.

The association requested its members to abstain from work on Thursday “as a token of protest as the said transfer is a rarest of rare case, the majesty of our revered institution is at stake”.

However, sources said the judge’s consent was taken before issuing the transfer proposal.

The Supreme Court collegium, through cryptic notifications, also recommended the transfer of Justice Subramonium Prasad of Madras high court to Delhi high court. Justice Prasad, before his appointment as Madras high court judge on June 4, 2018, was practising as an advocate in the apex court.

It recommended transfer of Bombay high court’s Justice Ranjit V More to Meghalaya high court and Karnataka high court’s Justice R V Malimath to Uttarakhand. The collegium also recommended appointment of four judicial officers — I J Vora, Gita Gopi, Ashokkumar C Joshi and R M Sareen — as judges of Gujarat high court.

Mangaluru: Former mayor K Ashraf , who suffered a head injury during the December 19 Mangaluru violence, submitted his evidence in writing before Udupi deputy commissioner G Jagadeesha, who is heading the magisterial inquiry into the alleged police firing, on Wednesday.

Ashraf said in the 10-page submission before the Udupi DC, that he has explained what he had seen at the spot. “I reached there to convince the protesters at the request of city police commissioner P S Harsha. I submitted 15 CDs and a compilation of videos from various social media platforms. However, the magistrate refused to accept it, as they were not recorded by me, ” he said.

Jagadeesha told reporters that 204 people have made their submissions. Since a bandh was observed on February 13, public, police and the media were given another opportunity to submit videos before the court, based on the high court directive. On Wednesday, only Ashraf appeared and submitted his evidence in writing. The CDs and pen drive brought by him, were not accepted because he claimed in his affidavit that he had received the videos on his phone, and copied them into a CD at a cyber centre. Since we do not know the source of the videos, it cannot be used in the investigation. The inquiry is happening as per the Supreme Court’s guidelines. Those released on bail can come forward and submit their evidence during the hearing, he said.

Next hearing for police personnel

Jagadeesha said 12 police officers and staff will be given an opportunity to appear for the next hearing on February 25. Notices have been issued to the police through ACP (North) and nodal officer Belliappa K U to submit all the documents during the next hearing. City police commissioner Dr P S Harsha and DCP (law and order) Arunangshu Giri will be called separately. The statements of 176 policemen will be recorded as part of the inquiry, based on the list provided by the police. Meanwhile, the DC will submit the status report on the case to the high court on February 24. Jagadeesha said the police have submitted a pen drive with 50 video clips and one CD. The police had seized 23 DVRs that were submitted before the court, and the acknowledgement was presented here. As per the government order, a report on the inquiry will be submitted before March 23.

Jagadeesha said depending on the situation, if required, he would seek more time from the government. Following the December 19 violence and the death of Nauseen Kudroli,49, and Jaleel Bengre, 23, due to alleged police firing, the state government commissioned two probes, one magisterial and the other CID.

Madurai: The Madras high court has relaxed the bail condition of activist Mugilan in a rape case registered against him by the Karur CB-CID officials.

The case was registered against Mugilan alias Shanmugam under IPC Sections 417, 376 and Section 4 of the Tamil Nadu Prohibition of Harassment to Women Act, 2002, based on a complaint filed by a woman alleging that he had physical relationship with her after he promised to marry her. The case was later transferred to the CB-CID.

When Mugilan moved the high court Madurai bench seeking bail, the court on November 13, 2019, granted bail to him on condition that he should appear before the Karur CB-CID inspector of police once in two days at 10.30am until further orders.

In January, Mugilan had filed a petition seeking to relax his bail condition following which it relaxed the condition and directed him to appear before the police once a week.

Meanwhile, Mugilan once again moved the high court Madurai bench seeking to completely relax his bail condition. When the petition was heard on Wednesday, justice G R Swaminathan gave the direction relaxing the condition. TNN

HYDERABAD: In a bid to encourage more women in the pharma and life sciences sector, Primal Enterprises vice-chairperson Swati Piramal mooted the idea of setting up a National Commission for Women in Science to encourage over 100 million girls to excel in science and eventually emerge as leaders in this industry. She pointed out that Telangana being one of the leading states in the pharma and life sciences industry can take the lead in this area and set an example for other states as well.

“Telangana being one of the leaders in the lifescience industry, it could target million girls from science and get them from schools and work with teachers and parents … to make them leaders in this industry,” she said, while speaking on ‘Women in Life Sciences, Healthcare & Tech – The Journey From Aspire to Inspire’ at BioAsia 2020 here on Wednesday.

As per industry estimates, women constitute only about 10-15% of the workforce in the pharma and life sciences industry in India constitutes as compared to around 28% globally.

The other industry leaders such as Nivruti Rai, country head, Intel India, and Dr Christiane Hamacher, CEO, Biocon Biologics, too suggested that companies create a conducive ecosystem for women to thrive in their careers.

Rai pointed out that Intel had introduced 'Home to Office’ or ‘H2O’ initiative that brought women, who have been on a career break, back to work. As part of the programme, women are trained for a stipulated period and eventually given a chance to join the organisation.

Similarly, Dr Alenka Stefanic Petek, head of Sandoz Development Centre, India, spoke about how organizations are not just making a conscious effort to ensure diversity in their workforce but also ensuring that its service providers too follow the same by setting up benchmarks for them.

Facilities in over 150 nations export FDA-regulated products to the US

HYDERABAD: The US drug regulator, United States Food & Drug Administration ( USFDA ), indicated that the overall adherence to quality framework by Indian manufacturers has improved over the last couple of years.

“I think that if you are talking about difference from a few years ago, there has been an increase in maturity of quality systems…,” Dr Sarah McMullen, deputy director, USFDA India office, said on sidelines of BioAsia 2020 when asked about the performance of Indian firms.

McMullen added that FDA has been closely collaborating with the Indian drug regulator Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) and in many inspections, CDSCO officials join as observers. FDA conducted around 200 inspections last year in India, which supplies approximately 40% of the generics sold in the US.

The FDA official said that once pharma manufacturing units receive Form 483, they must respond to authority in “comprehensive thoughtful and realistic” manner within the stipulated time of 15 days, following which they can fix the problem.

“So, if you are facing regulatory action, you need to be open and transparent in your communication to the agency … your responses are read comprehensively by the agency…you have to make a response within 15 days to 483, you do not have to fix everything in 15 days. So, I think that is a misconception… so sometimes people want to look at short-term fix or something and that might not be the most appropriate thing …,” she said while participating in a panel discussion on ‘Meeting the Quality Imperative’.

HYDERABAD: A significant number of Indians are now making their way to Uruguay with the growth of the IT sector in the Latin American country. A similar time zone as the United States has also made the country an attractive location for companies who are now scaling up their hiring. At present, around 1,000 Indians currently work in Uruguay, up from 300 in past three years according to industry insiders. Almost 50% of this workforce is Telugu.One of the reasons for this increase in hiring is down to US-based clients looking to outsource work to ‘near-shore’ centres. Near-shore centres allow companies under similar time zones to work together to make communication faster, a recent shift from the traditional off-shore or on-site axis.At a time when many countries are moving towards protectionist measures, Uruguay comes as a breath of fresh air for many Telugus looking for international exposure. “Uruguay has become a destination which can cater to EST, CST and IST,” says Bairaboena Niranjan, who has worked in Uruguay for three years with TCS.With tech biggies such as TCS, IBM, Deloitte present in Montevideo and Google soon to open its Latin American data centre, hiring in Uruguay is said to be on an upswing. “This is one of the safest places. There is a lot of potential for growth and no restrictions,” says Raghunath Rao Buddineni who works with a tech giant in Montevideo.Having lived for four years in the Uruguayan capital, Jaswanth Reddy also agrees that it offers a peaceful and an easier way of life. “While the pay is less than the US, so are the costs. The quality of life is unparalleled. That there is almost no pollution and serene landscapes makes it a place to look forward to,” he says.Cost of living is an important draw for many, says Telangana Information Technology Association (Tita) president Sundeep Kumar Makthala. “Accommodation for a paying guest, including food, can be as little as Rs 25,000 which is ideal for freshers. Indian food too is easily available,” he says. Starting salaries range from between Rs 50,000 to Rs 60,000 a month. A Uruguay peso amounts to just a shade under Rs 2. Industry experts say that given the IT sector’s nascence in the country, there are very few people at the senior levels thus offering a better scope for growth.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74222610,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-268728,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/montevideo-the-new-calling-for-it-professionals/articleshow/74216346.cms

HYDERABAD: US-based applications, learning and outsourcing player Computer Generated Solutions Inc (CGS) is expanding its presence in Hyderabad with a new facility and is drawing up plans to ramp up its headcount in the city to about 2,000 over next five years, founder president and CEO Phil Friedman told TOI here on Wednesday. He said CGS also plans to set up its global cybersecurity operations centre (CSOC) in the city and ramp up its capacities in augmented reality based learning solutions.

Friedman, who is in town for the opening of CGS Inc’s new 80,000 sq ft facility spread over five storeys in Madhapur on Thursday, said the company plans to grow its headcount from around 500 to nearly 800 in the city over the next 18 months or so.

“We have development work happening in US, UK, Canada, Romania and Hyderabad. Our engineers in Hyderabad are engaged in doing some sophisticated software development work,” Friedman said, adding that apart from software development, the company is also building teams for development of AR-based learning solutions as well as cyber security operations in the city.

“All our AR learning solutions visualization work is currently done out of our CoE in Canada but we plan to do the data curation work for it here in Hyderabad. Currently, we have a small team of about a dozen employees engaged in this here, which we plan to grow over time,” he explained and added that the CSOC team, which is about a handful of people now, will grow in the future as the company brings on board the requisite talent for it.

322,['20/02/2020'],"Involve citizens in drawing up plans and budgets, say activists","TimesView Given the state of the city’s infrastructure, it’s clear that BBMP is not the most efficient of organisations. This inefficiency masks a significant amount of graft, influence management and patronage. Involving citizens in decision-making, especially where budgets and efficient delivery of services are concerned, is something that councillors will find deeply threatening. How many people have been held accountable for pothole deaths or punished for the state of lakes? How many have been penalised for flouting guidelines — building, fire safety or others? This is why citizen participation is important, starting from the ward level.

BENGALURU: When it comes to formulating ward projects, masterplans and budgets, a bottom-up approach is required, where citizens are actively involved in urban planning, said civil society members , adding that ward committee meetings have been reduced to grievance redressal fora.Civil society members, under the banner of Civic, recently wrote to urban development department principal secretary Anjum Parvez, with recommendations for the Karnataka Municipalities draft bill prepared by the National Law School of India University, Bengaluru.“Ward empowerment and strengthening is key to bring about transparency and accountability in urban governance. Very little weightage has been given to citizen participation in the draft bill,” said Kathyayini Chamaraj, executive trustee, Civic.“Our main suggestions include ensuring participation of genuine people through elected area sabha representatives, who sit in on ward committee meetings. Area sabhas should also be empowered to conduct social audits. The veto power given to counsellors concerning ward panel meeting decisions has to be removed,” she added.Srinivas Alavilli of Citizens for Bengaluru, who recently spoke at a ‘consultation on transparency and accountability in the paradigm of urban governance’ at BMS College of Law, pointed out that ward committees , which have taken over 28 years to be established, must be given more time to become stronger.“The committees have finally become functional in Bengaluru and over 1,000 meetings have been held in the past 18 months or so. While their functioning is in no way perfect, it’s developing in a positive manner. The main problem is inadequate citizen participation. The next BBMP elections will be crucial since 2,000 additional ward committee members will be added to the existing network. This will change urban governance in the city,” opined Srinivas.Pointing to a study conducted between July and October in 22 wards by Sensing Local Foundation, it’s co-founder Ankit Bhargava said it showed there’s lack of consistency in conducting monthly ward committee meetings and documenting the same.“There is no standard format for communication of ward committee meetings — notices are shared on WhatsApp groups, which all citizens may not be a part of. We also detected inconsistency in setting and sharing of the meeting agenda in many wards. Only in 60.9% of the meetings surveyed was the corporator found to be anchoring it. Such meetings have largely become grievance redressal platforms instead of focusing on ward planning, budgeting, project oversight and monitoring of supply of urban services,” he said.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ward-committees-involve-citizens-in-drawing-up-plans-and-budgets-say-activists/articleshow/74215828.cms

Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike

BENGALURU: A desperate attempt by Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike ( BBMP ) to collect property tax dues to shore up its revenues met its match in an equally desperate Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC), which is in the red.

“We don’t have money to pay our drivers and conductors. Do you expect us to pay property tax to BBMP?” a senior BMTC official was quoted as telling the Palike officials who visited the transport utility’s Shantinagar headquarters last week to recover levy dues totalling Rs 9.6 crore, which had piled up over four to seven years.

A few days earlier, another BBMP team was in for a bigger shock when it visited a BMTC office in Malleswaram ward to recover property tax dues. According to Palike staffers, a BMTC official told them: “We don’t have money. Take our Volvo buses .”

It was the BBMP officials’ turn to beat a retreat. “Where do we keep the Volvo buses if we confiscate them? We have to safeguard them as they are not our property. It would be a logistical nightmare. The cost of maintaining them would only drill holes in our pockets,” said a senior official from the revenue wing of the civic agency’s west zone.

BMTC sources, however, denied their official had the made “take the Volvo buses” remark. “Volvo is our luxury bus. How can we give it to anybody?” they said.

Another BMTC official said the utility’s financial position is weak. “The cost of diesel has gone up and so have employees’ salaries. Besides, passenger traffic is reducing,” he explained. The official said they have requested BBMP to collect tax only for BMTC’s commercial structures and not for vacant properties or housing infrastructure like depots. About 60% of BMTC’s properties are commercial. “Property tax arrears towards our non-commercial properties alone amount to nearly Rs 4 crore. We are asking the Palike to bail us out by collecting property tax for our commercial properties ,” added the official.

The corporation has also requested BBMP to write to the government on its behalf and request extra subsidy for the utility.

Jadeja said, “The state government is adhering to the policy of reservation. We are committed to ensuring the constitutional reservation rights of all citizens. The stir was totally political and the government has assured all LRD women candidates that it will take care of their interests. The recruitment will be completed shortly.

The demonstration entered its 12th day on Wednesday

BENGALURU: Women protesters at Bilal Bagh have intensified their campaign against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, by starting a relay hunger strike and demanding that chief minister BS Yediyurappa visit the site to hear their concerns.

Two women stopped eating on Tuesday and two others will take their place on Thursday as part of a cycle which will continue till the government acknowledges their demands.

The Occupy-movement-style demonstration at Bilal Bagh, organised on the lines of Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh, entered its 12th day on Wednesday. The women here have demanded that the Karnataka government should not implement the controversial citizenship law and the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC).

Poet Nasreen Syed, who is among the protesters, said the decision to go on a hunger strike was the result of anxiety and pain that the participants were facing because of the government’s indifference.

“Dard ko bhi Aadhaar card se jod do na, saheb, jinko mila hai unko dubaara na mile! (Dear sir, link even the pain with respective Aadhaar cards, so that people who experienced it once don’t have to go through it again),” she said. “The indifference of the government, unconstitutional laws like CAA and NRC have killed our appetite anyway. We can’t eat, drink or sleep because of the constant worry about the state of affairs.”

According to a volunteer, about 1,000 women joined the first two protesters on hunger strike, staying off even water, on Tuesday.

The Bilal Bagh women said the developments in Delhi won’t have an impact on their stir. A Supreme Court-initiated mediation process is underway in the national capital to persuade Shaheen Bagh protesters to shift their venue of sit-in.

“We are ready to die, but won’t move from here. We will continue to fight to protect our Constitution,” said Warsi, one of the women on hunger strike. She added that the opposition to CAA had united citizens.

Another protester, Firdaus, shared a similar view. “Shaheen Bagh inspired us and this fight will continue,” she said.

Avani Choksi said Bilal Bagh had an independent existence and the events in Delhi won’t alter its course. Teresa Braggs, a student, said Shaheen Bagh protesters were unlikely to budge.

332,['20/02/2020'],Personalised stamps in honour of Parrikar on anvil,"This story is from February 20, 2020

Panaji: The department of posts has requested the state government to come up with a proposal for the release of a ‘My Stamp ’ in memory of former defence minister and ex-Goa CM Manohar Parrikar .

‘My Stamp’ is a personalised sheet of postage stamps. It involves the printing of thumbnail images of a person, logos of institutions or images of artwork, heritage buildings, etc, alongside the selected commemorative postage stamp. “Postage stamps are usually released after 10 years of the death of a person,” said postmaster general, Goa region, N Vinodkumar. “We have informally told the state government that it can come up with a corporate My Stamp on Parrikar.”

During World Post Day celebrations at Maquinez Palace last year, chief minister Pramod Sawant had requested the department to come out with a postal stamp of Parrikar to commemorate his stint as Union defence minister.

“We need to get proposals from sponsors for the release of stamps. The proposals are then forwarded with recommendations to our New Delhi postal directorate where they are examined and approval for the release of stamps is given,” Vinodkumar said.

The central government recently renamed the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (IDSA), a government think tank, as the Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses to honour the former defence minister. Posts officials said this may urge stamp collectors to have a thumbnail of Parrikar in their collection.

“Philatelists will also want to collect this stamp especially considering that Parrikar was posthumously awarded the Padma Bhushan last month. We are hopeful that once printed, the stamps will sell out immediately,” a senior posts official told TOI.

Madurai: Hearing a suo motu public interest litigation (PIL) in connection with the custodial death of a youth in Madurai last year, the Madras high court has directed his father to file an affidavit after the latter expressed his desire not to pursue the case as he was convinced that the death was not due to custodial torture.

P Muthukaruppan moved the high court Madurai bench, seeking to register an FIR into the custodial death of his son, M Balamurugan. During the course of hearing, the court had directed to preserve the evidence in the case, however, Muthukaruppan withdrew the case on November 11, 2019.

After withdrawal of the petition, an advocate Henri Tiphagne in a letter to the court on November 12, indicated that the police officers are coercing Balamurugan’s parents not to depose against them.

Based on the letter, the suo motu PIL committee directed the registry to register a suo motu PIL with the prayer seeking for a direction to register the FIR and transfer the investigation to the CBI for impartial probe.

When the case was taken up for hearing on Wednesday, the counsel A Kannan representing Muthukaruppan submitted that the father had withdrawn the petition as he was convinced that his son did not die due to custodial torture. He also stated that there is no necessity to pursue this case.

However, Tiphagne wanted the court to pursue this case. He also alleged that certain transactions had taken place which was the reason behind the withdrawal of the case. Denying the allegations, the additional advocate general K Chellapandian submitted that necessary steps were taken as a case was registered in this regard and the Madurai JM III is also conducting inquiry into the case.

Taking note of the submissions, a division bench of justice M Duraiswamy and justice T Ravindran gave the direction to Muthukaruppan and adjourned the case to February 26 for further hearing.

Madurai: The Madras high court has directed the authorities concerned to consider a plea moved by a retired sanitary worker seeking payment of special monthly pension.

In his petition, N Balu, stated that he joined as a sanitary worker at the Thummanatham village panchayat at Usilampatti taluk in Madurai district in 1998.

After he joined duty, the panchayat officials opened a service book and periodically reviewed his service.

He was drawing a monthly salary of Rs 4,770. After working for nearly 20 years, the special officer of the village panchayat had issued a retirement order dated June 30, 2018.

He said the state had passed a government order (GO) on November 28, 2017 stating that government employees and employees working in local bodies under special time scale pay shall be granted special monthly pension and lumpsum payment (monetary benefit) at the time of retirement.

Based on the GO, the sanitary workers should be provided a special monthly pension of Rs 2,000 and lumpsum payment of Rs 50,000. Though he submitted a representation to the authorities concerned seeking the benefits, the same was not considered.

Hence, the petitioner moved the high court Madurai bench seeking special monthly pension from the date of his retirement and lumpsum payment as per the GO.

When the case was heard on Wednesday, justice M S Ramesh gave the direction to the authorities to consider the representation and pass orders in accordance with law.

LUCKNOW: A special investigation team of UP Police has named 16 government officials as those responsible for fraudulently transferring the land of Gond tribes in Umbha village of Sonbhadra to a society.

The SIT was formed after 11 members of the Gond tribe were killed by gram pradhan Yagya Dutt and his aides on July 17 last year over a land dispute. While Dutt and the henchmen were arrested, the government had formed the SIT on August 4 to investigate the case. It has completed the probe in six months.

DG SIT Rajendra Pal Singh confirmed to TOI that the report on the Umbha land dispute had been sent to the government for approval. However, he refused to divulge more details.

TOI has learnt from officers who conducted the probe that first the SIT found clinching evidence to suggest the land belonged to Gond tribals even before Independence. In 1955, the land was illegally registered in the name of Adarsh Co-operative Society.

SIT officials said 16 “public persons” were involved in fraudulently transferring the gram sabha (government) land in possession of tribal families since the pre-Independence period to a farming society. Thereafter, the land was transferred in the name of individuals and resold.

NAINITAL: The state government on Tuesday told the Uttarakhand high court ( HC ) that it will not grant any new permission for setting up of stone crushers in the state without permission of the court.

The assurance was given by additional chief secretary (ACS) in the state government, Om Prakash, whose personal appearance was ordered by the court in its previous hearing on February 10.

The bench of Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia and Justice Narayan Singh Dhanik has been hearing a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) which said that there are over 300 stone crushers running in the state.

The petition says that these crushers are a major contributor to the pollution in the ecologically sensitive state and almost half of them are located in three districts of Udham Singh Nagar, Nainital and Haridwar .

The court’s written order — made available on Wednesday — also notes a submission made by the Bar that “at least for the three district of Haridwar, Nainital and Udham Singh Nagar, these stone crushers/screening plants can be located in a particular designated area which will be for the sole purpose of the operation of stone crushers and located at least two to three km away from residential, hospitals and religious institutions.”

Responding to the suggestion, the order read, “Since we are not aware of the logistics, we direct the state government to properly inquire and make a study of this issue… and file a report positively within a period of four weeks.”

The petitioner had pointed out that not all the plants are catering to the needs of Uttarakhand and that in fact, much of the products were being exported to other parts of the country, even as Uttarakhand was rapidly becoming a pollution zone on account of these stone crusher plants.

Panaji: Just days after implementing pay-parking, the Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) took another step to streamline traffic flow in the capital by beginning the process to clamp and tow haphazardly and illegally-parked vehicles.

The corporation is offering a seven-year contract to a private agency, which will be responsible for towing and clamping cars and motorcycles causing traffic jams, Panaji mayor Uday Madkaikar said.

Around six months earlier, Madkaikar had asked the Panaji traffic cell to penalise and clamp all haphazardly parked vehicles. At that time, the civic body provided 200 clamps to the cell.

The CCP has a truck to lift illegally parked motorcycles, but the vehicle often suffers mechanical breakdowns and the Panaji traffic cell is not adequately staffed and equipped to monitor the entire city for haphazard parking.

“The selected bidder should have well-trained workers to lift, tow and clamp defaulting vehicles, who would assist the corporation and Goa traffic police in this exercise,” Madkaikar said.

In 2015, the CCP had discontinued a similar contract with a private agency. Then mayor Shubham Chodankar said that the civic body received complaints from the public due to the high rates charged by the agency.

“In order to provide better service, the city will be divided into two zones. Zone 1 will be from Kala Academy to St Inez, Miramar, Caranzalem and Dona Paula. Zone-II will be from Kala Academy to main city area, Patto, Mala and Ribandar,” a CCP official said. Less than a week ago, the corporation rolled out its pay-parking system, charging four-wheelers Rs 20 to park on Atmaram Borkar Road and 18th June Road. For every additional hour, motorists have to shell out Rs 15.

Goa carnival parade

PANAJI: With just two days left for the riotous Carnival celebrations to kick-off, Goa police has shot down the proposal to hold the popular float parade on the city’s main road, prompting the Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) to seek an urgent meeting with the North Goa collector.

The Panaji Carnival Committee, CCP and Goa police’s traffic cell will sit down with the North Goa collector at 10am to resolve the impasse and chalk out a traffic plan for February 22 when the floats are expected to roll down from the Santa Monica jetty to Kala Academy.

“We are firm on our decision. We are not going to change,” CCP mayor Uday Madkaikar said.

The traffic cell rejected the decision to return the Carnival parade to traditional route in the city on the grounds that it would lead to traffic jams.

Last year, the parade was held along the Miramar-Dona Paula road, but the CCP decided to return to the old route.

The floats will be asked to assemble at the Santa Monica jetty while the flag off will be at the Adil Shah palace with chief minister Pramod Sawant and tourism minister Manohar Ajgaonkar expected to be in attendance.

“Carnival preparations are moving at a brisk pace and we have already started setting up the stage. We cannot change it now,” Madkaikar said.

As of now, 27 participants have come forward to put up floats for the Carnival tableau.

Aside from the VIP seating area, CCP has also decided to set up a covered seating area for tourists who wish to pay and watch the float parade, a first for the Panaji Carnival.

“Seating for 500 people is being created at a special pandal where numbered tickets priced at Rs 500 are being sold. If all the tickets get sold out, we have time to increase the seating arrangements,” CCP commissioner Sanjit Rodrigues said.

These tickets are being sold at the CCP office.

CCP has decided to put up its own float, focusing on Goa as a wedding destination. The traditional four-day festivities, samba square, will also be held this year.

“Let’s celebrate Carnival without troubling anyone. There will be tourists, outsiders, foreigners and locals,” Madkaikar said.

CCP has roped in 100 volunteers, who along with Goa police, will try to regulate the throngs that come to witness the parade.

NEW DELHI: A Delhi-Jeddah IndiGo flight had to return to the Delhi airport on Tuesday night after taxiing for take-off when two passengers created a scene inside the aircraft. The passengers were agitated as their two co-passengers were not allowed to board the aircraft after losing their boarding cards.

According to sources, a group of 110 people from Srinagar were travelling via Delhi to Jeddah. Two of them lost their connecting boarding pass and were not allowed on flight 6E1741.

“While the aircraft was taxiing, the group leader demanded that the two passengers be accepted on board. The IndiGo crew tried to pacify him, but two people onboard reportedly got very agitated and tried to open the aircraft door to stop it. The captain then decided to return to the terminal where two men and three women passengers were offloaded with their three checked-in bags,” said an official.

A complete anti-sabotage drill was performed. The aircraft, which has a schedule departure time of 8.10 pm, finally took off with a delay of three hours.

An IndiGo spokesperson confirmed the incident. “Some passengers displayed unruly behaviour and were offloaded to continue flight operations. A report has been filed with the relevant authorities as per protocol,” the spokesperson said.

VIJAYAWADA: The Andhra Pradesh high court on Wednesday sought explanation within two weeks regarding payments to renewable power generation companies.

Power generation companies moved the high court seeking directions to power utilities to clear dues in power bought by discoms in compliance with the earlier order of the high court.

The counsel for the energy department told the court that they had cleared all dues in compliance with the high court order and there were no pending dues in some petitions and in some cases, the state government has been trying to raise funds through bank loans to clear the dues.

As there is a huge divergence in the amount claimed by the power generation companies and the amount paid by the power utilities, the HC asked for explanation pertaining to payments to be made to individual companies.

The high court bench headed by Chief Justice J K Maheswari and Justice Ninala Jayasurya said they would summon the officials concerned for personal appearance if they failed to furnish the details.

MUMBAI: Cautioning jaywalkers, a magistrate’s court this week acquitted a 65-year-old woman, booked in 2011 for ramming into a pedestrian at Marine Drive, after it found that he was crossing the road when the signal was green. “It is successfully brought on record that her ( Kalpana Marchant ) defence is probable that her driving was not rash but the accident took place due to rashness and sudden crossing of road on the part of deceased Sadanand Bhatde ,” the court said.

Marchant had halted after the accident near Kaivalyadham on the evening of January 22, 2011, and Bhatde was lying unconscious. Police took him to Saifee hospital, where he succumbed to injuries. Marchant was booked for rash driving and causing death by negligence.

Among the three witnesses were two cops and an eyewitness. The eyewitness told court that he was driving his car in the middle lane. He said a pedestrian crossed the road when the signal was green, and he was hit by a car from the lane on the right.

Relying on the witness, the court said he did not mention anything about the accused being rash or negligent. The court pointed out that the witness admitted that Marchant and he were driving at normal speed and the pedestrian came from the left of the road. “All these facts continuously point towards the sudden action of the victim in crossing from a place without a zebra-crossing. Such zebra-crossing is meant for crossing by pedestrians and they are only supposed to cross the road by it,” the court said.

The court said it had come on record from evidence of the eyewitness that the signal was green when the victim was crossing. “Indirectly, it suggests that the deceased was crossing the road from the place not meant for crossing, and that too when he was supposed to stop, due to having a green signal for vehicular traffic,” the court said.

“Hence, considering all the facts, it is clearly visible, but there is nothing on record to show that the accused was driving the vehicle either in a rash or negligent manner,” the court said.

PM Modi at Hunar Haat

NEW DELHI: The Hunar Haat — a coming together of artisans from the minority communities on the lawns of Rajpath to showcase and sell their products — had a surprise guest on Wednesday afternoon. As Prime Minister Narendra Modi strode in on an unscheduled visit, both officials and minister for minority affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi were caught by surprise.

As word spread that the PM was among the visitors, the crowd started growing but Modi was in no rush to leave. He obliged visitors with selfies, interacted with artisans and relished 'litti-chokha' ( a delicacy from Bihar) and 'kulhad chai’ (tea in earthen cup).

Soon after chairing the meeting of the Union cabinet Modi reached Rajpath where Hunar Haat is being organised by the ministry of minority affairs. Naqvi told TOI that the PM came at around 1.30pm and went around the Haat over the next 50 minutes. “I had returned home from the cabinet meeting chaired by the PM when I received a call from officials at Hunar Haat who said that the SPG was at the venue. I decided to go to the venue and was pleasantly surprised to see the PM arrive a few minutes later. It was very encouraging for the artisans who shared their experiences with the Prime Minister,” Naqvi said.

Interestingly, the PM chose to be like any other visitor and decided to sit on the charpai laid out near the food stalls. From the Haat’s “bawarchikhana”, the PM decided to eat litti chokha and ordered chai for himself and Naqvi and paid Rs 120 for the savoury and Rs 40 for two kulhad chai.

Artisans participating in the event came forward to tell the PM how traditional arts were dying, and events like Hunar Haat were providing them a window to sell their products.

Later the PMO put out a press statement on Modi’s visit where it shared that more than 50% of the artisans participating were women. The event will be on till February 23. Similar ‘haats’ are being organised across India as part of an effort to empower master artisans.

347,['20/02/2020'],"Past perfect, future tense as hotel footfall sees sharp drop","This story is from February 20, 2020

Vijayawada: Hotels in Vijayawada which enjoyed a dream run for almost three years during the previous government are now struggling to make ends meet as occupancy in these hotels saw a drop of about 50 per cent across all segments in the past six months. A change in regime and the present government’s alternative plans of establishing three capitals has changed the fortunes of hoteliers in the city.

When the administration completely shifted to Vijayawada from Hyderabad in 2015, the hotel industry witnessed an unprecedented demand. Vijayawada’s hotel industry saw a massive boom, especially after the city was made part of the capital.

When the previous government announced mega plans for the construction of a greenfield capital with world class infrastructure, the hospitality industry saw several new businesses mushroom in the city. More than 250 new hotels began business in the city in the past four years. Many of these hotels are in the medium range segment, offering food at affordable prices. All these hotels had good business, especially with the help of online hotel room booking mobile applications.

Speaking to TOI, Sanjay Jain, general secretary of Vijayawada hotels association, said that most of the new entrants have been struggling to make ends meet for the past six months with occupancy drastically falling by as much as 50-60 per cent across all segments. Many of these new entrants started the business by taking the buildings on rent.

With the fall in occupancy, the new hotels are in a catch-22 situation. On one hand they are not getting enough revenue for maintenance, and on the other hand, to close down the operations, they will have to forgo all the capital expenditure they have made on the building.

“While those who have been in the business for a while are sustaining by offering discounts as high as 50% to their corporate and regular clients, the new entrants are facing severe hardships with a sharp decline in footfall,” said Sanjay Jain.

Parvataneni Ravi, president of the Vijayawada hotels association observed that the previous government used to have many events—either conferences or workshops. “Apart from hosting these events, there used to also be lot of visitors from all the world, who attended these events. Under the current government, the number of such events have come down, which has affected the hotel industry. Overall economic slowdown is also a contributing factor for the fall in demand side,” Ravi said.

NEW DELHI: The new Parliament House will be built at an estimated cost of Rs 776 crore and the total built-up area in the Parliament complex after new construction will be more than double of what it is now. While 194 trees need to be felled for the project, the government has claimed that the total green area in the complex will increase by at least 25%.

These are the details that the housing and urban affairs ministry has submitted while seeking the environmental clearance for the project.

According to the ministry’s application, the new Parliament will have facilities for a Lok Sabha , Rajya Sabha and joint sessions besides lounges.

The new Parliament building will be 50 metres tall. The application filed by the urban affairs ministry on February 12 said that the current built-up area is 44,940 sq metre and after the new construction, this will increase to nearly 1.05 lakh sq metres.

The project to be built over 8.2 acres will require about 8.61 lakh tonnes of raw material.

The ministry has also submitted that the total number of trees in the complex will increase to 632 from the present number of 250. It has claimed that the total greenbelt will increase from the current 16,136 sq metre to 20,636 sq metre.

349,['20/02/2020'],"Due to stigma, private doctors not reporting HIV cases to Goa state AIDS control society","This story is from February 20, 2020

BATTLING PREJUDICE

PANAJI: Private doctors treating HIV/AIDS are not reporting their cases to Goa State AIDS Control Society (GSACS) despite it being mandatory to do so. Officers with the society said that this meant that people living with HIV/AIDs still faced the risk of being stigmatised if their status came to be known.

Stating that it is one of the reasons why private doctors do not share information with them, a senior GSACS official said that this was despite making it clear to the doctors that they did not have to reveal their patients’ identities.

A GSAC staffer said that though HIV/AIDS patients may not be ostracised by society or family, as was the case few years ago, they, however, do face stigma. HIV/AIDS patients are more likely to be treated last in any public health facility if their status is known, the officer said. “It is a fact. So, can you blame them for not disclosing their status. People still look at them differently,” the officer said.

This, she said, they find reflected in patients’ behaviour when it comes to their treatment. For example, one reason behind some patients under Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) not adhering to the drugs regimen prescribed to them was that they want to avoid taking medication in the presence of others or in an office environment.

“If it is required for a person on ART to take medication at certain hours, and if that timing coincides with duty hours, then the person will likely avoid taking the tablets while in office lest he or she be questioned,” the officer said.

A person runs a high risk of treatment failure if the ART drug regimen is not adhered to. These aspects are disclosed when patients are investigated to know what may have gone wrong, and there is a first or second line failure. “We do see such cases,” the officer said.

350,['20/02/2020'],"More than 2,000 people take part in anti-CAA protests","This story is from February 20, 2020

Vellore/Tirupattur: A massive crowd gathered in Muslim-majority Tirupattur to protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ), National Register of Citizens ( NRC ) and National Population Register ( NPR ) on Wednesday, while relatively lesser number of protesters turned up near the Vellore collector’s office.

The protesters demanded that the Tamil Nadu government pass a resolution in the assembly not to implement the CAA, NRC and NPR.

While in Vellore around 500 people participated in the protest organised near the collector’s office, more than 2,000 people from various Muslim groups and opposition cadres took part in the protest in front of the Tirupattur collector’s office. To avert untoward incidents and to prevent the protesters picketing the collector’s office, more than 1,000 police personnel were deployed near the entrance of the collector’s offices in both towns.

Addressing the gathering near the Vellore collector’s office, J Imthiyas Ahmed Rashadi, district secretary of Jama’atul Ulema, who was heading the protest, condemned Kapilkumar Saratkar, joint commissioner of police, North Chennai, for attacking people who were protesting against CAA at Washermenpet in Chennai. He demanded compensation for the kin of deceased Pasalurhaq who allegedly died in the police attack. Rashadi urged the state government to adopt a resolution against CAA, NPR and NRC immediately.

Others who spoke after Rashadi strongly criticized the AIADMK and BJP governments for their anti-secular policies.

Speaking to TOI a senior police officer on condition of anonymity said they expected more than 2,000 people to participate in the protest and had deployed around 1,000 personnel for protection headed by Vellore SP K Praveshkumar, seven DSPs and 25 inspectors. But less than 500 people took part in the protest.

Based on the request of some Muslim groups, only seven leaders of the Muslim organisations and political parties were allowed to file a petition with the Vellore collector. After handing over the petition, the protesters dispersed around 1 pm, the officer said.

Meanwhile in Tirupattur, more than 2,000 people from various Islamic groups and opposition parties gathered in front of the collector’s office and raised slogans demanding a resolution against CAA in the assembly. Members of the Tanzimul Masjid Committee, who led the anti-CAA protest, later filed a petition with Tirupattur collector M P Sivan Arul.

No untoward incidents were reported at both Vellore and Tirupattur.

Vijayawada: Two youth were found grievously injured after they attempted to hunt for treasure at Doddipallu forest near Palamaner town in Chittoor district. The incident took place on Monday but came to light only on Wednesday after cops received information about five youngsters trying to enter the Doddipallu forest in search of treasure.

“The victims were identified as Ganesh, a bike mechanic, and Harish, who had minor injuries,” deputy superintendent of police Arifulla told TOI. Arifulla said that the boys, in their mid-twenties, believed in the local myth that the forest has hidden treasure. “They began digging near a tree on Sunday. After finding nothing they went home. They returned on Monday night. But this time, they noticed that someone had erected an electric fence,” Arifulla said.

Ganesh first stepped on the high voltage fence and suffered major injury on his leg. While trying to save Ganesh, Harish too suffered minor injuries, the DSP said.

They were then taken to a local government hospital by their friends and later the police was informed. Police said that they had registered a case under AP Forest Act for trespassing and are also trying to find out who laid an electric fence in the reserve forest. tnn

Officials inspect an illegal construction site in Vijayawada on Wednesday

Vijayawada: Anti-Corruption Bureau ( ACB ) sleuths continued their state-wide raids on town planning officials for the second consecutive day on Wednesday. Officials said that they have verified different illegally constructed buildings coming under various municipal corporations and offices jurisdiction in Andhra Pradesh. Under Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) limits, officials found the unauthorised construction of a building at Central Ware House Main Road in Kedareswar Pet.

“The irregularities found here is that officials did not approve any plan. Totally unauthorised construction of G+1 commercial-cum-residential building is over 53 yards,” the ACB said. Official apathy ensued as the town planning officer neither mentioned the irregularities in the unauthorised construction register that they maintain nor was a notice served to the owner.

Overall, ACB officials inspected five more unauthorised buildings in the city, including one opposite Hindu High School in Islampet street, Kotamrajugari street, RR Appa Rao Street, Kutumba Rao street and Ganesh Nagar Colony. Not surprisingly, a majority of these are predominantly situated in One Town area. In Guntur district, officials found the unauthorised construction of one building in Nallacheruvu, with different irregularities. For another, the 3rd floor was constructed without an approved plan.

Further, setbacks were not left according to the approved plan and deviations in the use of construction. There was also excessive plinth of 198.65 sq meters. More serious irregularities under GMC limits included officials regularising a plan that was ineligible for the building penalisation scheme.

Furthermore, officials also turned a blind eye towards the deviations in the construction of buildings. Unauthorised constructions were being brazenly allowed across Nellore, Ongole, Tirupati, Tadepalligudem, Kakinada, Vizag, Srikakulam, Proddatur, Kadiri and Yemmiganur. ACB officials said that a detailed report would be submitted to the government recommending necessary actions against the erring town planning officers.

Nagpur: After more than three weeks of isolation in their hostel rooms and 17 days quarantine in India, medical students from Hubei university of science and technology in Wuhan, China, finally reached their home on Wednesday. For families of four girl students of Vidarbha, it was a grand homecoming.

“We were asked to stay back in our hostel rooms since mid-January. Chinese staff and teachers used to provide us all necessary goods. By January 23, when their New Year began, everything was shut. Metro, airport all came to a standstill,” recalled Prachi Bhalerao, a second year medical student. Prachi’s parents stay in Akola.

First batch of evacuated Indians that was allowed to go home on February 17 included four girl students from Vidarbha.

Sonali Bhoyar, who is from Gadchiroli, said people were dying daily in Wuhan. “It was a real panic to see so many deaths every day. Even if our university was taking care of us, we finally approached the Indian embassy. They were quick to act. We were evacuated in first flight that landed in Wuhan on February 1,” said Sonali.

After landing in India, these students were kept in isolation at a medical facility of Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) near New Delhi. Here, Government and armed forces made all arrangements for them.

“Under isolation, facilities like indoor gym, carom, chess, table-tennis were available for us. We had a lot of time to spend together. Many of us got new friends. ITBP doctors also became our friends for lifetime,” said Komal Jaddewar from Nanded. She reached here by Dakshin Express on Wednesday evening.

Government made post-quarantine travel arrangement also for most of these students. Those who were from New Delhi were dropped at home. Train tickets, hospital to airport drop facility were provided to others. Students said they were proud of Indian armed forces for timely evacuation and for taking very good care during the quarantine facility.

Education continues online

Even when universities are closed, these students are attending online tutorials and digital classes.

“We have already started attending digital classes. We get online video of our lectures and PPT presentations. By scanning a QR Code, we can register our attendance. So, our session will continue virtually for now,” said student Bhagyashree Uke. The facility of online examination is also available in this university in case of emergency. So there is no hurry for them to return to Wuhan.

“I am not planning to go back unless WHO declares Wuhan free from coronavirus threat and the university invites me back,” said Sonali Bhoyar.

Jaipur: As more than 16,000 cases on its land are pending in the court, the Jaipur Development Authority ( JDA ) has expedited its legal panel to resolve the cases.

At present, JDA’s panel has 300 legal experts. Directions has been given to follow up the cases to make JDA land free from legal tangles. A senior official at JDA said, “There are cases where stay has been put on JDA’s land. As the cases needs regular follow up, directions has been given to expedite the process.”

Sources said land worth Rs 1,000 crore cannot be sold by JDA due to court cases. “The JDA is desperate to earn revenue as it has to pay approximately Rs 30 crore installments against the loan taken from National Capital Regional Planning Board for Dravyawati River and Railway over-bridge,” said a source

The JDA has taken loans totalling Rs 2,250 crore from NCRPB for the city's major projects. The JDA sought funds from the Centre for ROBs and the elevated road.

The JDA will also prepare the list of properties which has been put under the hammer several times but could not find buyers.

As the real estate sector is going through a slump and the JDA is battling to meet its targets, zone commissioners of the civic body have been asked to earn revenue if they wanted better grades in the annual confidential report (ACR).

A JDA official said, “Zone commissioners will identify the reasons why these properties did not sell. Bigger plots, which are out of reach of buyers, will be reduced in size. To earn revenue, the zones will also focus on collection of lease money.”

The civic body will also run a special auction campaign to sell its property. The JDA will also introduce lotteries to sell its unsold plots in existing housing schemes.

Rajulu, a native of Brahmana Koduru village of Ponnur constituency in Guntur district , did his schooling from Sri Patibandla Sitaramaiah High School (SPSH) in Guntur and went on to pursue graduation in agriculture sciences from Bapatla Agriculture College in 1978. He completed the degree in 1982 and did post-graduation in seed science and technology from Indian Agriculture Research Institute (IARI) in 1986.

He joined Nabard as grade-B officer in 1985 and held several positions across the country before becoming deputy MD in 2019. Rajulu’s appointment is likely to benefit AP as he could push at least a few pending projects and loan requests from the state. In fact, the Centre has tied-up funding of Polavaram project with Nabard. Even after getting cleared from various ministries, it might take several months to get the funds from the banker. In such a situation, intervention at the highest level would help clear the funds for the prestigious project.

361,['20/02/2020'],"SC: Can Nitin Gadkari come to court, explain EV policy?","This story is from February 20, 2020

NEW DELHI: In an unprecedented step, the Supreme Court on Wednesday requested road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari to come to the court and explain the government’s policy vision on curbing vehicular pollution by gradual transition from fossil fuel-based vehicles to electric ones.

A minister has never been called to the apex court and explain a policy vision or decision of the government, a task generally carried out by the attorney general, solicitor general or any of the additional solicitors general. But a bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices B R Gavai and Surya Kant said since the minister had made several statements about e-vehicles, it would be better if he came and explained.

“Could the minister come and explain the policy on introduction of e-vehicles?” the bench asked additional solicitor general Atmaram S Nadkarni. The ASG said he would convey the request to the minister.

However, Nadkarni feared that advocate Prashant Bhushan , who was arguing for expeditious conversion of public and private vehicles to electric mode from fossil fuel mode, could cross-question the minister and create an unpleasant situation.

The bench said, “We understand Bhushan to be a political person but he will not argue with the minister. If the minister has any reservations in coming to the court, then it is not a problem.”

On Bhushan’s suggestion, the bench framed four questions requiring explanation: whether all future procurement of government vehicles should be electric-run; whether charging ports should be provided in every public infrastructure/building; whether additional levy would be charged on petrol/diesel run vehicles to cross-subsidise electric vehicles; and whether all public transport should be converted to e-vehicles.

The bench said vehicular emissions had a great impact on environment, not only for the National Capital Region but for the entire country, and the issue required a focussed approach. “We consider it appropriate to consider all issues simultaneously,” it said.

On January 17, the SC had asked the Union government to detail the steps taken to implement the National Electric Mobility Mission Plan-2020, a policy decision taken in 2012 to give incentives for adoption of electric vehicles and disincentives for fossil fuel based vehicles.

Appearing for petitioner NGO ‘Centre for Public Interest Litigation’, Bhushan cited the 2015 Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles in India (FAME India) scheme, under which the government was to subsidise ‘initial cost of acquisition’ of electric vehicles.

The CPIL had said in its plea, “Though NEMMP-2020 called for an investment of Rs 14,500 crore from the government, as of 2018, the total budget allocation of government has been less than Rs 600 crore, showing government apathy.” It had said though NMMEP planned to adopt 7 million electric/hybrid vehicles, less than 0.3 million such vehicles had been adopted till 2018.

Given the slowdown in the auto industry, Gadkari had recently said there would be no deadline for transition to electric vehicles, or a ban on petrol and diesel-run vehicles. Responding to Niti Aayog’s draft guidelines that set a timeline for phasing out vehicles with internal combustion engines, Gadkari had said, “We will not set any deadline for electric mobility. A lot of state governments are procuring electric buses... the transition will happen as a natural process.”

Students of Government Higher Secondary School, Sanganer, attend classes on the field due to lack of space in ... Read More

JAIPUR: The state government has issued orders to open Sanganer Government College temporarily in the building of Government Higher Secondary School , Sanganer, where already 1,961 students are enrolled. Though there are 25 classrooms in the school, many classes are held in the open ground. In class IX and XI, more than 100 students study in one classroom.

The college will be opened in the six rooms situated in the backyard of the school courtyard. According to the order issued by the higher education ministry, the college will start from this session.

A school teacher said in most of the classes, students have to sit on the floor as there is not enough space for furniture. “If we keep the furniture, only 40 students can be accommodated in a classroom. So students sit on floor. In class IX, there are three sections with 220 students.

Two sections sit in a classroom. In class XI, there are 576 students with 8 sections of humanities, science and commerce streams. Space is going be a big issue,” said the teacher.

Classes from IX to XII are held in the six classrooms which are allotted for the college. A teacher said in one room, NCC, NSS and scout centres are functioning. The State Open School centre is also operating from it.

Higher education Minister Bhanwar Singh Bhati said, “It is a temporary building and the college will be shifted after the new building comes up. However, if there is any inconvenience to school students, we will look into the matter.”

Principal Rakesh Sharma said to solve the problem of space crunch, school can be run in two shifts. “There will be space problem if both the college and the school are run simultaneously. Government can run the school in two shifts that will help in adjusting students,” he said.

Duronto’s back ‘home’

NAGPUR: Responding to sharp criticism from passengers and people’s representatives, Central Railway rolled back its decision to operate 12289-90 Nagpur-Mumbai-Nagpur Duronto Express from Ajni. The train will again operate from home platform at Nagpur station.

TOI on Wednesday had reported on the plight of passengers owing to lack of facilities at Ajni railway station . The train was shifted just because of operational convenience. The railway had to shunt the train from home platform to Ajni coaching complex where it is maintained.

Nagpur division of Central Railway said in a release on Wednesday that from Thursday (February 20), the 12290 Nagpur-Mumbai Duronto will leave from Platform 8 (home platform) while 12289 Mumbai-Nagpur train leaving from CSMT on February 20 will also terminate at Nagpur.

In a note to Central Railway DRM here, the chief passenger traffic manager (CPTM), Mumbai, said, “As passengers are facing inconvenience due to work on lift and escalator, train should be shifted to Ajni.”

“The reason mentioned in CPTM note seems frivolous. The work on installing lift and escalator is in no way a hurdle to passengers. It is the lack of proper facilities at Ajni station that bother them,” said Brijbhushan Shukla of Rail Yatri Sangh.

“This means Duronto was deliberately shifted from home platform to Ajni under the garb of washable apron work on Platform 1. There was no need to shift the train to Ajni as it has been running smoothly for a decade. If at all Ajni needs to be developed, the railways should start giving a 2-minute stoppage to important trains like Duronto here and develop amenities,” Shukla adds.

From the CPTM communication, it appears that Central Railway may restart Duronto and other passenger train operations from Ajni after work on lift and escalator is completed. The work on both is expected to be over by March. The reason doesn’t hold water as the time when Duronto departs is night time when construction activity is stalled, experts said.

Basant Kumar Shukla, general secretary of passenger rail users’ body Bharatiya Yatri Kendra (BYK), said, “The problem is not with Duronto alone. There is same experience with other trains like Ajni-Pune, Hamsafar express and others. Unless Ajni station is redeveloped by expanding it, the problem will persist.”

Former Congress corporator Tanveer Ahmed pushed for reopening one of the operational yard lines on the east side of the station for operating Duronto. Already freight trains are being moved from this side now. This line was used by the railways long ago.”

Reacting to Central Railway faux pas, Vilas Ramteke, professor with Sir JJ College of Architecture, Mumbai, who belongs to Nagpur, said, “Setting up a lift and an escalator will be a partial relief. Quick accessibility to the station is a big issue with Ajni. I stay in North Nagpur and it is easy to approach home platform. There may be many like me facing similar problem if train is operated from Ajni.”

“I welcome CR’s decision to shift the train back, which is well connected to MP and Maharashtra bus stands. Many passengers across the region travel by Duronto. When railways spent crores on home platform, why shouldn’t it be utilized for benefit of passengers,” asked Tushar Patil, an executive working in Mumbai but originally from Nagpur.

From February 9, Nagpur division of Central Railway suddenly started operating the train from Ajni for three months. Prior to this, the train was temporarily shifted to Ajni from January 8 till February 8, citing work on washable apron on Platform 1. Railway sources said the plan was to to permanently shift Duronto to Ajni.

364,['20/02/2020'],Mundhe drops garbage transfer stations plan,"This story is from February 20, 2020

Nagpur: Municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe has dropped the plan to develop five garbage transfer stations and transferred its allocated funds of Rs40 crore for the bio-mining project. Garbage transfer stations were planned to achieve the status of Garbage Free City.

Mundhe, who took over the charge of CEO of Smart City special purpose vehicle — Nagpur Smart and Sustainable City Development Corporation Limited (NSSCDCL) — took the decision in the meeting to review the Smart City Project on Tuesday.

Mundhe directed NSSCDCL officials to stop the ongoing tendering process for the appointment of private contractors to develop the stations.

Mundhe’s predecessor Abhijit Bangar had planned to develop one garbage transfer station in each of the ten zones. For decades, sanitary workers of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) used to dump garbage collected from streets and roads in a given location in each area. Also, staffers of the private garbage operator used to dump garbage collected from households at the same spots. Then, big trucks used to come and take away the garbage. But the garbage used to exist at many locations across the city causing inconvenience to the people and pollution. Therefore, Bangar planned garbage transfer stations where garbage will come and systematically taken away in big trucks to Bhandewadi dumping yard. Funds of Rs40 crore from Smart City Project was sanctioned for five stations and remaining five were supposed to be developed later.

NMC sources told TOI that Mundhe directed the officials of health department to ensure no garbage is dumped and transferred directly from sanitary workers’ tubs and small vehicles into big trucks. “Mundhe might have felt shortage of funds for bio-mining which is under way and very crucial for scientific disposal of 6-8 lakh tonne garbage lying at Bhandewadi dumping yard for decades and also to free the 32-acre land,” sources said.

Considering the past experience, now Garbage Free City may not be achieved without garbage transfer stations.

Mundhe directed the officials to adopt and spread awareness about the four Rs — reduce, reuse, recycle and refuse. He meant citizens should reduce the quantum of garbage by reusing wet garbage at households itself for compost, recycle dry waste and refuse to use plastic.

As the decision was taken by board of directors of NSSCDCL, Mundhe reportedly took the decision after taking the consent of chairman Praveen Pardeshi.

Auto driver molests passenger

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

GURUGRAM: A first-year Delhi University student had a harrowing experience while travelling alone in an Uber cab, and alleged that the driver harassed her by incessantly staring and then masturbating in front of her during the ride.The driver, 30-year-old Manoj from Hisar, has been living in Gurugram for the past few years. He was arrested but later released on bail.Terming the incident deeply upsetting, a spokesperson for Uber said, “The driver’s access to the app has been removed and we stand ready to assist law enforcement with their investigation.”In her complaint, the woman said that on Tuesday morning, she had booked a cab through the Uber app to take her from her house in Sector 51 to the Huda City Centre metro station. The driver was constantly glancing at her in the rear-view mirror, she added. After covering some distance, he started masturbating while driving, she alleged.Fearing for her safety, the woman said she kept quiet throughout the entire ride. On reaching the metro station, she said she “jumped off the cab and ran inside”.The perturbed student then immediately took an auto to return home and shared the ordeal with her father. The duo approached the women police station in Sector 50, and on the basis of the woman’s complaint, a case was registered against the driver under IPC section 354A (sexual harassment).“With the help of the car details on the app, the driver was apprehended and produced before court from where he was released on bail,” said police spokesperson Subhash Boken.This is perhaps the first time such an incident has been reported from Gurugram. Cities like Kolkata, Delhi and Bengaluru have seen a number of complaints by passengers where drivers of app-based taxi services have been accused of harassment, misbehaviour and sexual assault. In 2015, a Delhi woman had allegedly faced a similar incident, about which she had posted on Facebook, while a woman in Kolkata had claimed that she had been molested by an Uber driver.In another case, a woman was allegedly molested by an auto driver in Gurugram in the early hours of Wednesday. The woman said she had left home with her child after an argument with her husband and decided to go to her parents’ house in Chhatarpur in New Delhi.“Around 1 am, I took an auto from DLF Phase 2 market, but instead of going to Delhi, the driver took me an isolated place in DLF Phase 1 through Sikanderpur and molested me,” she alleged, adding that when she objected, the driver beat her up and threatened to kill her child. He fled when she raised an alarm.A case was registered under IPC sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 354 (outraging modesty) and 506 (criminal intimidation). “We are scanning CCTV footage to identify the accused,” said ASI Praveen from DLF Phase 2 police station.In Video: Gurugram: Cab driver masturbates in front of DU student",gurgaon,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74217829,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-131847,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/student-in-cab-driver-stares-at-her-masturbates/articleshow/74216629.cms

Bareilly: A rookie poet and a reluctant politician, Imran Pratapgarhi, who was recently slapped with a Rs 1.04crore show-cause notice for his alleged remarks during anti-CAA protest in Moradabad -- which he has termed a ""witch hunt -- is a rage on YouTube with over 11 lakh followers, blending poetry with humour and political rhetoric to draw cheers from the crowd.

Since the introduction of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), Imran has been travelling extensively to talk about it and has been a part of gatherings in at least 100 cities. With a copy of Constitution in his hand, the poet encourages people to hold democratic and peaceful protests against CAA and the national register of citizens (NRC).

In Moradabad, on February 7, a large crowd assembled at Eidgah after word spread that Imran was coming. Administration and police had a tough time managing the people. Later, they decided to take the cost incurred by police for the ""security"" from the poet who contested the 2019 Lok Sabha election on a Congress ticket from Moradabad.

“Popularity comes with a price, but this is too much. There was no violence and Imran just called for a peaceful protest,” a supporter said. ""People here have been staging protests since January 29. After the initial two days, the numbers had started depleting. On February 7, when Imran reached here, the entire Eidgah ground was packed with people, there was no space even outside the ground,” added an organizer of the event in Moradabad.

On February 14, Imran was in Gaya district of Bihar where people have been holding a sit-in at Shanti Bagh. “For me, he is undoubtedly the present-day Faiz,” said Shaqib Rahman, a MCom student in Moradabad. His latest video,in which he had protested at Delhi Police headquarters, was seen by over 18 lakh viewers. He uses ‘Pratapgarhi’ as suffix as he was born in Pratapgarh district of eastern UP. Imran started penning poems from school, and completed graduation in Hindi literature from Allahabad University. His poem ‘Madrassa’ brought him to limelight. The then Samajwadi Party government conferred the prestigious Yash Bharati award on him for his contribution in the field of poetry and literature.

Middlemen who took bribes on behalf of transport inspectors

JAIPUR: Nine more transport department officials have come under the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) net.

On Wednesday, ACB released a list of 19 more accused including nine transport inspectors in the case for seeking bribes by threatening transporters to cancel their registrations.

The agency had arrested 15 accused in the case on Monday after Sunday’s raids. The number of accused in the case have increased from 15 to 34.

The bureau has claimed to have busted a nexus of agents and some transport department officials for allegedly collecting money from transporters by threatening them.

All the accused transport officers — Babulal Meena, Rajkumar Singh, Amritpal, Mukund Rathore , SK Sharma, Chaitanya Sahay Mathur, Alim Khan, Rajiv Jain and Sukhbir Chaudhary — are posted in Jaipur except Alim Khan, who is posted in Dudu. “We have not arrested them yet. We will call them for questioning,” additional director general (ADG) ACB Dinesh MN told TOI.

While naming 19 more accused, the ACB categorically mentioned that there could be more people involved in the racket including several public servants and individuals.

Apart from transport inspectors, the ACB has named one Kalyan, a resident of Kotputli , Jagdish from Chomu and Sikar, Rajesh and Ravi from Shahjahanpur, Jaswant (a guard) from Behror and others including Mukesh, Girwar, Sheoji Kadwal, Yogesh Kumar and Rajendra Singh.

The ACB is investigating into the case to establish the links of the transport inspectors with agents, who belong to Jaipur and other nearby places such as Chomu, Shahjahanpur and Sikar.

The ACB had claimed to have found Rs1.5 crore from the possession of 15 persons already arrested during the raids.

The officials are claiming that they have enough evidence against the arrested accused.

However, the bureau is hopeful that they will get crucial information from the 19 persons who have been named in the case but they have not been arrested.

It has constructed smart disabled-friendly toilets and tourist information facilities.The government has spent about Rs 42 crore in developing infrastructure for the benefit of tourists with disabilities visiting beaches. D’Sa however dismisses the government’s claim.“We would like to know on what infrastructure the government has spent Rs 42 crore on,” he said.During the last session of Goa legislative assembly, the House was told that GTDC spent Rs 4.34 crore in 2017-18 , Rs 32.44 crore in 2018-19 and for 2019-20, incurred expenses to the tune of Rs 5.30 crore, towards beach infrastructure.This was in response to a question tabled by Congress legislator Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco.In 2017-2018, GTDC had built permanent toilet blocks at Mayem Lake, near the library building at Curchorem and at Candolim beach. Also, permanent toilet blocks have been built at Baga beach, at Baga near Titos, at Anjuna parking, Morjim Khind and at Ashwem beach. In 2019-20, permanent toilet blocks were built at Keri beach, Pernem KTC bus stand, Tiracol and Morjim beach.

Pilibhit: Police on Wednesday booked five members of a family for misappropriating Rs 1.5 lakh given to the husband of a 26-year-old cancer patient for her treatment by her mother, who was also beaten and molested after her daughter died.

In her complaint filed at Pilibhit-Kotwali PS, Ahmad Bi of Beni Chaudhary locality in Pilibhit city said she had given her daughter Samreen Khanam in marriage to Wasim Khan of village Chandoi under the same police station on February 21, 2014. She added that although she had given a lot as dowry, her son-in-law and his family used to thrash her daughter demanding more.

When Samreen got diagnosed with breast cancer some months ago, Wasim took Rs 1.50 lakh from Ahmad Bi for her daughter’s treatment, but instead of spending it on the treatment, bought a secondhand truck with it. After Samreen died on January 16, Wasim’s younger brother Shibu Khan approached Ahmad Bi on February 12 and demanded another Rs 50,000, claiming Wasim had borrowed the amount for Samreen’s treatment. When Ahmad Bi refused, Shibu thrashed and molested her.

SHO Shrikant Dwivedi said an FIR was lodged against Wasim, Shibu, their sisters Nazia and Ruby, and mother Mehrunnisa, under sections 406 (criminal breach of trust), 354 (assault to outrage modesty), 452 (house trespass), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 504 (intentional insult) and 506 (criminal intimidation).

When Samreen got diagnosed with breast cancer some months ago, Wasim took Rs 1.50 lakh from Ahmad Bi for her daughter’s treatment, but instead of spending it on the treatment, bought a secondhand truck with it. After Samreen died on January 16, Wasim’s younger brother Shibu Khan approached Ahmad Bi on February 12 and demanded another Rs 50,000, claiming Wasim had borrowed the amount for Samreen’s treatment. When Ahmad Bi refused, Shibu thrashed and molested her.

SHO Shrikant Dwivedi said an FIR was lodged against Wasim, Shibu, their sisters Nazia and Ruby, and mother Mehrunnisa, under sections 406 (criminal breach of trust), 354 (assault to outrage modesty), 452 (house trespass), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 504 (intentional insult) and 506 (criminal intimidation).

Jaipur: The assembly passed the Rajasthan Goods and Services Tax (Amendment) Bill 2020 (RGST) by voice vote on Wednesday.

Minister of parliamentary affairs Shanti Kumar Dhariwal introduced the bill in the House. Replying to discussion on the Bill, the minister said that only the amendments made in the GST by Parliament have been done through this Bill.

The ordinance was brought in this regard on December 28, 2019 in view of special circumstances and urgent needs. He told that GST Council has the right to add any service and appeal in it. The state government can only provide suggestions, he said

Dhariwal said since the Centre had implemented GST in a haste, it needed some rectifications. “Earlier, the cess on petrol and diesel was Rs 3 to Rs 4 which was increased to Rs 14 to Rs 15 per litre in 2014-15. Tax collection of the Centre is going to decrease by Rs 2.50 lakh crore against the target this fiscal.”

It was discussed that after the 15th Finance Commission, there has been a loss in the tax share of the state. Earlier, the state used to get 42% of tax collection. Now, the state gets 41% of the 85% of tax collection. Fifteen per cent is already reduced as cess.

BJP MLA Kiran Maheshwari said, “The government should give presentation in GST council to reduce the tax on marble. It should be brought to 5% from 18%”

BJP MLA Madan Dilwar said, “GST on Kota stone should be waived off as industry is facing a severe setback since long.”

JAIPUR: More CCTV cameras will be installed at Sawai Man Singh Medical College in the wake of increasing thefts in the hospital. This was decided at a meeting with police officials held at SMSMC on Wednesday.

TOI had taken up the issue of thefts in the parking lots and other areas of the hospital in its report ‘Thieves giving hard time to patients’ attendants at SMS’ on February 9.

Patients and their attendants have to remain extra cautious as thieves target vehicles at the parking lot.

Acknowledging that thieves are around, a speaker has also been installed at the parking lot which keeps alerting vehicle owners about safety of their belongings.

“City police have also identified areas and we have also identified some areas in the hospital where thieves strike regularly especially in the parking lot. Apart from installing cameras, policemen will guard such areas regularly,” said Dr DS Meena, medical superintendent, SMS Hospital . Traffic police will also install a system in the parking lot to keep a check on vehicles entering and taking exit.

The hospital administration regularly gets complaints of petty thefts, such as thieves taking away someone’s bags and other belongings. However, SMS Hospital has expressed its limitation to police for preventing such incidents as they have limited number of guards.

Moreover, they also discussed heavy movement of vehicles and parking on the roads outside the hospital causing problems for ambulances entering the hospital carrying patients.

Mysuru: It’s a fitness regimen, stress-buster, character builder and a getaway all rolled into one. And it’s a great way to get back in touch with nature and meet people too. From home-makers to professionals, across age groups, women in Mysuru are taking to trekking like never before, turning their weekends and vacations into a rejuvenating break from the grind.

Dr Rekha V Bhat, an endocrinologist at Columbia Asia Hospital, says she heads to the hills and mountains whenever she feels “drained” by the demands of work and everyday life. “Trekking not only teaches patience and endurance, it sharpens my reflexes to focus on patients,” she says.

The 45-year-old began trekking in the Himalayas in 2010 while studying in Chandigarh. “It was a casual visit to Badrinath and Kedarnath that made a strong impression on me. And I sensed this was the beginning of a journey,” she says.

“While trekking, we have a destination and we have to make the best use of available resources to get there. My work is the same and I have to do my best to treat my patient,” says Bhat. “My profession deals with pain and suffering and this drains me out from time to time. I then head for a trek to recharge myself.”

Among her major treks, Bhat counts Chandrabadani, Tadkeshwar Mahadev, Gomukh–Tapovan, Yamunotri, Badrinath-Charanpaduka-Vasudhara falls, Muchukunda Gufa-Satopanth lake, Valley of Flowers-Hemkund Sahib, Tunganath and Dronagiri in Uttarakhand, Ahobilam in Andhra; and Kailash-Manasarovar and Muktinath-Damodar Kund in Nepal. In Karnataka, she has been to Chamundi hills and Kumara Parvatha in Dakshina Kannada.

Himalayas was a major attraction for accounts executive S Keerthana as well who has been trekking for 10 years now. “Trekking is a stress-buster and re-energiser since you feel one with nature. I have been trekking in the Himalayas which was a great experience and that kept me going,” she says. “Down south, I have trekked in Kudremukh, Thandiyandamol, Kodaikanal and Chamundi hills. Kodaikanal is my favouring destination.”

Tiger Solanki, chairman of Mysuru-based Tiger Adventure Foundation, says trekking is helping people changing their perspective on life and helps them look at the big picture. “When people working like machines go into nature’s lap and return, they are rejuvenated and work with more vigour and energy,” says Solanki, who has been trekking for more than three decades now. “Nature also teaches lessons that books don’t, especially about oneself.”

Social worker and home-maker Suma Mahesh says children should be taken on treks from an early age. “They can learn a lot from nature. Getting in touch with the environment gives you happiness,” she says. Suma has been to the Himalayas twice.

“Trekking is beneficial for all age groups,” says IT executive Deepika Hitaish who has trekked in the Himalayas and back home as well. “It is meant for everyone who loves nature, and for those who have chronic disorders including blood pressure and diabetes. Trekking is fitness without equipment. For IT executives who work on round-the-clock shifts, trekking really helps relax and de-stress,” she says.

“Instead of partying on weekends, trekking gives you so much more. It is fitness and much more. Earlier, I used to depend on my husband for everything but trekking opened up the world for me. I now run a business and don’t think twice about doing another round of Kukkarahalli lake either,” says Sumangala Danth, entrepreneur and home-maker who has been trekking for four years now.

He alleged that the state government and the sand mafia were working ""in an alliance"" for the past one year. Earlier reacting to the order, state revenue minister Harish Chaudhary said the government will submit a report and other information sought by the Supreme Court regarding sand mining.

The Supreme Court on Wednesday took strong exemption to rampant illegal sand mining in Rajasthan and directed the state government to take immediate steps to stop it. Seeking an action taken report from the state government within four weeks, the bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde said illegal sand mining is likely to ""damage the environment irreparably"". “The Supreme Court's direction is a welcome step. The sand mafia has written a new chapter of terrorism in Rajasthan.

Every night, 2,000 trucks transport sand illegally. This is a very serious matter. The mafia attacks the media and police. An organised crime is flourishing in the state,"" Lahoty said.

Madurai: At a time when greenery has largely been wiped out of the globe to make way for urban space, an army of youngsters in Chinnalapatti of Dindigul district, made a difference by planting thousands of trees in 18 town panchayat wards.

Joining hands for the green gesture, organizations Vritcham Pasumai Iyakkam, Pasumai Vaasal and Abdul Kalam Trust hope that they can soon turn the drought-hit wards lush green again, thus bringing back rain eluding the region for some time. The campaign members said that their panchayat received less rain for lack of trees resulting in water crisis and this could be sorted out by growing trees.

To source their saplings, they set up a nursery in Jeeva Nagar, the fifth ward of the town panchayat, and the saplings are distributed for free to public and other organisations who came asking for them. As the saplings are free for all, many came forward to join the effort.

P Raghavan of Jeeva Nagar says that the awareness among the youth on this and their response are encouraging enough. Many others, including elder people, are now following suit. He said a lot of youngsters in the panchayat consider APJ Abdul Kalam as their mentor and leader, trying to fulfill his vision the way they can.

“Kalam had stressed the importance of trees for a better environment. When trees are grown in large numbers, soil will be reinforced with nutrients, which will lead to the growth of many trees, grasses and shrubs. This is what we are doing,’’ he said.

Vijayakumar, Nagarajan and Saravanan of Vritcham, Durairaj, Sivakumar of Chinnalapatti green movement and Ajay, Sivakarthik and Ashok of Abdul Kalam trust are the active members of the drive, together planting about 4,000 saplings so far. They travel regulary to water the saplings

In less than a month after the course was announced, GU has received 42 applications already, officials said.

In the past, Goa University has offered other foreign language certificate courses, but none have stirred quite an interest among Goans as the Japanese programme.

This is the first time that Goa University has announced a Japanese language course, and it is open to students of GU as well as others.

The university will soon enter into an MoU with the Japanese government, following which a Japanese tutor is expected to be provided to GU. The varsity will then begin regular Japanese language courses, which will be open to non-GU students as well, officials said.

Until the time the MoU materialises, Goa University had called for enrolment to a Japanese language certificate course. The course is being offered in association with the Japan Foundation .

The university had announced that those who successfully complete this certificate programme can expect to teach at Goa University in the near future when the Japanese teaching division eventually opens.

On completion of the level-one certificate course in Japanese, students can also work with the Japan Foundation in India or 23 other countries, the varsity had stated.

The three-and-half month programme will end on May 15. Students will be charged a fee of Rs 5,500 for the entire duration of the course.

Jaipur: In what will become the first largest investment in Rajasthan during the current regime of the Congress government, Central PSU NTPC and Rajasthan Solarpark Development Corporation Ltd (RSDCL), a subsidiary of RRECL, will sign an agreement on Thursday to develop 925 megawatt capacity solar power projects in Nokh Solar Park, near Jaisalmer.

As per the agreement, NTPC will develop solar PV projects in the park at an estimated investment of Rs 4,000 crore, while RSDCL will build the basic infrastructure that would require about Rs 450 crore. The park will be connected to PGCIL 765 kV Bhadla-II sub-station. TOI was the first to report on the deal on its January 8, 2020 edition.

“The agreement follows rounds of discussion between NTPC and RSDCL officials and will bring to Rajasthan the biggest investment in state’s solar power sector. The NTPC board has already approved the investment in a meeting held on February 7, 2020 and signing of the Implementation Support Agreement (ISA) will officially mark commencement of the investment inflow to state,” said Ajitabh Sharma, principal secretary, Energy and chairman of RRECL.

The park is proposed to have four projects, three of 245 MW each to be developed in EPC mode and one of 190 MW in developer mode. For power evacuation system, RSDCL will construct four park pooling substations and transmission lines for Nokh solar park. Availability of most sunny days in a year, high insolation and large tracts of government as well as private non-cultivable barren land make Rajasthan a sought-after destination for solar developers. To harness the potential, the state government has recently launched new Rajasthan Solar Energy Policy, 2019 and Rajasthan Wind and Hybrid Energy Policy, 2019, giving competitive incentives to investors.

Government is also promoting establishment of ultra mega renewable energy power parks with CPSUs and private developers.

A search is on for an AIADMK functionary running a jewellery outlet who bought the stolen jewellery for a very less price.

The accused has been identified as Edwin Jose of Pullanvilai near S T Mangadu in Kanyakumari district. “He has more than 28 cases against him. This includes at least eight in Kerala and four in Tamil Nadu for which he was lodged in jail before he committed many burglaries in 2019 and 2020 for which he has been arrested now,” Thuckalay DSP M Ramachandran said.

Ramachandran said that Jose has confessed to at least 15 burglaries in Kanyakumari district after he came out of jail. The major burglaries he had committed include the ones at Silanga Jewellers in Marthandam on December 15, 2019, and Jayasri Jewellery and the house of its owner on January 28. Six special teams were formed to crack the case.

“Initially, we were not aware that he was an ex-convict. We followed the CCTV footage of the man with helmet collected from the scene of crime at various places in recent months and narrowed down on his place of stay,” the DSP said and added that they deployed police personnel at the locality for nearly 10 days to identify him and his house.

Police said that he was nabbed during a vehicle check near Marthandam on Tuesday. Police claimed that he abandoned his two-wheeler and tried to flee when he fell into a roadside pit and fractured his leg.

Explaining his modus operandi, police said that Jose used to disrobe himself whenever women were alone in the house. “When the occupants closed their eyes in disgust he made use of the opportunity to burgle the house and flee. In the two jewellery outlets, he wore a helmet to conceal his identity as there were CCTV cameras,” the DSP said. According to police, a major share of the loot was recovered from his house.

He also pledged the loot in a leading gold loan company. Jose sold around 80 sovereigns in a jewellery outlet belonging to AIADMK functionary Rameshkumar in Marthandam.

JAIPUR: The state government on Wednesday announced forming a regulatory commission to promote quality education in private universities and to prevent irregularities.

The minister for higher education Bhanwar Singh Bhati announced this while replying to a discussion on the functioning of private universities in the state.

Bhati said that the quality of education should be increased, fees should be controlled, and students should not be exploited. For this we promised to set up a regulatory commission.

Earlier, the committee was constituted to study the proposal for a regulatory commission, but no positive outcome. “We are studying its findings and examining the complaints of various universities and commissions of other states. He claimed that that employment opportunities have increased in the state with the establishment of private universities which invested over Rs 5000 cr and students from other states also come to Rajasthan to study.

He said the establishment of private universities has helped in increasing the ratio of higher education. We cannot point fingers at all universities, although some universities continue to receive complaints that need to be stopped. He informed that the gross enrollment ratio in Rajasthan was only 6.04 in 2004, which has increased to 23 in 2018-19. In 2004, this proportion was 7 in the Scheduled Castes category, which has now increased to 20.

The gross enrollment ratio in the Scheduled Tribes category is higher than the national average. While the national average of this class is 17.2, that of Rajasthan is 21.3. The role of private universities is important in the state's ever-increasing enrollment ratio.

392,['20/02/2020'],"Partially eaten carcass of tigress found in Dudhwa, ‘cannibalism’ suspected","This story is from February 20, 2020

Bareilly: In a case of suspected “cannibalism” among tigers, a partially eaten carcass of a 10-year-old tigress was found in Kishanpur Wildlife Sanctuary of the Dudhwa Tiger Reserve on Wednesday.

Pug marks of a male tiger near the spot suggest that the male tiger may have killed her while mating and there was a fierce fight. Male tigers sometimes kill tigress when they don’t co-operate but eating the flesh is something unusual. In this case, the tiger had eaten the scruff of the neck. Last year, a case of cannibalism among tigers was reported from Kanha National Park in Madhya Pradesh. However, this is second such instance recorded in Dudhwa.

The news of carcass was initially shared by some tourists on Wednesday morning and a ranger rushed to the spot with his team. Soon, field director DTR Sanjay Pathak and others went to Kishanpur and a team of wildlife veterinarians was called for postmortem.

After reaching the spot, the field director declared “high alert” across the reserve and staff was put on patrol. Dog squad was used to confirm that poachers were not involved. Forest department also put emphasis on looking for the male tiger. Tourists were prohibited from entering the forest area as the wounded male tiger may pose a threat.

Field director DTR Sanjay Pathak told TOI, “After receiving information, principal chief conservator of forests (PCCF) Sunil Pandey and CCF Ramesh Pandey also arrived from Lucknow and an autopsy was conducted in their presence. The autopsy confirmed that it was a case of infighting and a male tiger may have also suffered injuries as the nails of the tigress had blood stains. The trachea was crushed and there were two puncture wounds of canine. Two ribs of the tigress were broken and it all points to a brutal fight.”

“Male tigers sometimes kill female ones when they don’t cooperate while mating and the act of ‘eating the flesh’ could be a result of vengeance. The incident may have occurred on Monday night as the body was 24-36 hours old and there were signs of rigor mortis,” Pathak added.

Siddharth Singh, one of the tourists who saw the carcass, said, “The carcass was found in forest’s tourism zone and tourists gathered there. Plants present at the spot were completely damaged which suggest that the fight was fierce.”

There is a demand from the aspirants that district level job mela should be conducted regularly. In this regard, we will place this demand before the deputy commissioner and try to organise district level job mela once in two months,” said Jyothi.

“The job mela has failed to attract top companies and there is not much for MCom students,” said M Mega, who had come empty handed after going through job mela.

KN Nishanth, a BCom student said: “There is good opportunity. I have submitted my resume to four to five companies and they have assured me that they will get back to me in a day or two. Deaf and dumb students who had completed ITI in fitter too had come for job mela which will conclude on Thursday.”

NAGPUR: Vigilant invigilators at a centre of HSC exam on Tuesday booked a BSc student who was appearing for the exam for his friend. The BSc student had changed the photo on the hall ticket of the friend to evade being caught.

Bajaj Nagar police have registered a case of fraud against the HSC candidate and his friend. The accused have been identified as Rahul Bagde and his friend Vinay Maurya, both 20 and residents of Bhim Nagar.

According to police, the actual candidate was Maurya and as his sister was getting married in Uttar Pradesh , he wanted to attend the wedding. He asked Rahul, a third year BSc student, to appear for his English paper scheduled for February 18.

Maurya’s centre for exam was Nutan Bharat Junior College. Maurya and Rahul made a fake hall ticket with latter’s photo and also took its colour printout.

While Maurya left for UP for wedding, Rahul went to the centre to appear in the exam. While checking hall tickets, invigilators suspected something fishy. While taking signatures of candidates, invigilators spotted difference in photo on the hall ticket and one on list of students.

Invigilator then informed Bajaj Nagar police about the dummy candidate appearing in the exam. During questioning, Rahul revealed his real name and also told cops he was impersonating Maurya as latter was attending his sister’s wedding.

Senior PI of Bajaj Nagar police station RA Kshirsagar said, “We have not arrested the BSc student or the HSC candidate as he is out of station. We have given a notice to the BSc student regarding the incident and a probing further.”

400,['20/02/2020'],Narayanasamy asks police to end ganja menace in Pondy,"This story is from February 20, 2020

Puducherry: Regretting that even school students , including girls in Puducherry , have started using ganja, chief minister V Narayanasamy said he has directed police to unearth the source of supply of the contraband and initiate concrete measures to curtail the drug menace in the territory.

He was speaking at the inaugural of a two-day capacity building programme on drug abuse prevention for school teachers, organised by the state social welfare board in association with the national institute of social defence, Union social justice and empowerment ministry on Wednesday.

Narayanasamy went on to the extent of saying that a woman anti-social in Tiruvannamalai remains the main source of ganja that reaches Puducherry by train. Ganja peddlers in Puducherry, on receiving the contraband, use children to sell it in small sachets to tourists who gather at popular landmarks and to shops near schools and colleges.

He said he has directed the director-general of police to send a team to Tiruvannamalai to identify the source of the contraband and initiate stringent action to eradicate the menace. He regretted that police fail to maintain a constant vigil on peddlers despite his repeated directions.

“Once in three months, a meeting is convened with top police officers. We instruct them to keep constant vigil and prevent peddling of ganja into Puducherry. Police initiate action and after two days do not keep up the vigil,” Narayanasamy said.

He said the government cannot enforce total prohibition as it depends on the revenue generated through liquor sales but quickly added that the government will initiate efforts to reduce the sale of alcoholic beverages in a phased manner in Puducherry.

The chief minister said that repeated efforts to secure more financial assistance from the Union government have not yielded any positive results. “The Union government extends 42% financial grants to Tamil Nadu, but provides just 26% for Puducherry. Earlier, we used to get grants close to 70%. I called on the Prime Minister and other ministers seeking additional assistance, but nothing has materialised so far,” he said.

Narayanasamy appealed to the social welfare department to rise to the occasion and spearhead campaigns to create awareness among people on the ill-effects of use drug abuse. He also appealed to all sections of society to lend a helping hand to the government to transform Puducherry into a drug-free territory. “It is the primary duty of the government to ensure a drug-free society, but teachers and parents play a significant role,” he said.

The five-year validity of the last accreditation ended in September 2019.The reevaluation is now taking place in the monsoon of 2020, late by a whole year since validity of the last accreditation ended. This is because the Goa University itself had written to the state government last year that it wants to postpone the accreditation process.The GU is currently in the process of filling up its vacant faculty positions and the university does not want to apply for reassessment by NAAC before the posts are filled, as it may lead to the university losing out points.Over the last five years, a lot has changed with the NAAC assessment process.“NAAC has altered its accreditation process. Earlier, a lot depended on the NAAC peer team’s visit, where they inspected facilities and interacted with students, faculty and parents of students. Now, the peer team’s visit will carry only 30% weightage. NAAC has given 70% weightage now to purely quantitative assessment, like the qualifications of teachers, the number of teachers working on permanent basis, etc,” explained an official.“If GU had to apply for NAAC accreditation, before its vacant posts were filled, its grade would slide,”the official added.GU currently has close to 50% of its posts lying vacant and the process of filling up these positions is on.Once the university fills up its posts, it will submit its self-study report to NAAC, following which the peer team’s visit will be fixed and then the accreditation will be awarded.In 2014, Goa University had finally managed to shed its ‘B’ grade and upgrade itself to an ‘A’ grade.The Union HRD ministry has now changed the categories of grading for NAAC by introducing catergorisations like A1, A2, AC1, AC2 and so on, with A1 being the highest grade.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74219647,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-160614,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gus-accreditation-by-natl-council-slotted-for-jul-aug/articleshow/74216663.cms

Madurai: Tension prevailed in the city as more than 1,000 people including 200 women, predominantly from the Muslim community, who gathered at Tamil Sangam Building started marching on Dr Thangaraj Road towards Madurai district collector office demanding the state government to pass a resolution stating that the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Population Register (NPR) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) will not be implemented.

A large number of policemen were deployed at various pockets in the city. Policemen wearing protective gears were deployed at vantage points. The entire area around the collectorate was brought under police control. Police have put up barricades in at least six spots on Dr Thangaraj Road. Madurai city police commissioner S Davidson Devasirvatham supervised the security arrangements. Higher officials including deputy commissioners of police E Karthick (law and order), K Sugumaran (traffic) and K Palanikumar coordinated security measure.

The crowd gathered at Tamil Sangam Building started marching towards the collector office at 11 am. But police stopped the march immediately near Madurai corporation swimming pool and warned the protestors not to move beyond it as the march was not permitted by police.

Leaders of Jamaat Ul Ulama Sabai, who organized the protest, addressed the gathering. They said that a delegation will meet the district collector and hand over a petition. They asked the gathering to leave the place without creating any law and order issue. A section of people was reluctant to leave and sat on the road for some time. However, after a few Ulama members spoke, they started leaving the place peacefully.

An elderly person, who brought a can full of kerosene, doused himself with kerosene. One of the protestors, Syed Ahamed Basha, said, “We stopped him and asked him to leave the place at once after warning him not to take part in other protests.”

Meanwhile, the protest at Mahaboobpalayam continued for the sixth consecutive day on Wednesday. The protest at Nelpettai also continued for the third day.

Similar protests were staged in all the southern districts including Tuticorin, Tirunelveli, Tenkasi and Kanyakumari. A large number of police personnel were deployed at each protest venue.

CCP commissioner Sanjit Rodrigues also said that local residents who stay near the stretches where pay-parking has been implemented are not being charged to park their vehicles.“Traffic movement has improved after pay-parking began.

405,['20/02/2020'],IIT Powai exposes excess billing scam in MSEDCL,"This story is from February 20, 2020

Representative image

Nagpur: Even as MSEDCL is grappling with the revelations of the report of Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission ’s (MERC’s) working group on agricultural power consumption, TOI has got hold of a report prepared by IIT Powai that had exposed excess billing by the discom in 2017.

According to IIT Powai’s study, agricultural power consumption in the state is only around 55% of that claimed by MSEDCL. This implies that MSEDCL has indulged in jugglery of thousands of crores in the last fifteen to twenty years.

When Chandrashekhar Bawankule of BJP became the energy minister, he received several complaints of excess billing of farmers. He had constituted a fact-finding committee in July 2015 to look into the complaints. The committee asked IIT Powai to determine the consumption by doing a survey across the state. The committee was headed by MSEB Holding Company director Vishwas Pathak and had power experts Pratap Hogade and Ashish Chandarana as members. MSEDCL is governed by the Holding Company.

The revelations of IIT’s study were so damaging that Pathak refused to sign the report of the fact finding committee. The report was submitted to the Holding Company in July 2017 with the signature of only Hogade and Chandarana. The Company has not taken any action on the report since then.

Pathak admitted that he had refused to sign the report. “Hogade and Chandarana were more interested in publicity. They refused to take into account the positive things being done by MSEDCL by using technology. I therefore prepared a separate report and submitted it to the Holding Company. Mine was accepted while theirs was rejected,” he told TOI. He, however, accepted that the Company had not acted on his report too.

Bawankule refused to comment on why no action was taken on the report despite repeated calls and text messages for three days. Incumbent energy minister Nitin Raut said that he was not aware of the existence of the report.

The committee in its report concluded that the estimated agriculture power sale was 15,093 million units (MU) against 25,685 MU (58.76%) reported for 14-15 by MSEDCL and 14,973 MU against 27,505 MU (54.43%) reported for 2015-16.

IIT’s figure is on the higher side, which is evident from the assumptions made by it. IIT calculated low tension (LT) distribution loss at 23% but considered 25% for the sake of calculations. It states that agricultural feeders get power for 8 to 10 hours a day but 12 hours was being considered. It has been assumed that agricultural pumps work for 300 days a year. This assumption is fallacious as pumps work for 300 days only in irrigated areas. Most of the state has dryland agriculture where the third crop is not possible due to unavailability of water. If these factors are taken into account, MSEDCL’s inflation of sales figures is higher than that calculated by IIT.

Hogade alleged that MSEDCL indulged in this jugglery to conceal its massive failure in curbing power theft. “Had MSEDCL actually brought down distribution loss to 15%, our power tariff would have been considerably lower,” he told TOI.

The fact finding committee had recommended that “Considering the higher percentage of losses observed by the IIT and the committee, it is necessary that any unauthorized use of power and theft of power should be strictly prohibited and should be treated strictly in accordance with the law. The committee recommends that the regular theft detection drive should be taken by the MSEDCL to reduce the losses on this account.”

The committee also stated that “For the purpose of tariff hike petitions, agricultural connected load as per MSEDCL data is considered. Attempting to justify higher consumption hours, high unauthorized and illegal load under the ambit of agricultural sales and thereby claiming direct subsidy from state government and cross subsidy from the rest of the subsidizing consumers is unfair and unlawful practice. In our view, it needs to be avoided and stopped fully within minimum possible period. Appropriate authority can take suitable decision in this regard.”

IIT Powai has observed in its report that MSEDCL’s method of estimating agricultural power consumption has been faulty right from the beginning. “There has been no convergence over the years to a reliable methodology to calculate agricultural consumption. The method followed by the Commission in 2006-07 had already thrown up very unreliable metering data. The current situation may be worse as observed from the preliminary field data and from some analysis of metering data of Nasik and Aurangabad zones.”

407,['20/02/2020'],1 more Indian on Japanese ship tests positive for COVID-19,"This story is from February 20, 2020

Madurai: The Indian embassy in Tokyo has confirmed that one more Indian crew on board quarantined ship Diamond Princess at Yokohama in Japan has tested positive for COVID-19. The cruise ship management said that more countries have airlifted their citizens – passengers and crew members – from the ship on Wednesday.

One Indian crew who tested positive for COVID-19 is among the 88 new cases identified on Tuesday. They have been taken to a hospital for treatment, reads a tweet by the Indian Embassy in Japan. This takes the total Indians on board the ship getting treated after testing positive for COVID-19 to seven, till 9pm (Japan time) on Wednesday and that their health condition is improving. The embassy added that disembarkation of passengers has started and is likely to continue till February 21.

The embassy is yet to respond to queries on the number of Indian crew members who had expressed their interest in prematurely ending the 14-day mandatory quarantine that began on February 19. “Countries have already started airlifting their citizens from the ship. We have been waiting for the government of India to fly us home. It’s been three days since the US evacuated their citizens and three days since we filled the forms given by the Indian embassy asking our willingness to prematurely leave the ship,” said Anbalagan, 41, a crew member from Madurai.

On Wednesday, the crew was given forms asking whether they had any symptoms of COVID-19. “We were informed that swab samples will be collected from us on Thursday. We are in fear that the delay in evacuation could lead to every one of us getting infected. Whenever a country evacuates their citizens, we hope that the government of India will be next,” he said. Princess Cruises, the operator of Diamond Princess, on their official website confirmed that that the embassies of Canada, Australia and Hong Kong are coordinating the evacuation of their guests and crew via chartered flights on Wednesday. It said that according to Japanese ministry of health, the disembarkation process for individuals who are not taking government repatriation flights will start on Wednesday.

“The disembarkation process will take several days, since they will be tested, and the testing and results require two to three days to complete,” it stated. An internal communication from Susan Coskey, senior vice-president of HR-global fleet operations, to the crew members on Wednesday stated that they are of the understanding that most (if not all) teammates will have to undergo a minimum of 14 days additional quarantine once guests have disembarked. They are in discussion with the Japanese government on where and how it will take place, including whether this will be on the ship or ashore.

“An increasing number of governments are arranging charter air travel for their citizens to complete their quarantine periods in their home countries. This includes New Zealand, Hong Kong, India, Philippines, South Korea, Indonesia, Italy/European Union and United Kingdom (as a second flight),” she added. Delay in evacuating the crew members has left the families of the five from Tamil Nadu worried as they were expecting to fly home any time.

PANAJI: The six juveniles, who had escaped from the state protective home Apna Ghar late Tuesday night, were found by police in the early hours of Wednesday and have been lodged at the home again. While three of the boys were found hiding at a construction site on the Kadamba Plateau, the other three were traced to Karmali Railway Station.

The six were planning to board a train to Mumbai, sub-divisional police officer, North Goa, Uttam Raut Dessai said.

Officials, however, said that another juvenile, who had escaped from Apna Ghar earlier this month, remains untraceable.

“At 10.30pm on Tuesday, the matron of Apna Ghar, Esperanca Menezes, called the PCR to inform that six juveniles had managed to escape from the Merces facility, at around 9.45pm. PI KP Sinari, along with his staff, rushed to Apna Ghar. He noticed that the juveniles had tied bedsheets together to climb into the CWC section of the home. They then escaped through the windows by removing the grilles and later scaled the home’s compound wall,” Dessai said. He said that the window grilles had been dislodged by the juveniles with their bare hands.

They also jammed the locks of the dormitory, locking the caretakers inside, Dessai said.

Police personnel were then deployed to search for the juveniles. A thorough search was conducted, wherein three of the juveniles were spotted near Gera School, hiding at an under-construction site. It was learnt from the three that the six planned to flee to Mumbai by train from Karmali Railway Station. Accordingly, the other three juveniles were caught trying to board the train.

“When I visited Apna Ghar, I found that there was no proper illumination around the premises, which helps the juveniles escape onto the road without being noticed. This needs to be attended to,” said Dessai. Several of the six juveniles who tried to run away were involved in a cheating case in Calangute , and have been lodged at Apna Ghar for more than six months now.

The other juvenile who had escaped from Apna Ghar earlier and remains untraceable, managed to flee while being taken to court.

PANAJI: Following criticism by the opposition that the government has been delaying the reservation of wards for the zilla panchayat elections scheduled for March 22, panchayats minister Mauvin Godinho on Wednesday, said that he has already cleared the file pertaining to reservation of wards.

“I cleared the file long ago and handed it over to the State Election Commission (SEC). No file is pending with me, whether it is about ZP election reservations or date of the election,” said Godinho while responding to media queries.

Both, the reservation of wards and programme for conducting the elections, Godinho said, will have to be decided by the SEC.

Godinho however, declined to comment when pointed out that the SEC has stated that it is yet to receive the file concerned. “I cannot say anything on their statement,” he said.

Earlier, the BJP-led government was also questioned over delays in announcing the ZP election date.

The government had hinted that ZP elections would be held in mid-March. Recently, chief minister Pramod Sawant said the election will be held on March 22.

It was speculated that the delay in announcing the ZP polls was due to the time taken in deciding a favorable reservation for the ruling party.

Though BJP enjoys a brute majority in the House of 40 representatves, the ZP election results will reflect the mood of the people towards it, a year ahead of the state assembly elections. The ZP elections will be fought on party lines

CHANDIGARH: More than nine years after a 26-year-old realtor of Panchkula was tied up with an iron chain, locked inside his car and the vehicle set ablaze, a trial court has acquitted all the accused of his murder and indicted the special investigation team (SIT) for a poor probe.The SIT, which was led by Harmeet Singh, PPS, had conducted only a “formal investigation,” and brought no concrete evidence, according to the court.The 90-page verdict released on Tuesday evening said the police failed to probe Sajni, with whom Suresh Kumar, the victim, was alleged to be having an affair. Even Sajni’s sister Rajni as well as Neelam, whose phone had allegedly been used by Sajni to call Suresh, had not been examined by the prosecution, the court observed.“The police had failed to investigate and find the facts as disclosed by accused Raj Kumar and Mohinder Pal during their brain mapping tests. No efforts were made to obtain evidence about a contract killing and to trace Mohna Baba (the alleged contract killer), if any,” the court observed.Highlighting further loopholes in the investigation, the trial court of Monika Goyal, additional sessions court, Mohali, observed that the police did not try to trace the scattered glasses of the car, to find out if the accused had beaten Suresh at one place or not or only taken him to Baddi-Siswan road to burn him along with his car.“Apart from the results of tests (polygraph), no other corroborative evidence was brought on record. The results of the tests can only lead to suspicion of the involvement of the accused in the crime, but do not prove the case of prosecution beyond reasonable doubt. Moreover, no brain mapping and polygraph test of accused Gurwinder Singh, Harjinder Singh and Kamal Kumar were conducted,” the trial judge observed in her orders.The court said the prosecution had failed to trace call details and route of Suresh through his mobile and not enquired about his friends with whom he had gone to watch a movie on the fateful night.On November 26, 2010, the burnt body of Suresh, a resident of Mansa Devi complex Panchkula, was found in his car near Siswan village on the Mullanpur-Baddi highway. His body was beyond recognition and identified only from the partly-burnt number plate of his car. He was running a real estate business from Kharar.

Police sources said that cracker production work started in the factory at the usual time. It is suspected that the source of the fire could be the vehicle. On being alerted, fire and rescue services personnel from Vembakottai rushed to the spot. The Sattur police registered a case.

415,['20/02/2020'],SC directs state govt tostop illegal sand mining,"This story is from February 20, 2020

New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Wednesday ordered state district collectors and superintendents of police to take immediate steps to stop massive illegal sand mining in Rajasthan and ordered the Central Empowered Committee (CEC) to probe allegations that the sand mafia is having a free run in the state.

The order came after state government’s additional advocate general Manish Singhvi confirmed fears of petitioner Navin Sharma that illegal mining was rampant in the state despite SC orders. Singhvi said that against an annual demand for sand of around 70 million tonnes, only 2 million tonnes were being produced by those having leases currently.

“Naturally, there will be rampant illegal sand mining. So, please vacate the stay on grant of new leases by the state. When there is huge demand for sand and so little is being produced legally, it will lead to illegal mining. This will result in a loss of revenue for the state and create a law and order situation,” he told a bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and justices B R Gavai and Surya Kant.

After ordering the state government, collectors and SPs to immediately stop illegal sand mining, the bench asked the CEC to carry out a detailed investigation into the issue and the allegation that the sand mafia was having a free run. It empowered the CEC to summon any government officer, examine records and asked it to submit a report with recommendations in six weeks.

“We find that it is not disputed by anyone, including the state government, that illegal sand mining is rampant in Rajasthan. This cannot be allowed to continue. We direct the Rajasthan government and collector and SP of each district in Rajasthan to take immediate steps for stopping illegal sand mining as there is no doubt that such unbridled sand mining is likely to damage the environment irreparably,” the bench said.

Appearing for NGO ‘Dastak’, senior advocate Vikas Singh said to circumvent the rule that requires environment clearance for mining in over five acres of land, the state government had devised an ingenious way out by leasing four acres of land on flood plains which does not require a green nod.

The court asked the CEC to hear representatives of the state government, the ministry of environment and forests, petitioner Navin Sharma, NGO ‘Dastak and all stakeholders before finalising its report.

416,['20/02/2020'],"HC bells big CAT delay, asks date of landing at airport","This story is from February 20, 2020

Chandigarh: The Punjab and Haryana High court on Wednesday directed all stakeholders to categorically file an affidavit stating clearly by when the Chandigarh international airport will be CAT-III enabled, observing that an airport does not become international by merely naming it one.

The CAT III-B Instrument Landing System (ILS) allows flights to land safely in low visibility of 50 metres. It lets aircraft land with runway visual range (RVR) of up to 50m with a decision height of 15m.

The court pointed out that due to visibility issues in Chandigarh, even the Chief Justice of India could not reach the city on time as his flight was delayed by 2 hours. The court said it should be informed whether CAT-III installation is possible or not, directing the amicus curiae to file a report mentioning the exact situation after consulting all the stakeholders. The court further observed that even after spending Rs 2,000 crore in five years, the airport does not have all the facilities and international operators are shirking away from operating from here.

The court was informed that the installation of CAT-III will be done in a phased manner and it is not possible immediately as certain defence installations have to be removed. CAT-I approach lights will be installed on the runway by AAI at the earliest and upgradation to CAT-II and CAT-III undertaken, the court was told.

Puneet Bali, the counsel for petitioner Mohali Industries Association, responded that the airport has not become CAT-III enabled even after spending Rs 2,000 crore. He said what to talk of CAT-III, the airport is not even fully equipped with CAT-II, the reason behind international operators staying away. He accused the “hotel lobby” of working behind the scenes.

“Someone should be prosecuted and an inquiry marked to the CBI to find out why even after five years of operation, the airport is not equipped with CAT-II and CAT-III,” Bali said. “There is someone behind the scene who is playing the ball,” he alleged. Assistant Solicitor General of India Chetan Mittal refuted all the charges, saying extra efforts have been made to make the airport CAT-II and CAT-III ready. “It is painful to hear that despite serious efforts, charges have been levelled by the advocate,” he said.

The court observed if operational issues, like the defence airport being near, were one of the causes, then Chandigarh should not have been made an international airport. “There were so many other airports in Punjab, like Ludhiana, that could have been chosen and made international,” the court said.

Mittal, however, claimed not a single flight was diverted because of visibility. To this, the court cited the recent delay in the flight of the Chief Justice of India.

Mittal said even if the airport is CAT-II enabled, a lot depends on the skills of the pilot to take off or land during low visibility. The court then said just naming an airport international does not make it one; international flights are required to take-off or land her. The court pointed out that that if the issue of visibility can be solved in Amritsar airport, then why not in Chandigarh?

OBSERVATIONS

Just naming an airport international does not make it one

Even after spending Rs 2,000 crore in five years, the airport does not have all the facilities and international operators are shirking away from operating from here

If operational issues are the reasons behind the delay, Chandigarh should not have been made an international airport

Open Sky policy

A meeting of senior representative of Punjab, Haryana, Airport Authority of India and CHIAL concluded that addition, deletion or substitution in the list of 18 tourist destination will not be advisable and instead it will be better to encourage Indian carriers to start international flights from Chandigarh. It was observed that designated airlines of the US and UK had access to any point in India and they can undertake operations to Chandigarh

GoAir for Thailand

The high court was informed that private airlines GoAir has shown interest in starting a flight between Chandigarh and Thailand. It was agreed that CHIAL would do everything possible to facilitate commencement of such flights by GO air. All other airlines said international flights from Chandigarh will not be commercially viable due to inadequate traffic

Air India response

Air India stated that it was providing good international connectivity to Chandigarh by its hub-and-spoke operation

Madurai: The city crime branch (CCB) police have arrested four more people in connection with the issue of fake driving licence and batch from Madurai North RTO office. Police officials said that so far 16 people have been arrested in the case, which was registered in August, 2019.

A CCB official said the four have been identified as Soundarasubbiah, contract employee engaged through a private company for the online facility, driving school owners Pandiarajan and Muthuraman from Madurai and broker Abbas. They have been remanded in prison on Tuesday.

In March, last year a message spread on WhatsApp promising to get driving licence for two-wheelers, cars, heavy vehicles and batches within three days without any test. A phone number was also provided in the message. Applicants have to provide their Aadhaar, blood group details and phone number, the message had stated, police said.

There were copies of a few licences attached to the message, which were purportedly obtained by the brokers, circumventing mandatory procedures required to get a licence including a test.

The shocked regional transport office (RTO) officials and employees checked with their repository using the details found on the licence copies and found that they were not recorded in their database. However, when the officials further checked, it was found that the licences were issues through Sarathi Parivahan online facility, which was meant for replacing missing licences, police said.

Elvis gomes

PANAJI: Aam Aadmi Party said on Monday that the party’s decisive victory in Delhi has proved that good governance and work can win elections, and that the Narendra Modi-Amit Shah duo was not invincible. The party said that it was working on a similar roadmap for Goa.

The party said it would contest the upcoming Zilla Panchayat elections, and had begun the process to select probable candidates for certain seats.

“AAP has shown that Modi and Shah are not invincible. We will try to implement a similar roadmap here in Goa,” said Elvis Gomes .

Arvind Kejriwal led AAP to a massive victory for the second time in the Delhi assembly polls, dealing a body blow to BJP and completely decimating the Congress. Gomes, who attended the swearing-in ceremony in New Delhi, is counting on the victory to give the party a boost in Goa too.

“Our political ideology is work, and that is what we promise — to give everyone basic necessities. The common man in Delhi is happy with AAP’s victory. We will try to capitalise on this in Goa,” said Gomes.

Gomes also questioned the state government’s “anti-people” policies and criticised chief minister Pramod Sawant for coming out with policies that were not adequately studied.

“At every stage, the Goa government flounders. It looks like there is no foundation behind the policies of this government. Over the past few days, three decisions were reversed. Who is running this government? Don’t they have any vision?” said Gomes.

Asked about the party’s preparations for the upcoming ZP elections, Gomes said that AAP had already started its preliminary work. “If I have to fight the elections, how do I know if a particular seat is reserved or not. The State Election Commission is favouring BJP and keeping them informed about which seats are reserved. What is the use of conducting elections?” Gomes asked.

419,['20/02/2020'],Haphazard parking on city roads a major menace to commuters,"This story is from February 20, 2020

Madurai: Many important roads in the city, like the Panagal Road where the Government Rajaji Hospital is situated have become congested due to haphazard parking of vehicles.

Wide roads have been divided in a move to reduce accidents in many parts of the city. This is helping to some extent. But, as people park their cars and two-wheelers on both sides of the roads it causes heavy traffic congestion during the peak hours. “Police only take note of rickshaws, autos and cycles parked on the road, but if it is a luxury car they are not questioned,” said an auto driver, Manikandan.

One major reason for the haphazard parking is the series of eateries which have lined up the road. “Sometimes there are three rows of two-wheelers parked in front of these shops which leads to heavy congestion,” said K Pandiarajan, a regular commuter on this road.

The congestion due to parking on the roadsides is a major problem at Suguna store junction in Anna Nagar. Many shops have encroached the road and made it their own parking space. As the pavements are badly damaged on this stretch, people are forced to walk between the parked vehicles.

Kamarajar Salai, a trading area, is difficult to navigate through in the mornings and evenings. “The problem worsens on days when functions are held in the halls on this road. Vehicles jostle with each other for parking space and end up blocking the road,” said S Manimaran of Kamarajar Salai.

The four Masi Streets which is under construction near the temple becomes chaotic during the peak hours when load vehicles enter these roads and park in every available space. “If someone gets sick or during emergency situations we will cannot even rush them to the hospital because of the haphazard parking,” said Shanthi of West Masi Street.

The road beyond the collectorate near the Gandhi Museum gets narrowed to less than five feet in the evenings when vehicles are parked haphazardly by people who visit the temple and an eatery near it. “This is a place which needs constant monitoring by the traffic police,’’ said Elizharasan of Anna Nagar.

Deputy commissioner of police (traffic), Madurai, K Sugumaran said that they are trying to regulate parking on roads. Autorickshaws are the major menace and regulation would be better once the Smart City works are completed.

Madurai: The Madurai Corporation is planning to provide free WiFi facility for visitors of Anna Maaligai, the main building of the civic body, and at the Eco Park, a green lung located adjoining the campus, which attracts a large number of residents for recreational and fitness activities.

The corporation is planning to provide the facility with the help of a private telecommunications company headquartered in Bengaluru, which has agreed to provide the service free of cost. Visitors can make use of the facility, which will be restricted for only 45 minutes to each mobile phone. Hundreds of job aspirants thronging the Anna Maaligai campus, where they prepare regularly for the exams, will be benefited by the facility.

“To prevent misuse, only 45 minutes will be provided for each user to start with. This will ensure more people can use internet at good speed,” said a corporation official.

Commissioner S Visakan said that work to provide the facility will soon begin. The commissioner said that after successful installation of the facility on the corporation premises and Eco Park, it will be extended to other busy parks such as Vandiyur park in future.

He also said that free WiFi facility which has already been introduced in many corporation schools with the help of the same company, will be extended to more schools soon. Internet helps the students access study materials fast and equip themselves better, he said.

K Vadivelan from a village near Melur, one of the government job aspirants, said the facility will be helpful for people like him to access online resources for their preparation. Although they have data on their phone, WiFi would be a preferred option due to poor network connectivity, he said.

Corporation officials said the facility will attract more people to Eco Park. The park has been provided with fitness equipment. Lighting has also been improved recently where a gigantic art work has been created from scrap iron.

HYDERABAD: In a significant arrest, Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) sleuths caught a key accused in Tamil Nadu for his role in the Rs 750-crore imported gold fraud case .Nagasiddu Sunil, who has been evading police for over nine months, was arrested in Pavoorchatram town in Tenkasi district on Monday and brought to Hyderabad on a prisoner transit warrant.Sunil was produced on Wednesday the Nampally criminal court, which remanded him in judicial custody. Sunil, who was working for Srikrishna Exim LLP, a unit of Hyderabad Gems SEZ in Raviryal near Shamshabad, was accused of diverting imported foreign gold and misdeclaration of exports.“As per preliminary estimates, around 1,800kg of imported duty-free gold worth Rs 750 crore has been fraudulently diverted and sold in local markets by Srikrishna,” DRI sources said.In a remand report filed in the economic offences wing court, DRI had said that Sunil had been avoiding arrest for the past nine months and hiding in various places in Karnataka, TN and Pune. The DRI sleuths tracked him in Pavoorchatram, where he was hiding along with his wife and son, and arrested him. The accused was produced first in a Madurai court on Tuesday.Sources said Sunil was sending money and paying tuition fee of his son. First, he went to Mannerhal in Karnataka to hide and then to Pune, the sleuths said.DRI said Srikrishna Exim was importing huge quantities of duty-free gold, but passed it as gold manufactured in the SEZ and exported it.DRI officials found that the company was exporting bogus ornaments — mostly made of semi-precious and colour stones with very little gold — by declaring them as ‘studded jewellery’.The firm was then diverting the imported gold into the domestic market in Hyderabad, the DRI said. Sunil used to collect the imported gold and deliver it to various jewellers in the city.A probe into this scam began on May 3 last year after the DRI conducted searches at the SEZ unit and other places in Hyderabad. During the searches, DRI found in an export consignment that gold content declared was 19,374 gram, whereas the government-approved valuers’ report said it was just 565 gram. The weight of semi-precious stones declared in the invoice was 2,060 gram, whereas the actual weight of the semi-precious stones was 20,850 gram. The total worth of jewellery to be exported was declared at Rs 5.45 crore, while the valuers’ report put it at Rs 22 lakh.During the searches, it was also found that Rs 6.1 crore worth excess gold was recorded in the stocks. Discrepancies were found in the stock statement and the stock.

Panaji: Going ahead with the plan to setup a bio-digester plant at Chicalim, the Goa Waste Management Corporation (GWMC) is now looking for an agency to set up and operate the plant for a five-year period.

The plant will help treat garbage generated around the Goa International Airport at Dabolim.

Airports Authority of India has already approved an amount of Rs 15 crore to fund the 10-tonne per day (TPD) biodigester plant under its corporate social responsibility programme.

“The 10 TPD bio-digester with two reinforced concrete cement tanks of five TPD each has to be set up in Chicalim panchayat jurisdiction in plot number 7/1 and in the 3,000sqm of land demarcated for waste management purpose,” said GWMC.

GWMC is looking for agencies which have at least three years’ prior experience in managing solid waste for a state government or at the municipal level.

According to GWMC’s specifications, the bio-digestor plant will generate power, which will be utilised for its own operations. The biodigester plant will treat garbage generated from Chicalim panchayat, Chicolna - Bogmalo panchayat, Sancoale panchayat, part of Hollant and waste from AAI.

According to GWMC officials, the bio-digester plant is likely to come up in 8 to 10 months.

A memorandum of understanding will be signed between Chicalim panchayat, GWMC and AAI with regards the funding and operations of the plant.

Along with the bio-digester plant, four materials recovery facility (MRF) sheds, a baling machine, forklifts and dustbins to help curb the garbage menace around the airport are also planned.

They had sought that the land use map and register for the Margao planning area be quashed and prepared afresh as per the Town and Country Planning Act, 1974 and Planning and Development Authority Rules, 1977.

The petitioners had also objected to the sub-classifications adopted while zoning areas for land use.

NMC engineers almost never impose fines on MSEDCL contractors for the trenches

NAGPUR: The apathy of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) engineers, or their nexus with contractors of Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL), has turned trenches into death traps on main roads as well as in lanes of residential areas. The engineers almost never impose fines on contractors for trenches, though the cash-strapped NMC is losing money on road repairs.

TOI had, on January 22, reported that workers of a MSEDCL contractor damaged NMC’s drinking water pipeline on newly constructed cement concrete road at Sahakar Nagar. Gallons of drinking water went waste, and paver blocks on the roadside were also damaged, along with disruption in water supply.

Some 28 days later, the engineers of NMC water works department and Laxmi Nagar Zone are yet to register FIR against contractor, levy a penalty, recover the loss, or even get the road restored.

Engineers of NMC water works department told TOI a proposal to recover penalty has been prepared. “Laxmi Nagar Zone should ensure restoration of road,” they said.

NMC Laxmi Nagar Zone engineers only said they will ensure restoration is done by the MSEDCL contractor.

RTI activist TH Naidu has alleged NMC engineers do not take action as there is a nexus between them and MSEDCL contractors. “There has been no action by NMC against contractor for 28 days in the latest case, which proves the nexus. NMC engineers are shielding the contractor despite inconvenience to people and loss to the civic body,” he said.

In residential areas of Swavalambi Nagar and Trimurti Nagar, MSEDCL contractors trenched roads for laying power cable over six months ago. The trenches are yet to be restored. Cables are still lying on surface layer, on sides of road, in front of gates of houses etc.

President of The Process Server Co-operative Housing Society, Swavalambi Nagar, Sanjay Nakhate said people are fed up with regular digging in residential areas. “No one from NMC visits and monitors the trenches. Over six months ago, trenches were done for power cable. Then for sewage line. For last couple of months, the sewage and storm water lines are still being laid. The road was asphalted a year ago. Now, NMC is widening the same road. It is a big loss of public money and inconvenience to citizens,” he said.

Trenches made along London Street two years ago are yet to be restored properly. In Sahakar Nagar and Sonegaon, trenches were made a month ago and are lying abandoned.

At Sahakar Nagar, trench was laid on footpath by removing paver blocks on newly constructed cement road. The paver blocks were kept in front of shops. The trenches and stock of paver blocks are still lying like that for last one month.

Naidu said NMC engineers will asphalt the roads where trenches are made by MSEDCL contractors after some months, causing more financial loss. “MSEDCL contractors even dig in some places without permission. None of the NMC engineers come and check the works,” he said.

NMC has time and again directed its engineers and MSEDCL officials to ensure restoration of trenches within one week of laying power cables. But no one is complying with the orders.

NMC also takes only nominal charges for permitting trenches, and does not take security deposit from MSEDCL contractors. The NMC recovers high charges along with security deposit from individuals and telecommunication companies that want to dig roads.

MSEDCL spokesperson said restoration will definitely be done by the contractors. “Works are yet to be completed in some areas so restoration works are yet to be started.”

428,['20/02/2020'],UT orders promotion of 2 DSPs from June 2009,"This story is from February 20, 2020

Chandigarh: The UT home department has ordered the promotion of DSP Ramgopal (CID) and DSP Kewal Krishan (traffic administration) as SPs from June 2009.

According to Punjab Police Rules (PPRs), a DSP who has completed his six-year tenure is eligible to be promoted as SP. The UT police department follows Punjab Police Rules.

However, some senior DSPs have objected to the seniority of Ramgopal. A senior DSP said how can Ramgopal be senior to him as he joined as an ASI in 1991 and he joined at the same rank two years before him.

According to the orders, Ramgopal is promoted with effect from June 1, 2009, against a vacant post following the retirement of then DSP P K Dhiman. Kewal Krishan is promoted from June 22, 2009. The ministry of home affairs had sanctioned the two new posts of DSPs for the UT police. The order stated ante-dated promotions will be subject to the outcome of court decisions in pending cases.

Though Ram Gopal had joined Chandigarh as ASI, Kewal Krishan was inducted into the UT police in 1989. The two were promoted to the rank of DSP in January 2016 and given the benefit of promotions since February 2011.

DSP Kewal Krishan approached the Punjab and Haryana high court demanding promotion benefits since June 2009. The high court accepted his application, but the administration moved the apex court against the high court decision. Later, the Supreme Court dismissed the Special Leave Petition (SLP) in January this year. The principal home secretary, UT, then issued the orders that “Kewal Krishan be brought on the ‘G’ list and promoted as DSP with effect from the date he became eligible”.

DSP Ramgopal had also pleaded before the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) to direct the authorities to consider his claim for promotion against the existing vacancy of deputy commandant, IRB, to the rank of SP, as he being the senior-most official to be eligible according to Punjab Police Rules.

However, two DSPs Jaswinder Singh and Udaypal had challenged the seniority of DSP Ramgopal in 2017. The two DSPs had mentioned that they are senior in cadre since they joined the Chandigarh Police as ASI in 1989 whereas Ramgopal joined as ASI in 1991.

Representative image

PANAJI: The State Election Commission (SEC) continued to face criticism with Goa Forward Party (GFP) and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) openly accusing state election commissioner R K Srivastava on Wednesday of being subservient to the BJP-led government.

Slamming the SEC for the ambiguity surrounding the zilla panchayat election dates and reservation of seats, both parties accused BJP of trying to gain unfair advantage in the polls. “It is better if the State Election Commission is shut down. The state election commissioner cannot do justice to the elections,” said GFP’s general secretary Mohandas Lolienkar.

The SEC had earlier notified March 15 as the election date, but chief minister Pramod Sawant, a few days later, said that the elections would be held on March 22. GFP and AAP demanded to know why the government was making statements on behalf of a constitutional authority that is supposed to function independently.

AAP’s state convenor Elvis Gomes said, “There is no autonomy, and now the SEC is behaving like a government department”.

A few days earlier, Congress criticised the SEC for its delay in announcing the reservation of ZP seats and even alleged that it was BJP which is deciding on the reservation of seats for the ZP polls.

All the parties have claimed that the file proposing reservation of ZP seats for women, SC/ST and general category is at the BJP headquarters in Panaji.

“The file for reservation has not reached the ZP office. The state government, that is Pramod Sawant, is dictating terms to the state election commission,” said GFP vice-president Durgadas Kamat.

Kamat and Gomes, who addressed separate press conferences, said that Srivastava was “behaving as if he is on a holiday” in Goa post his retirement as chief secretary of the state.

PANAJI: The state government, which is working on amending existing laws to make it mandatory for households within 100m radius of a sewerage treatment line to get a connection, is also exploring the possibility of subsidising the initial costs, sources said.In areas like Mapusa, the charges for a sewerage connection are likely to drop to Rs 2,000 from the present Rs 5,000. Other areas, too, may get a concession on similar lines.Sewerage Treatment Plants (STP) under the Jica project are being readied at Mapusa and Calangute, while plants at Ponda and Colva are in the final stages of completion under the Sewerage and Infrastructural Development Corporation of Goa Ltd (SIDCGL).“The idea behind subsidising the cost of connections for households is to encourage more to take the connections. While concession for Mapusa area is nearly finalised, the proposal for subsidising costs for other areas is still under government consideration,” an official said.SIDCGL has proposed to the state government that it be made mandatory for households within 100m radius of a sewerage treatment line to get a connection. Currently, as per the Goa Sewerage System and Sanitation Services Management Act, 2008, and Rules, 2010, it is mandatory for households within 30m radius of a sewerage line to get a connection. But this rule was never implemented as sewerage treatment facilities in the state were still in their nascent stages when the laws were framed.SIDCGL has now called for amendments that will penalise households for whom the 100m criteria is applicable if they do not get STP connections. As penalty, they will have to pay 25% of their water bill tariff for six months. If even after this a household fails to comply, the penalty will be hiked to 50% for one year and thereafter it will be liable for disconnection of its water and electricity connections for continued violations of the new norms.The state law department had already agreed to this amendment and the finance department’s nod is awaited.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74218360,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-132883,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/subsidised-cost-for-household-sewerage-connection-mooted/articleshow/74216707.cms

Coimbatore: People seeking alms in the vicinity of the Coimbatore railway junction is not an uncommon sight. But people passing by the station for the past two days were struck by the sight of a westerner with arms stretched seeking alms.

Wearing Rudraksha mala and wristbands, the middle-aged man who was clad in a white cotton dhoti was seen thanking donors with folded hands. He never spoke a single word to anyone, but had a constant smile.

Identifying himself as Kim from Sweden, he said he had been a garden architect back home but had renounced the profession to become a volunteer for want of mental peace. “I started doing volunteer work in Sweden. I came here to take part in a meditation programme at a yoga centre and become a better person,” he said.

Since his visit to the Isha Yoga Centre, he has been seeking alms. Kim said he got to know about the meditation programme through an acquaintance in Sweden and came on a three-month visa. He plans to go back after that.

A reluctant Kim requested not to seek more information about him and his visit. However, he has become the talking point for the public who spot him in and around railway station.

“He has been here for the past two days. He would just stand quietly in a corner and would not speak to anyone. When someone donates money, he would thank them with folded hands and a pleasant smile,” said an auto driver in the locality.

A spokesperson at the Isha Yoga Center said living a simple life was a part of shivanga sadhana, a 42-day-long process that starts on Pournami and ends on Shivaratri. At the end of the sadhana, devotees would undertake a pilgrimage to the Velliangiri mountains on the city’s outskirts.

“During the process, the pilgrims will have to take alms from at least 21 people and wear either white or light colour clothes. They have to eat only two meals during the day and the first meal should be after noon,” the spokesperson said.

Yes, a two-hour drive covering a distance of 110km (from Hyderabad) will take you to a small village of Konne in Telangana’s Jangaon district where a life-size statue of Donald Trump welcomes you.An ardent devotee of the US President, Bussa Krishna has turned his modest house in the village into a shrine for Trump and has been offering pujas and performing rituals to the 6-ft tall statue. His dream is to meet his ‘god’. Krishna hopes to realise his dream when Trump lands in India on February 24 on his first visit along with his wife Melania on a two-day visit.“I am praying earnestly so that I can meet him,” he told TOI over phone from Konne. More than meeting Trump, Krishna prays for his well-being and re-election as President of the US.Krishna (32) first began worshipping Trump four years ago when the US President appeared in his dream. “It was an early morning dream. I saw Trump in the dream,” he recalled.Is it the only reason that turned him into a staunch devotee of Trump, perform pujas to his photograph and erect a statue by spending Rs2 lakh? “Trump came again in my dream and this time told me that India would win the cricket match (during the 2019 World Cup) against Pakistan.” When it came true, Krishna’s belief in Trump soared further.Krishna, who is a farmer, immediately engaged 20 persons and erected the statue on June 14 last year. Initially, villagers called him mad. “People of my village used to make fun of me. But when it soon became known that Trump Temple is only such shrine in the world, they started taking me seriously and accepted my admiration for my god,” he said.Some villagers even called him a disgrace. “I told them that when they can worship and offer prayers to lord Shiva or lord Rama, I believe in Trump and want to worship him. His parents and other family members also join him now in offering puja to Trump. He offers vermilion, turmeric, flowers and performs ‘harathi’ to the statue. “I perform all the rituals and pujas to Trump like how we do it for our gods.”If he is heading to the fields or a shop, he always carries a photograph of Trump with him. “I always carry Trump’s photograph in my bag, wear a T-shirt with his photograph and even take a dip in the water holding my god’s photograph.” So much so, villagers call him ‘Trump Krishna.’Krishna sold a piece of land he had and bought a small house.

The national medical education regulator has found 29 major flaws during the physical and academic inspection of this college.

If the college administration fails to rectify these deficiencies within a month, it may lose renewal of permission to admit students for MBBS first-year batch for the academic year 2020-21.

According to the notice issued by S Savitha, assistant secretary of MCI, the college is facing 20.75% deficiency of faculty and 46.77% shortage of residents. According to MCI rules, if the faculty deficiency is more than 20%, such institute is not considered for renewal of admissions.

“Since deficiencies of faculty and residents are more than 20%, you are hereby issued a show cause notice as to why rule 8(3) (1)(b) of Establishment of Medical College Regulation (amendment) 2010, part II dated February 5, 2019, should not be applied,” reads the notice. This clause has provision to deny permission to renew admissions for current academic year.

The MCI board of governors has sought point-wise explanation from the college and documentary evidence in support of rectification of the deficiencies noted by the board.

The inspection of Gondia GMC was conducted on December 9 and 10 last year. The 2020-21 batch will be fifth of the first-year MBBS in this college. Interestingly, in 2016-17, the state government had given an undertaking that it would rectify all deficiencies in this college within three months.

The chalk-white lungs have been created using HEPA filters, which are also used in operation theatres, anti-pollution masks and other places to trap dust. “The lungs have also been fitted with fans that will suck in the air to mimic the functioning of lungs while breathing,” said CSD director Leena Buddhe.

Over the next few weeks, the particulate matter from dust pollution and vehicular emissions will start getting trapped in the HEPA filters. “This will lead to the lungs changing colour — from chalk-white to brown to black. The billboard is also fitted with a digital air quality monitor that will record and display the real-time Air Quality Index (AQI),” added Buddhe.

Similar lungs installed in Mumbai in January this year turned black in just two weeks. The lungs installed in New Delhi in November last year turned black in just six days while it took 25 days to the ones put up in Bengaluru to change colour.

The organizations plan to put up the lungs in Nagpur for a month during which different activities will be held everyday to engage public and create mass awareness.

According to the organizations, they chose to install the lungs in Nagpur not only because it’s the second capital of the state but also “one of the most polluted areas and a non-attainment city”. As reported by TOI earlier, Maharashtra, at 17, has the highest number of polluted cities in the country identified by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).

At a time when environment activists have been questioning the air quality monitoring done by Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB), having these lungs will ensure that the real picture of city’s air quality comes out. TOI earlier reported that despite in the dip in mercury levels, the city’s AQI remained “too good to be true” as per experts.

Coimbatore: With the construction work of a dog shelter at Ondipudur completed, the animal birth control (ABC) programme to sterilize stray dogs in 80 wards of the city corporation is expected to resume soon.

A senior official from the corporation said, “The dog shelter is constructed at the cost of Rs 36 lakh. It will house nine rooms for dogs, an operation theatre and a doctor’s room. Of the allocated 50 cents near the sewage treatment plant (STP) at Ondipudur, the shelter is constructed in carpet area of close to 20 cents. The shelter will be expanded if required.”

“We had completed the construction work and submitted applications to the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB) for power connection. The connection is expected to be given within a week,” the official added.

It has been close to three years since the corporation had stopped implementing the ABC programme in 80 wards after it had closed the dog shelter at Ukkadam in 2017 due to strong opposition from the public. Under the programme, the corporation had roped in non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to sterilize the stray dogs.

An NGO, which has been given the task of sterilizing dogs in 20 wards, has a dog shelter at Seranaickenpalayam. But another NGO that was given charge of remaining wards had to stop its work after the shelter was closed.

He said that they have not yet finalized the new NGO that would be running the shelter at Ondipudur and the decision is expected to be taken at the earliest.

A Vijayalakshmi, a resident of Ramanathapuran, said, “Both the population of dogs and its menace have increased manifold in the recent times. The dogs are often seen chasing the motorists. In some areas, children and elderly people are scared to step out of their house, especially during night hours. The problem is not pertained to a particular region but across the city.”

She said the corporation should take steps to curb the growth of dog population and put an end to its menace.

K Chandrasekhar Rao

HYDERABAD: Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has decided that Hyderabad should have a huge statue of social reformer Jyotirao Phule . He directed BC welfare minister Gangula Kamalakar and tourism and culture minister V Srinivas Goud to identify a suitable site.

Sources said following a suggestion from municipal administration minister KT Rama Rao that the government should set up a statue of Phule, the CM had immediately agreed for it.

“The idea is to lay the stone for the project on Phule’s birth anniversary on April 11,” Goud told TOI.

The decision to install the statue comes at a time when BC organisations have started targeting the TRS government for neglecting BCs and reducing their reservation in the local bodies polls.

While some BC welfare associations have welcomed the move on having a Phule statue, national BC welfare association president R Krishnaiah said increasing BC reservations proportionate to their population is more important.

SC association leaders have urged KCR to speed up work on the 125-ft Ambedkar statue, a project hanging fire for nearly four years.

The Congress MP said a new study by Osmania University’s department of geophysics had revealed that Musi was full of filth and dirt up to 70km from the city’s periphery.

Large quantities of untreated sewage and drug residue were released by major and minor pharmaceutical companies established along the banks of Musi in Telangana, making it extremely toxic.

The contaminants have percolated up to 300 feet below the ground at many places and up to 500 feet at a few other places. Over 40 pharmaceutical industries established in Pochampally and Choutuppal areas were releasing chemicals into the river, he stated in his memorandum.

“There is an urgent need to start a massive programme for cleaning the water of Musi through tertiary sewage treatment plants of 3,000 million litres capacity per day, take up massive tree plantation around water bodies, penalise those polluting the water bodies, remove all encroachments and prevent industries from polluting the Musi further. These steps will restore the erstwhile glory of Musi and save millions of human as well as animal lives,” he stated in the memorandum.

Coimbatore: Ahead of the implementation of new GST returns mechanism in April, MSME industrialists in the district said the disparity between the fine percentages should be eliminated.

If the government delays GST refund, they pay it with 6% interest, but if assessees pay GST late, they are asked to file it with 18% interest, the businessmen said and wanted the disparity eliminated.

State vice-president of Laghu Udyog Bharati S Surulivel said it would take a while for them to get used to the procedures of the new GST returns filing mechanism. “So, it would be better if the interest rate for delay in paying the tax is 6%.”

Members of the association represented the issue to GST officials at an interactive session held recently in the city. They requested the officials to conduct more sessions to create awareness and to redress grievances.

Other MSME associations have also been representing issues they face with GST.

Members of the Coimbatore Tirupur District Micro and Cottage Entrepreneurs Association (Cotma) had last month said that releasing of blocked GST accounts after paying dues took a month to 40 days. “We feel that after our representation, things have become better. Now, after paying dues, GST accounts are being released in 10 to 15 days,” said Cotma president C Sivakumar.

Kozhikode: The enforcement wing of the motor vehicles department in the district has decided to introduce a checking schedule to inspect school buses and other vehicles transporting school students.

They have decided to stick to the checking schedule in the backdrop of the decision to strengthen the inspection of school vehicles.

The enforcement squad with the support of teams from regional transport offices will inspect school buses every Tuesday. The plan is to strictly enforce safety laws with regular monitoring. Though GPS and speed governors are mandatory for school buses many school vehicle drivers tamper with these safety instruments, said P M Shabeer, enforcement RTO. Many school buses are yet to install GPS and for many it is not functional, he added

The enforcement wing of the MVD has also introduced checking schedule for other vehicles. The aim is to reduce road accidents by 10% with the strict implementation of laws. Different types of offences will be checked during special drives on different days.

“We have decided to dedicatedly check two-wheelers including non-wearing of helmet, on all Mondays, said the Enforcement RTO. School buses will be inspected on Tuesdays and stage carriage buses on Wednesdays, he said.

Though the enforcement wing in the district had prepared a check schedule earlier itself, they had not introduced it owing to the deployment of personnel for Sabarimala duty and transfer of personnel to other places.

The MVD decided to implement the check schedule with immediate effect following the death of the school student who fell from a school bus in Malappuram. During a day-long inspection on Tuesday, the MVD enforcement squads inspected 73 school buses in Kozhikode city and Vadakara regional transport office limits. The officials also booked 27 school buses for various offences.

While four buses were booked for conducting service without closing the door, three were booked for the absence of door attender and three for the absence of first aid box. Two buses were charged for overloading and one for tampering with the speed governor. The MVD team booked 13 other school buses for various other offences including

School buses were the first vehicles for which GPS was made mandatory, said Shabeer. We however, had not launched inspection based on this, he said.

The preparation of the software to track the vehicles with GPS is nearing completion and inspection of speed violation will become easier with the introduction of the software, said Shabeer. The MVD officials also held the school managements responsible for the road law violence by school buses and non-compliance of speed governor and GPS laws.

Coimbatore: Special teams of the rural police arrested notorious burglar ‘Sullan’ Suresh, 31 , of Madurai on Tuesday and recovered 93 sovereigns of gold ornaments and two cars from him.

Of the seized gold, 53 sovereigns were stolen from Coimbatore and the rest from Erode, Hosur and Kerala, police sources said. “The arrest of K Rajasekar, 38, of Azhagapuram in Salem, had led to Suresh’s arrest. The Thudiyalur police had arrested Rajasekar last December and recovered 124 sovereigns of gold ornaments and four kilograms of silver articles from him.

Police recovered 10 sovereigns of gold ornaments each from the duo, who were lodged in the Coimbatore Central Prison.

Pattarai Suresh, who involved in a robbery in Mannuthy police limit in Palakkad district, was arrested by Kerala police last month. He was taken to Coimbatore under prisoner transit warrant and Thudiyalur police obtained four days custody. He was remanded in judicial custody on Monday evening. Police seized a car from him.

“Investigation revealed that all of them had become friends while in prisons. They came out on bail four months ago and had stolen a car from Bengaluru city. They then started the series of burglaries in Kerala, Coimbatore, Erode, Hosur,” the officer said.

NEW DELHI: A Delhi court on Wednesday granted bail to former Niti Aayog CEO Sindhushree Khullar and others in the INX Media corruption case filed by the CBI.

Special Judge Ajay Kumar Kuhar also granted bail to former section officer of the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) unit in the finance ministry Ajit Kumar Dung Dung , then under-secretary in the FIPB unit Rabindra Prasad, former officer on special duty to finance minister Pradeep Kumar Bagga , former FIPB director Prabodh Saxena and former joint secretary (foreign trade) DEA Anup K Pujari.

“The CBI has neither been able to show that the accused/ applicants are flight risk nor has it shown any reasonable ground for having any apprehension that they will tamper with the evidence or influence the witnesses,” the court held.

The court, which granted them bail on a surety of Rs 2 lakh each, directed that they would not leave the country without its permission. “Mere arguments on this line will not justify the apprehension of CBI. No incidence has been cited that any of the applicants ever made attempt to influence witnesses,” the court added.

The accused individuals and entities have been charged for offences such as criminal conspiracy, cheating, forgery and under provisions of Prevention of Corruption Act for causing loss to the exchequer. They were allegedly involved in processing the FIPB clearance of INX Media.

During arguments, the CBI counsel opposed the bail plea and said if granted bail the accused would influence witnesses for they were all influential people.

One of the main planks of CBI’s case is the allegation of Indrani Mukerjea, formerly of INX Media, that she was asked by Chidambaram to help with his son Karti’s business and make “possible overseas remittances” in lieu of regularisation of FIPB violations by her media firm. Indrani, who is accused of murdering her daughter, has not been charged as she had turned approver and will be made a prosecution witness.

The UDF said the LDF members had a fight with the UDF members in the mayor’s room and in that the mayor was manhandled in the morning. The harthal call was following that, as a mark of protest. Vehicles have been exempted from harthal, said the organizers, seeking the cooperation of the shops and establishments.

For the last few days the employees belonging to the Kerala municipal and corporation staff union, which is a pro-Left organization, has been on agitation in the corporation, alleging that the governing body is going against the democratic rights of the employees and harassing them in a different manner. The LDF councillors came to the mayor’s chamber demanding to find a solution for the issue and during the argument they manhandled her, said the Congress.

The mayor had to be taken to the hospital following a variation in blood pressure.

But the LDF claimed that the councillors did not manhandle the mayor but that the UDF councillors manhandled the LDF councillors. Four LDF councillors later got admitted to the hospital raising the complaint.

Meanwhile the Congress alleged that the CPM councillors were behaving like demons and that the police should take action against them.

The councillors physically attacked the mayor from behind without even giving her the consideration of a woman, but the police officials were mute spectators even after the mayor complained, alleged DCC president Satheesan Pacheni. He said the police should take action against the councillors who attacked the mayor, and also department-level action should be taken against the erring police officials.

Ever since the LDF lost power in the Corporation and the UDF came to power after deputy mayor P K Ragesh switched over to the Congress, the LDF and the UDF have been at loggerheads and the present issue is also a continuation of that.

Further, TOI has learnt that the total number of notices issued were 87 and not 127 as mentioned in a release of UIDAI on Tuesday night.Some time back, the Union government had made changes in the Aadhaar card rules for NRIs. The earlier condition was that Aadhaar could be obtained by Indian citizens, NRIs and even foreign nationals after residing in India for one year. The Supreme Court gave a ruling that Aadhaar card cannot be issued to illegal migrants.“In view of the changes in the Aadhaar rules for NRIs and the apex court ruling, we need to verify as to who they were and how did they obtain Aadhaar cards,” a senior UIDAI official on condition of anonymity told TOI. He was referring to some of the residents of the Old City, who were issued the notices. “We have issued the notices based on a report of the state police,” he elaborated further.Senior officials said some of the complaints and the report they had received clearly mentioned that they were not Indian nationals. “We mentioned the same in the notices issued to them. Our job is find out whether they had obtained the Aadhaar cards by false pretences during enrolment. We are not asking them to prove their citizenship,” the officials said.UIDAI considered inputs from a TV channel’s sting operation on Aadhaar cards apart from the state intelligence department’s report on how some persons had obtained the Aadhaar cards, sources said.In Tuesday’s press release, UIDAI said the notices had nothing to do with citizenship of the residents and that Aadhaar was not a document of citizenship.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74215924,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-153868,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/52-notices-undelivered-addresses-dont-exist/articleshow/74215926.cms
461,['20/02/2020'],Officials seek CM’s help to reopen plant,"This story is from February 20, 2020

Palakkad: The top officials of PepsiCo India Limited’s bottling plant run by Varun Beverages Limited at Kanjikode met chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan and director general of police Loknath Behra in Thiruvananthapuram on Wednesday and sought their immediate intervention to reopen the soft drink unit which has remained closed for last 12 days due to strike by workers of a labour supplier.

The company officials said that the CM and the DGP assured all help to reopen the company unit. Meanwhile the labour commissioner has called a meeting on Thursday of the labour contract company representatives and the trade union leaders to discuss the issue as the meeting called by the district labour officer here on Tuesday failed to reach any settlement on the wage increase of Rs 250 demanded by the workers daily.

The company management wrote to industries minister E P Jayarajan and labour minister T P Ramakrishnan on Monday for their immediate intervention to reopen the company that has been closed since February 8.

The company is not directly involved in the issue because the striking contract worskers are not employees of the PepsiCo India Limited or Varun Beverages Limited, the officials said.

They said that “running a factory in Kerala has become very difficult. Some people here think that running a factory is a crime in the state. In this situation we will be forced to move out of the state.”

The closure resulted in a huge loss to the company and more than 150 permanent and 500 indirect employees were affected.

The officials said that though the Kerala high court on February 12 ordered that “police shall accord necessary protection to the petitioner and his employees and shall ensure that no obstruction is caused to the smooth functioning of the petitioner’s establishment at the hands of the party\ respondents for their association,” the company did not get any protection.

Meanwhile district superintendent of police G Siva Vikram said, “police presence is very much there in front of the company to avoid any untoward incident. If the police intervene to remove the striking workers forcefully, there could be a law and order problem.”

The company officials filed an FIR in Walayar police station on Tuesday against eight persons who had allegedly attacked them outside the company area.

463,['20/02/2020'],Can’t freeze assets of ex-MD of PNB in Nirav scam: SC,"This story is from February 20, 2020

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court has ordered that the Union government could not have moved under company law for freezing the assets of ex-managing director of Punjab National Bank Usha Ananthasubramanian, who was chargesheeted by the CBI in the Rs 14,000 crore loan default scam allegedly engineered by Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi.

A bench of Justices R F Nariman, S Ravindra Bhat and V Ramasubramanian in a recent order said the powers under Sections 241, 337 and 339 of the Companies Act could not be utilised to attach assets of persons heading a bank or any organisation when the fraud was not committed by that particular organisation.

It clarified that these provisions of Company Act related to persons responsible for the business of the company that indulged in the fraud leading to defaulting of the loan and not to the business of another company or persons heading it.

Appearing for Ananthasubramanian, senior advocate C S Vaidyanathan and advocate Vikrant Singh Negi told the bench that the CBI chargesheet against several senior officials of PNB and directors of Gitanjali Gems, at best, showed that she “omitted to take precautions or preventive steps to prevent the fraud perpetrated by Nirav Modi and thereby committed misconduct and conspiracy with other accused”.

Vaidyanathan said provisions of the Company Act permitted the government to move for attachment of property of those officials involved with the running of the company accused of fraud and, hence, could not be used against the ex-MD of PNB.

Writing the judgment for the bench, Justice Nariman said, “Under Section 241(2), the central government, if it is of the opinion that the affairs of the company are being conducted in a manner prejudicial to public interest, may apply itself to the tribunal for orders under this chapter, which is headed ‘prevention of oppression and mismanagement’.”

He added, “Section 337 refers to penalty for frauds by an officer of the company in which mis-management has taken place. Likewise, Section 339 refers to any business of the company which has been carried on with intent to defraud creditors of that company. Obviously, the persons referred to in Section 339(1) as persons who are other than the parties ‘to the carrying on of the business in the manner aforesaid’ which again refers to the business of the company which is being mismanaged and not to the business of another company or other persons.”

The bench further said, “This being the case, it is clear that powers under these sections cannot possibly be utilised in order that a person who may be the head of some other organisation be roped in, and his or her assets be attached. This being the case, we set aside the impugned order passed by the NCLAT and well as the NCLT. The appeal is allowed in the aforesaid terms. We may clarify that nothing stated in this judgment will have any effect insofar as the investigation conducted by the CBI or the investigation by the SFIO is concerned.”

KOLKATA: Double-decker buses — the lumbering behemoths of everyday commute once ubiquitous on Kolkata’s streets, but phased out since the early 90s — are set to return to the city, exactly a century since the first one arrived during British rule, but in a swankier avatar.Until the certification comes from the Central Institute of Road Transport (CIRT) — merely a formality, according to sources — there are no approved double-decker models, since no Indian automobile manufacturer makes them. Officials at the West Bengal transport department said the final nod is expected by this month, allowing the two buses to hit the road early March.Kolkata, also, is on the cusp of leading the second wave of double-decker buses in metros across the country. Once CIRT gives its final certification to the two buses designed and developed indigenously, those will be the latest approved model of double-deckers across the country.“These buses will open a new vista for the reintroduction of double-deckers across the nation, particularly in the form of electric vehicles (EV),” said a transport department official. “As of now, the two buses are diesel-run, but unlike the earlier double-deckers, which were fuel guzzlers, these are BS-IV compliant and fuel-efficient,” he added.In the late 1980s, the then Left government in Bengal had decided to decommission double-deckers in phases as the fleet guzzled fuel. They also belched black smoke, but that wasn’t much of a concern then. By 2005, the last double-decker went off road. In Mumbai, double-deckers still ply but the number is on the decline.

Asaduddin Owaisi

HYDERABAD: AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi on Wednesday accused the UIDAI of abusing power after it sent notices to 87 people for obtaining Aadhaar cards on false pretence.

Owaisi, who is leading a campaign against CAA and NRC, alleged that the Aadhar authority has exceeded its power, created panic among people and was biased. His reaction came soon after UIDAI tweeted that 127 people in the city obtained Aadhaar cards on false pretences and primary enquiry revealed that many were illegal migrants, and were not eligible to obtain Aadhaar card.

Owaisi also requested UIDAI and Telangana police to roll out the percentage of Muslims and Dalits among the people to whom notices have been served.

“Request @UIDAI & @TelanganaPolice to tell us how many of those 127-listed people are Muslim & Dalit @TelanganaPolice please stop asking for Aadhaar during your “search & cordon” operations. You’re not legally permitted to do so UIDAI sent notices to 127 people in Hyderabad for obtaining Aadhaar on false pretences” tweeted Owaisi.

He also said that Aadhaar authority has no right to verify citizenship and their notices have created panic among people. “UIDAI did not follow due procedure & abused its powers. The result was (understandably) panic among people First, @UIDAI has no power to verify citizenship. It has few powers to consider some cases of Aadhaar being granted incorrectly (rules 27 & 28),” tweeted Owaisi.

UIDAI also clarified on twitter that Aadhaar is not a citizenship document. Owaisi said the deputy director (UIDAI) has turned the case into citizenship verification which he is not empowered to and claimed that notices don’t even have the details of false pretences.

Through its folktales and folksongs, the author traces beautifully the history of this significant speck on the map of India. No wonder that the book, published by Busy Bee Books, Pondicherry, makes a magnificent read,” Antonisamy said.

PUNE: The director of a Kolkata-based private firm, along with two others, was booked on Tuesday on the charge of duping a city-based medical practitioner of Rs 35 lakh on the prextext of providing him with an imported MRI scan machine .

The 34-year-old complainant had transferred the amount on November 10 last year through RTGS. When he did not get the promised machine for over two months, he lodged an FIR with the Kothrud police.

The police said the director of the firm approached the complainant, who runs a healthcare centre on Karve Road, last year. “The suspect gained the complainant’s confidence by helping him in selling a medical equipment from his healthcare centre,” an officer from the Kothrud police said.

The officer said in the first week of November, the suspect had contacted the medical practitioner and told him that he could arrange an imported MRI machine from a hospital in Malaysia. “The person told the complainant that the machine was worth Rs 35 lakh,” he said.

On November 10, the suspect contacted the complainant again. “He told the complainant that if the machine remains idle for more than 15 days, the helium gas in it might leak out and he might have to pay Rs 15 lakh extra for the refill,” the officer said.

Following this, the complainant transferred the asked amount, after which the suspect sent him the receipt with the photographs of the machine. “The suspect told the complainant he would get the machine within a week,” the officer said.

The medical practitioner started pursuing the suspect when he did not get the delivery. He visited his office at Gahunje and met the suspect’s wife, who promised the delivery of the unit at the earliest. After few days, when the complainant visited the officer again, he found it locked. “He told the suspect to cancel the order and return the money. At that time, the suspect promised to return Rs 5 lakh. The medical practitioner, however, did not get the amount and the machine,” the officer said.

Representative image

AURANGABAD: A large section of private schools coming under the ambit of RTE Act 2009 has raised grievances over non-release of dues towards admissions done under 25% quota among other issues since the academic year 2018-19.

Maharashtra English School Trustees Association (MESTA), a body of private unaided English schools said the state government dues towards RTE admissions have been withheld from the last two years. “The government had released a partial amount of dues corresponding to the academic year 2017-18. We cannot disown the students admitted under the 25% quota concerned, but the government should not taste our patience,” MESTA president Sanjay Tayade said.

While the government reimburses a sum of around Rs 17,600 towards each student admitted under the RTE Act, the private schools owe a whopping Rs 700 crore from the government, MESTA has said.

Among other issues related to RTE admissions, several private schools have demanded separate arrangements from the government for providing uniforms, school books, and food. “The government reimburses money towards tuition fees only and parents of the beneficiaries have to bear expenses towards other essentials such as uniforms, school books, and food. Several beneficiary parents find it difficult to arrange the money for the same. The government must either provide money to beneficiaries for the same or give grants to schools for providing the daily essentials,” MESTA joint secretary Manish Hande said.

Among other RTE-related demands, MESTA has pressed for a pension scheme for teachers from schools that come under the ambit of the legislation concerned. “Despite having private managements, our teachers are rendering services towards the implementation of the government welfare scheme in the field of education by implementing the RTE Act. Therefore, teachers must get a pension from the government. A separate pension scheme can be worked out for teachers,” MESTA members said.

As many as 9,328 private schools are part of the admissions under the RTE Act having a collective intake capacity of 1,15,191 seats.

When contacted, authorities from Aurangabad Zilla Parishad said the demands raised by MESTA fall in the purview of the state government. “The state-level authorities are expected to take a call on different demands of private schools related to RTE Act, including pending reimbursement,” authorities said.

Gangster Ejaz Lakdawala

MUMBAI: The city crime branch stumbled upon a gold smuggling racket while investigating the alleged hushing up of an extortion case involving gangster Ejaz Lakdawala and police informer Salim Maharaj.

The crime branch has identified more than a dozen persons involved in smuggling gold from the Gulf.

Last week, Mumbai police commissioner Sanjay Barve ordered an inquiry on learning that some police officers had hurriedly transferred an extortion case from Pydhonie police station to M R A Marg without citing valid reasons. It was also learnt MRA Marg police officers did nothing to bring the case to its logical end.

Crime branch Unit I, which is conducting the inquiry, learnt that the hushed up case related to a dispute between the gold smugglers and a woman carrier. In June 2018, one Sumaiyla who lives at Null Bazaar smuggled in gold strapped to her body. She returned from Dubai to Bengaluru airport and called one Imtiaz and told him that she was being followed by some people. Imtiaz brought her to Mumbai and the very next day she allegedly began to receive calls from gangster Tariq Parveen, a Lakdawala aide, and Maharaj. The duo threatened Sumaiyla saying she must hand over 600 grams of gold or be killed.

They called Sumaiyla to Rafai Towers in Pydhonie. She, Imtiaz and his friend Saddiq were then assaulted and threatened saying if they failed to get the gold, they would be handed over to the cops. Frightened, Sumaiyla, Saddiq and Imitiaz then approached police and lodged a complaint saying they were confined, assaulted and threatened at gunpoint by Tariq and Salim.

During inquiry, police summoned Imitaz, Saddiq, Sumaiyla and her friend Reshma who shared information about such smuggling rackets in South Mumbai.

It is learnt that the smugglers mostly hail from Kerala and live in Dongri in dormitories.

They handpick young women and men who want a sponsored trip to Dubai. They are offered a small shopping allowance and free three- four day stay. On every kilo of gold smuggled into India, smugglers earn make Rs 3-4 lakh profit.

“A carrier carries around 500 to 600 gram of gold biscuits on her body,” said an informer. The carriers prefer to land in Chennai or Bengaluru due to laxity in customs. From there, they either reach Mumbai by road or rail and hand over the packets to their mentors.

“Among the carriers, there are some who steal 50gm to 100gm of gold from a consignment and if smugglers ask about it, they threaten to file molestation or rape cases against them,” said a police officer.

475,['20/02/2020'],Maharashtra: FIR over videos linking poultry with coronavirus,"This caused undue fear amon people and eventually hit the demand for poultry products

PUNE: The state animal husbandry department on Wednesday lodged an FIR with the cybercrime police station here in relation to three misleading videos uploaded on the social media and a video-sharing platform, which linked the spread of coronavirus infection with consumption of poultry meat.“We have registered an offence under Section 505 (1) (b) of the Indian Penal Code, which refers to acts intended at causing fear or alarm to the public,” inspector Jayram Paygude of the cybercrime police station told TOI.The move comes close on the heels of a delegation of poultry farmers and breeders’ body meeting animal husbandry, marketing and dairy development minister Sunil Kedar recently to raise their concern about a sudden fall in the demand for poultry meat due to misleading videos and messages.The minister had then instructed the state animal husbandry commissioner to take appropriate steps. Assistant commissioner of the animal husbandry department Shriram Sitaram Pawar on Wednesday filed the complaint with the cybercrime police station.Paygude said the department came across three such videos, in which the presenter was seen urging people at large against consuming chicken and eggs. The presenter claimed that the coronavirus was transmitted through the flesh of the animals and birds, especially poultry chicken and eggs.According to the complaint, these videos, along with the long text messages, were circulated on different social networking sites, among others. “Many people, who received these video clips forwarded them without understanding the facts. This caused undue fear among people and they stopped eating chicken and eggs, thus, adversely impacting the demand of eggs and meat,” he said.“The contents of these videos were examined by the authorities from the animal husbandry department, which were found utterly false and misleading,” he added.“We are yet to ascertain the motive behind these videos and why people circulated them on the social networking sites,” he said.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74217825,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-613492,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/fir-over-videos-linking-poultry-with-coronavirus/articleshow/74215983.cms

Mohammed Sattar Khan

CHARMINAR: Mohammed Sattar Khan, who is among the 87 people from Old City who received notices from Unique Identification Authority of India ( UIDAI ) for obtaining Aadhaar cards on the false pretence, told TOI that the claims were baseless and his family has been living in Hyderabad for decades.

He wondered how could UIDAI send notice or call him to prove his citizenship without a proper check.

“I have been residing in Bhavani Nagar Talab Katta for the past several years. I was born and brought up here, I have two daughters and a son. After so many years, I am being asked to prove my citizenship, how can it be possible? The notice will be challenged in court and I have discussed the matter with my counsel Muzafferullah Khan,” Sattar Khan said on Wednesday.

He added that like every citizen he also stood in long queues in 2007 to obtain Aadhaar card and despite that he is being asked to prove his citizenship again.

Senior advocate Muzafferullah Khan told TOI that the legal process has been initiated and the matter has been taken up in the court.

GHMC ward committee member and AIMIM leader, Talaha Kaseri, said: “It seems like UIDAI is abusing its power by serving such notices without checking the facts.”

Meanwhile, Telangana Advocates Joint Action Committee (JAC) demanded that UIDAI should withdraw the notices immediately.

Terming the notices arbitrary, unlawful and unconstitutional, Telangana Advocates JAC convener Mohammed Wali-ur-Rahman said the UIDAI should clarify that on what basis the notices have been issued. “Such notices are considered as arbitrary, illegal and unconstitutional. On what basis have these notices been served and what authority does UIDAI have to call people to prove their citizenship,” asked Wali-ur-Rahman.

The JAC has decided to move the high court against UIDAI.

“If the Aadhaar card is not correct then it could be cancelled, but how can someone be called to prove their nationality or citizenship by claiming that their Aadhaar card is false. These notices will only add to public woes at a time when anti-CAA protests are going on,” said Wali-ur-Rahman.

478,['20/02/2020'],Mumbai News: How this south Mumbai wine shop owner trapped extortionists,"This story is from February 20, 2020

CCTV film shows an extortionist trapped by staffers as he returned to collect ‘hafta’on Tuesday

MUMBAI: A few men in white linen clothes walked into a liquor shop on Sidhwa Road in Fort last week. And posing as political party workers, they asked the staff if they had a licence and other documents.

But, little did they know that the shop belonged to Ashok Patel , 65, who had got 117 persons—including cops, I-T staff and officials of various departments—arrested for extortion in the last 25 years.

They learnt it the hard way on Tuesday when one of them returned to knock off ‘hafta’ (bribe) of Rs 7 lakh. How? Patel and his staff literally made a ‘trap’: they locked the door from outside and called up the police control room. The Marine Drive police then arrived and arrested Rajendra Waghmare, a Dadar resident, making him Number 118. His three accomplices too were arrested, taking Patel’s ‘trapped’ count to 121.

Among 117 trapped over the last 25 years were police inspector Anand Bhoir, held for demanding and accepting Rs22 lakh last year, and various sales tax and I-T personnel, policemen, BMC officials, fire brigade staff, Railway Protection Force cops, Mhada officials and smugglers and drug peddlers. Of the 117 ‘trapped,’ 35 were frauds posing as government officers.

“The four men had been asking for monthly ‘hafta’ of Rs7 lakh and a few wine bottles. I am an honest tax-payer and don’t indulge in illegal activities, so why should I pay them? I kept bargaining with them and on Tuesday, they thought they could make a final deal,” said Patel, who is president of the Fort Merchants Association which represents the interests of 425 shopkeepers and traders.

Tuesday’s incident, where Waghmare parked his car outside the wine shop and walked in and demanded money, has been captured in the shop’s CCTV cameras. Patel’s son Bhavesh called up the police after one of the staffers had locked the main door from outside. During interrogation, Waghmare told police about his three aides——Sanjay Ahire, Janardhan Gyanit and Manish Tambe— and police suspect they may have been collecting money from other shopkeepers in the area as well.

Patel, who hails from Bhuj, said he feels “relieved” every time he traps people on the wrong side of the law and has received more than 100 cash rewards and certificates from government agencies so far. “The most remarkable case was in 2012, when I tipped off the income-tax department and got a cash reward of Rs5 lakh,” he said. He added that he was not much educated but was “tech savvy” and had “all modern gadgets to tape, video-record and do sting operations.”

Recalling a December 2003 case where he helped the Cuffe Parade police to catch three policemen who had kidnapped three traders from Hutatma Chowk, he said the traders had been held by their kidnappers under the Chowpatty bridge for a ransom demand of Rs25,000. He has also helped the authorities in Gujarat to crack some cases, he added

479,['20/02/2020'],Symbiosis institute gets accreditation from AACSB,"This story is from February 20, 2020

Pune: The Symbiosis Centre for Management and Human Resource Development ( SCMHRD ) recently became the first institute in the city to get the accreditation of the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business ( AACSB ).

AACSB is an internationally recognized body that provides business education intelligence, quality assurance and professional development services to over 1,700 member organizations and over 840 accredited business schools worldwide.

“In India, Symbiosis Centre for Management and Human Resource Development is the 14th B-school that is accredited by AACSB. Some of the other institutions that hold this accreditation include ISB (Hyderabad), IIMs (Kolkata, Indore, Udaipur), among others. Only 5% of the business schools across the globe hold the AACSB accreditation,” Vidya Yeravdekar, the principal director of Symbiosis Society , said.

Pratima Sheorey, director of Symbiosis Centre for Management and Human Resource Development, said the institute formally entered the accreditation process in 2014.

“The next five years had endless rounds of brainstorming, re-engineering, putting the thoughts to action and developing a robust ‘assurance of learning’ and various other processes as mandated by the AACSB,” Sheorey said.

She added that regular annual and sometimes biennial updates were sought by the AACSB to the standards on which they evaluate institutions.

“After five long years of work and reporting, the peer-review team was assigned to Symbiosis Centre for Management and Human Resource Development, which visited the college, interviewed the stakeholders, assessed all processes and documents and then recommended that the institute be accorded with the accreditation,” Sheorey added.

480,['20/02/2020'],Monitor lizard rescued from water tank in Nakshatrawadi,"This story is from February 20, 2020

The reptile was spotted by the owner of the hotel

AURANGABAD: A monitor lizard (Ghorpad) was recently rescued from the water tank of one of the hotels based on the outskirts of the city in Nakshatrawadi .

The reptile was spotted by the owner of the hotel, Monisha Brahma, who then called the animal rescuers.

“The monitor lizard had apparently fallen in the tank for a few days, but went unnoticed. The rescue team safely removed the reptile without hurting it. The operation that lasted for 20 minutes,” environmentalist Kishor Pathak said.

“The lizard, weighing around 5 kg and 65cm in length, was offered necessary aid before being released into the wild with permission from the forest department,” rescue expert Manoj Gaikwad said.

“The monitor lizard is a reptile which is shy in nature. The creature avoids coming into contact of humans or their habitat. The rescued lizard must have strayed into human area in search of food or water,” he added.

Usually found near farm lands, rocky hill region or jungles, the monitor lizard is a carnivorous creature and feeds on rodents, crustacean snails, snakes, scorpion, birds, eggs and insects.

“Nakshatrawadi area is on the outskirts and one of the biodiversity-rich habitats around Aurangabad. The area has mountain ranges and waterbodies making it a suitable place for different creatures. However, the growing construction activities in the area is leading to man-animal conflict,” Pathak said.

Hunting monitor lizard attracts provisions of Schedule I of the Wild Life Protection Act, which is tantamount to hunting a tiger. “It is believed that eating the meat of monitor lizard increases sexual power in humans. However, there is no scientific evidence to prove this myth,” Pathak said.

481,['20/02/2020'],"Funds allotted for 4th Egmore, Beach rail track","This story is from February 20, 2020

CHENNAI: Finally, a long-pending demand of Southern Railway is set to be fulfilled. The fourth line between Chennai Egmore and Beach railway stations would soon become reality, as the railway ministry had allotted funds for taking up the work.

Chennai divisional railway manager P Mahesh told TOI that the fourth line between Egmore and Beach will cover 4.30 km. Despite the short distance, due to lack of the fourth line, long distance express trains or freight trains from Tambaram heading to Arakkonam or Gummidipoondi had to be operated on a single line and were halted at various stations before reaching Beach. This can be avoided when the fourth line is laid.

At present, many trains from the southern parts of the state use Egmore and Beach stations to proceed to Coimbatore, Mumbai and Gummidipoondi towards Andhra Pradesh and beyond. Hence, the Southern Railway is keen on the fourth line, he said. Another official said MGR Chennai Central is saturated and no new trains can be added due to space constraints. In an effort to cut congestion in MGR Central it has been proposed to shift a few trains to Tambaram, after making it a second terminal, the official said. This would also help decongest Egmore station too to some extent, he said.

To begin with, Southern Railway will start survey work for the fourth line. It will be completed in six months as Southern Railway is keen to finish the project at the earliest. Along the stretch, land acquisition has been a major impediment. It can be addressed only with the support and cooperation of the Tamil Nadu government, the official said. Track laying won’t take too long the official added. The fourth line will go up to Royapuram and along the route a large number of encroachments have to be removed by the state authorities.
