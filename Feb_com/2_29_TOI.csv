1,['29/02/2020'],BBMP moots license fee waiver to promote adoption of indie dogs,"In what is seen as a major boost for the cause of indie dogs, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagare Palike (BBMP) is set to introduce a new clause in the Pet Dog Licensing Bylaws 2020 (Draft), which exempts adoption of indie dogs, and that of rescued, injured or abandoned dogs of other breeds, from licensing fee. “This time, the focus is on incentivising adoption of indies and rescue dogs by waiving off license fee. The idea is to change the perspective around these dogs, which are normally considered a menace. Indie breeds are far more suited for Indian conditions than foreign breeds,” says Randeep D, Special Commissioner for Solid Waste Management and Animal Husbandry, BBMP.According to BBMP’s 2019 survey, the total estimate for stray dogs in Bengaluru was 3.1 lakh, representing 3.67 dogs per 100 people. Considering these numbers, this rule inclusion might herald in a better future for strays. Randeep adds, “We are trying to bring in social awareness among pet owners to look at this option, so that strays find a home and are not out on the street. There will be no restriction on the number of indie or rescued dogs a person can adopt.” The Pet Dog Licensing Bylaws 2020 (Draft), is pushing for the one dog for one flat and three dogs for an independent house rule, which has been contested by pet owners earlier.Sanjana Madappa from the rescue and rehabilitation wing of Compassion Unlimited Plus Action (CUPA) says, “BBMP is not limiting the number of Indies and rescued dogs someone can adopt. But they have to be adopted, which, in a way, will discourage buying from backdoor breeders. And, it is time that people stop giving second-class treatment to strays and rescued dogs.”",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74387201,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1693686/74387201.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/bbmp-moots-license-fee-waiver-to-promote-adoption-of-indie-dogs/articleshow/74387201.cms
2,['29/02/2020'],Music Review: Kannum Kannum Kollaiyadithaal,"The songs of Kannum Kannum Kollaiyadithaal, the romantic thriller by Desingh Periyasamy, do sound peppy and upbeat in the beginning, but by the time you’re done with the album, composed by Masala Coffee, the overload of percussion, same type of beats, tunes and lyrical treatment begin to seem overbearing.The songs were obviously written and set to music to show carefree youth life, but do they have to be so noisy? Let’s start with Sirikkalam Parakkalam sung by Benny Dayal and Madurai Souljour, who’s also written part of the lyrics along with Desingh. This song is the sole high point of the album, mainly because as the first one, it sounds peppy and upbeat and quite dance-y. Ennai Vittu, sung by Ranjith, and written by Vignesh Shivan is a first romance song, interspersed with cutesy dialogues. Among the plethora of ‘pogathey’ songs we’ve had lately in Tamil films, this one is a better version. The next song is Yelo Pullelo, sung by Anirudh Ravichander, written by Mani Amudhavan. More percussion, noisy background babble that cuts off the main song at many places. Kanave Nee Naan is the love-lost song. Sad and maudlin, sung by Sooraj Santhosh and written by Hafeez Rumi and Desingh, who’s also written Ennil Nee, sung by Janani SV. It’s the lone female song, which she sings mostly in soprano.Then come the two versions of Assai Illa – the Kannum Kannum Kollaiadithaal theme songs, so to say. One is by sung by Hashavardhan Rameshwar, the other remixed by Gouthami Ashok EFI. Short numbers both, must be background scores – but both sound good. The last song of the album is Maagaa Maagaa sung by Hashavardhan Rameshwar, Kavya Ajit and Janani SV, and written by V Lakshmi Priya.

Along with frequent collaborator and mridangam player Yanchan, SVDP will be finishing his India tour with a concert in Chennai today.“We purposely booked Chennai as the last stop because it has been the most supportive. Chennai really does feel like home to us. The city has been treating us so well, so naturally I have high expectations for the show,” the Jaffna-born musician said. The duo, who started the tour with their debut at a music festival, are known for seamlessly blending Carnatic tunes into rap. They rose to fame for Mridangam Series, their hit episodic album, where they fuse rap hip-hop with mridangam.“I know our biggest fanbase is in Chennai with a lot of Carnatic fans. I'm excited to tear the stage up,” Yanchan said, adding that fusion music has endless possibilities today. “I think a lot more people have become open to the idea that it is okay to crossbreed Carnatic music with other genres of music. From watching legends like L Subramaniam and Karaikudi Mani do fusion concerts as a kid, they helped give me the confidence to explore Carnatic music with hip-hop,” he noted. The first episode of the Mridangam Series was more of an experiment, SVDP recalled, adding, “At this point, we fully have a grasp of what we’re trying to do. We want to make sure we challenge ourselves and make sure each episode evolves musically and visually.”Among the pieces that SVDP will be performing will include material from IYAAA, his collaborative album with Yanchan. “The goal was to make a fusion album that the south audience will really connect to. It is a lot more different than our solo projects, we’re really pushing each other to leave our comfort zone,” the musician added.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74390629,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1487009/74390629.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/music/this-city-really-does-feel-like-home-to-us-svdp/articleshow/74390629.cms
4,['29/02/2020'],Shoot at Site: Vishal is in search of the Chakra,"It was a regular Friday for shoppers, who flocked to a city mall. Even as they milled about at the mall, browsing through shops and indulging in retail therapy, they remained largely unaware of a different kind of excitement that had gripped a bunch of people who were busy in their own world at the basement car park. There were hefty-looking men, wielding weapons, waiting for their prey.And that’s when Vishal and Shraddha Srinath entered the car park, probably after a fruitful day of shopping. Just as the duo got set to leave, they were attacked. And what followed was heavy-duty action, with bone-breaking moves. Yep, we were at the shooting spot of Chakra, directed by debutant MS Anandan.“We are shooting the opening sequence of Vishal sir,” began the filmmaker, “It will be stylish and engaging. Chakra will be an edge-of-the-seat thriller, and every character that appears in a frame will have some purpose. Script is the base for a film, but it’s characters that bring the story together. We have a crisp flashback, and I’m sure the action sequences in the film will be appreciated.”Talking about how he pitched the story to Vishal, Anandan said, “I was so nervous the night before meeting him. It was a big opportunity for me, and I didn’t want to waste it. But the way Vishal treated me boosted my confidence. He quietly listened to the whole story, and didn’t even take a coffee break in between. He said, ‘The story is good and the characterisations are strong. Don’t change anything for me.’ He believes in script and doesn’t believe in promoting the hero and downgrading the villain. I think both of them have to be equally strong if the face-off sequences have to come out well.”We were joined by Vishal then, who had just finished giving a shot. “The reason why the film is called Chakra is because it revolves around Ashoka Chakra, India’s highest peacetime military decoration. The hero is in search of the medal that belonged to his dad,” he revealed and added, “Many think the film is a sequel to Irumbu Thirai, but it’s not. However, thematically, while that film spoke about hacking phones, this one will raise an important question — what if your entire life is hacked? This is the first time that I’m working with both Shraddha Srinath and Regina Cassandra, and I love how both of them have super powerful characters.”“We will wrap up shoot by March 13. Yuvan Shankar Raja has given us lovely songs; one of those will be shot from March 11,” Vishal informed us before going for his next shot.This is the first time ever that I’m wearing khakhi for a film. In fact, I’m doing things I haven’t done before for this movie. My character is hot-headed, impulsive, and Vishal is the cool cat among the two of us. When I shot my opening sequence, I was so nervous. I thought it would look unnatural for me to do stunts. I was wondering if I was even physically fit to do it. But Anbariv masters were so good. I’ve seen the edited scene, and I’m so excited to see the film for my own action sequence!— Shraddha Srinath, actressThis is a stylish action sequence that we are shooting. Shraddha also has a powerful action-based opening scene. Every character in the film will be very strong. We have planned a crisp flashback portion as well.— Anandan, directorAll the characters have been sketched well by our director. So, I’ve ample scope to make the action sequences stylish. This one, in particular, will be a mass-meets-class one. We’ve used Krav Maga techniques, where you use the opponent’s power to defeat him. The moves are slick and almost unexpected. I’m also excited about the climax action sequence.— Anl Arasu, stunt choreographerThe whole film is based on contrast. This fight is being shot in a basement car park, but we haven’t used extra lights. Anl Arasu master wanted to use high speed shots, which require a lot of light. But we have kept it raw.

6,['29/02/2020'],Govind Padmasoorya: The success of Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo has opened doors for me,"Since Pretham 2 in 2018, Govind Padmasoorya has been missing from Mollywood, but the Malayali audience’s support has been endless, he says. In 2019, he made his debut in Tamil with Kee and earlier this year, he was part of Allu Arjun’s blockbuster, Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo. The actor talks to us about how these movies have helped him get better offers, working with Allu Arjun and more.There are two reasons for that. The movies that I have been doing outside of Malayalam are star-studded films – be the Jiiva-starrer Kee or Allu Arjun’s Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo. The only reason I could be part of such big films is because I played the antagonists. I did get other roles in Telugu and Tamil but they didn’t excite me. Those projects in which I was offered the lead role were either helmed by debutants or had a new production company backing the film. When I start in an industry, I wanted it to be with a good project. I think it was the right decision as I was offered Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo after its director Trivikram Srinivas saw my performance in the Tamil film Kee.I have always only done projects when they excite me. Irrespective of movies being big or small, I look at whether there’s a takeaway for me and whether the audience would love it. If a project satisfies these two conditions, then I am in. For Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo, my takeaway was that I got to be part of a huge film with Allu Arjun and for the audience, it was a great entertainer that I could recommend without thinking twice.However, the funny thing is that I didn’t immediately say yes when they approached me. For Kee, the character was a huge challenge and that is what attracted me to take it up. But when the team of Ala.. narrated the story, I was hesitant at first because I was not sure how much the scope of performance was. Even though I was the main villain, I didn’t have a lot of acting to do and I wanted a bit more. However, at the end of the day it was a Trivikram Srinivas-Allu Arjun film, and finally I decided to be part of the film. I didn’t know it would be such a huge hit.Earlier the number of offers I got from other industries were very limited and I could select only the best from what was being offered. Right now, the success of these two films have opened a lot of doors. But I still haven’t committed any film because I want to do a movie that meets all the criteria I had mentioned.He’s a sweetheart and charmer, both onscreen and offscreen. He is very considerate, not just to me but to everyone he meets, be it to a light boy or a fan or a director. After he had introduced me by name in that event, a major chunk of Allu fans now message me on social media asking what my next project is. It’s one of the sweetest things he did.During the shoot, he had complimented me, saying I had sharp expressions and that I was using my eyes well. It didn’t stop there. He also spoke highly about my performance in his interviews and highlighted these points, and I found that very genuine. Many directors took a snapshot of that interview and sent me, and it felt good.I think after Pretham, this was the role that was appreciated the most. Many people called to say that it was a powerful role and I had performed well. I wish it would have done better in Kerala theatres, but I also think a lot of people had watched it in theatres. I remember when I went to a theatre in Edappally, Kochi, to watch 1917 and the theatre owners took me to their office to say it was running to packed houses for two weeks.

DOHA: Petra Kvitova battled past world number one Ashleigh Barty 6-4, 2-6, 6-4 on Friday to set up a Qatar Open final against Belarusian Aryna Sabalenka .

The two-time Wimbledon winner overcame a second-set blip to reach the 37th WTA final of her career and her second in Doha , where she won the 2018 title.

Kvitova ended a run of four straight defeats to Barty, including in the Australian Open quarter-finals earlier this year.

Australia's Barty has now lost in back-to-back semi-finals after her last-four loss to eventual champion Sofia Kenin in Melbourne.

It will be Kvitova's first final since April last year in Stuttgart.

The 29-year-old Czech, ranked 11th in the world, is chasing a 28th tour title.

Earlier on Friday, Sabalenka dispatched Russian veteran Svetlana Kuznetsova 6-4, 6-3.

Ninth seed Sabalenka, 21, broke twice former Grand Slam champion Kuznetsova four times as she reached a 10th career WTA final -- her first of the 2020 season.

10,['29/02/2020'],"Battered oil augurs well for consumer inflation, interest rate cut","(Representative image)

NEW DELHI: Oil prices tested a three-year low on Friday due to heightened fear of deeper impact of the corona virus outbreak crushing global economic growth and energy demand.Global benchmark Brent slipped below the $50 per barrel-mark briefly, marking a decline of over 4% and a level last seen in July 2017, before recouping to close 2.4% down from the previous close.Global oil prices have been declining since the outbreak due to falling demand, largely from China as it went into a lockdown mode to contain the outbreak. Since India meets 83% of its oil needs through imports, lower prices augur well for the government and consumers.A low oil price regime reduces fuel costs for the aam admi and industry, which helps the latter in times of economic slowdown. It also improves macro-economic parameters – lower inflation and subsidy bill, keeps the rupee healthy as there is lesser need to buy dollars to pay for crude. This in turn improves the balance of payments position.There are other benefits. Lower inflation creates ground for interest rate cut, which eases burden on households by reducing home or consumer loan installments. Reduced subsidy burden and improved current account deficit means more legroom for the government to spend on social schemes or announce incentives to revive growth.India’s crude purchase has so far averaged $64 per barrel in 2019-20 and is likely to close the fiscal around this level. This is comforting since the government math is based on a $65-per-barrel oil price. The road ahead also looks comfortable as the International Energy Agency has projected the coronavirus outbreak leading to the first quarterly contraction in global oil demand in more than 10 years.The IEA slashed its 2020 oil demand growth forecast by 365,000 bpd (barrels per day) to just 825,000 bpd, the lowest oil demand growth since 2011.A prolonged period of subdued prices, thus, will keep pump prices low and allow the government to raise levy on fuel to make up for shortfall in tax revenue. It will also make it easier for refiners to recoup investments made for producing BS-VI fuel . The government had raised excise duty nine times between November 2014 and January 2016 to shore up finances as global oil prices fell.The flip side, however, is that if global economic activity continues in the slow lane, it will hurt India’s exports. Continuous fall in oil prices will also lead to inventory losses for refiners, lowering their profitability. This will result in lower payouts to the government. Low prices will render investments made in new fields unremunerative for explorers, forcing them to pull back on fresh investments. This in turn will lead to inadequate capacity - and volatility - when demand picks up in the second half of the fiscal.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74412794,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-111782,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/battered-oil-augurs-well-for-consumer-inflation-interest-rate-cut/articleshow/74408714.cms

Novak Djokovic hugs Gael Monfils after the match (AFP Photo)

DUBAI: Novak Djokovic saved three match points before defeating Gael Monfils 2-6, 7-6 (10/8), 6-1 to reach the Dubai Championships final on Friday, describing his victory as ""an amazing escape"".

It was the 17th win of the season for the world number one and a 17th career win over Frenchman Monfils without a loss.

Djokovic will play on Saturday for a fifth Dubai trophy against Stefanos Tsitsipas after the second seed and 2019 finalist beat Dan Evans 6-2, 6-3.

The Serbian fought off three Monfils match points in the second-set tiebreaker, as the Frenchman committed forehand and backhand errors on his first two winning chances.

An increasingly weary Monfils blew the third with a double-fault.

Djokovic finally squared the semi-final at one set a-piece on his eighth set point before rolling on to victory in the third set after more than two and a half hours.

""It was an amazing escape,"" said Djokovic who now has a 20-match win streak stretching from the end of last year.

""Gael was playing as well as he ever has. It was difficult to go through him. I have good defence, but what he did today was unbelievable.

""On the match points, I just hoped that he would miss on first serves, which he did. That gave me an opportunity to get into the points.

""I know Gael was injured and he could not play his best, but once he's healthy, watch out.""

Tsitsipas, who lost the final a year ago to Roger Federer, won his eighth match in a row by seeing off Evans.

The Greek lifted the trophy last Sunday in Marseille.

Tsitsipas could not fault his victory in 83 minutes over the 37th-ranked Evans in a first-time meeting.

""I managed to stay solid throughout the whole match, I didn't have too much stress, I stayed quite calm and played well,"" he said.

""I was dominating a lot from my forehand side, playing with a clear head and not thinking of too much, staying in the moment, trying to process of what potentially he's going to use on the court.

""It was just a matter of time for me to take the lead and get up in the score.""

Tsitsipas, winner of 16 of his last 17 sets, won his 10th career match at the Aviation Club against two defeats.

British number one Evans was competing in his fourth semi-final at the ATP level.

He saved three match points against Pierre-Hugues Herbert in the second round and two set points in the quarter-finals against Andrey Rublev.

Tsitsipas never faced a break point on Friday while breaking Evans' serve four times.

15,['29/02/2020'],New Zealand strongly encourages India to become participant of RCEP in future: Foreign minister,"This story is from February 29, 2020

India can come back to RCEP in the future, said New Zealand foreign minister and deputy prime minister, Winston Peters, but at present the Indian government’s position does not hold out much confidence that RCEP would go ahead with India.

In India to pick up the threads of a bilateral relationship, Peters who has been accompanied by a large and diverse business delegation, is keen to get India to open up its agriculture market for New Zealand. India and New Zealand last held talks on a trade agreement back in 2010. Peters said he was here to restart that dialogue. “We have been aspiring for that bilateral deal for 10 years. But we respect India’s decision.”

Describing New Zealand as the country with the greatest ease of doing business, Peters said, “there is need for wider understanding of the Indian agricultural market. Due to rising demand in India and need for added value, our discussion was about having a chance to prove to the domestic agriculture market in India that we are no threat to them. The size of their milk industry is so much larger. If you look at the future demand that’s building here, it’s very difficult to envisage how we could possibly be a threat. We just want a chance to demonstrate that. We don’t want to compete with any Indian farmer. Rather, to work in concert with them and to grow the capacity of supply keeping in sight the future demands. “

This was, Peters said, his third meeting with foreign minister S. Jaishankar . The focus of the discussions, he said, were “Democracy, rule of law, multilateralism, discussions for the need to continue down that path in the interests of our two economies and the world. That includes the wto, and institutions that promote free and fair trade, in what is currently a difficult environment.”

Could New Zealand be the next entrant into the Indo-Pacific universe? “It’s an emerging concept and putting flesh and shape around this concept is what we’re keen to have a discussion on. If you look at it, we’re at one end of the Indo-Pacific, down in the South Pacific . India’s at the other end. But there are a lot of areas where the promotion of values and institutions, peace and security is fundamental to the health and stability of the region. We don’t have to go too far to point out the areas of trans-national competition that we have as two countries.” New Zealand, like India, he said, regards Asean as central to the Indo-Pacific strategy.

With close relations with China, how does New Zealand regard the Asian hegemon? “We have our eyes wide open about what we’re dealing with. We cooperate with China as much as we can. There are Lots of reasons for us to press on. Where we disagree we have to be frank and disagree, bearing in mind that with respect, the differences can become a pathway to compromise and understanding.” Despite such close ties, though, New Zealand has blocked its 5G market to China and Huawei . “Bear in mind that our law passed by the previous government dates back to 2013. In short, no PM or cabinet minister can change it – it’s a decision made by the oversight body, in this case the GCSP, when applications come in. Which is to say they have to commit to the laws of the government. But they have to satisfy the criteria set out in the legislation seven years ago before they can proceed further.”

How has New Zealand dealt with terrorism in the post Christchurch attack era? “The reality is that the appalling attack on humanity in our country happened by the intersection of an outsider. We have a commission of inquiry into the event. In the meantime, we have communicated and discussed with other countries on the importance of sharing information. Because the particularity of this sort of terrorism is that its under the radar, often undetected, festering away in undiscovered environments. That needs more surveillance to look for those trigger points that IT and other modern tools can investigate, provided we can put resources into that. We need to work with other countries, and help other countries. But I think our political systems are way behind technological advances.”

EURO TRAVEL

BELFAST: FIFA president Gianni Infantino has said March's international soccer matches could be threatened by the coronavirus but was hopeful that this year's European Championship tournament and the Olympic Games will go ahead unaffected.On Friday, six countries reported their first cases of the virus and the World Health Organization (WHO) raised its global spread and impact risk alert to ""very high"".The spread of the virus has already hit sporting events and on Thursday Italian club Inter Milan were forced to play their Europa League home match against Bulgarian side Ludogorets at San Siro behind closed doors.A number of international fixtures, including the Euro 2020 playoffs as well as friendlies, are scheduled for the final week of March. Asked whether he would consider halting those games, Infantino said nothing was out of the question.""I wouldn’t exclude anything at this moment. I hope we will never have to get into this direction. I think it will be difficult in any case to make a global ban because the situation (in each counry) is really different,"" he told reporters.""The health of people is much more important than any football game. The health is beyond anything and that’s why we have to look at the situation and hope that it (the coronavirus outbreak) will decrease rather than increase.""At the moment it looks like it is still increasing. If games have to be postponed or played without spectators until it is over then we have to go through that,"" added the head of soccer's world governing body.Euro 2020 is scheduled to begin on June 12 and will see an unprecedented amount of international travel with the tournament being held in 12 cities in 12 different European countries.""I think the Euros will take place in June. Before that we have many matches at international level with lots of travelling involved as well so I think we have to monitor the situation and those in charge, the government, the institutions they also take decisions on what is allowed and what isn’t,"" said Infantino.""We don’t have to panic. I am not personally worried as well. But we have to look at it seriously. We can't underestimate and say it’s nothing but we don’t have to overreact and panic. We have to follow the instructions given by the authorities,"" he added.The other big soccer tournament on the horizon is at the Olympic Games which is due to be held in Tokyo in July. Infantino said he had not recently discussed the matter with the International Olympic Committee.""We all hope the Olympic Games will take place as planned and that we can travel safely to Japan in the summer,"" he said.The FIFA chief added that he did not believe closed-door matches without fans were a solution to the problem.""I don’t think it is sustainable but that is my personal view. Every competition organiser has to decide what is best for him. In the short term it can be a solution in order to move on but you cannot imagine a few months of a competition with several matches played behind closed doors.""",sports,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74409131,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-114580,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//sports/football/top-stories/fifa-chief-accepts-matches-are-at-risk-due-to-coronavirus/articleshow/74409135.cms
18,['29/02/2020'],FIFA president says open to changes in offside law,"This story is from February 29, 2020

FIFA president Gianni Infantino (AFP Photo)

BELFAST: FIFA president Gianni Infantino says he is open to changes to the offside law to help address problems that have arisen since the introduction of VAR video reviews.

Football's law-making body the International FA Board (IFAB) will meet on Saturday and discuss VAR and the offside law, although no proposal has been tabled for a concrete law change.

Frustration in England's Premier League with VAR ruling out goals for tiny margins of offside, in some cases involving heels and armpits, has led to calls for a different approach.

Some commentators have suggested there should be clear 'daylight' between the attacking player and the defending one for offside to be called while FIFA’s head of global development Arsene Wenger has floated another alternative.

The former Arsenal manager suggested earlier this month that a player should be deemed onside if any part of their body which can legitimately score a goal is level or behind the last defender.

""The offside discussion is an item we need to look at and personally I’m certainly in favour of discussing a new way of looking at the offside rule, to see if it can help, because I think the issue is more an issue of understanding,"" Infantino told reporters on Friday.

""Some of (the decisions) are very, very close and it’s difficult for the people who are watching to see whether it’s offside, so we have to look at whether we can make the offside rule clearer by having light in between,"" he added.

""But it’s for discussion of course – there will be no decision on this one because there is no proposal on the table. But it is to be discussed and to see whether it has to be tested or not,"" added the head of soccer's world governing body.

However Infantino rejected the idea of introducing some element of leeway over offsides.

""It doesn’t solve the issue. Even if you put a margin of 10 centimetres and then if it’s 11, it’s still one more, if it’s 10-1/2... it doesn’t solve it,"" he said.

Infantino suggested the Premier League problem may be due to excessive examination of video reviews.

“In Italy, in Spain, in Portugal, in Germany this offside discussion is not existing on the VAR. But it’s not a problem, it’s something to look into.

""And maybe it shows that actually it’s more a question of the rule and the application of the rule, and application of the VAR itself. If you need 10 minutes to find out whether it was offside, maybe it’s not,"" he said.

One option Infantino rejected outright, however, was getting rid of VAR completely.

“VAR is here to stay as far as FIFA is concerned,"" he said.

This will include not just the songs, but also the background score.Talking about how other music directors have used his work, Tanishk says, “They (background score composers) take my tracks and paste it throughout the film. Case in point is the recent film starring Ayushmann Khurrana ('Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan'). The entire background score actually has many parts of my original songs. That’s why I decided to take this up seriously. Since the background musicians are using my tracks, I thought why not do it myself? Why should someone else take the credit for my music?”Tanishk, who has earlier worked on background scores for other music directors, adds, “Creating a film’s background score will help me be completely involved in the project because I will be composing more than just the songs in it.” When asked about his numerous recreated numbers, he states, “The response to my remixes has always been good, but this year onwards, I am going to concentrate on my original music and score music for the entire albums. Right now, I am doing at least four to five songs for each film that I am composing for.”2020 will see Tanishk getting into live stage performances too and he will be debuting that with an upcoming award show in Bhopal.“I will be singing, playing instruments on stage for the first time. I am preparing myself for being a performer as it will be a very different experience. I have not done something like this before.

24,['29/02/2020'],Supreme Court: Protests can’t infringe rights of others,"This story is from February 29, 2020

NEW DELHI: After a few judges spoke on the cardinality of the right to dissent and protest peacefully, the Supreme Court on Friday ruled that one’s right to protest could not infringe upon the rights of others as it upheld the Uttarakhand high court verdict initiating stringent action against lawyers boycotting district court work for years.

Uttarakhand lawyers had moved the SC claiming that the HC verdict violated their fundamental right to free speech to go on strike court work to protest against issues concerning them. They said it was a mode of peaceful representation to express grievances of the lawyer community.

Rejecting the arguments, a bench of Justices Arun Mishra and M R Shah said, “Such a right to freedom of speech cannot be exercised at the cost of litigants and/or at the cost of the justice delivery system as a whole.”

“To go on strike or boycott courts cannot be justified under the guise of right to freedom of speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution,” the SC bench said.

Advocates in the districts of Dehradun, Haridwar and Udham Singh Nagar have been boycotting court work on Saturdays for the past more than 35 years. The Law Commission had found that between 2012 and 2016, advocates were on strike for 455 days (average 91 days per year) in Dehradun district and 515 days (average 103 days per year) in Haridwar district .

A PIL against the strikes was entertained by the HC, which passed a series of directions on the line of law settled by the apex court banning strikes by lawyers. It also warned of contempt of court proceedings against errant advocates.

The bench also took suo motu cognisance of lawyers resorting to strikes in several parts of the country despite a series of judgments by the SC banning strikes by advocates. “We take suo moto cognisance and issue notices to Bar Council of India and all state bar councils to suggest further course of action and to give concrete suggestions to deal with the problem of strikes/abstaining from work by lawyers,” the bench said and sought responses from BCI and state councils within six weeks.

The court criticised the inaction of BCI and state councils against lawyers indulging in strikes. “The day has now come for the Bar Council of India and bar councils of states to step in and take concrete steps. It is the duty of bar councils to ensure that there is no unprofessional and unbecoming conduct by any lawyer,” it said.

Writing the judgment endorsing the steps taken by the HC against lawyers of three districts of Uttarakhand, Justice Shah said, “We direct all concerned and district bar associations to comply with the directions issued by the high court in its true spirit. It is directed that if it is found that there is any breach of any of the directions issued by the high court in the impugned judgment and order, a serious view shall be taken and the consequences shall follow, including punishment under the Contempt of Courts Act.”

BERLIN: Italian Filippo Ganna beat his own men's individual pursuit world record with a time of 4 minutes and 1.934 seconds at the World Track Cycling Championships in Berlin on Friday.

The 23-year-old, who rides on the road for Team Ineos, was close to breaking the symbolic four-minute mark in his qualifying run.

Ganna had previously set the record with 4 minutes and 2.647 seconds in November. He is bidding for a fourth pursuit world title, having taken gold in 2016, 2018 and 2019.

Ganna, who also claimed world silver in 2017, will face Ashton Lambie in the final later on Friday, after the American qualified in 4min 3.64sec.

Frenchman Corentin Ermenault will face Italian teenager Jonathan Milan for bronze.

Elsewhere, 19-year-old New Zealander Corbin Strong claimed gold in the men's points race in an event which has been scrapped from the programme for this year's Tokyo Olympics.

Spain's Sebastian Mora Vedri finished second with the Netherlands' Roy Eefting in third, as title holder Jan-Willem van Schip decided against competing to focus on the omnium and the madison later in the championships.

LONDON: Formula One 's governing body said on Friday it had reached a settlement with Ferrari after technical investigations into the team's 2019 power unit.

Details of the agreement were kept private but the governing FIA said both parties had agreed to ""a number of technical commitments"".

It said these would improve monitoring of all Formula One power units in future and ""assist the FIA in other regulatory duties in Formula One and in its research activities on carbon emissions and sustainable fuels.""

Ferrari's engine was the subject of much speculation last year, with rivals suspecting the team were circumventing fuel flow sensors to gain performance.

They had started the season as early favourites after impressive times in testing and a clear straight line speed advantage.

The performance appeared to tail off, however, after the FIA issued several technical directives concerning fuel flow sensors later in the year.

The team denied anything untoward, with principal Mattia Binotto saying in December they had been one of the most checked teams on the grid.

""We have never changed our way of operating the engine for the last part of the season,"" he said.

Ferrari finished runners-up to Mercedes last year, with three race wins.

The sensex suffered its second-worst single-day loss ever in terms of points on Friday, falling in tandem with global markets that followed Thursday's crash in US stocks . On Thursday, the Dow had closed 1,191 points lower, its largest-ever one-day drop in points, on fears of a coronavirus pandemic.A key trigger for the fall in US markets was California authorities announcing that they were monitoring 8,400 people for coronavirus. Traders described the fall in the Dow Jones as a correction as US stocks had hit a record high in mid-February.Asian markets had lost 2-3% by the time the Indian market opened. The sensex fell nearly 1,000 points in early trade and slipped further to close down 1,448 points, or 2.6%, as coronavirus fears spead to Europe as well. The cumulative fall in the sensex in six sessions adds up to 2,872 points. Friday’s decline alone wiped out Rs 5.5 lakh crore of investor wealth.Among the sectors that were affected, auto and pharmaceuticals, which have been hit by supply chain disruptions, continued to weaken. New losers were tech and bank stocks which also fell sharply on Friday. All sensex scrips, barring ITC, closed in the red. The only positive for the Indian economy was the fall in international crude oil prices, which slipped to a 12-month low of $50.“As coronavirus spreads rapidly around the world, hopes that it would be contained has vanished and the market fears that it could turn into a pandemic. Investors are fearful that it might lead to global recession as the outbreak is spreading to the world's largest economy - the US as well as Europe, which will adversely impact global supply chains and derail economic growth,” said Siddhartha Khemka, head - retail research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services.“The world markets are in panic mode over the virus. All the money is moving into US treasuries, which are as a safe haven,” said Abhishek Goenka, CEO, IFA Global. While the markets are expected to be under pressure, Goenka does not see a one-to-one correlation between stocks and the rupee. “RBI has built a huge war-chest of $476 billion and it can easily spend $30 billion to defend the rupee,” said Goenka.While the rupee has been holding up so long, concerns of large-scale exit by foreign institutional investors led to the rupee closing 60 paise lower at 72.21. “This week’s fall can be attributed to FIIs who have been aggressively moving flows out of the country. Surprisingly, domestic institutional investors were net buyers this week till Thursday,” said Jimeet Modi, founder & CEO, SAMCO Securities .",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74409441,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-126672,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/coronage-sensex-suffers-its-2nd-biggest-1-day-loss-ever/articleshow/74409144.cms

File image of Brooks Koepka (Reuters Photo)

MIAMI: World number three Brooks Koepka said poor putting was the problem as he missed the cut Friday at the Honda Classic , another speed bump in his return from a left knee injury that hindered him last season.

""I'm fine,"" said Koepka, who had stem cell therapy in August to treat a partially torn patella tendon. ""No complaints. It's nothing to do with my knee. It's just me.""

Specifically it was Koepka's struggles on the greens at PGA National that cost him. He missed half a dozen putts from within 10 feet on Friday as he posted his second straight 74.

His eight-over total put him well outside the projected cut line.

""Struck it really well,"" said Koepka, who had a triple bogey and a double bogey on his card on Thursday and two double bogeys on Friday. ""Really pleased with how I'm hitting it. Putter, I just haven't putted well.""

Koepka teed off on 10 and his hopes of gaining ground to make the cut dimmed at 13, where he was right of the fairway off the tee. His third shot was a chip to nine feet, but he missed the putt to save par as well as the short putt for bogey.

He chipped in for his only birdie of the day at the second, but had a bogey and another double-bogey -- when he was in the water at the par-three fifth -- the rest of the way.

""Maybe need a little bit more touch around the greens, a little more feel,"" said Koepka, noting that he's played only about 18 rounds since August.

As he tries to return to peak form in time for the Masters in April, Koepka is scheduled to play the Arnold Palmer Invitational at Bay Hill next week with the Players, the Valspar Championship and the WGC Match Play Championship to come after that.

""Just need to pick it up a little bit,"" Koepka said.

Andre Silva scored twice as Eintracht Frankfurt reached the last 16 of the Europa League on Friday with a 2-2 draw, and 6-3 aggregate win, over FC Salzburg in a storm-delayed match in Austria.

Frankfurt, 4-1 winners at home, will now play Swiss side Basel in the next round.

Salzburg took the lead at the Red Bull Arena through captain Andreas Ulmer in the 10th minute but Silva headed in the equaliser in the 30th.

The home side again went back in front with a header from defender Jerome Onguene in the 71st but Portuguese striker Silva again equalised by smashing the ball into the top corner from the edge of the area with seven minutes remaining.

The match had been postponed from Thursday after a severe storm warning in the area.

The Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) had on Wednesday condemned Justice Arun Mishra’s praise for the PM. (... Read More

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court judge Arun Mishra on Friday took a dig at those criticising him for praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi at a recent conference, saying he had good things to say about many others but would refrain from doing so lest he is criticised again.

Justice Mishra’s observation came during hearing of a plea challenging SC-appointed monitoring committee’s decision to seal ‘Learning Tree’ play school near Khan Market in Delhi. Senior advocate A M Singhvi, appearing for the school, contended that it was the only play school in Lutyens’ Delhi which has been running for 25 years and its closure would affect many children. He said no construction was done by the school which was run from tents.

The bench, also comprising Justice Deepak Gupta, however, rejected the plea. At the end of the proceedings, Justice Mishra asked Singhvi, “Do you want to hear something good about you? I have some good words for you.”

When Singhvi replied that it would be an honour for him, a smiling Justice Mishra said, “But if I use good words for you then other people will blame me.”

The Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) had on Wednesday condemned Justice Mishra’s praise for the PM and urged judges to maintain judicial independence by refraining from making such statements or show close proximity to the political executive. Mishra, who retires on September 2, had described Modi as an “internationally acclaimed visionary” and a “versatile genius who thinks globally and acts locally”.

Saying that it “expresses its strong reservations of the statement and condemns it strongly,” the SCBA resolution added, “the SCBA believes any such statement reflects poorly on independence of judiciary and so calls upon the judges not to make statements in future nor show any proximity or closeness to the executive, including higher functionaries”.

Justice Mishra and Singhvi also engaged in a humorous exchange on ‘Khan Market elite’ — a common refrain in the capital’s social circles. When the lawyer told the bench that the school was just across the road, the judge asked Singhvi whether he is also part of ‘Khan Market elite’. Singhvi said he never lived in Lutyens’ Delhi but won’t mind being called so. He said even judges visited the famed market for shopping, prompting Justice Mishra to add, “Do not bring judges into controversy.”’

34,['29/02/2020'],GDP growth in October-December quarter slows to near 7-year low of 4.7%,"(Representative image: Reuters)

Coronavirus impact an unfolding story: Government

NEW DELHI: The country’s quarterly economic growth slowed to a near seven-year-low in the October-December period of 2019-20, dragged down by contraction in manufacturing and electricity, reinforcing the view that more measures are needed to help the economy navigate choppy waters, especially with the coronavirus threat looming.Data released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) on Friday showed GDP (gross domestic product) grew by 4.7% in the December quarter, slower than the upwardly revised growth of 5.1% in the previous quarter and below the downwardly revised 5.6% in the December quarter of 2018-19. The October-December GDP growth of 4.7% is the slowest in 27 quarters according to official data and slowest since the 4.3% expansion in the January-March quarter of 2012-13.Since the NSO has revised quarterly data for 2018-19 and 2019-20 it may be difficult to do a comparison given the fact that revisions for other quarters are yet to be unveiled.The NSO also retained the GDP growth estimate of 5% for 2019-20 in the second advance estimate but did not spell out anything about any impact of the coronavirus impact, which is expected to be a major drag on global economic growth.The farm sector was the mainstay of growth, growing by a steady 3.5% during the December quarter compared with 2% growth. The manufacturing sector contracted 0.2%, compared with a 5.2% expansion in the year-earlier quarter but a decline of 0.4% in the previous quarter.The services sector, which accounts for nearly 60% of the economy, grew 7.4% in the December quarter, slightly higher than the 7.3% in the previous quarter and at the same level of the previous year-ago quarter.The government, which has unveiled a string of measures since last year and in the February Budget, said growth may have bottomed out. “We have noted the estimates of growth for third quarter of 2019-20. Sustained improvement in agricultural and services continue to drive the growth. The turnaround in composite eight core industries index in December 19 and January indicates well for the manufacturing sector,” economic affairs secretary Atanu Chakraborty said. Asked about the impact of the coronavirus outbreak, he said it was an unfolding story.Experts have cautioned that the outbreak could have a significant impact on growth given the country’s strong links to Chinese imports across sectors and the impact on the global supply chain.Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said the government is closely monitoring the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on the economy and has said there is no need to press the panic button.“Based on the expenditure method, robust and double digit growth in consumption along with higher government expenditure has driven the overall GDP growth in Q3-FY20. However, contraction in gross fixed capital formation (GCFC) has limited the upside,” said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at Care Ratings.“The investment activity, as measured by GFCF (as a % of GDP) has declined to 26.1% in Q3-FY20 compared with 29.1% shared in corresponding quarter a year ago. The decline in growth in GFCF has been significant at 3.3% in Q3-FY20 as against a robust growth of 16.3% seen in Q3-FY19,” said Sabnavis. GCFC is a proxy for investment.The Indian economy, Asia’s third largest, has been in the throes of a slowdown as investment and consumption have remained tepid. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has also aggressively cut rates to support growth and has indicated its willingness to do more if needed.“At present, it is difficult to conclude whether the risks arising from the rapid spread of the coronavirus for domestic tourism, trade and manufacturing, would outweigh the improved outlook for the agricultural sector and rural spending, engendered by the encouraging outlook for the rabi crop,” said Aditi Nayar, principal economist at ratings agency ICRA.“The continued slowdown in economic growth in Q3 FY2020 suggests that the MPC (monetary policy committee) may well undertake another rate cut, but only when the CPI inflation retraces considerably towards the 4% mark. Therefore, we continue to expect a pause, at least in the April 2020 and June 2020 policy reviews,” said Nayar.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74411816,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-178576,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/gdp-growth-in-oct-dec-quarter-slows-to-near-7-year-low-of-4-7/articleshow/74409382.cms

Tiger Woods' back remains stiff and he will not play in next week's Arnold Palmer Invitational in Florida where he has won eight times, his agent said on Friday.

""Back still stiff and just not quite ready,"" Mark Steinberg said in a text to ESPN when asked if the former world number one would play at Bay Hill.

Woods, who is chasing a record 83rd career win on the PGA Tour , has not played since finishing last at 11-over par 295 among players who made the cut at the Genesis Invitational at Riviera in California two weeks ago.

""I was just off, it happens,"" Woods, who has been bothered by a stiff back, said after the tournament.

""I’m off and I got a chance to have the week off (passing on last week's WGC-Mexico Championship) and do a little prep, a little practising, some training, be at home and all positive things.""

The 44-year-old also decided not to play in this week's Honda Classic near his South Florida home.

Woods said on Tuesday he would prepare for the April 9-12 Masters in much the same way as in 2019 when he ended an 11-year wait for a major title at Augusta National.

“It worked last year, so yeah, I’ve got a blueprint for what I need to do and hopefully I can have the same feelings,” Woods said on a conference call.

36,['29/02/2020'],fc goa: ISL: Ability to stay calm behind Corominas's goal-scoring feats,"This story is from February 29, 2020

File image of Ferran Corominas (TOI Photo)

CHENNAI: Ferran Corominas might be 37, but there is hardly any let-up in his intensity. Having been prolific in the past two seasons, FC Goa ’s Spanish striker has continued his rich vein of form and netted 14 times this season to be the joint second-highest scorer in the Indian Super League (ISL) behind Kerala Blasters’ Bartholomew Ogbeche (15 goals). He has also managed to take his total ISL tally to 55 goals – the most by any striker – and will be gunning to add one more Golden Boot to the two he has already won over the last two seasons.

What sets Corominas apart is his consistency and finding the net in crunch situations since joining Goa back in the 2017 season. So even though forward Hugo Boumous has proved to be the most influential player for FC Goa this season, Corominas still remains the biggest threat for Chennaiyin when the two sides face off in the first semifinal on Saturday.

Corominas said that his ability to stay calm under pressure is the reason behind him scoring on the big stage.

“Throughout my career, I have loved to score on big occasions. This is because I can stay calm and composed. I am not intimidated by pressure. My dream is to score in the ISL final and help the team win,” Corominas told TOI on Sunday.

The reason behind the Spaniard’s success in the league is his vision for goals. Neither a poacher nor having the physique to bully defenders, he finds spaces behind the defence to run into and has the uncanny ability to be at the right spot at the right time.

“It’s about keeping the focus, having the mentality to score when it matters and striking a bond with teammates. It’s not about adapting to each other. It’s about the application on the pitch. Having stayed together for so many years, we know each other’s strengths and weaknesses. We have been practising the same style over the years and now it has become much easier to understand where the ball will come from. So it helps me to take my position,” Corominas said.

He, though, is aware that things might not be easy for the team on Saturday despite the fact that Goa have got the better of Chennaiyin twice this season.

“They are coming on the back of very good momentum. It will be foolish to take Chennaiyin lightly. All their foreign players are well rested and they will be aiming to prove a point against us,” he said.

The former Elche player admits that he is at the twilight of his career and is already taking coaching lessons. But he wants to realise his one last dream before saying goodbye to the sport.

“My dream is to score in the ISL final and help Goa triumph. The hard work that we have put in over the last three years should translate into the ISL title. I don’t know what the future will bring but if I can stay fit and find enough motivation and excitement, I would love to continue playing.

""At the moment, I am getting my coaching license. I am one level away from turning into a professional coach,” he signed off.

37,['29/02/2020'],"Gokulam Kerala, Punjab FC not giving up on I-League title race","This story is from February 29, 2020

Gokulam Kerala and Punjab FC are unwilling to give up on the title race even as Mohun Bagan are 12 points clear at the top of the I-League table with at least seven more rounds remaining.

Punjab, visitors to Gokulam’s home turf in Kozhikode on Saturday, sit second in the 11-team table with 21 points. The 2017-18 champions have been solid since a first-round thrashing from Churchill and their only other defeat since then came early February against Mohun Bagan.

“We are not losing hope,” said Punjab coach Yan Law on the eve of their clash with Gokulam at the EMS Corporation Stadium. “They (Mohun Bagan) also have seven more matches to play and mathematically it is still possible, so we will keep doing our part,” he added.

Gokulam head coach Santiago Varela, whose side are sixth with 17 points, reciprocated: “It is very difficult (to close the gap) but always possible if you are willing to fight. Mohun Bagan are now more stronger than when they started the I-League. But anything is possible.”

Even as the two sides have their eyes set on the big prize, they are determined to not lose any more ground as the difference between the second- and tenth-placed Aizawl is only six points.

“This match is vital for us to keep our position and stay second for now,” said Yan Law.

Punjab had a 1-0 win over Real Kashmir in their previous outing two weeks ago and will be hoping for an encore on their 3-1 thumping of Gokulam when the two met in Ludhiana in January. Dipanda Dicka had a brace in the win and the Punjab front-man, with nine goals, should be eager to go top of the goalscorers’ table replacing Bagan hitman Javier Gonzalez.

“It is going to be a tough game because they are well organised. Their coach always comes up with something new every time. The conditions are humid than where we come from, so it could be a bit difficult,” said the Punjab coach.

Gokulam, meanwhile, are happy to return to home comfort after throwing a lead and losing 2-3 to Neroca last week. Varela has blamed the quality of grounds elsewhere that he believes deters the execution of his passing game.

“If we don’t have a good pitch, it is difficult to play our style of football . But here we are happy,” said Varela, who is expected to reinstate Henry Kisekka alongside captain and top scorer Marcus Joseph after dropping the Ugandan in Imphal.

The match will kick-off at 7 pm and the home side has planned a half-time introduction of their women’s team that lifted the Indian Women’s League on Valentine’s Day.

Panic in the stock market over the spreading coronavirus continued into a seventh day on Friday, with world share markets crashing again, compounding their worst week since the 2008 global financial crisis and bringing the global wipeout to $5 trillion.The S&P 500 index dropped more than 3 percent in early trading Friday. Before trading began, the index was already down more than 12 percent from a record high reached just last week, and the drop has put the index on track for its worst week since the 2008 financial crisis.The sell-off is fueled mostly by worry that measures to contain the virus would hamper corporate profits and economic growth, and fears that the outbreak could get worse. The selling has dragged stock benchmarks around the world into a correction — a drop of 10 percent or more that’s taken as a measure of extreme pessimism — in a matter of days.A potential outbreak in the United States represents a significant test for President Trump, whose presidential success has been deeply tied to the economy and a rising stock market.On Friday, the slide in Asia and Europe followed a 4.4 percent nose-dive in the S&P 500 index on Thursday, the worst day for American shares since 2011.Hopes that the epidemic that started in China late last year would be over in months, and that economic activity would quickly return to normal, have been shattered as the number of international cases have spiraled. “Investors are trying to price in the worst-case scenario and the biggest risk is what happens now in the United States and other major countries outside of Asia,” said SEI Investments Head of Asian Equities John Lau.“These are highly uncertain times, no one really knows the answer and the markets are really panicking.”Fear over the economic fallout from the spreading coronavirus tightened its grip on global markets, sending US equities to a seventh straight loss and sparking demand for safe assets from Treasuries to the yen.The S&P 500 plunged more than 3.5% Friday and is now down 15% from its record. The index is mired in its longest slump in over three years and careening toward its worst week since the financial crisis. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has shed more than 4,000 points this week. Treasury yields sank to all-time lows, with the two-year tumbling through 1% and 30-year rates under 1.7%. Crude slid toward $45 a barrel, while gold lost 2%. European shares headed for August lows and Asian equities fell more than 3%.The sell-off picked up steam after a White House official suggested the virus could force some schools to close and more companies warned that disruptions could upend sales and profit forecasts. Germany quarantined about 1,000 people and Switzerland banned large events, leading to the Geneva car show being canceled. Iran and South Korea revealed more infections while the first cases appeared in Mexico and Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country.That’s all put shares worldwide on course for the worst week since the 2008 crisis, down around 10%. With the likes of Citigroup Inc. saying they want to see markets “closer to panic” before going all-in on global equities, the dip buyers who have helped make this bull market the longest on record are nowhere to be seen.“Investors are selling stocks first and asking questions later,” Keith Lerner, SunTrust’s chief market strategist, wrote in a note. “We are seeing signs of pure liquidation. ‘Get me out at any cost’ seems to be the prevailing mood. There is little doubt the coronavirus will continue to weigh on the global economy, and the US will not be immune. There is much we do not know. However, it is also premature to suggest the base case for the US economy is recession.”Downgrades to the global outlook keep rolling in and money markets now see three Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts this year. Bank of America predicted that the global economy will see its weakest year since the financial crisis as the virus damages demand in China and beyond.“Asset prices diverged significantly from growth in the past year, in part because of central bank policy, but also because passive investment’s main signal is price action,” reckons James McCormick, global head of desk strategy at NatWest Markets. “The COVID-19 escalation runs a real risk of virtuous cycle turning to a vicious one. Either way, given where growth estimates are heading for the next few months, I’d expect more downside.”Amid the hunt for havens, the yen is on course for its biggest weekly gain since mid-2016, though gold was set for a decline after a multi-month rally.Elsewhere, New Zealand’s dollar fell 1% Friday as the country reported its first case of the virus and investors bet on policy easing from the central bank.

Of course, the biggest challenge was to play a homosexual guy being a heterosexual guy.""Meanwhile, the film is helmed by Hitesh Kewalya and also stars Neena Gupta , Gajraj Rao, Manvi Gagroo, Manu Rishi and more.Now, on the other hand, Vicky Kaushal 's 'Bhoot: The Haunted Ship' which also released on the same day as Ayushmann's flick collected Rs 23 crore nett in one week. The BOI report stated that Vicky's film scored Rs 1 crore on its second Friday. Reportedly, the reason behind such low turn out is that the weekend was dull and weekday trend was not as strong as it should have been which could mean a dull second week.Well, during an exclusive interaction with Etimes, Vicky opened up about his horror film. He said, ''My experience of shooting for Bhoot was amazing and it was a great learning experience for me because it was a completely new genre. It was a genre I was not prepared for, a grammar I was not prepared for.The film is helmed by Bhanu Pratap Singh and also stars Bhumi Pednekar and Ashutosh Rana in pivotal roles.

NEW DELHI: The official death toll in northeast Delhi’s riots rose to 42 on Friday with four more people dying at Guru Tegh Bahadur Hospital. The Jumma prayers, meanwhile, passed off peacefully. Policemen and paramilitary forces kept a close watch, with drones deployed above, during the 10 hours of section 144 being relaxed.The police are, however, still looking for AAP councillor Tahir Hussain, booked in the murder case of IB official Ankit Sharma. His mobile phone has been switched off and a man who was coordinating with the media on his behalf claimed he has not been in touch with him as well. On Friday, a forensic team, along with members of SIT, inspected the drain from where Sharma’s body had been recovered. The police suspect that Sharma was first killed and then his body dumped in the drain.GTB’s medical director Dr Sunil Kumar told TOI they had recorded 38 deaths since Monday. Of these, 16 people have been identified and 12 are unknown. Seven had gunshot injuries, eight had blunt assault wounds, three had been stabbed, five had suffered burns, one had been stabbed and shot while the cause in four cases was unknown. He added that about 50 injured people were still in the hospital.Lok Nayak Hospital has recorded three deaths and another death has been reported from Jag Pravesh Chandra Hospital in east Delhi ’s Shahdara. Dr Kishore Singh, medical director of Lok Nayak Hospital, said 56 injured people had been brought there in the past four days. One of them was brought dead while two died during treatment. Eleven people are still in hospital, he said.“On Monday, when the riots began and patients started pouring in with serious injuries, there was some chaos. But within a day, a system was put in place for smooth triaging – deciding the order of treatment – depending on seriousness of the injuries and to manage the manpower needs. Some of the staffers who were on leave were asked to join immediately,” said a senior nursing staff at GTB Hospital.This hospital, with 2,500 beds, is the largest in east Delhi. Due to its proximity to the areas where maximum violence took place, most of the injured were rushed to the hospital beginning Monday.A senior official in the state health department said Wednesday onwards, when GTB Hospital’s emergency wing was running to near-full capacity, some of the patients with minor injuries were referred to Jag Pravesh Chandra and other hospitals. “Now, the government has also clarified that it will bear the cost of treatment for those injured in the riots even if they are being treated at private facilities,” he pointed out.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74409567,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-690173,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-riots-toll-rises-to-42-as-4-more-die-in-hospital-friday-prayers-pass-off-peacefully/articleshow/74409479.cms
41,['29/02/2020'],"Differences in Maha alliance, this time over Muslim quota","This story is from February 29, 2020

File photo of Eknath Shinde (L) and Nawab Malik (R)

MUMBAI: The Maha Vikas Aghadi government will provide 5% reservation for Muslims in government educational institutions, minorities minister Nawab Malik announced in the legislative council on Friday, drawing sharp reactions from the opposition as well as the Shiv Sena, which said no decision has been taken yet. If implemented, the total reservation in the state will rise to 69%.

The move takes forward a 2014 ordinance brought in by the then Congress-NCP government to provide quota for Muslims in education and government jobs. The Bombay high court had stayed the job reservation and quota in private educational institutions, but had cleared it for state-run educational institutions. Malik said the government will soon bring a bill as per HC orders. This means, private educational institutions and government jobs will not be included.

The NCP minister’s announcement in reply to a Congress member’s query comes barely a week after the allies clashed on the issue of CAA and NPR. CM and Sena boss Uddhav Thackeray had initially backed the Centre on CAA and NPR, only to concede ground later and signal conditional support following criticism from allies NCP and Congress.

When BJP’s Bhai Girkar sought to know if the Sena supported the quota, Malik said, “The Sena is committed to resolve the issues of various communities, including Muslims. Also when it was part of the previous regime and NCP-Congress MLAs raised the issue of Muslim reservation, several Sena MLAs had supported it.”

Several states such as Kerala, Bihar, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal already have reservation for Muslims.

Congress MLC Husnabanu Khalife demanded that the issue of reservation for Muslims be decided before admissions begin in May. Minorities minister Nawab Malik replied that a decision would be taken at the earliest.

On the issue of reservation for Muslims in government jobs and private educational institutions, Malik told the legislative council these issues would be resolved.

The quota issue was raised by Congress’ Sharad Ranpise who expressed unhappiness over the written reply given by the government and said, “The answer is the same as that given by the previous government.” Ranpise then asked if the 5% reservation which was not stayed by the Bombay HC in its interim order would be implemented.

However, Sena minister Eknath Shinde said no decision has been taken so far on the issue. ""The CM will take a decision after speaking to all the allies at the right time,"" said Shinde.

Opposition leader in the assembly Devendra Fadnavis later told TOI that BJP was opposed to all reservations based on religion. “We want to what deals the Sena has agreed to, to form the government. When the Sena was with us it had opposed the reservation. We will oppose the reservation based on religion. Also, there is no final order (of the Bombay High Court ) on the 5% reservation,” he said.

Fadnavis said Dr B R Ambedkar’s Constitution does not allow for reservation based on religion. A similar view was taken by the Andhra Pradesh High Court, he added.

“The Modi government has already provided 10% reservation for the economically poor which includes Muslims. This enabled a Muslim boy to obtain admission in the IIT,” he said.

The Muslim reservation will impact that for the Other Backward Caste and Maratha community reservation, he said.

42,['29/02/2020'],"‘After Balakot, Pak will think 100 times before a misadventure’","This story is from February 29, 2020

Defence minister Rajnath Singh (File Photo)

NEW DELHI: India’s “out-of-the-box” response against cross-border terrorism through air strikes on the JeM facility at Balakot a year ago has forced rewriting of doctrines and military manuals in Pakistan, which will now “think 100 times” before trying “any future misadventures”, defence minister Rajnath Singh said on Friday.

“Today, the world stands shoulder-to-shoulder with India in forcing countries like Pakistan to bring terrorists to justice. We have recently seen the impact of collective diplomatic and financial pressure on Pakistan. Terrorists like Hafiz Saeed , who were treated like VIPs and heroes, have been put behind bars,” said Singh.

But much more needs to be done, said the minister, adding that unless Pakistan was made fully accountable for sponsoring cross-border terrorism, it will continue with its “previous policy of duplicity and deceit”. “All attempts are being made to work in this direction … Our approach to terrorism was, and will remain, a judicious combination of clinical military action and mature and responsible diplomatic outreach,” he said, speaking at a seminar on “No War, No Peace” organised by the Centre for Air Power Studies to mark the first anniversary of the Balakot air strikes.

The 2016 “surgical strikes” and the Balakot air strikes were not just resolute military strikes against terrorism but also sent a strong and unequivocal message to Pakistan that it can no longer use terror infrastructure on its soil as “safe havens” to wage a low-cost war against India. “Balakot must teach us to think strategic rather than tactical,” said Singh, adding that while an operational victory may be achieved on the ground, the real war must be won in the enemy’s mind.

IAF chief Air Chief Marshal R K S Bhadauria, in turn, said the government’s “bold decision” to strike at the “heart of terrorist training camps” inside Pakistan represented a paradigm shift in use of air power in a sub-conventional scenario. Pakistan’s “Operation Swift Retort”, the attempted counter-strike with a large package of aircraft 30 hours after the Balakot air strikes, was an effort to satisfy its domestic audience and was successfully thwarted by the IAF, he said.

“We had an edge over Pakistan Air Force in terms of beyond visual range missiles at the time of the Kargil conflict in 1999. But we allowed that to slip and thereafter it took a decade and a half in our struggle to acquire better capabilities,” said ACM Bhadauria, adding that the induction of the 36 Rafales from France from this year onwards will help the IAF in retaining the combat edge.

Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat, on his part, said India must maintain credible deterrence in land, air and at sea at all times, stressing that the three Services must closely work together to deal with any potential threats. “Credible deterrence comes from the will of the military leadership and intent of the political class while taking tough decisions. This was amply shown after Kargil, Uri and Pulwama attacks,” he added.

ARA/ PATNA : A team of vigilance investigation bureau arrested Sarna panchayat mukhiya Sanjay Kumar Singh (45) while he was allegedly accepting a bribe of Rs 63,000 at his residence at Sarna village in Bhojpur district from a ward councillor Phulsundari Devi on Friday. The arrested mukhiya is also Shahpur block president of Lok Janshakti Party (LJP).

Phulsundari is the councillor of ward number eight which falls under Sarna panchayat. The raiding team was led by DSP Sarvesh Kumar Singh.

Vigilance sources said the woman councillor had constructed drainage and had got water-supply pipelines laid in her ward under the Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s ambitious seven-resolves scheme and the mukhiya was demanding a bribe to clear her bank cheque against the expenses made. They said that it is the mukhiya who used to make payments against such construction work under the scheme.

“The mukhiya had demanded 40% as commission from the entire amount spent on construction work. A total bribe money, as calculated by mukhiya was Rs 1,26,600,” a senior official of the bureau said preferring anonymity.

He said the final deal was struck at Rs 1.25 lakh and Rs 63,000 was the first instalment to be paid to the mukhiya. “The bribe was to be paid on Thursday. However, he was busy due to some meeting of his party at the panchayat- level. We delayed the raid by a day after which action was taken on Friday,” said the official.

Vigilance bureau sources said the ward councillor had written to the block development officer and others for clearing her payment against the construction work but no action was taken. “She finally wrote to the bureau on February 17. The very next day, the bureau verified her complaint and found it to be true that the mukhiya was demanding money to clear her payment. Following this, a trap team was formed to nab him,” he said.

PATNA: The state police headquarters has sounded an alert in the state in view of forthcoming festivals, especially Holi. The recent violence in Delhi and pro or anti-CAA protests in the state has kept senior police officers on their toes. Upcoming assembly elections are also in the mind of law enforcement agencies.

The SPs of the districts, which had witnessed group clashes in the past, have been asked to maintain extra vigil on movement of outsiders or unfamiliar faces. The members of cyber senani groups have been directed to closely monitor fake news or rumours spread through social media.

ADG (law & order) Amit Kumar said on Friday, “An alert is in place. We have made foolproof security arrangements to ensure peace and harmony. Additional forces are being deployed in the districts identified as sensitive from security point of view.”

Though Kumar refused to share details of force deployment, sources said four companies of Rapid Action Force would be deployed in hyper sensitive districts in the state.

A senior IPS officer said special arrangements were made in the districts which have witnessed anti or pro-CAA protest marches recently. “In fact, the entire state has been put on alert,” he added.

Besides RAF, the state anti-riot force’s 15 companies would also be deployed in the districts. Each company comprises 96 effective personnel, who have been imparted special training to deal with mobs.

Those cops who were earlier earmarked for training have been sent to the parent districts of their posting. The police chiefs of the districts which had earlier witnessed group clashes during festivals have been asked to arrest anti-socials.

The DGP, during his recent visit to several districts, had told the SPs to conduct beat meeting with people in neighbourhood localities.

In addition, intelligence agencies have been asked to give inputs on anti or pro-CAA protest sites. They have been assigned to keep a close watch on the developments.

“We will not allow any miscreant to create trouble,” said an IG rank officer, who is on field assignment.

Bihar minister Bijendra Prasad Yadav

PATNA: Energy minister Bijendra Prasad Yadav was non-committal on Friday regarding introduction of domicile policy in Bihar even as leader of opposition in state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav maintained that non-pursuance of domicile policy for the natives of Bihar had led to candidates from other states getting most government jobs here.

Tejashwi said the government in neighbouring Jharkhand and some other states have introduced domicile policy for 100% government jobs to the locals. “However, due to non-pursuance of the domicile policy in Bihar, youths going to other states in search of government and private jobs are being harassed and assaulted,” Tejashwi told reporters outside the assembly.

While giving the government’s reply to the call attention motion from an RJD member who had sought to know if the government had any intention to introduce domicile policy for the natives of the state, Bijendra said, “Give it in writing which states have been implementing what kind of domicile policy and also mention in which states youths from Bihar are assaulted or prevented from getting government jobs. After you give it in writing, our government will look into it.”

Bijendra said be it the government jobs or admissions to educational institutions, scheduled caste, scheduled tribe, backward castes and extremely backward castes have got 50% reservation in the state. “If 10% additional quota enjoyed by the economically weaker sections in the state is considered, the total reservation goes up to 60%. The remaining 40% is open for the natives of Bihar and from other states,” he said.

“Youths from Bihar going to other states for jobs is not a problem, because they are free to find job anywhere in the country,” he added.

While addressing a public meeting in Gaya district as part of his ‘Berojgari Hatao Yatra’ on Thursday, Tejashwi had maintained that if elected to power, the RJD government would implement the domicile policy for the natives of Bihar and give 80% of jobs to the locals.

Earlier in the day, Tejashwi tweeted, “Nitishji lacks willpower. People are going to moon, but he is unable to give jobs to seven crore youths from Bihar. Good schools, colleges, universities and world-class institutions needed to be opened in the state.”

In another tweet, he wrote, “In the last 15 years, not even a factory for needles has been established. What is the reason that no one is willing to set up IT park, manufacturing, food processing and other industrial units in the state (sic)?”

‘4,012 medical officers to be appointed’: Health minister Mangal Pandey said in the state assembly on Friday that decks have been cleared for the appointment of 4,012 medical officers and 2,425 specialist doctors on the recommendations of the Bihar State Technical Commission (BSTC). Counselling for the same will be completed by the end of March, the minister said.

Similarly, the counselling of nursing staff and auxiliary nursing maids (ANMs) have also been completed for their posting in various government hospitals, the minister said while giving the government’s reply to the short-notice question of RJD member Shiv Chandra Ram.

SURAT: Diamond workers in the world’s largest diamond cutting and polishing centre in Surat are on the warpath against state government on the issue of professional tax . The industry is set to witness closure and dharnas by workers from March 15.

Surat Ratnakalakar Sangh (SRS) has given a call for bandh in the diamond industry on March 16 to demand abolition of professional tax charged by the state government from diamond workers. A three-day long dharna programme will be organized at Mini Bazaar diamond market in Varachha from March 15.

SRS president Jaysukh Gajera told reporters, “About 5.5 lakh workers will stay away from work on March 16 to demand abolition of professional tax. We are appealing unit owners to support workers by keeping their units shut for a day.”

Gajera added, “Workers and the industry have for long been demanding abolition of professional tax, but the state government is yet to accept this. The government is collecting over Rs150 crore worth of tax from workers and that they are not being given any benefits.”

He said diamond workers are not getting enough work in the industry due to weak market conditions and that the diamond unit owners have slashed production of polished diamonds in the last few months. Last year, more than 13,000 diamond workers were laid off from small and medium diamond units.

Meanwhile, Surat Diamond Association (SDA) has stated that an industry delegation will be meeting chief minister Vijay Rupani in Gandhinagar to make a representation against professional tax on March 2.

SURAT: Federation of Surat Textile Traders’ Association ( FOSTTA ) has urged Union ministry of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) to provide status of MSME to textile traders in the city.

FOSTTA office-bearers held a meeting with special secretary and development commissioner of MSME, Ram Mohan Mishra, who was on a day’s visit to the Diamond City on Friday. The traders’ body raised several issues including that of their long-pending demand of providing MSME status to textile traders.

Purshottam Agarwal, joint secretary of FOSTTA, said, “Textile trading business involves 60% job work on cloth, which passes from more than 12 different types of processes. However, traders are also manufacturers and that they should be given the status of MSME.”

Traders said a representation has been made to MSME development commissioner for setting up a ready-made garment centre in Surat.

FOSTTA president Manoj Agarwal said, “We raised an important issue with MSME development commissioner for setting up a skill development centre for women doing hand-embroidery on saris and dress material. After GST implementation, hundreds of women have been rendered jobless.”

SURAT: The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence ( DRI ) has detected Rs 30 crore scam under the export incentive scheme by Tamil Nadu-based exporters of mosquito nets.

Official sources said that the DRI’s Surat unit had raided two firms based in Karur in Tamil Nadu exporting bed nets and mosquito nets. The DRI sleuths had received intelligence that the firms were indulging in fake classification of their export products and wrongfully claiming the Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) benefit despite their non-eligibility.

Sources said that the MEIS scheme is an export incentive scheme of the Union government under which exporters get 1-7% of the free on board (FOB) value of their export product as incentive depending upon their product and customs tariff heading under which they are classified.

During the search operation on the two Tamil Nadu based firms, the officials found incriminating documents related to the misuse of the MIES for getting benefits. The owners of the firm admitted in their statements that they had wrongly availed the MEIS benefit.

The total value on the ineligible MEIS scrips issued and utilised by the exporters was worth Rs 30 crore. The exporters voluntarily paid Rs 5.4 crore towards wrongful availment of benefit under the MEIS scheme.

Official sources said that the exporters have been asked to pay up the rest of the amount wrongly claimed under the MEIS. Further investigations are going on.

SURAT: Nylon yarn spinners and powerloom weavers are engaged in a face off over anti-dumping duty on import of nylon filament yarn proposed by Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR), Government of India.

Yarn spinners from the city had filed a petition with DGTR for imposing anti-dumping duty on nylon filament yarn last year. On February 4, DGTR had issued a disclosure report in favour of yarn spinners, considering the injury to domestic industry due to dumping of cheap nylon yarn by China.

Powerloom weavers started a campaign against spinners stating that anti-dumping duty on nylon yarn will ruin the industry by allowing spinners to form price cartels to loot weavers. Weavers feared that the anti-dumping duty on nylon yarn would increase domestic yarn prices by Rs 100 per kilogram.

According to yarn spinners, out of the total 18 nylon yarn spinners in India, about 11 are based in Surat. The industry is suffering from cheap import of low-grade yarn from China since 2016. About 23 metric tonnes of nylon yarn were imported from China in 2016, which rose to 1,250 metric tonnes in 2019.

Nylon Spinners’ Association (NSA) president Narayan Agarwal said, “Weavers are making false allegations about yarn price hike in domestic market to influence proceedings in DGTR. Majority of weavers are using yarn manufactured by local spinners and only 0.4% utilize imported yarn.”

NSA vice-president Rakesh Choudhary said, “After disclosure report by DGTR, importers’ lobby is backing weavers to spread false propaganda to influence the ongoing proceedings. We can’t even think of increasing prices by Rs100 per kilogram thereby losing business in domestic market. Weavers are trying to malign the image of spinning sector.”

Pandesara Weavers’ Association Ashish Gujarati said, “There is no anti-dumping duty on nylon yarn, but the moment it is imposed spinners will definitely rig prices. We fear that about 1.5 lakh powerlooms will be affected and more than 6,000 workers will lose their job.”

SURAT: They have rejected fear to accept life, a new living free from prejudices and social stigma. As many as 75 women have come out open on their HIV positive status and will search for suitable marriage partner at a marriage fair which is being organised in Hazira on Saturday.

In what appears to be a positive step towards positive thinking, the numbers this year have almost doubled compared to the past years in among participants of 'Jivan Sathi Chayan Mela'. The fair is organized by the Gujarat State Network of Positive People (GSNP+) — an organisation run by HIV positive people from across Gujarat.

In the annual fair, majority of the volunteers are couples who found their partners in similar fairs organised in the past.

Along with awareness drive, organisers are encouraging the women to attend the fair offering benefits like transportation charges. Along with participants from Gujarat, many from other neighbouring states including Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan are also participating.

""It is a good sign that women are shedding their inhibitions. In past only 20 to 25 women attended such fairs but the growing numbers reflect their rejection of fear from being identified,"" said Daksha Patel , founder of GSNP+.

Patel further said that by marrying a suitable match these HIV positive people will find a reason to enjoy their lives like any other normal person.

NEW DELHI: AAP councillor Tahir Hussain , who has been booked in the murder case of IB official Ankit Sharma , is absconding. His mobile phone is switched off.

As per the FIR registered on the complaint of Ankit’s father, Ravinder, “Tahir had gathered goons at his residence who were engaged in violence and firing, throwing petrol bombs and pelting stones.”

“My son stepped out on February 25 evening to buy some items for the house, but never returned home. He was found just in his underwear, and had wounds on his head, face, chest, waist and back by a sharp weapon. He even had burnt marks on his body,” Ravinder added.

On Friday, a team of the forensic department, along with the SIT team members, reached the drain from where the body was recovered. As blood was found there, police suspect Sharma was first killed and then his body dumped in the drain.

The SIT also inspected the riot-hit areas. Initial examination of Hussain’s video indicates that his speech may have been superimposed in the background of riots. Not only is the background changing slightly but his ears are also missing in some frames, said a source.

Meanwhile, inquiry into the attack on DCP Shahdara, Amit Sharma, and other officials has revealed that after Sharma was attacked, the protesters went on a rampage. TNN

Jaipur: With spurt in population and increase in demand for land, the illegal construction and development of colonies in the city is on rise.

As per the data available, in 2009 attempts to develop 66 illegal colonies were checked by the Jaipur Development Authority (JDA). Similarly, the civic body took action against the 4,000 illegal constructions in its periphery. Though the numbers look impressive, the illegal colonies and construction continued to crop up.

Chief minister Ashok Gehlot last week also pulled up the officials about the alleged corruption within the department because of which illegal construction is rampant. Sources in the department said, “After the CM pointed out corruption in the enforcement wing, three officials were relieved on Friday. A list of officials are also been prepared who are allegedly involve in shielding or promoting illegal construction,” sources said.

Source said, the move to relieve officials were taken after receiving repeated complaints from zone 9 and 10 and Privthi Raj Nagar, south region. The civic body's ground officials are allegedly turning a blind eye to these illegal constructions. “Settling illegal colonies on vacant government land is not the only type of corruption in PRN; high-rises going beyond permissible heights in connivance with JDA officials are the latest abuse of law taking place in this locality. Private developers are blatantly violating the building bylaws,” said sources.

Chennai: As discussion begins to assess the feasibility of life insurers to design and offer health insurance products, existing and potential policyholders may be offered bundled packages of life and health products, with a possibility of cheaper insurance premiums. “Unlike non-life insurers we can offer unique bundled products like — life and health products, health and savings. In this case, the morbidity risk still stays with us, but the savings part goes back to the customer. We may also offer five-year guaranteed premium products as we have the expertise to offer long-time products. Given our history of having a significant distribution channel, we plan to leverage on them to cover the significantly bigger under-insured population,” said Bikash Choudhary, appointed actuary and chief risk officer, Future Generali India Life Insurance Company Limited.

Last Tuesday, IRDA announced the setting up of a committee to study the feasibility of allowing life insurers to offer indemnity based health policies, Life insurers have expressed interest and their ability to create newer markets to cover the under insured population.

NS Kannan, MD and CEO, ICICI Pru Life Insurance said the focus has shifted to living well from living long. Going forward, the problem of the country is not mortality as longevity is increasing, but are people living well and healthy. Speaking on the advantage which life insurance companies will have in offering health products, Kannan said, “The deep expertise to assess morbidity and mortality is the biggest advantage, in managing the risks associated around health products.”

On pricing of health insurance policies by life insurers, Aalok Bhan, Director and CMO, Max Life Insurance said if a customer is buying both life and health cover from the same insurance provider at a given point of time, there will be no need for separate medical and financial underwriting for each product, thus, cost of policy issuance and administration might also be lower. There will be a possibility to pass on such cost benefit to policyholders. The distribution strength of life insurance companies is unparalleled at 2.3 million, especially with LIC alone having over 1.2 million agents. “Besides agent-driven distribution model, we have recorded vast customer base via bancassurance model, where 40-50% of premium comes from these bank partners.” Policybazaar.com spokesperson said through the drafted regulations, life insurers may be able to implement the actuarial models and review the price periodically say in every few years or so instead of doing it every year. IRDA banned life insurers from offering indemnity-based health products since 2014 .

Even after Friday’s decline, the rupee continues to be among the better-performing Asian currencies.On Friday, the rupee fell by 62 paise to settle at a nearly six-month low of 72.18 against the US dollar as global markets cracked due to panic over the coronavirus pandemic. The rupee opened weak at 71.9 in the interbank foreign exchange market and soon hit a low of 72.29 in intraday trade. Friday’s close of 72.18 is the lowest since September 2019.“Considering risk-off trades seen in recent weeks, further weakness in the currency cannot be ruled out,” said a report by ICICI Securities . However, dealers are confident that the RBI will not let the rupee slip as this could hurt sentiment in the bond markets and the RBI has $476 billion of reserves.The current level of reserves is enough to cover nearly a year of imports and 80% of the total debt. “Globally, funds are going back to US government bonds. As a result, the yield on the 10-year bond has hit a new low of 1.16%,” said a dealer.“I expect the rupee to remain range-bound with the caveat that the Chinese yuan does not slip which could lead to pressure on the rupee,” said Abhishek Goenka , CEO, IFA Global. India and China have been the best performing BRICS currency in 2020.While the Chinese currency is down only 0.4%, the Indian rupee has slipped 1.1%. The worst performers are the South African rand, which slipped 10.7%, and the Brazilian real which declined by 10.6%. The only Asian currency to gain against the US dollar in 2020 was the Japanese yen, which appreciated marginally to 0.26%.“The panic selling of foreign investors in Indian equities has led to the rupee depreciation.

Bihar CM Nitish Kumar

PATNA: Amid reports of growing bonhomie between leader of opposition in state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav and CM Nitish Kumar , the latter on Friday reiterated his demand for special category status to the state at the 24th Eastern Zonal Council (EZC) meeting chaired by Union home minister Amit Shah in Bhubaneswar.

Nitish said his government had been consistently demanding grant of special category status to Bihar. “Today, I once again strongly put up my demand before the Union home minister so that we can get our genuine share and Bihar too can progress and make its contribution to the development of the country,” Nitish said.

The meeting was also attended by Naveen Patnaik and Mamata Banerjee, CMs of Odisha and West Bengal, respectively. Jharkhand’s finance minister Rameshwar Oraon represented Hemant Soren at the meeting. Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha and West Bengal are members of the EZC.

“Despite achieving double-digit growth rate during the last so many years, we are still behind the national average in major development parameters like poverty line, per capita income, industrialization and social and physical infrastructure. Some other states also are like Bihar in terms of backwardness. The states, which are given special status, have progressed on development scale. Therefore, a new policy framework is needed to bring all the backward states to the national mainstream in terms of development,” Nitish said.

He also sought cooperation from Jharkhand and West Bengal governments to check smuggling of illegal liquor in Bihar. “Bihar had enforced total prohibition April 2016. Several vehicles laden with illegal liquor were seized in the recent past by Bihar police after they crossed borders of Jharkhand and West Bengal. We urge the governments of the two states to take effective action against the smugglers who are sending illicit liquor to dry Bihar,” Nitish said.

He urged Shah to prevail upon the Jharkhand government and ask it to clear the pending payment of Rs 310 crore to Bihar under the pension liability, as agreed before a meeting of Union home secretary on June 18, 2018.

The CM also drew the attention of Shah towards Bihar’s pending dues of Rs 911.82 crore with the erstwhile Planning Commission under the special plan (Backward Region Grant Fund) and urged him to ask the NITI Aayog (which was formed in place of Planning Commission) to send the amount to Bihar at the earliest.

Nitish pointed out that altogether 10 companies of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) stationed in Bihar were sent to other states in the recent past. “Of the 10, only two companies have so far returned to Bihar. I request the Union home minister to ensure early return of the rest eight companies to Bihar,” he said.

Nitish also demanded allotment of Rs 1,000 crore per year to Bihar under the Centre’s project ‘Bringing Green Revolution to Eastern India’ project to enhance agriculture output in the state. He called for formulation of National Silt Management Policy to maintain uninterrupted flow of the Ganga water and check floods in the region.

But some, like Shakila Khatun, stepped on to the state-of-the-art trains for the first time on Friday. But it was still “love at first ride”.“I have been watching everyone taking rides on the new Metro. Since I live right opposite, I decided to wait for the crowds to thin. And it was worth the wait,” said Khatun, a resident of DL 13/1.However, even though the ridership has dipped, East-West is still the best for people like Pal, who takes a train from Sector V to stadium and walks to Beliaghata ID Hospital. “Green transport and walking through Subhas Sarovar have made me feel younger and happier,” the 56-year-old said.Bookshop owner Anuradha Chowdhury, the daughter-in-law of former Left Front land and land reforms minister Benoy Chowdhury, has ditched her petrol-driven car to take the train to work at her bookshop at EC Market. “Why is the enthusiasm ebbing?

The police said the accused, Murtuja Rawda (24), Samirsha Pathan (23) and Anadu Vala (23), had first tonsured the head of Mayur Sakaria (27) and then dumped his body in front of Jumma mosque in Amreli after beating him up with bats, iron pipes and bottles.

Sakaria was first taken to Amreli Civil Hospital and from there he was shifted to Rajkot Civil Hospital where he succumbed to his injuries.

The accused trio was arrested on the basis of a tip-off while they were going towards Rajkot from Shelkhambhalia village on their two-wheeler.

“During their interrogation, the accused said that Sakaria’s murder was the result of the internal rivalry they had with him in the bootlegging business. The accused alleged that Sakaria used to give tip-offs about their liquor supply to the police. Nursing a grudge against him, they had decided to kill him,” said K D Jadeja, inspector with Amreli SOG .

The accused had taken Sakaria on the bank of Dharangani village river, telling him they had organized a liquor party. Then they attacked Sakaria as part of their conspiracy.

Facebook India’s Manish Chopra with actor Ritabhari Chakraborty and an instagrammer at the event on Friday.

KOLKATA: The city’s passion for food and travel is reflected on the photo-sharing app Instagram , said officials who were in Kolkata to meet local instagrammers on Friday. Kolkata’s old-world charm of Raj-era buildings and monuments, particularly in the central business district and by the Hooghly, along with its high-rises, flyovers, urban spaces and swanky cafes makes for attractive visual landscapes. The photo-sharing app has now launched ‘Born on Instagram’, through which several users from the city will be mentored and taught how to shoot and share visual landscapes where the traditional and the modern come together.

On Friday, over 200 instagrammers gathered for an interaction on rediscovering Kolkata through Instagram lens. “Kolkata has been known for its cultural vibrancy and this is exemplified in the city’s content creators,” said Manish Chopra of Facebook India .

Instagram influencers in the city have been using their ‘followers’ to boost the appeal of several eateries, cafes and tourist spots in Kolkata, promoting them under the term “instagrammable”. “Food, travel and lifestyle have been the main characteristics of the content instagrammers in the city have been posting so far. Kolkata is a very interesting mix of old-world charm and modernity, which is reflected in the pictures that the youth of the city post on the photo-sharing app,” Chopra said.

Several handles, like Calcutta Instagrammers and Streets of Kolkata, capture the daily life in the city — from its streets to local festivals to various modes of transport. Several images of Kumartuli, Howrah bridge, St Paul’s Cathedral and trams have become synonymous with Kolkata on social media. But the app is not just for the youngsters. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee, who joined Instagram a few months ago, already has 50,000 followers. She has shared 175 posts, which are normally behind-the-scenes pictures taken during her visits to the various districts. Kolkata Police , too, regularly interacts with the citizens via Instagram.

“I am 20 years old now but this is just my fifth birthday, as I am one of the few whose birthday falls on February 29 , Leap Day,” says Sanaya. “It not only makes the day very special but incidentally all my February 29s have been very special due to grand celebrations they come with.

71,['29/02/2020'],"Bihar’s per capita income rises to Rs 43,000: Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi","This story is from February 29, 2020

Sushil Kumar Modi

PATNA: Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi , who also holds the finance portfolio, said in the state assembly on Friday that the development process in the state was on the track under the leadership of CM Nitish Kumar.

“The state witnessed development activities only during the rule of Shri Krishna Singh. After his death, there started political instability, when the state saw 23 CMs between 1961 and 1990,” Modi said, adding the development exercise was a ‘total washout’ during the 15-year-rule of Lalu Prasad and Rabri Devi.

Modi was giving the government’s reply after the conclusion of the two-day discussion on the Rs 2.11 lakh crore state budget that he had presented in the House on Tuesday. He stressed that the state’s average growth rate at 2011-12 constant prices had remained steady at 10%, while the per capita income had also increased from Rs 30,000 at the 2011-12 constant prices to Rs 43,000 at current prices in 2019-20.

Modi also assured the people of Patna that all the pumping stations and drainage systems would be qualitatively improved before the onset of monsoon, so that there is no repeat of the unprecedented waterlogging that the city faced last year. “Tenders have been invited for the allotment of work to restore pumping stations and drainage system,” he said.

Modi added that of the Rs 1.25 lakh crore package for Bihar announced by PM Narendra Modi in 2015, Rs 53,000 crore was spent on constructing quality roads in the state.

The deputy CM presented a comparative picture of the state’s economy under the 15-year-rule of Lalu and Rabri versus that of the NDA government led by Nitish. Noting that the state’s budget had increased eight-fold since 2004-05, he said the growth rate of the state’s gross state domestic product then was meagre 9% at current prices, and the per capita income at Rs 3,037 in 1990-91 and Rs 8,000 in 2004-05.

“The state’s own tax revenue increased from Rs 3,340 crore in 2004-05 to Rs 30,000 crore in 2019-20 and capital expenditure from Rs 1,140 crore in 1990-91 to Rs 21,058 crore in 2018-19. Further, if the market borrowing of the government was as high as 64% of GSDP in 1990-91, it had come down to 32% in 2019-20, and the fiscal deficit from 6.2% in 2004-05 to 2.7% now,” he added.

Representative image

PATNA: Legislators, cutting across party lines, erupted in anger in the legislative council on Friday after education minister Krishna Nandan Prasad Verma blamed delay in framing of service rule for contractual teachers and librarians to failure of the committee formed in this regard to hold its meeting.

“Service rule is very important, but it is unfortunate that the committee formed to frame the service rule has not met yet. I will find out the reason behind it,” Verma told the House after a call attention in this regard was brought by CPI MLCs Kedar Nath Pandey, Sanjay Kumar Singh, JD(U) MLCs Sanjeev Shyam Singh, Sanjeev Kumar Singh and Congress MLC Madan Mohan Jha.

The MLCs had asked the government to explain delay in notification of service rule for contractual teachers and librarians with policy for continuation in their service, monetary increment, promotion to the post of principal and choice transfer.

After Verma’s reply that a committee had been formed to frame service rule for contractual teachers, CPI MLC Pandey said, “You are giving the same reply from past three sessions. Please notify the service rule so that teachers start concentrating on teaching, rather than wasting their energy on protests.”

BJP MLC Nawal Kishore Yadav sought to know whether the committee was superior or the House.

Verma had earlier said that the department had formed a committee on August 11, 2015 with principal secretary or secretary level representatives from finance department, education department, general administration department, urban development and housing department and panchayati raj department.

“The committee had recommended revised salary for contractual teachers and librarians on May 15, 2017. Subsequently, as per department’s resolution, their salary was increased 2.57 times of their basic pay. Accordingly, they were given revised financial benefit from April 1, 2017. As per the resolution taken on October 11, 2017, they were also given dearness allowance, medical allowance and house rent on the revised rates,” the minister said.

73,['29/02/2020'],No rule framed to curb practice of ‘jaywalking’,"This story is from February 29, 2020

Pedestrians crossing busy road in Patna (File photo)

PATNA: Most pedestrian accidents occur because of jaywalking or crossing a busy road unlawfully, claim experts.

The Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 2019 empowers states to regulate the activities of both motorists as well as pedestrians. However, no rules have been made for pedestrians in Bihar under this clause.

According to Sanjeev Sinha, traffic expert from NIT-Patna, behavioural issues and lack of awareness among people are the main reasons behind jaywalking, which is a common sight in the city.

“There are several facilities given to pedestrians that they hardly use. Traffic signals are not just for motorists, but pedestrians as well. However, more that 90% of the people walking on roads do not even know about them,” Sinha told this newspaper.

Talking about the lack of proper footpaths and zebra crossings, Sinha said, “Most footpaths in the city have been encroached upon. A number of them are so high that it becomes difficult for children, elderly people and women to climb them. Besides, some of the busiest areas like the Rajendra Nagar Terminal and Govind Mitra Road do not have zebra crossings.”

Sinha also laid emphasis on the proper construction and designing of roads. He pointed out, “Roads should be designed and built in such a manner that they accommodate the needs of all users.”

If the figures of the transport department are anything to go by, almost 20% of the accidents occur because of pedestrians, who cross roads while vehicles are on the move.

Asked why jaywalking had not been made a punishable offence, transport secretary Sanjay Kumar Agarwal said, “Since it is considered a minor offence, pedestrians are not penalized for it. There are also no rules regarding pedestrian penalties in the MV Act. Hence, we feel educating people and creating awareness among them is more important and effective at the moment.”

He claimed that several initiatives, including crosswalk buttons, were launched for pedestrians in the city few months back.

“These buttons were installed on Hartali Mor, Punaichak Mor and Bailey Road near the Patna zoo. Even then a large number of people can be seen flouting the rules openly,” Agarwal said, adding, “Unauthorized cuts on roads will soon be shut to ensure public safety and avoid mishaps. Also, dividers on airport road, Dak Bungalow road and Saguna Mor are being fenced.”

On his part, traffic superintendent D Amarkesh has deployed more traffic cops at several places in the city. He said, “Bailey Road witnesses heavy traffic throughout the day. Traffic cops in that area have told me that their pleas fall on deaf ears as most people do not use crosswalk buttons.”

Some pedestrians, on the other hand, are of the view that the city lacks proper infrastructure to ensure their safety. “Many areas do not have footpaths or zebra crossings, as a result of which many people violate the rules and regulations,” rued Rakesh Sharma, a pedestrian near Exhibition Road.

74,['29/02/2020'],Textile traders stare at Rs 200 crore loss due to violence in Delhi,"This story is from February 29, 2020

SURAT: Communal riots in New Delhi have cast a dark shadow over the business prospects of the country’s largest man-made fabric (MMF) wholesale market in the city. Supply of saris, dress material and other textile products has been affected because of the riots and local traders are staring at losses to the tune of over Rs 200 crore.

Textile traders stated that New Delhi is their largest market and that they daily supply textile products worth Rs50 crore. However, the trade now remains suspended ever since the violence broke out and transporters refuse to accept goods to New Delhi.

Industry sources said New Delhi is gateway for supply of textile products to Uttar Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Haryana and Punjab.

Federation of Surat Textile Traders Association (FOSTTA) president Manoj Agarwal said, “New Delhi is largest market for Surat fabrics. The communal violence in New Delhi has paralysed textile trade, affecting supply of fabrics to the tune of Rs200 crore in the last few days.”

Textile traders stated that apart from saris and dress material, New Delhi is the largest market for home-furnishing clothes, duppatas, lehngas, salwar suits, gowns and kurtis manufactured in Surat.

Krishna Banka, a textile trader at JJ A/C market, said, “All our buyers in New Delhi have stopped giving us orders. The trade between Surat and Delhi has got suspended. We pray that communal tension in New Delhi calms down. We supply about Rs10 lakh worth of saris and dress material to New Delhi in a month.”

Surat Textile Goods Transporters’ Association (STGTA) president Yuvraj Deshle said, “Daily 45 transport trucks leave from Surat to New Delhi. The transporters have halted supply fearing losses to trucks and fabrics. We will resume the services once New Delhi returns to normalcy.”

SURAT: Taking a cue from diamond city , notified area authority of Ankleshwar GIDC and Ankleshwar Bicycle Club (ABC) have jointly started a bicycle sharing project on a pilot basis at the GIDC Joggers’ Park. The idea behind the pilot project is to promote cycling for healthy living among residents in the industrial town.

The idea on the bicycle sharing project was mooted by ABC during the recently held cyclo-walkathon organized in the Ankleshwar town in this month in which more than 1,200 cyclists from across the district had participated to promote healthy living and green environment.

At present, the ABC has started the pilot project with 11 bicycles—five bicycles donated by Ankleshwar notified area authority, five by the ABC and one bicycle donated by the Surat bicycle club.

Naresh Pujara, convenor of ABC, told TOI, “Around 4,000 people use the huge joggers’ park in Ankleshwar GIDC during morning and evening hours daily. However, we thought of starting the bicycle sharing project on the lines of the one started by the Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC).”

Pujara added, “We are charging a token amount of Rs 10 for half an hour ride and Rs 20 for one hour ride from the people wanting to use the bicycle at the joggers’ park. The amount collected from the bicycle usage will be utilized for purchasing new bicycles.”

The ABC has plan to start bicycle sharing project in the entire Ankleshwar town in the coming months following the success of this pilot project.

Kiran Modi, owner of a pharma company in Ankleshwar and member of ABC said, “The response from the citizens is overwhelming and we are inspired to roll out the project in other areas of the town as well.”

Ashok Chovatiya, chairman of Ankleshwar GIDC notified area authority, said, “Ankleshwar is an industrial town and we have taken an initiative to promote bicycling among the residents. We have donated five bicycles for the pilot project and are ready to donate even more in the coming days.”

PRAYAGRAJ: Imagine driving down a deserted highway at night, when you spot a woman seeking a lift. What would you do? Most of us would stop and offer the damsel in distress a lift.

Well, your efforts as a Good Samaritan might not always be good for you. For this certainly was the case with the dozens of truck drivers who ended up being looted by thugs dressed up as village women, when they stopped to help the said damsel.

Touted as a revamped version of the infamous ‘ looteri dulhan ’ gang — where women married innocent youths only to flee after robbing the groom and is family a day after the wedding — the new brand of crooks refer to themselves as the ‘dulhan gang’ and have targeted more than 20 drivers in Prayagraj , Bhadohi and Varanasi in the past few months.

The gang’s activities came to light after the arrest of one its members Gyan Chandra on Wednesday. A resident of Upardaha village in trans-Ganga area of the city, the 25-year-old youth has been involved in robbing over a dozen truck drivers in the past. Police said that Chandra has been sent behind the bars more than thrice.

According to police, the gang’s members are aged between 18 and 25 years. Clad in ‘chunari’ and ‘ghaghara’, they stand on deserted roadsides of the Prayagraj–Varanasi highway, seeking lifts and then target innocent commuters.

SSP (Prayagraj) Satyarth Anirudh Pankaj said, “The members of the gang wear ghagharas and dupattas and usually stand on the roadside of the Prayagraj-Varanasi highway at night. When they see a truck coming their way, they flash a torch in the drivers’ direction to indicate that they need a lift.”

“Most truck drivers mistake them for prostitutes and often stop to allow them into their cabins. However, once the gang members enter the cabin, they are surprised to see a man instead of a woman. By then it’s too late to do anything and they end up being robbed at gunpoint or knife-point,” the SSP added.

“The gang members usually cover their faces under a chunari, so that the truck drivers are not able to see their faces. Once they enter the truck’s cabin, they rob truck drivers after tying their hands and legs.”

Pankaj said that most of the gang’s members are from Upardaha and nearby villages. The gang has been active since the past one-year-and-a half.

Police records show that Chandra got a bail about two months back in connection with a road hold-up case in Bhadohi.

Chandra also told the police that he had tried to rob a truck driver two days on Prayagraj – Mirzapur route two days back.

Police also seized four crude bombs from his possession.

Meanwhile, Handia police have identified five more members of the gang and are raiding possible hideouts to nab them.

Iron props set up in one of the buildings in Bowbazar to strengthen it.

KOLKATA: The Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation ( KMRC ) on Friday carried out strengthening of buildings in Bowbazar where occupants alleged that cracks have appeared during the second stint of Metro tunnelling.

TBM Urvi is currently at work below Chaitan Sen Lane . On Thursday, locals had alleged that ever since Urvi started digging on February 18, fresh cracks have appeared on the walls of buildings, which fall within 30m radius of the TBM’s route.

On Friday, the KMRC team started strengthening the structures with iron props and carried out other safety procedures. The team, led by chief engineer Biswanath Deewanjee, spent the entire morning assuring residents that all steps are being taken to ensure there is no repeat of the accident on August 31.

Sukalyan Dutta, a businessman living at 11, Chaitan Sen Lane, said, “The chief engineer said all kinds of measures are being taken during and after the tunnelling. Some repairs have been carried out, but we have told him that we don’t need superficial repairs. Concrete measures must be in place so that the building can withstand the upheaval 15m below the ground. We just hope KMRC keeps its promise.” Ward 51 councillor Sanchita Mondal was present at the spot when Deewanjee told the residents that the hairline cracks that had surfaced were superficial. They were mostly fissures and would not affect the structural foundation of the buildings.

Apart from strengthening the buildings with iron props, the team also carried out grouting and installed crack-and-tilt meters to identify ground settlement and assess if the cracks were widening. “Our strengthening activities involve improving structural performance to enable the buildings to fulfil new functional requirements, which includes curbing ground settlement that the movement of the TBM may or may not have caused,” an engineer said. He added that the agency would keep monitoring and submit a status report to experts who would, in turn, submit them to the Calcutta High Court .

GAYA: Myanmar President U Win Myint arrived in Bodh Gaya on a two day visit. Accompanied by a 28-member delegation comprising first lady Daw Cho Cho , information minister U Kyaw Tin, religious affairs minister Thura U Aung Ko, transport minister Thant Sin Maung and others, the Myanmar president landed at the Gaya International Airport by a special aircraft on Friday morning.

At the airport, the visiting dignitary was received by state building construction minister Ashok Chaudhary, Gaya MP Vijay Manjhi, Magadh divisional commissioner Asangba Chuba, zonal IG Rakesh Rathi, Gaya DM Abhishek Singh and SSP Rajiv Mishra.

Myint, soon after his arrival went to the Mahabodhi Mahavihara, the seat of Lord Buddha’s enlightenment and offered prayers at the shrine.

At the shrine, he gifted a 3-feet tall Buddha image and also went around the shrine premises including the Meditation Park and the Muclind Sarovar. It is believed that Buddha, then Prince Siddhartha, had spent the sixth week of his seven-week-long meditation in the Muclind Sarovar under a snake’s protection.

The visiting dignitary was offered a memento by BCD minister Ashok Chaudhary. Gaya DM Abhishek Singh presented a copy of the Bodh Gaya coffee table book.

Penning down his impressions, the Myanmar president wrote in the visitor’s book, “As a devout Theravada Buddhist I deem it a remarkable and invaluable experience for us to pay homage to the sacred Bodhi tree and to perform meritorious deeds at the temple in Bodh Gaya. On behalf of the Myanmar delegation and my own behalf, I would like to place on record our sincere appreciation to the Government of India for arranging this memorable visit.”

The visiting dignitary also went to the Myanmar monastery and nearby Shaivite Math located to the north east of the Buddha shrine. He also visited the 80 feet high Great Buddha statue built by the Japanese.

Kotak Mahindra Bank chairman and managing director Uday Kotak (File photo)

PUNE: Kotak Mahindra Bank chairman and managing director Uday Kotak on Friday proposed diluting government stake to below 50% in three of the 12 state-owned banks and running the other three through public-private pa-rtnership. Kotak said he did not advocate moving away from state-owned banks, but state ownership, in some of them, could be reduced.

“After the merger of various state-owned banks, we are now down to 12 public sector lenders. I still believe we need to have a six-three-three formula. Six banks should remain in the public sector. In three others, state ownership should go below 50%. And for the rest, we should think out-of-the-box and find a transparent way for public-private partnership, with domestic and non-domestic players,” Kotak said, while speaking at the Asia Economic Dialogue here.

Kotak said India was at the cusp of making some serious choices in the financial sector and people needed to ask some tough questions. “India nationalised its banking system in 1969. I want some analysis on the amount of taxpayers’ money that has been put into these banks from 1969 to 2020…Then we need to ask that over a period of 70 years, what is the return to the taxpayers on the crores of rupees that have been put into the state-owned banks?” Kotak asked.

He added he saw a potential battle for the global financial technology order in the future, between Western and Chinese systems, currently exemplified by the debate over 5G wireless technologies that were being aggressively marketed by Chinese companies.

PATNA: Opposition MLCs from RJD and Congress protested outside the Bihar legislative council on Friday against alleged use of inferior quality of steel in Mahatma Gandhi Setu reconstruction work.

Talking to reporters at the entrance of the legislative council, Congress MLC Prem Chandra Mishra said low quality of steel worth over Rs 1,000 crore was purchased for reconstruction of the bridge. The MLC also expressed concern over delay in completion of the project.

The 38-year-old Setu is being rehabilitated with the use of triangular steel truss and the work for the same had started in February 2017. “As per the contract, rust-free steel structure of high quality was to be used in the bridge rehabilitation work. However, the same is not being used. The consultant hired for the project was blacklisted by Gujarat and Bihar governments earlier,” Mishra said.

He added that Gandhi Setu division executive engineer Sunil Kumar Singh and resident project engineer I N Mishra were removed from the project after they gave a written complaint about use of sub-standard material for the construction work. “The then team leader for this project, Prashant Bhattacharya, was also removed from the project after he submitted a written complaint,” Mishra said.

State road construction minister Nand Kishore Yadav, however, said the rehabilitation work was being done by central government and the state had no role to play in it.

“He (Mishra) had raised same question in the House earlier as well and I had answered his query. Those who are surrounded by corruption only see corruption everywhere,” Yadav said.

Chennai : Engineering exporters will meet in Coimbatore to draw up a blueprint to bring in more small scale businesses under the export umbrella, in its pursuit to push up Indian exports beyond $81 bn recorded last year. Engineering Exports Promotional Council (EEPC) India will organise its ninth edition of its flagship event International Engineering Sourcing Show (IESS) in Coimbatore from March 4-6, 2020. While EEPC has already held IESS editions - five in Mumbai and three in Chennai, the Coimbatore event has turned out to be the largest such event.

While Malaysia is the partner country, Tamil Nadu will be the partner state for the event, which will have 400 exhibitors displaying their wares. Over 400 foreign delegates are participating in the event, which will also have 10 thematic sessions including Vendor Development Meets with MNCs from several countries.

“India’s engineering exports, which was $81 billion last financial year, stood at $64 billion till January, 2020. While the last quarter of the fiscal is the best phase for registering higher growth, we hope to push exports this year,” Ravi Sehgal, chairman, EEPC India said.

But, Sehgal outlined global challenges that need to be overcome by the Indian industry. The protectionist approach of the US and Europe has been an issue. From being a net exporter of copper, India has now become a net importer of copper. There are a few challenges to overcome, he said.

“The corona virus epidemic has already affected the global logistics industry. It may take about three months for us to assess the impact on India,” he said.The US – China trade war had made several businesses to look at India. “But our lack of capacity was a problem. We have to increase the capacities of our MSMEs. We are discussing this with Union minister Nitin Gadkari to look at way to improve the capacities, since we need to urgently scale it up to meet any eventual increase in demand,” Sehgal said.

Aurangabad/Pune: The residents of two villages in Kalamnuri taluka of Hingoli district ran out of their homes around 2am on Thursday after hearing a rumbling sound in the ground. The sound lasted for around 10 minutes, sparking fears of an earthquake, villagers said.

However, the Hingoli district administration on Friday said the sound was not linked to either an earthquake or a tremor. “The residents of Bothi and Maldhaunda villages heard the mysterious sound, discussed the development and went back to sleep after some time. Some of them alerted the administration,” Kalamnuri tehsildar Kalashchandra Waghmare told TOI.

Waghmare visited the villages with police officials on Friday. “Everything is normal. None of the houses have developed any crack or losses,” he said.

Sources in the India Meteorological Department’s seismic department told TOI that while there was no earthquake recorded in and around Hingoli on February 27 early morning, tremors of 2.5 on the Richter scale were recorded 133km south of Akola around 3:47 am on February 27. They said more analysis will have to be done to find out these tremors had any connection with the rumbling sound in the Hingoli villages.

Delhi high court

NEW DELHI: Delhi high court on Friday sought response from the Centre and AAP government on a PIL seeking a probe by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) into the violence and its funding in northeast Delhi over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. The plea also wanted cases to be lodged against Congress member Salman Khurshid and AIMIM members Waris Pathan and Asaduddin Owaisi for allegedly provoking citizens against CAA.

A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice C Hari Shankar issued notices to the ministry of home affairs, Delhi government and police seeking their stand on the plea by Ajay Gautam, urging the court to direct the Centre to order NIA to find out the “anti-national forces” behind the agitations and to probe the role of People’s Front of India (PFI), which is allegedly “funding, motivating and supporting the protests”.

It said protests have been on the lines of Palestine, where children and women were used as a shield for carrying out anti-national activities. It also sought an investigation into the role of PFI and who was funding, motivating and supporting these alleged anti-national protests.

It also sought an investigation against “anti-India forces, who are allegedly openly threatening to kill the Prime Minister and home minister, which is evident from the videos gone viral in social media and direct the state authorities to normalise the situation for the sake of convenience of the general public.”

It wanted directions to identify the roads blocked by protesters over CAA and immediate clearance of these roads. The plea also sought action against several Opposition members and social activists for allegedly provoking protesters at Shaheen Bagh.

Aurangabad: The Aurangabad bench of Bombay high court on Thursday issued notices to the state election commission (SEC), Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC), state government and other authorities following a petition challenging the legality, propriety and correctness of illegal delimitation and ward formation for the upcoming civic elections.

The petitioner, Sameer Rajurkar, a former corporator, has moved court challenging the ward formation process and accusing the authorities concerned of manipulating population ratio in at least 28 wards and reserving wards for SC/STs to help some political leaders.

He also pointed out that false records were prepared and the wards were abruptly changed.

The petition said: “Population of municipal area is required to be divided into 115 wards and thus the ratio of population per ward comes to 10,769. A difference of 10% is permissible in this ratio. Thus, maximum population limit per ward is 11,747 whereas the minimum is 9,611. As population per ward has nexus with reservation of seats of SC/ST, the EC has directed that only in exceptional case, the ratio of population can cross the minimum or maximum limit. However, during the current ward formation, due to interference of political persons, this ratio of population per ward has been violated in 21 places. The entire ward formation and consequent reservation is thus tampered with in 80 wards.’’

It added: “The reservation of scheduled caste and scheduled tribe is required to be carried out in a descending order. For that purpose, the ratio of total population of ward with the ST and SC population is taken into consideration. The data is then submitted to the SEC in schedule 6 and 7 by the AMC. All the wards are arranged in a descending order on the basis of the percentage of SC and ST population. The wards which were reserved earlier are excluded and then other wards are reserved in the descending order. However, while tampering with the SC/ST reservation a mischief is played.”

Following the petition, the high court bench — comprising justices SV Gangapurwala and Shrikant Kulkarni — ordered issuance of notices to the respondents while posting the next hearing on March 5.

The Street Vendors Act, 2014 regulates street vendors in public areas and protects their rights. This comes after the AMC removed the hawkers from the market areas of Gulmandi and Paithan Gate.

Under the Shaheed Bhagat Singh Hawkers’ Union, around 100 hawkers raised slogans against the civic body. Abhay Taksal, the union organiser, said, “AMC has failed to implement the act and instead is trying to develop a conflict between the shopkeepers and the vendors.”

In a meeting with mayor Nandkumar Ghodele on Friday, a delegation of the hawkers’ union placed a set of demands. The Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana-National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NULM) department of the AMC had initiated a survey of hawkers through a private agency across the city in December. The hawkers union demanded the schedule of the survey to be published in the newspapers and the hawkers in the city should be part of the survey.

“The mayor has agreed to all our demands. If the action is not taken within eight days, we will initiate another agitation,” Taksal said. Three days before the protest, the shopkeepers in the market area met with the municipal commissioner and sought implementation of no hawkers’ zone.

AGRA: A probe into disbursement of funds for the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna (Urban) in Agra district has found that some beneficiaries were provided extra funds totaling Rs 2.57 crore than they were entitled to. As a result, while needy applicants are doing the rounds of offices for funds for building their houses, some applicants allegedly having link with officials have been provided the installments twice.

Under the PM housing scheme, central and state governments together provide a monetary assistance of Rs 2.5 lakh to the people of low income group living in urban areas. The sum is provided in three installments for construction of a house on a piece of land owned by the applicant.

The first installment provided to the applicant is Rs 50,000, the second is Rs 1.50 lakh and third Rs 50,000.

In Agra, 226 applicants were provided the first installment and 96 applicants, the second installment twice.

Last year, a probe was ordered into the matter by the state government following numerous complaints. Investigations revealed that a total of 322 applicants were provided the first and second installments two times. It was found that the then project director of District Urban Development Authority (DUDA) and two managers were responsible for the malpractice. They are likely to face action.

SVS Rajput, DUDA, Agra project officer, said, “For now, the state government has ordered that former project officer Anupam Rai and two managers should be given 15 days’ time to recover the funds wrongly transferred to over 300 applicants.

Chennai: The draft rules for the state government’s land pooling scheme released on Friday enhance landlords’ rights over their property acquired for infrastructure projects. The government launched the scheme two years ago to acquire land for housing and infrastructure projects.

The rules state that the planning authority shall, where possible, promote the formation of committees to explain the scheme to owners of lands and buildings, and discuss and consult with them when the number of people likely to be affected by the scheme is more than 100. The planning authority should take into consideration all suggestions made and objections raised and hold land surveys and ownership verification meetings, as may be required.

The rules deal with multiple issues relating to land pooling, including for industries.

Jaipur: The forest administration at Ranthambore has once again rung an alarm bell after tigers are venturing out from inhabiting area of the reserve and becoming a threat not just for humans but for themselves as well.

Ranthambore forest officials on Thursday wrote to the state chief wildlife warden (CWLW) Arindam Tomar to take action regarding tiger T-108 which has made its base in the fields close to the reserve. The tiger, which had previously killed a boy, has been out of the reserve for around four months and is creating major problem for the farmers in Sawai Madhopur, who are unable to go to their fields. T-108 has found a conducive environment as it has also found a mate in T-114 because of which it is not returning to the reserve, claimed officials.

Manoj Parashar, field director, Ranthambore Tiger Project told TOI, “T-108, sub-adult tiger named Jai (T-108), which killed the 10-year-old boy has ventured out of the reserve few months back and has made its base on the on the boundary in some fields. This has become a very serious issue for the villagers who are unable to go to the fields due to fear of the tiger. The worst part is that there is a tigress also along with T-108. So essentially, it is getting food, a mate and its own territory because of which the tiger does not want to come back to the reserve. Some action has to be taken to resolve this issue because of which I have written to the chief wildlife warden to look into the matter.”

According to sources, the tiger is also at the risk of being killed by the villagers. The officials further stressed on the fact that the department should consider relocation of few of the tigers from Ranthambore to other reserves. The Ranthambore reserve has a core area of 392 square kilometre, with a buffer zone of 1,342 square kilometre. Of the total area of little over 1,700 square kilometre in RTR, only 600 square kilometre can be used by tigers. According to the data available there are 51 adult tigers in the reserve out of which 25 are female and 26 males. Apart from this there are 13-14 young ones though the exact number is not available.

The number of tigers in Ranthambore is the highest in the state which also means that the tigers keep venturing out of the reserve to look for territory. “The letter to the Warden is essentially centered on the issue of T-108, there is also a suggestion that in it regarding possible relocation of the tigers as they are venturing out of the reserve too often,” added Parashar. The number of tigers in Ranthambore Tiger Reserve (RTR) has increased to the point that the reserve can no longer sustain the big cats that are currently inhabiting the area.

Aurangabad: Beed district collector Rahul Rekhawar, in order to curb cases of cheating during the ongoing HSC examinations, has sought the help of journalists.

On Thursday, Rekhawar requested the journalists across the district to keep a close watch on all examination centres and photocopy shops, and send him photographs along with the name of the centre where cheating is being carried out.

The district administration had earlier issued a directive to photocopy centres — within 100m radius of the examination halls — to keep their shops closed from 10am to 6pm on examination days.

Rekhawar has also asked the journalists to send him name and address of the shops around exam halls with the photographs that remain open while examination is going on.

Beed ZP CEO Ajit Kumbhar, while speaking to TOI, said they are getting information about malpractices from different sources. “The appeal made to the journalists is on this backdrop. With the help of a tip-off from a journalist we were able to catch a dummy candidate from Nirgudi centre of Patoda Taluka on Friday,” he said.

Both, Rekhawar and Kumbhar, have issued a number of directives to prevent cases of copying or malpractices during the examination.

A team of Class I and Class II officials have also been appointed at each examination centre for keeping strict vigil. Teachers appointed as invigilators are sent on duty to other schools and to the school that they are teaching.

Nets have been installed on windows of the examination halls to prevent passing of chits or other material inside the hall from outside. “Candidates are also required to undergo frisking before entering the examination hall,” Kumbhar said, adding that police force has been scaled up in 24 sensitive examination centres in the district.

AGRA: Major malpractices have surfaced with regard to determination of exam centres by Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar University . Colleges where mass cheating was reported in the previous years have been made exam centres. In violation of the state government orders, some exam centres are 70 km away from parent college. Besides, no physical inspection of colleges has been conducted by the university administration to check availability of CCTV cameras and voice recorders in classrooms as mandated by the state government.

Agra University’s main examinations for 2019-20 are scheduled to start on March 2. To conduct the exam, university administration has selected 45 nodal centres and 365 exam centres. A list of all these centres has been uploaded on the university website.

General secretary of the University Teachers Association Nishant Chauhan said, “The determination of the exam centres has been done in complete violation of the standard norms and state government orders. Debarred colleges , where mass cheating took place in 2018 and 2019, have been made exam centres. As per norms, these colleges should not have been exam centres for at least two years.”

He added “According to the government orders, varsity authorities, should look for an exam centre within 5 km radius of a college. In any case, the exam centre should not be more than 10 km away from the college. But university administration has selected exam centres for several colleges which are over 50 km away.”

University registrar Rajeev Kumar said, “The colleges which have been made exam centres in previous years have been included in the list this year. So far, complaints regarding three debarred colleges being made exam centres have been received. All such exam centres will be changed. Besides, changes will be made in the exam centres located over 10 km from colleges. The updated exam centre list will be uploaded on the varsity website soon. We are committed to conducting fair examinations.”

103,['29/02/2020'],Mumbai: Govt lays foundation for vertical universities in highrises,"This story is from February 29, 2020

Representative image.

MUMBAI: The classroom is on the 80th floor. Universities are going northward. With absolute no requirement for land, a university in Mumbai’s island city can now be housed on the 50th floor of a shiny corporate tower or find a home in a hotel wing.

The old charm of large stone public varsity headquarters, snaking academic corridors, stained glass convocation halls, all seem to be the reserve of the far-flung urbs and the countryside. With the city falling short of large land pockets, the state government has decided to allow edupreneurs to set up vertical university campuses. Mumbai will be the first city in the country to permit such an arrangement.

“Essentially, a private university is required to have 10 acres of land and 1.5 lakh of constructed area. But with just no such land parcel now available in Mumbai south and central, one needs to look at allowing universities to grow vertically. The 10-acres requirement will be hence done away with. One will only look at the constructed square foot space,” said a source.

The government has set up a committee to understand and debate what ought to be the rules governing such educational enterprises. The panel is headed by former chief secretary Jayant Banthia and has Vijay Khole and Rajan Welukar, both former Mumbai University V-Cs, as members. The panel will understand the experiences of vertical universities in other countries and study whether the UGC guidelines would permit such development and what ought to be the student strength. “Can an existing educational enterprise in Mumbai be awarded a vertical university status?” is another point that needs to be answered.

Then, there’s the fundamental question on student facilities, hostels, sporting areas. “Will these universities merely be teaching-learning laboratory spaces or will they offer what other varsities have like a sporting complex, canteens, hostels?”

A government notification said the number of students seeking higher education opportunities was growing and just because space in the city is constrained, one cannot live with a low gross enrolment ratio . “A tie-up with a nearby sports club could give students the facilities of recreation, a few floors in a residential building can be converted into a hostel,” said a source.

Former AICTE chairman S S Mantha said, “In the US, there are vertical universities in space starved cities. In India too, they can be started for certain disciplines that do not require large infrastructural requirements and machinery. Most important, there must be quality assurance and not just accreditation, that must be given, the trust must own the facility so that student interest is protected.”

Victim has been identified as Rohit Kumar

AGRA: A member of a videography crew hired for a wedding shoot was shot dead by a man in heavily inebriated state following a heated argument over the camera’s angle in UP’s Firozabad district late on Thursday.

The wedding procession at Darigapur village of Khairgadh police limits took an ugly turn when Satyendra Yadav allegedly fired two shots from his double barrel shotgun. “The pellets struck two members of the crew. One succumbed due to excessive bleeding while the other recovered after first aid,” said Rajesh Kumar, superintendent of police (rural).

The 20-year-old dead videographer has been identified as Rohit Kumar while Satyendra Kumar sustained pellet injuries. Yadav and his aide Kuldeep fled after the incident. Based on a written complaint of Rohit’s relative Suresh Chandra, an FIR was lodged against the two under IPC section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder).

According to the FIR, camera crew of Dinesh Kumar, Rohit Kumar and Satyendra Kumar were shooting the wedding procession from a chair. “All of a sudden, Yadav and Kuldeep started misbehaving with the videographer’s crew. They were unhappy with the angle the team was using to shoot the video. Soon, Yadav shot Rohit on his left knee and his colleague on the right leg,” the FIR read.

Yadav runs a private school, according to sources, and the wedding procession was passing through his property. “Our team is now searching for the two suspects. We have recovered the weapon used. The firearms license of the accused will be revoked,” SP Kumar added.

Meanwhile, Rohit’s relatives staged a protest against the local police on Friday. They alleged that the police “changed” their written complaint of FIR under IPC sections 302 (murder) and 307 (attempt to murder) to “culpable homicide not amounting to murder”.

CHENNAI: Pulling up a developer for misrepresenting facts, the Tamil Nadu Real Estate Regulatory Authority ( TNRERA ) on Thursday slapped a fine of Rs 30 lakh and cancelled the registration of the project.

The case pertains to a project named ‘Bloom’ at Thirumudivakkam in the western suburbs developed by Casagrand Builder Private Limited. V Sangeetha, who booked a unit in the housing project, alleged that the developer had provided false information to obtain registration from TNRERA for a villa township project by projecting it as a layout. The complainant also said handing over of her villa was delayed.

The developer denied the charges saying there had been no false reporting with regard to project registration.

Hearing both sides, TNRERA observed that it was clear from the brochure and various documents that it was a residential housing project and not merely a layout of residential plots as contended by the developer and levied a fine of Rs 30 lakh for misrepresentation. It also cancelled the project approval.

CHENNAI: Despite modern air traffic control procedures, pilots are forced to hover over the city waiting for clearance to land at the airport . Forced to circle one above the other for up to 15 minutes during peak hours, each plane burns up to 600kg of fuel in the process.Earlier, air traffic controllers asked pilots to hover or be on hold when there was smog. But it’s done on most days during peak hours now. Ground delays due to inadequate number of taxiways, parking bays and back-to-back schedules given out to flights are blamed for such delays. More than 30 planes approach the airport for landing during peak hours.Planes put on hold are told to fly over four points near Chennai — over Tirupati, over the Bay of Bengal parallel to Tirupati, over Sriperumbudur and over Puducherry — so they can come in to land when runways and taxiways are clear.“We burn around 600kg of jetfuel hovering over the city during peak hours because of air traffic congestion. Airlines tell us to carry extra fuel needed for hovering while flying to Chennai. This is in addition to the mandatory fuel that is needed for diversion to the nearest airport, Bengaluru,” a senior pilot said. The pilot said flying to Chennai is considered a risk and is expensive during peak hours because of this. He added that Bengaluru airport too faces the same issue, especially at night.“Sometimes more than five flights queue up for landing. If there are departures at that time, the wait increases and so does the need for fuel. Airports Authority of India (AAI) has told airlines that they have been revamping air traffic control procedures to prevent planes from hovering around waiting for landing permission. But that has not helped.”AAI introduced PBN (performance-based navigation system) to ensure that planes can come in a queue and land without hovering around. But this is not happening during peak hours due to limitations on the ground.The congestion has had an impact on the turnaround time of international flights operated by foreign airlines. On most days, flights to London, Frankfurt, Dubai and Hong Kong gets delayed because the airports authorities are not able to handle the planes coming in and make ground operations quicker, said an airport official.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74411547,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1362396,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/its-a-long-wait-to-land-at-city-airport/articleshow/74409281.cms
107,['29/02/2020'],65% Sanskrit colleges run without principals in Raj,"This story is from February 29, 2020

Jaipur: In a major boost for Sanskrit education, chief minister Ashok Gehlot had announced Rs 106 crore in the budget. However, out of 30 Sanskrit government colleges in the state, post of principal is vacant in 20 which translate into 65%.

The lack of principals in 20 colleges was informed by the government to the assembly.

For the post of lecturer, the condition is more pathetic as there are 188 sanctioned posts out of which 93 are vacant. So, 50% lecturers’ posts are vacant in the state where government claims to be working for the development of the standard of Sanskrit education. There are 12 Sanskrit PG colleges and 18 UG colleges in 17 districts in Rajasthan . As per the reply given, lecturers were last recruited in 2005 after which no vacancy has been filled.

This question was asked by state BJP president Satish Poonia in the House on February 26.

Poonia says, “Since the Congress government has come to power, it can be seen that they are not inclined towards preserving the ancient Indian educational system. Ashok Gehlot is ignoring Ayurveda, Yoga and Sanskrit education. I think they considered it to be saffronisation of education system although it is related to our heritage. They haven’t allotted a single penny to yoga in this budget. They are not serious about taking Sanskrit forward.”

The situation is even more complex in Jagadguru Ramanandacharya Rajasthan Sanskrit University (JRRSU) where the university is functioning without professor. The last professor of state’s only Sanskrit university retired in June 2019. At present, there are 52 sanctioned posts for professors, associate professors and assistant professors out of which 28 are vacant.

A university faculty said that government is claiming to improve the research facility in Sanskrit university whereas there are no faculty. “How is the condition of research will improve when there are so many posts vacant in the university? Last year, university received only 90 forms for 690 seats. This shows the degraded situation of Sanskrit education and the efforts made by the government,” said a faculty member.

Counsel for TNPSC made the submission before a division bench of Justice R Subbiah and Justice R Pongiappan on a plea moved by Swapna, a transsexual candidate, alleging irregularities in the recruitment in 2015. The DMK has moved another plea seeking CBI probe into the allegations.

Recording the same, the bench directed the authorities to file their response to the plea moved by the DMK and adjourned the hearing.

Representing the DMK, senior counsel P Wilson said the scam was orchestrated by those in the highest level of the TNPSC in recruitment to 2016-17 Group-I services. The investigation officer was changed three times due to the pressure exerted by high level ministers, he added. Further, jurisdiction of state police over the TNPSC is questionable, he said, pressing for a CBI probe.

Leeds United goalkeeper Kiko Casilla was banned for eight matches and fined 60,000 pounds ($77,964.00) on Friday after being found guilty of racist abuse in a Championship match against Charlton Athletic last September.

The FA said the 33-year-old Spaniard, who joined Leeds from Real Madrid last year, must also attend face-to-face education after the breach of rule E3 (2) which covers discriminatory abuse.

Casilla had denied using racially abusive or insulting words. Media reports said the incident involved Charlton forward Jonathan Leko, who was born in the Democratic Republic of the Congo but has represented England at various age group levels.

The Spaniard said in a statement on social media that he was ""sad and devastated"" at being accused and believed firmly that racism should not be tolerated in any walk of life.

""I do not feel at all that the guilty verdict is a clear reflection of the incident,"" he said.

""I am sure that my family, friends, colleagues and the different technical teams who I have been working with for all these years in my professional career know I would never use my words with a racist meaning,"" he added.

""My respectful behaviour towards my opponents since I started my career has been honest and with the maximum sense of fairplay.""

Leeds acknowledged the decision in a statement but observed that the FA panel ""have based their decision on the balance of probability rather than proving Kiko to be guilty beyond reasonable doubt.""

The women were pursuing make-up artists’ course and were returning after an event.

Truck driver Raju was arrested, and his vehicle seized. Police have also recovered the CCTV footage of the entire episode. According to sources, police are also looking at the possibility that the truck driver was drunk at the time of accident.

“At this point, we cannot rule out any possibility and must check all facts. We have the driver in our custody and will question him further to find out the cause of the accident. The bodies of the deceased were handed over to their families after autopsy,” added the official.

112,['29/02/2020'],"Doctors can’t strike work, says HC, but junks transfer order","This story is from February 29, 2020

Representative image

CHENNAI: Doctors don’t have the right to go on strike or boycott work under any circumstance, declared the Madras high court on Friday. “Between the demands of doctors and the lives of the patients, it is life that is more important than anything else,” the court said.

By using strike to resolve issues, doctors, like lawyers, forget the moral worth and dignity of patients and leave them in the lurch, unmindful of the humanitarian consequences of their actions, Justice N Anand Venkatesh said. Patients cannot be a means to an end. They cannot be mere playthings whose lives can be put on the line to achieve other ends through the medium of strikes, he said. “The nature of duty of a doctor is such that the non-availability of the doctor even for a single minute may cost a life,” he said.

The judge, however, quashed the government charge memo to 135 doctors who spearheaded the protest for about a week in October 2019 and cancelled their transfers from Chennai to other locations, and directed the state to restore them to their original positions in the next transfer counselling.

“The action taken by the government by picking and choosing certain doctors and issuing them with the charge memos and transfer orders was not done to bring the situation under control, but it was done to warn the doctors that anyone who spearheads such agitations will be dealt with iron hands,” the judge said.

The doctors had filed the present pleas challenging the transfer and charge memo. At least 18,000 government doctors were on strike from October 25, 2019, across the state pressing various demands, including wage hike. Subsequently, in view of an announcement that no punitive actions would be initiated against them made by the state on October 30, 2019, the doctors withdrew the strike on November 1, 2019.

It is clear from the facts that the chief minister and health minister had requested the doctors to resume work with a promise that their demands will be looked into. Immediately, the agitation was called off. As a model employer, the government ought to have followed up and come out with solutions for the demands made by the doctors. Instead of resorting to such a positive step, the government decided to show its might against the office bearers, the court added.

“The charge memos and the transfer orders issued are clearly tainted with mala fides. If action had to be necessarily taken for the agitation/strike, then it should have been taken against all the doctors who participated in the same. However, the state has chosen to go only against the office bearers and hasty transfer orders have been passed and charge memos have been issued,” Justice Anand Venkatesh said.

Before parting, the judge reminded doctors that the chances of again going on a strike is virtually ruled out and said the court makes a fervent request to the government to immediately address the issues/demands made by the doctors and find a solution.

Gulab Chand Kataria

JAIPUR: Leader of Opposition Gulab Chand Kataria slammed government for the poor law and order situation in the state leading to the custodial death of Jeetu Khatik in Barmer.

During Question Hour in the assembly on Friday, Kataria asked for compensation for the deceased family, action against the errant police officers and legal provisions for rehabilitation of the dependents of the custodial death victims.

During the day, the Opposition went to the well, raising slogans against the government for increasing crimes in the state.

Responding to the Opposition, parliamentary affairs minister Shanti Dhariwal informed to put Barmer SP under APO and removed the Barmer circle officer.

“The inquiry into the case has been ordered and will be done by additional SP, CID-CB. A case under Section 302 of the IPC has been filed against the police,” explained Dhariwal.

He informed that the government is taking the issue seriously and has sent the ADG, Civil Rights, and the IG of Jodhpur have reached Barmer has failed to convince the opposition Kataria demanded compensation of Rs 1 crore or a package, including a job should be given to the victim’s family and asked the government if they are planning anything to prevent such incidents.

In response, Dhariwal said that victim’s post-mortem is yet to be done which will clear the cause of death is either custodial death or health reasons. “The government has always helped the victims by giving them job or compensation. In this case also the government will help, it will act according to the report,” said Dhaliwal. Till the last report came, the post-mortem of the victim has yet to be done as the family is demanding action against the police officers.

Kataria told the house that Khateek was tortured by the police for the whole night and was arrested without any FIR against him. Dhariwal admitted that police had no complaint against him and he was called in connection with the theft. “The victim was not beaten by the police,"" Dhariwal's statement invited ire of the speaker C P Joshi who questioned that what police did with the victim during the whole night in custody?

During the pandemonium in the assembly over the issue, Joshi advised the government to speak on the ways to handle such situations. He also asked the government if they are coming up with any legislation to protect and provide any relief to victims and their families. Both the lawmakers engaged in a heated argument over the issue on several occasions. Seeing no meaningful discussion on the subject, Joshi asked the house to defer the discussion till next week and directed the government to come up with some proposal on the subject Rights Resource Centre, an organisation working for Dalits has written to the National Human Rights Commission to ensure that action is taken against the police personnel who allegedly beat up a youth in Barmer which led to his death.

The centre set up at TNEB headquarters in the city will work to forecast clean energy generation real-time

CHENNAI: In the coming summer, power consumers in Tamil Nadu will get more green power compared to the previous years as TNEB has set up a facility, Renewable Energy Management Centre (REMC), to do real-time renewable energy forecasting, scheduling and generation. The centre was opened by state power minister P Thangamani on Friday.

“REMC enables optimum utilisation of renewable power as it is connected to 154 pooling stations, which evacuate wind and solar power round-the-clock,” said a senior official in the state load despatch centre (SLDC).

Similar centres have been set up in seven states that are rich in wind and solar power generation. Such centres are also functioning at the state load despatch centres in four regions of the country.

“We have four ways of forecasting renewable power. We use software of two renewable energy forecasting companies from Spain and Germany. Apart from that, we use forecasting tools of an Indian company.

Above all these, Tangedco officials forecast wind and solar power based on their experience. Our job is to check all the forecasts and go with the one that is closer to real time,” said the official.

The officials in the REMC will have real-time renewable energy generation data for a 15-minute time block.

The REMC was approved by the Centre. Each centre is being set up at a cost of Rs 49 crore. The REMCs are being managed by Power System Operation Corporation of India Ltd. (POSOCO) at regional and national level and by SLDC at the state level, the official said.

120,['29/02/2020'],Inform about completed &amp; pending irri projects: HC to govt,"This story is from February 29, 2020

Nagpur: The Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Wednesday directed the state government to inform on the number of irrigation projects completed and pending within two weeks.

The directives came while hearing a PIL by Loknayak Bapuji Aney Smarak Samiti’s (LBASS) convener Avinash Kale through counsel Bharti Dabhadkar regarding incomplete irrigation projects that led to a spate of farmer suicides in Vidarbha over the years.

In the last hearing, the petitioner moved an amendment application demanding directives to the state government and Vidarbha Irrigation Development Corporation (VIDC) to submit a report in this regard within a specific time.

On Wednesday, the petitioner again pointed out submissions made in his amendment application after which a division bench comprising justices Ravi Deshpande and Amit Borkar directed the respondents, including secretaries of state’s Urban Development, General Administration (GAD), forest and irrigation departments, besides VIDC to file a reply.

Kale had blamed incomplete projects for a spate of farmer suicides in the region over the years, which continued till date. Citing its old PIL (No 83/2012) in the multicrore irrigation scam that was disposed on December 12, 2014, after the VIDC assured to complete all projects within new deadline, he pointed out that hardly any progress has been made since then.

The petitioner further accused VIDC of failure to complete about 45 irrigation projects within deadline in the region, thus depriving over 30 lakh farmers of facilities. He pointed out that he was a part of ‘Sinchan Shodh Yatra’ along with social workers where they visited about 16 out of 45 projects and found them incomplete, even after the new deadline.

The VIDC, in its reply earlier, listed out a slew of reasons for delay in projects’ completion. It included PAPs’ opposition, lack of environmental clearance, introduction of lift irrigation scheme (LIS), unavailability of sand, metal, rubble and other material, and staff vacancy.

The cause of delays was introspected by conducting various discussions, forming committees and all feasible results/reports are being implemented. The VIDC and government are very serious in completion of remaining 64 ongoing forest-affected projects.

Security arrangements were made to avoid any untoward incident during Friday namaz in the city

KANPUR: Additional district and sessions judge, Vinay Kumar Singh, on Friday rejected the bail application of Mohd Aqeel in the Babupurwa riot case. The police had booked him for violence, arson, damage of public property and under Arms Act and Criminal Law (Amendment) Act.

Aqeel stated in his bail application that at present he is under judicial custody and in jail. He claimed in his affidavit that he was fabricated in the case as he had not committed any crime and is innocent. Babupurwa violence had taken place on December 20 last. He said by profession he is a fabricator of doors and on that day he was returning from Begumpurwa after purchasing some material.

He said when he noticed the Babupurwa area gripped by violence, he decided to go home through lanes and bylanes. In the meantime, he suffered a gun shot fired by cops and fell on the ground due to leg injury. Later, he was admitted to a hospital, and after few days he was discharged. Police later nabbed him from his house on the basis of gun shot injury, he stated in his bail application.

He requested the court to grant him bail as he had no role in the riots. He said it is his first bail application and that he has not preferred any bail application in the high court.

Opposing his bail application, ADGC Shiv Bhagwan pleaded that on December 20, after the namaz the accused along with a co-accused had hurled petrol bombs, acid bombs and bottles containing acids on the police party which caused damage to body protectors, cane shields, helmets and the vehicles. The police had used force on the order of the magistrate, the prosecution told the court.

More than a dozen cops had suffered injuries. The accused and the co-accused had burnt motorcycles of the police party. The field unit had collected empty shells of 12 bore cartridges, 315 bore cartridges and bottles used as petrol bomb and acid bomb, the ADGC argued and added the accused and the co-accused were arrested from the spot.

The judge in his order observed, "" The court has gone through the evidence on record and the police report in which the police claimed that charges under section 302 were added against the accused. The evidence on record indicate that he and the co-accused were involved in the violence and with the help of crowd had damaged national property which is a serious criminal offence"".

Considering the evidence, both oral and documentary, there is no ground to grant bail to the accused and his bail application is being rejected, the court said in its order.

Earlier on January 13 and February 1, the court had rejected the bail applications of accused Shahzad, Pervez, Adil and Mustaqeem.

Jaipur: The additional secretary of UGC Dev Swarup has been recalled by chief minister Ashok Gehlot to serve as vice-chancellor of a state varsity. Swarup, who resigned from the post of V-C Rajasthan University citing differences with the then higher education minister Kalicharan Saraf in 2014, on Thursday was made the V-C of Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar Law University (DBALU) in Jaipur.

Swarup will assume office on Monday has been part of several committees on the higher education in India.

“It is a very rare chance for any educationist to be given the role of VC twice. He turned out to be the obvious choice for the state due to his UGC background which would benefit the university to a great extent,” said a government official. Swarup biggest achievement has been the successfully initiating decades old recruitment process, department-wise curriculum meet and introduced choice based credit system which somehow was not implemented due to his exit.

Talking to TOI, Swarup said, “I believe in the saying beginning is most part of any work. The law university in itself is an exciting idea. I have already asked the bar council of India for their assistance in introducing three-year and five-year integrated law program. The larger aim is to follow the legacy of Baba Sahab by producing a force of legal luminaries upholding the core values of the constitution—justice, equality and egalitarian society.”

Earlier, also the role of Swarup was not restricted to the handle the affairs of the RU but was routinely consulted to the government on higher education. Swarup while resigning in 2014 had told that differences with then minister Saraf not allowing him to carry out developmental work.

PANAJI: A little over a year after it was inaugurated, the Atal Setu ’s south side approach road leading towards Porvorim has started sinking. Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation (GSIDC) has asked L&T, which constructed the cable-stayed bridge , to undertake major rectification of the approach ramps for which the Merces-Porvorim stretch will have to be shut.

GSIDC has also asked the private construction firm to raise the level of the down ramp on the south side, which gets inundated during the monsoon.

“Three issues have been identified for rectification. We have asked L&T to close the ramps and do all the repairs, including rectification of the settlement and potholes,” a senior GSIDC official said.

The two ramps have begun to show signs of settlement, which have been built in reclaimed land and the unevenness causes vehicles to jump or jerk while approaching the bridge. GSIDC has asked Goa police traffic cell for clearance to close down parts of Atal Setu, and discussions between all stakeholders are ongoing to identify suitable dates for the closure of the ramps.

Several potholes have also surfaced across the bridge, which L&T has repaired using the patch method.

“We are not satisfied because the methodology is not proper. The entire layer of asphalt has to be removed and a new layer has to be laid,” the GSIDC official said.

It must be noted that the bridge was inaugurated on January 27, 2019, by former chief minister Manohar Parrikar . Since the defects have cropped up during the defect liability period, L&T will have to bear the cost for the rectification and repairs.

GSIDC officials said that the bridge would continue to remain open for traffic as the Ponda to Porvorim ramp will be opened in a few weeks.

Vehicles coming from Merces and heading to Porvorim and beyond will be diverted towards the two older Mandovi bridges. “The work should start as fast as possible and has to be completed before the monsoon,” the official said.

The Porvorim-Merces ramp on the southern end of the bridge tends to get waterlogged during the monsoon due to heavy rainfall and the ramp itself has shown signs of settlement resulting in a bumpy ride.

L&T bagged the contract to construct the cable-stayed bridge for Rs 403 crore, but, as on date, GSIDC has spent Rs 546.8 crore on the four-lane bridge.

Jaisalmer: The uproar over the custodial death of a Dalit youth in Barmer rural police station does not seem to be dying down.

The family members and villagers are now staging a dharna outside the mortuary and have not agreed to lift the body of Jitendra Khatik. The three demands of the family members are a government job, compensation of Rs 1 crore and to arrest all police officers and employees under Section 302. They will allow the post-mortem to be conducted only when the demands are met, they said.

Jodhpur range IG Navjyoti Gogoi and Barmer collector Anshdeep have met the family members and assured all possible assistance and action as per rules.

Collector Anshdeep admitted that there has been some carelessness on part of police. He said all efforts are being made to get justice for the family and talks are on and for financial assistance.

Barmer additional DGP Ravi Prakash Mehda said keeping the youth in illegal custody was a mistake by police. As the matter is with CID CB, judicial investigation will soon take place. The culprits will not be spared, he added.

Dehradun: The slaughterhouse run by Dehradun Municipal Corporation ( DMC ) in Bhandari Bagh has been locked by the civic body. The facility was in use primarily for slaughtering goats.

With this lockdown, Dehradun now doesn’t have any authorised slaughterhouse.

Uttarakhand high court had recently directed the Food & Drug Administration to run an inspection drive in the meat shops of Dehradun to check whether they are following due norms or not.

Following the HC order, several raids were conducted and several meat shops who were found violating FSSAI norms were reprimanded. The FSSAI norms say that slaughtering of fowl or any other animal can’t take place inside the shops.

Meanwhile, the move to shut down the only legal slaughterhouse by the DMC was objected to by a few BJP MLAs including former mayor and Dharampur legislator Vinod Chamoli. “This will lead to illegal slaughterhouses flourishing and unchecked meat being sold.”

Chamoli added that “with diseases like swine flu and coronavirus prevailing, it is important that hygienic and properly checked meat is available to people and therefore, closing down of a legal abattoir is not a good step taken by the civic body.”

Nagpur: Jai Jawan Jai Kisan leader Prashant Pawar on Thursday alleged that MahaMetro’s Brijesh Dixit’s appointment was illegal and he had illegally got medical bills worth Rs64 lakh reimbursed. MahaMetro spokesperson denied that the appointment was illegal adding that the expenses was high because Dixit’s wife was admitted to a Mumbai hospital.

The spokesperson said that Pawar had stooped very low by terming medical expenses of the wife of an officer as corruption. “We get 100% reimbursement if the officer or his dependants are admitted to a hospital. If the person is not admitted, we get 90% reimbursement. In Dixit’s case, the bills were sanctioned, approved, audited and admitted. The amount was Rs30.44 lakh and not Rs64 lakh,” he added.

Pawar had claimed that Dixit’s medical expense reimbursement limit could not be more than Rs10 lakh to Rs20 lakh and hence Rs64 lakh was illegal. The Metro spokesperson said that this figure also included foreign service contribution, club membership fee, camp office rent, travel allowance, entertainment allowance and peon allowance. “The camp office rent of Rs31.80 lakh has been added to Dixit’s account,” he added.

On why the new government was not probing into his allegations, Pawar alleged that deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and guardian minister Nitin Raut were shielding the corrupt officials as they too had vested interests. He however, added that a MLA would raise the issue in state assembly next week and the government would announce an enquiry.

MADURAI: Madras high court has transferred a boy missing case to the CB-CID, after his father filed a habeas corpus petition (HCP) seeking to find his son who went missing in Pudukottai district last year.

In his petition, N Ganesan, an advocate and resident of Pudukottai district, stated that he has two children Shanmugapriyan , 17, and a 15-year-old daughter. On Septembr 4, 2019, his son, who was studying Class XII did not return home after school.

After searching for him at several places, Ganesan lodged a complaint at the Pudukottai Town police station. Though the police registered a man missing complaint, there was no progress in finding his son.

He stated that when he was searching for his son in Coimbatore district , a few hotel employees identified his son’s photo and said that he had approached the hotels seeking employment. Though he informed about these developments to the police, no effective steps were taken by them to find out the whereabouts of his son.

Hence, the petitioner filed a HCP before the high court Madurai bench. When the case was taken up for hearing on Thursday, a division bench of justice T Raja and justice B Pugalendhi transferred the case to the CB-CID.

Lodha was speaking over demands for grants for revenue and other departments at state legislative assembly on Friday. “Former BJP leader Ghanshyam Tiwari was raising the issue of bungalow no 13 for a long time and later he joined the Congress due to his differences. I urge the state government to inform how much expenses were incurred on Bungalow no. 13,” Lodha said.

Recalling a press conference by chief minister Ashok Gehlot while the latter was in opposition, Lodha, said, “In January, 2016, when Gehlot was not a chief minister, he had organised a press conference and had alleged that phones of political leaders and bureaucrats were tapped. He had then maintained that then commissioner of police, JDA commissioner and collector were involved in scams. Now your government is incumbent for the past 15 to 16 months, so the state government should table a report in this regard to clarify whose phones were tapped and who was involved in the scam,” Lodha added.

BHOPAL: Government Railway Police (GRP) still has the right to register cases under IPC in train theft, dispute, assault and other law and order related matters. Soon these powers can be given to Railway Protection Force (RPF). Keeping this in view, the RPF is preparing a cyber cell at the divisional level. Bhopal division will be the first to form such a cyber cell among the three divisions of West Central Railway.

Sources said that initially the task of the cyber cell will be to investigate the crimes registered under the Railway Act. Apart from this, they will hand over the complete details of the culprit to the GRP in mobile theft incidents. At the same time, when the RPF gets the rights of action under Section 378, 379, 380 of the IPC, then the usefulness of this cyber cell will increase even more, stated the officials.

Bhopal division will be the first to form such a cyber cell among the three divisions of West Central Railway.

Officials said that high-end computers will be bought for the cyber cell. Besides, they will also buy software for data analysis. Many a times, in the crimes registered under the Railway Act, issue is the location and call details of the mobile tower. In such situation, cyber cell will help in solving the case. Sources added that cyber cell will start by the end of March.

After the formation of the cell, RPF should take action in the incidents of theft of mobile phones in rail.

Along with this, it will also help to prevent and investigate cyber attacks on the railways. Besides, it will also monitor gangs involved in black-marketing of e-ticket. Training of RPF personnel is also going to begin for this. A senior official of RPF without quoting his name said that first RPF cyber cell of West Central Zone will be ready in Bhopal division.

Bicholim: The Kalsotsav festivities of Maya Kelbai Devasthan from Mayem village in Bicholim taluka have been suspended anticipating a law and order problem. Another reason was the letter submitted by Bicholim police station authorities to Bicholim deputy collector Jyoti Kumari about having lack of police force to control the situation in case the need arose.

This compelled the deputy collector to pass an order suspending the festivities. It has directed both parties to maintain status quo from February 28 to March 7. This was informed by Bicholim mamlatdar Pravinjay Pandit.

Uncertainty prevailed over the annual Kalsotsav festival which was scheduled to begin on Friday, with the two opposing communities vying to host the celebrations unable to reach a compromise. The groups met the Bicholim deputy collector Jyoti Kumari on Thursday, and the final call on whether the festival will commence was taken on Friday.

Festivities were scheduled to take place from February 28 to March 7. Bicholim mamlatdar Pravinjay Pandit had passed an order last week that the Kalsotsav festivities will be hosted by the Parab Gaonkar community. The other group, comprising Naik Gaonkar, Gosavi Gaonkar, Gawas Gaonkar and Karbotkar Gaonkar communities, had said that the mamlatdar’s order was one-sided.

“The celebration of Kalsotsav is the right of every community and not just the Parab Gaonkar community,” they said. Last year, the authorities had cancelled the festival, fearing a law and order problem.

Meanwhile, the Parab Gaonkar community maintained that order was passed at the last hour and hence they could not take any action.

“An inspection was conducted by health teams at three private hospitals. In all the three hospitals, no isolation ward was found for swine flu patients. Not just this, they did not have any infection control measures in place, instruction for which have been issued by the health department from time to time. A notice has been issued to all the three hospitals,” said Dr Raj Kumar, Meerut chief medical officer.

In this backdrop, a meeting of Nursing Home Association was called on Friday by the chief medical officer. “Strict instructions have been given to ensure that isolation wards are set up in each hospital without fail and all possible control measures are taken. If the instructions are not followed, strict action will be taken against the hospitals concerned,” said Dr Raj Kumar.

TOI had earlier reported that the health department had asked all the government as well as private hospitals to set up isolation wards for swine flu patients so that other patients admitted here – who are already have low immunity – do not catch infection.

As of now, there is no shortage, but if the situation continues, there may be a shortage after two months. That’s because a majority of the ingredients used for manufacturing medicines come from China. Thus, as a precautionary measure, we are going to stock medicines for six months. We already have two months’ stock, so stock for another four months is being purchased,” Dr J Vijaykumar, managing director of Madhya Pradesh Public Health Services Corporation Limited (MPPHSCL), told TOI.MPPHSCL is a state government-run company. One of the key objectives of MPPHSCL is to act as the central procurement agency for all essential drugs and equipment for all public healthcare institutions under the health department.“Annually, our medicine budget is around Rs 350 crore, thus cost of stock for four months would be approximately around Rs 120 crore. Tenders would be issued in a couple of days and deadline for supply will be within one month,” VIjaykumar said.

CM Edappadi K Palaniswami

MADURAI: Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami on Friday wrote to external affairs minister S Jaishankar to direct the Indian Embassy in Iran to make arrangements for the safe and immediate return of Indian fishermen stranded in that country due to Covid-19 outbreak.

The CM stated that flight cancellations because of the outbreak have left 450 Indian fishermen — 300 of them from Tamil Nadu — stranded in Iran. Employed in vessels operating in Port Kish , Cheeru and other places, the fishermen want to be evacuated, he added. Meanwhile, fear is gripping the fishermen some of whom hail from Kanyakumari. “We are struggling to manage with the limited water resources. Our boat has run out of water,” one of them, M Sahaya Askar, told TOI.

He said that schools and even mosques have been closed at many places in Iran but fishermen live in very poor conditions and will not be having access to proper quarantine facilities. “We have not even been provided with masks to boost our morale. We want to return home,” he added. Since there is no work permit to work as fishermen in Iran, most fishermen go to Dubai and take a visiting visa to Iran. The catch is sold in Dubai and hence the visiting visa is renewed every few months.

On Friday three boats with more than 20 Indian fishermen tried to enter Dubai as they have a Dubai visa but they were stopped in the sea by the authorities as the men worked in Iran. “In coordination with the fishermen in Iran and their village committees and through associations we have gathered the names of 252 Indian fishermen till Friday. Nearly 200 are from Kanyakumari district – predominantly from Kadiaoattanam and Rajakkamangalam Thurai coast villages,” Meenavar Orunginaipu Sangam secretary Charles Johnson said.

TENKASI: A 36-year-old man, who was found guilty of committing a triple murder in 2016, has been awarded death sentence by the Tenkasi additional district court on Friday.

The accused, N Muthuraj alias Andavar of Nettur village near Alangulam in Tenkasi district murdered M Pechithaye, 48, her daughter M Mari, 19, and Pechithaye’s father, Govindasamy, 75, on February 16, 2016.

Additional public prosecutor (APP) S Ramachandran told TOI that Muthuraj, a rowdy element had many cases registered against him. He was in jail in connection with another case and was released only about a week before he committed the brutal murders.

According to him, on February 12, 2016, Muthuraj tried to misbehave with the 21-year-old eldest daughter of Pechithaye. The latter lodged a complaint with the Alangulam DSP. On February 16, at around 3.45pm, when Pechithaye and a few other women who are fellow workers under the Mahatma Gandhi national rural employment guarantee scheme, were returning home on the Thenvadal main road, Muthuraj picked up a quarrel with her for lodging the police complaint.

He then attacked her with a machete resulting in her death. “He also attacked Pechithaye’s younger daughter Mari when she tried to protect her mother. Not content, he went to the village and murdered Govindasamy, who was grazing his cattle, by attacking him multiple times with the machete,” Ramachandran said.

The Alangulam police registered a case under sections 302 (punishment for murder), 341 (punishment for wrongful restraint) and 506(ii) (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code and the case was tried before the Tenkasi additional district court. “Though there were many eyewitnesses, some women turned hostile as the accused threatened them in the court,” Ramachandran said.

However, Pechithaye’s brother Murugan, 25, and his friend Govindasamy testified against Muthuraj. On completion of trial, additional district judge C Vijayakumar awarded him death sentence for the triple murder and two years and one month imprisonment for the other sections under which he was booked.

“The Centre has only announced withdrawal of the ban on onion export. It has still not issued any notification. The ban will not be withdrawn until a notification is issued by the Centre,” said Bharat Dighole, state president of the association.

The Centre had imposed ban on onion export in September last year after the average wholesale onion prices shot up. Moreover, a restriction on stock limit of 500 quintal was also put on the wholesalers and 100 quintal for retailers.

Following demand from onion traders and farmers, the Centre recently reduced the stock limit to 250 quintal for wholesalers and 50 quintal for retailers.

Meanwhile, on Thursday, the minimum and maximum wholesale onion prices were recorded at Rs 1,000 and Rs 2,391 per quintal, respectively. Around 20,000 quintals of onions were auctioned at Lasalgaon .

The average wholesale onion price had recorded an all-time high of Rs 8,625 per quintal on December 16 last year due to scarcity. Nearly 75% of the kharif plantation was damaged due to the incessant rains in September and October.

144,['29/02/2020'],BJP MLA writes to CM seeking land ownership rights for Hindu refugees in Bijnor’s Badhapur,"This story is from February 29, 2020

Bijnor: Unable to get land ownership rights ever since they were refuge by the government after the 1947 Partition, the Hindus and Sikhs living in Badhapur area of Bijnor are a worried lot even after 73 years. Now, BJP MLA from Badhapur, Kunwar Sushant Singh, has come out in their support and has written to Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath demanding that these people be given ownership rights of the land where they have been living for years now. Singh had also managed to get the support of 203 other MLAs for the cause and got their signatures on the application.

According to villagers, scores of families from Pakistan migrated to India during the Partition. Some were rehabilitated in Barhapur area, around 60 km away from the district headquarters. These refugees were provided land so that they could earning their livelihood. The land was barren and some had trees and shrubs at that time. These families worked hard and prepared the land for agriculture. Since then, they have been cultivating the land but do not have ownership rights.

As they do not have ownership rights, they are unable to avail of government's schemes for farmers. They are not even provided with supply tickets to sell sugarcane produce to mills, and this forces them to sell their crop outside at throwaway prices.

Talking to TOI, Tara Singh, husband of village head of Champatpur Soma Rani, narrated the grievances of the villagers: “There are 13 villages -- including Mudpuri, Chanmpatpur, Bhogpur, Prempuri, Kuakheda, Chakpuri, Rasulabad, Harevali, Harevala, Khijarpur, Nawabpura, Katarmal and Shahnagar etc -- in Barhapur area, where refugees from Pakistan were settled by the government.”

“We were persecuted in Pakistan and compelled to flee that country. Some of members of these families were killed in the riots and some got separated. A train brought us to Nagina railway station and from here we came to Barhapur. Each family was given four to five acres of land. Land is the only source of income for us. Earlier, we were given land records by the administration but it was stopped 13 years ago. Since then, we have not been given any benefit under government's agriculture schemes. We are forced to sell our produce at throwaway prices.”

“We have been demanding ownership of the land since long but our demands have fallen on deaf ears. Now, we have contacted Barhapur MLA Sushant Kumar to provide us relief. There are over 20,000 villagers who are fighting for ownership of land in their possession.” said Tara Singh.

Sushant Kumar Singh, MLA from Barhapur assembly segment in Bijnor district, said, “I have drafted an application some days ago. I also contacted 203 MLAs of UP and they have extended their support to the demands of these villagers. These MLAs also signed the application which I have handed over to chief minister Yogi Adityanath urging that ownership of land be given to these villagers on the line of forest nomads. I hope the chief minister will pay heed to the grievances of the villagers.”

Meerut: Two local journalists, who posted videos on social media platforms showing stones and other construction material on the rooftops of three houses of a community in Bulandshahr, were on Friday booked by police.

Taking note of the “sensational and inflammatory” posts against the backdrop of communal riots in neighbouring Delhi, police filed the FIR.

The FIR under IPC sections 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 295 (Injuring or defiling place of worship with intent to insult the religion of any class) and section 67 Information Technology Act was registered at Kotwali City police station of Bulandshahr. An unidentified person was also made an accused in the case.

Both the reporters work for local TV news channels.

The accused scribes have contested the claims of police.

“In the video footages of drone surveillance during Friday prayers, stones were spotted on rooftops of three houses, which were later removed. That’s what we showed. Police now claim that our intention was to flare up tension when we were just doing our job,” one of the reporters said.

But, the complaint on the basis of which the FIR was registered, read, “Videos and inflammatory content aimed at flaring communal tension was posted on YouTube and Facebook. A normal incident was sensationalized to hurt sentiments of a community.""

Panaji: The MGP intends to contest 20 zilla panchayat constituencies and is expected to announce the names of its candidates on Saturday, said lone party MLA Ramkrishna Dhavalikar here on Friday. Ponda, Pernem, Dharbandora and Bicholim talukas are some of the zones that MGP is eyeing.

The former PWD minister said the party’s executive committee had already met and deliberated over the names of the candidates for the ZP constituencies where the party intends to challenge BJP.

“Our committee has met and I think the party will contest the ZP elections in 20 constituencies. The committee will meet tomorrow and declare the names of the candidates,” said Dhavalikar.

He said that the party had received feelers from other political parties for an alliance for the ZP elections, but no final seat-sharing agreement had been arrived at.

“Even the decision on an alliance has not been taken, but like-minded parties who are with us, we will look into it,’ said Dhavalikar.

He said that the party had received a lot of interest from candidates and other political parties too. Dhavalikar also said that the ongoing resentment against BJP could work in favour of all the parties that take on the saffron party.

“I personally feel that all the opposition parties should come together. In the ZP elections, MGP, Congress and those who stand with these parties will fare well. If all these parties come together, it will be even better,” he said.

He said that MGP will focus on Mhadei water dispute, agriculture, industries and unemployment while campaigning for the polls.

MADURAI: Of the five crew members from Tamil Nadu who were on board COVID-19 quarantined ship Diamond Princess at Yokohama in Japan for more than three weeks only four have returned to India. Anbalagan, a crew member from Madurai who is among the Indians in a quarantine camp in Haryana, told TOI that a crew member from Kovilpatti in Tuticorin district was not in his camp.

The 138 Indians on board the ship included five from Tamil Nadu – one each from Madurai, Tuticorin, Trichy, Coimbatore and Chengalpattu districts. According to the Indian embassy in Japan, 16 of them tested positive for COVID-19 over a period of time and were taken to off shore quarantine facilities.

On Wednesday evening, 119 Indian crew members who tested negative for COVID-19 were taken from the ship at Yokohama to the airport by bus and flown to Delhi. On reaching India on Thursday morning, they were then taken to the defence camp for a 14-day mandatory quarantine.

“We all assumed that all the Indian crew members, including the five Tamil Nadu crew, have returned. I could not find the crew member from Kovilpatti in the camp. I was told by fellow crew members that he had tested positive for COVID-19,” Anbalagan said on Friday night.

He said the missing member joined work in the ship only a month ago due to which others were not close to him. “It is not confirmed if he is affected. But we could not find him here,” he added, expressing the hope he would be back home soon.

People using plastic carry bag in Trichy

TRICHY: Banned single use plastic products are making a slow but steady comeback across the city leaving the authorities virtually clueless about tackling it effectively. Except for the penalties imposed, the authorities have been hesitant to take stern action such as cancellation of trade license of repeat offenders. Traders who once clandestinely circulated the banned plastic products are now doing the same without any remorse.

Trichy corporation had in January 2018 banned plastic carry bags with less than 50 micron thickness which are detrimental to the environment even before the state government banned 16 types of single-use plastics from January 1, 2019. But the civic body has been unsuccessful in its attempts to eliminate such plastics. According to the ban, local bodies have to penalise a shop caught storing and circulating banned plastics three consecutive times. If it is caught again, the trade license certificate, a mandatory document for a shop to carry out the business, can be nullified by the civic body. However, the shops are only being penalised and there is no account of cancellation of trade license of repeat offenders. Taking advantage of this soft approach, shops have been paying the penalties imposed, be they in thousands, but continuing to circulate the banned plastics comfortably.

“The prevalence of banned plastics including plastic carry bags is only increasing because of poor enforcement. NGOs can be roped in to supervise and alert authorities on noticing their sale,” K C Neelamegam, secretary of the eNGO Thanneer, said. Since there are no plastic production units in the city, sources said the plastic is smuggled from other states through godowns on the suburbs. Door delivery of the contraband and assurance to reimburse the penalties levied were the strategy of plastic vendors.

Trichy corporation claimed they are left alone in the battle against plastic. It blamed poor cooperation from other stakeholders including the police department. “Like the seizure of gutka transported on vehicles, police can seize plastic contraband entering the city. Food safety department can enforce the ban in hotels but only we are implementing the ban,” a corporation official said. The official added that they have planned to approach the district administration for a coordinated approach to root out the menace in the city.

MEERUT: At least six persons died and 17 PAC jawans have tested positive for swine flu in the district in the last 48 hours.

Meerut chief medical officer Dr Raj Kumar said, “At least six persons have died of swine flu in the last 48 hours. Out of the 27 PAC jawans of the Sixth Battalion admitted to the Lala Lajpat Rai Memorial Medical College with complaints of fever, cold and other similar symptoms, 17 have tested positive for swine flu. Hence, around 370 jawans in the battalion were given Tamiflu tablets and instructed to remain on the campus to prevent further spread of the infection. With this, the total number of swine flu cases in the district has gone up to 71.” At least nine persons have died of swine flu in Meerut this season.

“We have added 40 more beds in the isolation ward of LLRMMC taking the total number to 56. Similarly, PL Sharma District Hospital and other private hospitals have also been asked to increase the number of beds in isolation wards,” he added.

In the wake of the rising number of swine flu cases, doctors have advised that only one member of the family should be involved in taking care of the infected patient to avoid spread of the disease. They added that city residents should wash hands frequently, wear a mask when in vicinity of the patient and take care of cleanliness inside the patient’s room.

Restoration work will be started in all the four Masi streets at the earliest

MADURAI: Madurai corporation has assured the public that Smart City work taken up in the Masi streets would be planned in such a way that it will not affect the movement of the Meenakshi Amman Temple car during the upcoming Chithirai festival. Trade bodies and residents have been urging the civic body to expedite the Smart City work to ensure a smooth conduct of the festival.

Officials said that they are planning restoration work at an additional cost of around Rs 70 lakh to make sure that everything passes off smoothly with minimum inconvenience to devotees thronging from various areas. Restoration work will be started in all the four Masi streets at the earliest, they added.

Corporation took up street landscaping and pathway construction work in the four Masi streets at a cost of around Rs 48 crore which is scheduled to be completed by September. Apart from landscaping and pathway, underground drainage facility, ducting of cables underground and storm water drainage are being provided under the scheme. One side of the roads have been dug up for the construction work, causing inconvenience to traders and residents.

Corporation commissioner S Visakan said work on the dug up stretch has been completed and work to cover the channel is taking place at present. Work on the other side of the street will be taken up after the festival. Soon, restoration work will start in all the dug up stretches in the four streets, he said.

Recently, trade body members staged a protest in West Masi street for speedy completion of the work. Another trade body had urged the civic body to postpone works until Chithirai festival, which starts in April, gets over.

Commissioner said that although inconvenience faced by traders and residents cannot be completely averted, they are carrying out the work in such a way that the impact is minimal.

152,['29/02/2020'],Wadettiwar shifts MahaJyoti HQ from Pune to city,"This story is from February 29, 2020

Nagpur: Reversing state government’s earlier practice of taking away projects and departments from Vidarbha, Minister for Backward Classes Vijay Wadettiwar has shifted Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Research and Training Institute (MahaJyoti) from Pune to Nagpur.

Hundreds of students from Vidarbha are likely to benefit with this non-profit government Institute meant for research, policy advocacy, training, financial assistance for OBC, SEBC and VJNT communities’ children.

Wadettiwar told TOI, MahaJyoti will start operations from March. “It will open on temporary basis from Social Justice Bhavan near Deekshabhoomi. I will soon develop new administrative building for MahaJyoti in Nagpur,” he said.

Backward Class Welfare Department on Wednesday issued a notification announcing it’s shifting from Pune to Nagpur and named Wadettiwar as chairman. “MahaJyoti was established on August 8, 2019, for social and financial development of students from OBC, SEBC and VJNT. Considering population of OBC, SEBC and VJNT in Vidarbha, the government approved setting up of head office of MahaJyoti in Nagpur instead of Pune for speedy execution of schemes and extending benefits to these communities. Address of MahaJyoti should be changed soon with Registrar of Company,” notification said.

Wadettiwar added, “A state-of-the-art training centre will be developed in Vidarbha soon. I have planned a series of schemes for students of communities covered under MahaJyoti. Routine benefits like library, fellowship, enabling coaching for competitive examinations etc will be also taken care of,” he said.

MahaJyoti is similar to Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Research and Training Institute (BARTI) established for SC students and Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj Research Training and Human Development Institute (SARTHI) for students of Maratha and Kunbi communities. These two government non-profits function from Pune.

On August 8, 2019, the then minister Sanjay Kute had announced MahaJyoti with its head office at Pune. Unfortunately, MahaJyoti remained only on paper due to assembly elections followed by uncertainty of government formation.

MahaJyoti is likely to have a budget of Rs 380 crore for the first two years. Umesh Korram, president, Students Rights Association of India (SRAI), said MahaJyoti coming to Nagpur means a lot for entire Vidarbha. “Kunbi along with Maratha are covered under SARTHI. Other castes of OBC were not covered under SARTHI. There was strong demand for another set up specially for all castes of OBC, SEBC and VJNT. Fortunately for Vidarbha. Wadettiwar became minister for OBC, SEBC and VJNT Welfare and he took lead in setting up MahaJyoti. Now, government will have to exclude kunbis from SARTHI as MahaJyoti covers them,” he said.

Korram said entire expense of students for all types of competitive examinations, M Phil and PhD courses etc in country as well as foreign countries will be looked after by MahaJyoti.

Wadettiwar is likely to appoint new members on MahaJyoti. BJP government had appointed 14 government officers in MahaJyoti which will be revised as per notification.

153,['29/02/2020'],Era Of Revival Of The Weakest: CM,"This story is from February 29, 2020

Indore: Chief minister Kamal Nath on Friday said that excess agricultural production is the biggest challenge for the state and limited measures to deal with it in absence of equivalent purchasing and procurement capacities continue to remain a challenge.

“Ten or 20 years ago, the challenge in agriculture was shortage, but today the problem is of excess. How do we deal with this excess? Excess means prices fall and poor remuneration to farmers. Sometimes, I think, we made a mistake by getting into high irrigation and high production,” Nath said at the annual meeting of Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) Madhya Pradesh Chapter, themed ‘CII@125: Business & Beyond’.

“With fast changing time and technology, it’s the era of ‘revival of the weakest’ and not the ‘survival of the fittest’. Industry bodies should plan to address forthcoming challenges, such as the young aspirational generation that, if not placed better, will pose a big challenge,” cautioned Nath. Stressing on tapping the state’s potential in food processing and horticulture, Nath said the government is working on a new approach to expand market and ecosystem in agriculture. “Food processing is a very big sector. We are in talks with leading logistics companies to make Madhya Pradesh a logistic hub, given that it has one of the best lands to diversify,” said Nath.

Nath said the Union government “lacks planning”, pointing out that it imported “loads of onions” a few months ago and is now contemplating exporting onions, citing higher output.

The CM also stressed on the need for attitudinal changes in every level, from politics to large companies and small-scale industries. “The profile and recognition of the state must change from being known for the unfortunate Bhopal gas tragedy to one of the best places to invest,” said Nath. Responding to a question on improving air connectivity, Nath asked CII to give a proposal on domestic and international flights.

Sunil Mathur, deputy chairman of CII-Western Region Council, said, “MP, being centrally located, is set to become the manufacturing and logistic hub of the country. Time-bound clearance and skill development are encouraging initiatives for investors.”

Madurai: The first meeting of the district development coordination and monitoring committee or ‘Disha’ this year for effective implementation of central government schemes in the district was held here on Friday. Madurai MP Su Venkatesan presided over the meeting which was attended by Virudhunagar MP Manickam Tagore, Theni MP P Ravindranath Kumar besides Madurai district collector Dr T G Vinay. Minister for Revenue, IT and disaster management R B Udayakumar was special invitee while MLAs from the AIADMK and DMK also participated.

Committee chairman Venkatesan said it was important for the members to ensure proper coordination of various central government schemes so that people benefit from them. Implementation of these schemes should be monitored stringently and Disha would meet once in three months, the MP said. Minister Udayakumar said the committee was responsible for the basic schemes which ensured proper infrastructure for development of the districts. These would ensure amenities like street lights, roads and potable water. Education and industrial development were also given thrust.

Madurai district has a population of 32 lakh in its 10 assembly constituencies put together, of which 26 lakh voters reside in the corporation limits. Many schemes including the challenging one to implement the AIIMS project had been given to Madurai. The chief minister was also implementing many development-oriented schemes. This committee should also take up the requirements of the local representatives with the central government and ensure they are met, the minister added.

Disha committee would monitor the implementation of 28 schemes of the central government including Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY), National Rural Drinking Water Program (NRDWP), Smart City Mission and National Health Mission (NHM) among other things.

Trichy: The BJP has threatened to launch a protest if the members of the Muslim community who have been on a two-week-long protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) at Uzhavar Santhai ground are not evicted.

Leading a protest rally of about 500 people in support of CAA from head post office to collector office on Friday, party general secretary Karuppu M Muruganandam demanded that the state government and police evict the protesters or he along with other people would sit opposite to them at the ground. “We don’t want to know how you do it, whether you carry out talks, fall at their feet or even use force, but they should be evicted. If that doesn’t happen, then a Delhi-like situation cannot be prevented in Tamil Nadu,” he told the police. Giving permission for such protests and ignoring their activities are against the interests of the country, he said.

Questioning the police action of allowing protests at Uzhavar Santhai ground for so many days, he asked if they (police) would tolerate similar protests by them too.

MADURAI: A medicinal tree park, with over 10,000 saplings and developed for the past two years, was inaugurated at Vaiyapurikulam Karamadai in Palani taluk by the minister for environment and forests, Dindigul C Srinivasan, on Thursday.

Speaking after inaugurating the park, Srinivasan said that the Tamil Nadu government was taking several steps to enhance the green cover in the state.

This year, it was planned to plant 72 lakh tree saplings to mark her birth anniversary and complete the project by December this year.

Under this initiative, the exclusive park of medicinal trees was announced in the Tamil Nadu Assembly in the year 2017-2018. Kodaikanal district forest officer (DFO), S N Thejasvi said that a vacant estate in Vaiyapurikulam Karamadai, which was being misused for dumping solid waste, was taken up for establishment of the park in 2018.

160,['29/02/2020'],Siblings given for adoption without informing family,"This story is from February 29, 2020

Representative image

BHOPAL: Three siblings, aged 8, 11 and 15, living in SOS Balgram here, were given for adoption to a US-based couple in late January — even when their father and grandmother are alive.

The kids’ grandmother went to meet them on February 22 only to find that they are already adopted. The Bal Aayog of Madhya Pradesh has taken cognizance of the matter.

The grandmother had taken the children to SOS Balgram in 2015, as CLCP (Child in need of care and protection), through Childline as their mother had died and father was of unsound mental health.

A special adoption agency of the city, linked to SOS, gave the children for adoption earlier this month, without the grandmother’s knowledge. On Friday, the grandmother filed a complaint with Madhya Pradesh Commission for Protection of Child Rights.

“I was unable to take care of the three children after my daughter-in-law passed away and son started having mental problems. A woman told me that I could go to Childline and put the children in an ashram or hostel where they will be taken care of. I took them to a shelter home with the help of Childline in 2015, and used to visit them every month till last year. The staff there told me not to come to meet the children so often, as it distracted them, so I went to meet them in January — after seven months. But they did not let me meet them. I went again in February but was sent back. I went again on February 22 when I was told that they are in a foriegn country as they have been adopted. I had not given them up for adoption. They were living there because I could not afford to take care of them,” the grandmother told MPCPCR

She had gone to the Child Welfare Committee on Wednesday but the members said they ‘knew nothing about the case’. “The previous CWC, with members — Rekha Shridhar , Seema Agarwal , Mohan Sharma, Satyendra Singh — had dealt with this case and had sent the kids to SOS as asked by the grandmother. As per records, we have the kids categorized as CLCP (child in need of care and protection) who cannot be declared legally free for adoption. We are going through other documents to verify them properly,” said Kripashankar Choubey , member of CWC.

Recalling the day the kids were brought to Childline, director Archana Sahaye said, “It had been made absolutely clear in the paperwork that the children were in need of care and protection, and had not been surrendered by the grandmother. The paperwork to make them legally free and then give them up for adoption was done without the knowledge of Childline and the grandmother.”

“We have taken cognizance of the matter and will write to the collector an commissioner WCD to investigate and see the Social Investigation Report given by the adoption agency and CWC before declaring the kids legally free for adoption and take strict agency against the guilty,” said Brijesh Chouhan, member of MPCPCR.

When TOI contacted Vipin Das — the director of SOS Balgram, about the matter, he said, “You can call CWC and SAA in question as all paperwork is done by them.”

Nagpur: Wardha police have filed a 426-page charge sheet in Ankita Pisudde case before the judicial magistrate first class court in Hinganghat on Friday. The 24-year-old college teacher had been set ablaze by an unrequited lover on February 3.

The murder had triggered a nationwide angst against atrocities on women. The state too had witnessed agitations at many places.

Pisudde was set on fire by her stalker, Vikesh Nagrale, a married man with a child, near her college at Hinganghat on February 3. She was rushed to city-based Orange City Hospital and Research Centre, where she was declared dead on February 10. The victim, a postgraduate in botany and pursuing BEd, was the elder of two siblings.

Wardha police arrested Nagrale the day of the attack, and he was shifted to Nagpur Central Jail due to security reasons. It’s learnt that Nagrale had followed Pisudde from her village at Daroda to Hinganghat, where he doused the victim with kerosene and set her afire.

SP, Wardha, Basavaraj Teli said a comprehensive probe has made the case watertight. “A foolproof investigation was done. We relied upon scientific and technical evidences to ensure there is no loophole left anywhere,” he said. Teli also said statements of eyewitnesses were part of the charge sheet. “We have included every possible detail and report, including the chemical analysis,” he said.

The state had already declared the trial to be conducted in a fast-track court with special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam appearing for the state.

Compensation has been paid to Pisudde’s family, including complete medical expenses for treating Pisudde. The state government has also announced a job for one family member.

Bhopal: A 40-year-old 'looteri dulhan' has taken her 72-year-old ‘groom’ for a royal ride. A day after the wedding, the bride ran away with Rs 10,000 cash and 150 gm gold jewellery. She told the victim that her mother had fallen ill and she had to leave, after few days she said her mother had died. The victim, who married her as he was lonely after the death of his first wife, has gone into depression and is having suicidal tendencies, say police.

Police arrested the two accused, including the woman and her 71-year-old real husband, who met the victim posing as her father. Police have also recovered the jewellery the accused had robbed. The accused were identified as Ramfal Shukla, 71, and Rani alias Sunita, 40, residents of Satna. The accused has confessed to duping elderly men in Kota, Rajasthan, and Jabalpur in a similar manner. She would target elderly men, who were either divorced or widowed. Once married, she would take money from them on pretext of conducting her mother’s last rites. A case on charges of fraud has been registered against the woman and her husband.

ASP (Crime Branch) Nishchal Jharia said that the 72-year-old victim had retired as engineer in a government department. He lives alone as his wife died a year ago.

The victim told police that after his wife’s death, he started feeling lonely and his friends told him to marry again. He gave an advertisement in a newspaper for marriage. After this, one Shankar Dubey, a resident of Panna, called him and said he has a relative, Rani Mishra, 40, who could not get married as she cannot conceive. He said, Rani is very poor and will serve him well. The victim agreed. ASP Jharia said that on February 20, Shankar and Rani came to Bhopal, and the victim married Rani in his house. He also gave his late wife’s jewellery to Rani. The next day, Shankar told the victim that Rani’s mother was seriously ill and they would leave for Satna.

The victim gave Rs 10,000 to Rani for this. A few days later, Shankar informed the victim that Rani's mother died and asked for Rs 40,000 to conduct rituals. Before he could transfer the money, he received a call from Rajasthan. The caller, Rajkumar Sharma, 53, said that ten days back, Rani and Shankar met him in Satna and he married Rani, but they fled with cash and jewellery. The victim then understood that he was duped.

164,['29/02/2020'],Indurikar’s event at SUK called off,"This story is from February 29, 2020

Kolhapur: The organisers of Shiv Mahotsav have called off the programme of controversial preacher Nivrutti Indurikar which was slated to take on Friday.

The activists of Maharashtra Andhshraddha Nirmoolan Samiti (MANS) and progressive outfits of the city had objected to Indurikar’s programme and had even threatened to disrupt it. The activists said that Indurikar propagates irrational concepts and blind faith in society.

Indurikar had recently made a controversial statement that intercourse by a couple on an even date would create a male child while intercourse on an odd date would result in the birth of a girl. Indurikar is famous among the rural areas and performs at several places. The MANS had demanded that a case against Indurikar should be filed for alleged violation of the provisions of the Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (PCPNDT) Act. However, the government has refuted the demand.

Shivmohotsav is organised every year at Shivaji University, Kolhapur (SUK). The students perform and participate in different cultural activities during the annual event. Indurikar was invited to deliver a kirtan (recitation) at the SUK. However, the activists of progressive outfits, Yuva Sena workers and the student wing of Shiv Sena met vice-chancellor Devanand Shinde in the morning demanding cancellation of Indurikar’s recitation.

Anuradha Bhosale, progressive activist and president of Ekati organisation said, “The university bears the name of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. He always honoured womenand respected them in the same manner in which he would respect his mother. Organising the event of some preacher who considers women secondary to men would be against the Maratha warrior king’s principles.”

Seema Patil, an activist associated with MANS, said, “Our movement is based on rational thoughts. Indurikar made irrational statements which had no scientific basis. Also, he has not understood our Constitution which upholds scientific temperament. His programme should not be held in the premises of Shivaji University, Kolhapur.”

Manjit Mane of Yuva Sena said, “Shiv Mahotsav is organised every year. Each year, various personalities are invited to the varsity to guide youth. Some people oppose it to gain publicity.”

165,['29/02/2020'],State seeks update in ’97 scam when Fadnavis was city mayor,"This story is from February 29, 2020

Nagpur: The Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, an alliance of Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress led by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, on Thursday sought details of action taken in the multi-crore sports equipment purchase scam that rocked Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) from 1997-98 to 1999-2000. Former CM and leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis was Nagpur mayor at that time.

The move comes days after the government ordered a probe into NMC’s garbage-to-compost project at Bhandewadi dumping yard.

The information on the sports scam was sought after Congress MLA from Rajura Subhash Dhote submitted a calling attention over the scam in the ongoing budget session of state legislature.

Municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe, deputy municipal commissioner Nirbhay Jain and a group of senior NMC officials worked till late night on Thursday to prepare the report for the state government. Subsequently, Mundhe flew to Mumbai on Friday morning.

The Congress had ruled the state from 2001 till 2014, and did nothing during these years. “Now, after almost two decades it is seeking action taken report. This is nothing but vindictive politics,” said mayor Sandip Joshi.

Speaking to TOI, Congress MLA Dhote said he came to know that the BJP-led NMC had dumped the recommendations of the Nandlal Committee and not initiated any action against 50 NMC engineers nor recover the embezzled amount from them.

Dhote said, “Both elected representatives and NMC engineers had looted taxpayers’ money and committed a very big scam.” The alleged scam took place between 1997 and 2000, and following this, the Maharashtra government had in 2001 constituted Nandlal Committee to conduct an inquiry into works approved and executed between 1997 and 2000.

The then government had also dismissed the BJP-led ruling alliance in the civic body and appointed an administrator after the scam came to light. The committee had later submitted its recommendations to the government, which directed NMC to act accordingly.

As per the committee’s recommendations, the 102 corporators were booked in criminal cases and the panel had also recommended action against 50 engineers and recover of Rs8 crore from them.

“The government even reminded NMC about implementation of the committee’s recommendations in 2006. But nothing has been done so far,” said city MLA, former mayor and Congress city president Vikas Thakre, who too had demanded Nandlal Committee.

He said that he will participate in Dhote’s calling attention motion and pointed out that the BJP-led NMC had not implemented the directives of the government to protect its corrupt practices.

Dhote said, “I will demand stringent punishment to those involved in the scam.”

The Scam

Between 1997 and 2000, ruling BJP corporators allegedly produced fake bills and receipts for sport goods, which were never purchased

There was no provision for NMC to purchase and distribute sports goods

Some also accused of not delivering sports material to players despite picking it up from NMC stores

76 corporators, including 28 women, and the then acting mayor Dr Ravindra Bhoyar, were arrested by Sadar police

Two BJP MLAs — Devendra Fadnavis and Mohan Mate — were detained for interrogation

After the expose, the then Congress-led Maharashtra government dissolved NMC in September 2001

Then NMC commissioner T Chandrashekar was made administrator at that time

In 2001, former IAS officer Nandlal Gupta probed the scam

Nandlal Committee accused over 102 corporators, the then additional deputy municipal commissioner Sahebrao Raut, retired sports officer H Mohite, retired education officer late Vinayak Chaudhary and supplier of not delivering sports material worth crores in their wards

Police complaint filed against 102 corporators under Section 406, 409, 420, 467, 120 (B), 511 and 34 of IPC

Recording of evidence underway in court cases, next hearing on March 17, 2020

167,['29/02/2020'],"CBS parking will affect business, claim auto unions","This story is from February 29, 2020

Kolhapur: The auto-rickshaw unions continue to oppose the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation’s (KMC) plan to develop multi-level car parking at the Central Bus Stand. A meeting between the KMC delegation led by Sanjay Mohite and the representatives of the auto unions was held on Friday.

The auto unions said that the car parking facility will affect their business. However, the office-bearers of the municipal corporation countered the claims saying that if the parking facility is developed, the number of visitors will increase, thereby, boosting the business of auto drivers.

The facility is likely to come up at 3,952 sq m location in front of the CBS. The parking facility was approved in 2012 and is expected to accommodate around 210 four-wheelers and 20 two-wheelers.

“The parking facility will also have covered parking accommodating around 80 rickshaws. We are going to visit the site in the next two to three days. We have asked the auto union representatives to remain present during the site visit. We are ready for discussion. We assure them that all the facilities they require in the parking facility will be given priority,” Mohite said.

Due to the lack of parking facility, the area surrounding the CBS remains congested even during the non-peak hours. The traffic department has banned the entry of private transport buses at the CBS to reduce congestion, however, the implementation of the decision is not satisfactory.

Along with the CBS, the multilevel car parking was proposed at several other locations in the city. The stone-laying ceremony of the parking facility to be developed at Saraswati Talkies will be held on Saturday. Tourists visiting the Mahalaxmi temple will be able to park their vehicles in this facility. Over Rs 8 crore will be spent on the parking facility.

The KMC is planning to develop a mobile application to facilitate booking of parking slots. The facility can accommodate 140 four-wheelers and 145 two-wheelers.

Mohite said that a similar facility will be developed at Kombadi Bazaar too. He has requested the auto-rickshaw union representatives to co-operate with the municipal corporation.

Kolhapur: The Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) has organized a bicycle rally on February 29 to create awareness about the increasing pollution caused by plastic. The municipal corporation aims to mke the city plastic-free.

The rally will witness the participation of corporators, civic officials, students and representatives of various NGOs. The KMC has also appealed to the citizens to take active part in the rally and support their plastic-free mission.

The municipal corporation has set a target of March 31 to make the city plastic-free. The programmes initiated to implement the plastic-free city plan are going to end on March 1.

Civic chief Mallinath Kalshetti recently met state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray and submitted a copy of the plan. Thackeray said that he will support the KMC’s plan to make the city platic-free.

“The rally will take off from Janata Bazaar Chowk in Rajarampuri at 9.00 am. The bicycle rally will pass through major localities and will conclude at Shivaji Chowk. We expect to cover distance of around 25km. We are going to hold corner meetings at several locations on the way and guide participants about the environmental hazards of plastic and the ways to avoid the use of plastic,” said Kalshetti.

The rally will pass through major localities, including Rajarampuri, Shahupuri, Laxmipuri, Mirajkar Tickti, Bhausingji Road and the Mahalaxmi temple. Students, teachers and locals will have to take pledge of refraining from using plastic. “We will make all necessary arrangements to ensure smooth flow of vehicular traffic,” said Kalshetti.

170,['29/02/2020'],10% slump in Kolkata international flyer count as trips cancelled amid corona scare,"A passenger being screened in Kolkata airport (File photo)

KOLKATA: Congestion at the international terminal in Kolkata that was becoming a major issue during busy hours till recently has eased conspicuously following a 7%-10% slump in the number of flyers this month as many cancelled their travel plans following the coronavirus scare . With Saudi Arabia announcing a ban on pilgrimage to Mecca on Thursday, the possibility of Gulf carriers also hitting the nCoV air-pocket has raised further concerns on the fate of international flight operations in Kolkata.“This is a challenging time, not just for Kolkata or India but also for the global aviation industry. Passenger traffic continues to decline as the climate of uncertainty prevails. Apart from fears triggering a decline in travel, travel restrictions and advisory issued by various countries have also led to reduced loads that have forced carriers to rationalise services,” said Kolkata airport director Kaushik Bhattacharjee.At Kolkata airport, international passenger departures had gone down from 9,232 a day in mid-January to 8,574 a day now. That means a dip of 4,600 passengers a week. Along with it, retail and food and beverage sales at the terminal have also slumped, with revenue dipping 14%.Flights to China were the first to be grounded after India cancelled visas to Chinese citizens and evacuated Indians stranded in the country. But the spread of nCoV to more than 50 countries has increased the radar of uncertainty to the entire region. With flights to Hong Kong being cancelled and those to Vietnam operating intermittently, traffic in South-East Asia is also taking a tumble.Flights to Bangkok, one of the most popular international destinations for Indians, and Kolkatans in particular, aren’t immune to the scare. One airline has stopped operations and others are rationalising services.The reverberations of the nCoV are now felt far beyond the region with even Gulf-bound flights, which have a good number of passengers who travel onward to Europe or the US, also reporting cancellations. “Loads have dropped by 50%-70% on east-bound flights and 20%-25% on those headed for west. If this persists, several more airlines will ground flights to avoid losses. The alarming issue is that with the Covid-19 virus continuing to spread, no one is quite sure when the situation will improve,” said travel agent Jaydeep Mukherjee.Travel Agents Federation of India chairman (east) Anil Punjabi is praying for a quick turnaround: “I have never witnessed this widespread a disruption. Even the situation during the SARS outbreak in 2003 was this dismal. Thankfully, this is the exam season, when families don’t usually travel and India is largely unaffected,” he said.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74410163,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-459580,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/10-slump-in-intl-flyer-count-as-trips-cancelled-amid-corona-scare/articleshow/74408665.cms
171,['29/02/2020'],"Sans permissions, tree cutters running riot in West Nagpur","This story is from February 29, 2020

Nagpur: Tree fellers are roaming in the city, especially West Nagpur which is greener than other parts, asking for trimming and cutting jobs from gullible citizens. They are brushing off queries of rules and regulations, and convincing owners to knock off a few branches and leaves here and there.

Citizens falling in their trap may end up being severely penalized by the civic body which has contracted tree cutters who work with full permission.

Recently, a group of citizens at New Somwaripeth at Manewada Road chopped down an age-old almond tree through such fellers. The tree was planted on the road nearly 25 years back and was felled without the mandatory permission of Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s garden department.

When an environmentally conscious resident Anshu Saxena tried to stop the illegal felling, few residents and labourers started abusing and threatening her. “I tried contacting the police but in vain. This group of people residents completely chopped down the tree because they were irritated with the leaf litter. How can this be a reason to destroy our green cover,” said Saxena.

According to the standard operating procedure (SOP) released by NMC in April last year, citizens can’t seek permission to fell trees citing insignificant reasons like “troubled by leaf litter” or “improving visibility of an advertisement hoarding or shop”.

Saxena further informed that the tree fellers, who visit their residential area regularly, make the job easier. “They offer service to trim or fell trees. The residents are now planning to chop down fully-grown Neem trees,” added Saxena.

On her complaint, a team of officials from NMC’s garden department had carried out a spot panchnama. “We have issued notices to the residents who ordered felling of the tree. Appropriate action will be taken based on the reply submitted by them,” officials said.

Since last few months, TOI has received many complaints about tree fellers who visit different residential areas. Carrying axe and other tools, they offer tree felling services at affordable rates. This practice is leading to significant loss in the city’s already dwindling green cover.

NMC garden superintendent Amol Chorpagar said that such tree fellers are prominently found in areas of West Nagpur. “We have identified such groups and will soon be initiating actions like filing FIR or extern them. The issue will be raised with the municipal commissioner,” he said.

Officials have appealed to the citizens to not use services of such fellers as they are cutting trees illegally. “They do not have NMC’s permit,” said Chorpagar.

172,['29/02/2020'],Cracks on incomplete cement road from Zingabai Takli to Godhani,"This story is from February 29, 2020

ddddd

Nagpur: Cracks are already appearing on the under-construction cement road from Zingabai Takli to Godhani village, raising questions on the quality of work being done. It has also exposed poor monitoring by the state’s public works department (division-I).

TOI has on many occasions reported about the lackadaisical approach of the state PWD and Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) towards monitoring and ensuring quality in cement concretization road works.

The Zingabai Takli to Godhani village stretch is part of the 5.6km long Bokhara-Godhani-Faras road that is being widened with grants sanctioned from Central road fund by city MP Nitin Gadkari. Some part of the road falls under Nagpur West assembly constituency while the remaining in Hingna constituency.

The Rs25 crore work order was issued in December 2016 to M/s Abhi Engineering. Work is being executed at a very slow pace and not even half of the road is complete after over three years.

TOI visited the stretch and found cracks at many spots on one side of the stretch between Mahajan Complex and Govind Lawn. If not attended to immediately, chances of these cracks opening up further cannot be ruled out.

At many places, there is gap between the road panels and interlocking blocks. The blocks too are of inferior quality.

From spot inspection it’s evident that the contractor isn’t following norms like regular sprinkling of water at the site and covering up construction material, thus leading to dust pollution on either side of the road.

Norms laid down by the traffic police too are not being followed. TOI found that the contractor has not put up barricades, signboards, blinkers, flasher boards, rotaries, directive signboards, red flags etc.

Also, traffic wardens need to be deployed round-the-clock at the site but this is ignored. Mankapur police and Sadar zone of traffic police seem to have turned a blind eye to these violations.

Former corporator Arun Dawre termed the quality of road work as poor. Citing reasons for the cracks, he said the road is not allowed to set properly. “The road is constructed at higher level from the ground and will lead to flooding of houses and shops nearby during heavy rains,” he said.

“Quality and pace of work is not being monitored. If quality is compromised, it will be like rubbing salt to people’s wounds,” Dawre said and added that compared to existing old cement roads, the new ones laid by the NMC, National Highways Authority of India and even PWD do not have a smooth surface layer.

Despite repeated attempts, state PWD’s executive engineer J Bhanuse was not available for comments. The contractor too could not be reached for comments.

Ruling party leader in the NMC and former deputy mayor Sandip Jadhav admitted that he too has found cracks on the road and said that he will raise the issue with the state PWD officials.

Bhopal: A division bench of MP high court on Friday issued notices to the Centre and the state government in response to a public interest litigation (PIL) challenging provision of 10% reservation to economically weaker sections (EWSs) from general category.

The PIL contended that the state government issued a notification on July 2, 2019, providing for 10% reservation for candidates from EWS of general category. In the Indra Sawhney case, the Supreme Court’s constitutional bench clearly laid down that total quota for various sections of the society can’t exceed 50%. MP already has 36% reservation for SCs/STs and 14% for the OBCs.

The petitioners further said that when state government raised the quota for OBCs to 27% from 14%, it was stayed by the MP high court. There are petitions in the Supreme Court opposing 10% reservation to EWSs and the apex court has stayed 10% quota for EWSs introduced by the Central government. In the same light, 10% quota for economically weaker sections in MP should also be stayed till disposal of the petition, the petitioners contended. TNN

175,['29/02/2020'],Opposition instigating riots over CAA: Amit Shah,"This story is from February 29, 2020

Amit Shah

BHUBANESWAR: In his first public speech since the outbreak of violence over the CAA in New Delhi earlier this week, Union home minister Amit Shah , here on Friday accused opposition parties of misleading people and instigating riots over the new citizenship law.

Without making any direct reference to the violence in the national capital that has so far claimed more than 40 lives and left over 200 injured, Shah said, “Through this big public meeting I want to tell the people of the country that the opposition parties are spreading rumours, provoking people and instigating riots.” He was speaking at a huge rally organised by his party to highlight the merits of the CAA.

Urging people not to be misled by such misinformation campaigns, Shah, whose resignation as home minister has been sought by Congress over the Delhi violence, said, “The entire opposition — Congress, communists, SP, BSP, Mamata didi — are opposing the CAA. They are saying minorities will lose their rights. Why are you spreading lies? The Prime Minister (Narendra Modi) has already said and I have also said in Parliament. Let me tell you again, not a single Muslim or any member of any minority community will lose his citizenship because of CAA.”

Shah’s remarks on the West Bengal chief minister came hours after the two met at a meeting of the Eastern Zonal Council here, which was also attended by Odisha CM Naveen Patnaik and his Bihar counterpart, Nitish Kumar, and Jharkhand finance minister Rameshwar Oraon. Jharkhand CM Hemant Soren could not attend the meeting which coincided with the first day of the budget session in his state assembly.

Shah said, “CAA is not an act to snatch citizenship from anyone. It is an act to provide citizenship to minorities persecuted in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. After Partition, there were forced conversions, forced marriages and rapes were committed. Many came to India to save their self-respect. It has been 70 years, but lakhs of such people don’t have citizenship. They don’t have access to healthcare and education. What about their human rights?”

The home minister pulled out pages from history to attack Congress. “Every Congress leader in the 1950s said Hindu and Sikh refugees will be given Indian citizenship. The Congress leaders on 27 different occasions made such promises, but never honoured them,” he said, adding, “While introducing CAA, we knew attempts will be made to malign us. But we are not afraid of such slander campaigns.”

Shah also touched upon issues like the construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya and abrogation of Article 370. Exhorting the crowd, Shah said, “Tell me whether Article 370 should have been abrogated or not. Be louder so that those Congressmen who are opposing it can hear you. Tell me whether a Ram temple should be built in Ayodhya or not. Whenever the issue of the Ram temple came up in the past, Congress tried to delay it in the Supreme Court. With your blessings, the Modi government has returned to power with a massive mandate. Now, a sky-touching Ram temple will be built at the place where Lord Ram was born.”

177,['29/02/2020'],Zoo restaurant burning a hole in visitors’ pockets?,"This story is from February 29, 2020

Mysuru: Zoo authorities have thrown up their hands even as tourists and visitors continue to complain about the high food prices at the restaurant on the campus. On an average, 8,000-10,000 people visit the zoo and are not allowed to carry eatables, barring water and baby food.

Entry on a weekday costs Rs 50 for an adult and Rs 20 for a child.

Former tourism minister SR Mahesh had assured that rates would be rationalised but nothing was done. Authorities said the rates were fixed after comparing prices at hotels in the area and the proceeds were required for maintenance of the zoo.

“The zoo is fantastic and well maintained but the rates at the restaurant are very high. We were shocked that even a cup of coffee or tea is not available for less than Rs 25,” said Radhakrishnan, a tourist from Chennai. “The government should realise that poor and middle-class people flock to zoos and can’t afford to eat here.”

“Completing one full round of the zoo is exhausting and most visitors have to grab a bite and catch their breath in order to cover all bird and animal enclosures. The high prices are a trap,” said a visitor.

Visitors pointed out that chapathi costs as much as Rs 50, a plate of idli-vada costs Rs 80. Staples such as masala dosa (Rs 65), bisi bele bath (Rs 75) and chow chow bath (Rs 100) were out of reach for most middle class families, they said.

Ajit Kulkarni, executive director of the zoo, said, “The rates were fixed after going through the prices at hotels in neighbouring areas. The zoo is maintained with the money it gets through gate collection, adoption and other contracts including the restaurant which pays Rs 10 lakh per month.” Bringing down prices would also mean more people at the restaurant which would make it difficult to manage and maintain cleanliness, he said.

178,['29/02/2020'],"Don’t pay extortion to gangsters, call us, say cops","This story is from February 29, 2020

Nagpur: City police have approached top builders’ bodies in the city, like Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Associations of India (Credai), to take them into confidence for ensuring none of them coughs up any extortion amounts.

Opening a special ‘anti-extortion’ cell this week, cops have also made a similar appeal to the members of Vidarbha Industries Associations (VIA).

On the lines of Mumbai, Pune and Thane, city police too now have their dedicated unit of ‘anti-extortion’ cell with PI Bharat Kshirsagar and API Ishwar Jagdale at the helm, with seven personnel under them. This is the first such initiative of city police under CP BK Upadhyay to have a dedicated unit to crack down on extortionists. Around 20 top gangsters and their gangs are under scanner now.

As economic activities have increased with the city’s expansion, around 84 offences of extortions have been registered in the last two years, including the ones against top goons.

Upadhyay said attention needs to be paid to the incidents of extortions as these often lead to violent crimes. “We may not have extortion cases on a large scale as in Mumbai or Pune, but even petty criminals engaged in such type of crimes needs to be put under the lens,” he said.

“Many times, there are no complaints against the goons by the victims fearing their wrath. But, we are trying to inculcate confidence among the citizens by approaching them and creating awareness that police need to be informed,” the CP said.

Kshirsagar said even the vendors at weekly markets, roadside temporary traders and kiosk owners are being approached during the surveys. “We have already conducted detailed surveys of the markets and traders. Several names of local goons who extort from these markets have come to fore. We have told the vendors and kiosk owners not to pay any goons,” he said.

“Earlier, there were no special approach to the problem of extortion. Now, we will try to explore the possibilities of slapping stringent actions like Maharashtra Control of Organized Crime Act (MCOCA) and Maharashtra Prevention of dangerous activities (MPDA) in as many cases as possible,” said Kshirsagar.

The PI said that anyone trying to extort under whatever circumstances can be bracketed as an extortionist and acted upon.

Kshirsagar said the records of the past cases of extortion in the city and the names cropping up as accused in them are being now researched. “We are scrutinizing the details of 84 cases of extortion registered so far and the accused who are in records,” the PI added.

Dehradun: A 42-year-old woman from Haridwar died of swine flu on Thursday making it the second death of H1N1 in Uttarakhand this year. The year’s first swine flu death was reported from Dehradun in January.

So far, nine swine flu-positive cases have been reported in the state.

Meanwhile, one more swine flu case was reported from Dehradun on Friday. The patient hails from Muzaffarnagar district of UP and is living in Dehradun.

Haridwar chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Saroj Naithani confirmed that the 42-year-old woman has died due to swine flu. “The patient was one among the eight positive swine flu cases that were confirmed earlier this week. She was admitted to the Himalayan Institute of Medical Sciences. One more case of swine flu was reported from Haridwar and the patient has recovered,” she added.

Talking about preventive measures, the CMO said that people must cover their nose as the H1N1 spreads by droplet infection. “Swine flu is curable but the virus can prove to be fatal in case of diabetics, children and the elderly. Hence, we advise early treatment and avoiding contact with people when symptoms are detected. One should immediately consult a doctor in case of consistent fever and breathlessness,” she said.

Mysuru: More than 7,000 industrialists and entrepreneurs have left the country due to a deficit of trust and incidents like the violence that rocked east Delhi will only affect the economy further, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, founder of Art of Living Foundation, said on Friday.

Ravi Shankar was speaking at a corporate wellness conference on the theme ‘Wellness and Wellbeing for a Progressive Nation’ hosted by CII, in Mysuru. He said an atmosphere of fear and mistrust pervades the country and is does not augur well for the economy.

“Bankers too are suspicious of everyone and are not extending loans to industrialists. This has posed lots of problem,” Ravi Shankar said. “This attitude among bank officials should go, as life depends on trust. When there is a deficiency of trust there is possibility of the economy slowing down.”

He said society is now faced with two important issues — aggression and depression. “Some people stage protests and pelt stones which happened recently in Delhi. This is really unfortunate,” he said. “Fear lurks in the nation’s capital, which is being used by many to create terror. This will affect economy. No country will prosper without peace.”

Wellness is the need of the hour, he said. “Corporates used to spend half their health to gain wealth and spend half their wealth to regain their health. This isn’t good economics,” he said. “We have to talk and convince people to invest in wellness. I am glad times have changed. CII has taken this big initiative and corporate wellness is buzz word around the world today.”

He went on to say, “The US has invested $27 million in the wellness industry. In universities in America, 52 have [a course on] Indology. In India, 40 years ago, yoga was not taken as profession, but today many are taking Ayurveda and yoga seriously. This is leading to wellness.”

Dr Upendra Shenoy, chief, medical services, Columbia Asia Hospital, said, “Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death in India and it is on rise. More than 50% of people who suffer heart attack are smokers.”

He advised people not to jog or run on the steps of Chamundi Hill as the uneven steps could result in injuries. Instead, he advised the audience to walk briskly on flat surfaces for at least 30 minutes. He also urged people to sleep eight hours a day.

69% of doctors ill

Dr Upendra Shenoy said a survey conducted by AIIMS revealed that nearly 69% of doctors have health issues. Besides this, more than 50% of psychiatrists have developed problems in their course of service towards patients. “Our mind is spinning so we need to take care of our mental health,” he said.

183,['29/02/2020'],SP’s personal letter moves top Naxal cadre to surrender with AK-47,"This story is from February 29, 2020

Along with an AK-47, Vilas Kolha also deposited three magazines and 35 cartridges

Nagpur: A letter penned by SP, Gadchiroli, Shailesh Balkawade seems to have done what the force under him could not with their advanced firepower. Without a bullet being fired, Balkawade’s letter heartfelt letter, offering all help after surrender, moved Maoist commander-in-chief Vilas Kolha so much that he laid down arms on Friday. This has delivered an unprecedented setback to the four-decade old rebel movement in the tribal district.

Kolha, 44, working as Divisional Committee Member (DVC) of Chatgaon dalam before leaving the post, became the first cadre of any rank in Maharashtra to surrender with an AK-47 assault rifle. He also deposited three magazines and 35 cartridges.

Kolha had almost Rs20 lakh rewards on him in Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh, and 147 offences registered against him. The offences against him include 22 murders and several firing cases on police, apart from masterminding the Jambhulkheda blast last year where 14 cops and a civilian were killed. He was also behind the heavy setbacks to police in 2009, when 51 police personnel were killed.

Kolha had joined the movement through Etapalli dalam in 2000 and rose to prominence with his daredevil planning, operational acumen, strategic manoeuvring and aggressive approach. It’s learnt Kolha had recently had differences with the party over his inaction during the last year’s elections, and also due to depleting strength of Maoists in the north.

Kolha, one of the most dreaded DVC, commanding a horde of dalam of north Gadchiroli, had a change of heart after receiving a personalized letter from Balkawade in November last year. The IPS officer had managed to send the letter to Kolha through some acquaintances and family members. He had assured to ensure all possible benefits under government’s surrender scheme, and his personal support to set up a life in the mainstream.

It’s learnt Kolha sneaked out from a hideout in the Maoists’ guerrilla base at Abhujmadh with the weapon to surrender. He was attending a meeting when he decided to leave the Naxals.

Balkawade said he sent a second letter after they learnt Kolha had already left the outfit, and was on his way to meet police. “Kolha was miffed with allegations of non-performance by Prabhakar of Dandakaranya Special Zonal Committee (DKSZC). He had already left the outfit when I sent him my second letter, just to confirm his decision to surrender. He then came to us through an intermediary,” he said.

Balkawade said Kolha’s name was taken in the same breath as other senior DVCs like Narmada (now arrested in Jambhulkheda blast case), Sainath (eliminated in Kasnasur encounter), Aitu (surrendered in Telangana) and Ramko (killed in Gundurvahi encounter). “Four DVCs have surrendered so far since 2018 and one (Ramko) was neutralized,” he said.

Under Balkawade, 35 Maoists and their supporters have surrendered in last couple of years. He has written to several other top Maoists to surrender. “Last year, the entire Chatgaon dalam had surrendered. Kolha was shifted as DVC of Chatgaon to rebuild the dalam,” he said. “Several other dalam leaders and cadres are also expected to leave after Kolha,” he said.

184,['29/02/2020'],4 officials suspended for poor property assessment,"This story is from February 29, 2020

Kolhapur: Four officials of the property tax department were suspended by civic chief Mallinath Kalshetti on Friday over faulty assessment of properties leading to huge revenue loss for the civic body.

One of the officials, Diwakar Karande, was the chief property tax superintendent and now the town secretary of the KMC. Others — Aniruddha Shetye, Nitin Nandwalkar and Vijay Khot — were tax superintendents in the property tax department.

Two months ago, Kalshetti had received several complaints stating that the assessment of property tax of many of the properties in the city was faulty. A three-member panel was formed to investigate the complaints.

After investigation it came to the fore that the officials were responsible for faulty assessment of properties for the last several years.

A senior KMC official said, “Suspension orders of all four officials have been signed by the civic chief. Last week, the officials replied to the show-cause notice, but their replies were not satisfactory. The investigation of the panel has found huge loss of revenue. The system of registering and assessing the property will be scrutinised once again. The digital system was closed for carrying out investigation. At present, the panel has scrutinised only few complaints and in the next couple of weeks more cases will be investigated.”

The panel members, however, have not mentioned the figure of the actual loss caused by irregularities of these officers.

“We have given orders to the property tax department to re-examine the assessment of the properties and change it as per actual assessment. Currently, no decision to recover the dues from property owners has been taken. We have found that the owners were hand-in-glove with these officials to save taxes,” said the official speaking anonymously.

Kolhapur: The corporators in the standing committee have decided to sack environmental expert Uday Gaikwad from three panels of the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC).

Gaikwad has been on the KMC’s panels for several years. He is the member on the panels tree authority committee, heritage committee and Kirnotsav committee. The tree authority committee looks after protection of the trees, issuing permissions for tree cutting and carrying out tree census. The heritage committee looks after conservation and protection of heritage site whereas the Kirnotsav committee was set up to study the obstacles in the way of sun rays falling on idol of goddess in Mahalaxmi temple.

Sandip Kawale, chairman of the committee, said, “The corporators have levelled several allegations against Gaikwad. He does not have appropriate qualifications to be a member of all these committees. Also, he has been accused of the delays in getting permissions for tree cutting and taking the official files of the committees to his house. All the corporators agreed to pass the resolution to drop him from all the panels either in the upcoming standing committee meeting or the general body meeting.”

Gaikwad is considered as one of the few environmental experts in the city. In the past, he has faced the wrath of corporators over drafting of environment status report (ESR) of the KMC stating that the reports are same for every year with just the figures changed. After the allegations, the KMC had hired a new agency to draft the ESR.

KOLKATA: Fake posts and rumours doing the rounds on social media that chicken spread novel coronavirus are reportedly taking a toll on sales in Kolkata, logging a decline of 30% to 50%.Blaming the drop in purchase on these rumours, traders said there might be no truth in such forwards, but consumers were being influenced by them and staying away from chicken shops. “We have been trying to convince the customers, especially the regular ones, that what they’re reading on Facebook and other social media are nothing but rumours. Our sales have hit rock bottom,” said a trader, adding that the last time their sales dipped was during the bird flu scare.West Bengal Poultry Federation general secretary Madan Mohan Maity said the problem surfaced a fortnight ago but over the past five days, sales dropped by 40% and prices 20%-30%. “The decline in egg and chicken sales due to rumours has accounted for a loss of Rs 300 crore. Wholesale prices of chicken have gone down by 50% in the past month,” he said. Kolkata consumes around 60 lakh kg chicken a week or an average of 8.6 lakh kg a day. Following the scare, the weekly consumption has come down to 24 lakh kg a week or 3.5 lakh kg a day.Lake Market chicken retailer Satyajit Sinha Roy said, “Every day, I worry how much further the sales would dip. My daily turnover has declined by 30% over the past 15 days. Sales didn’t increase even after we reduced prices. A fortnight ago, a whole chicken sold for Rs 100 a kg. I am now offering a whole chicken at Rs 80 a kg. Dressed-chicken was priced at Rs 180 a kg a fortnight ago. It is now on offer for Rs 160 a kg. But still, we have few takers.” Echoing him, Manicktala trader Sudhakar Dhali said, “Our sales have halved. Till 15 days ago, we would sell 400kg-500kg a day. Reducing prices by Rs 30-35/kg on an average has not improved sales.” Manicktala Market Committee joint secretary Bijoy Sahu said, “This rumour about coronavirus spreading from chicken is hurting business. Sales have been consistently declining. Things haven’t improved even after traders reduced prices.”Some citizens may not completely believe the rumours, but they don’t seem ready to ignore it either. Housewife Jayotee Mukherjee said, “It looks like a rumour, but I have kept chicken out of my shopping list. I am not taking any risk since I have kids and elderly people at home.”",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74410146,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-735511,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/online-rumours-pull-chicken-sales-down-by-50/articleshow/74408675.cms
187,['29/02/2020'],Carnatic musician shores up primary school he studied in,"This story is from February 29, 2020

Hassan: Beginning with contributing computers and building washrooms, renowned Carnatic vocalist RK Padmanabha has now added three digitised classrooms to the primary school he went to in Rudrapatna in Arkalgud. The government school, which started in 1931, bears its famous alumnus’ stamp as well: a permanent stage for cultural activities.

The village of Rudrapatna, on the banks of the Kaveri, is home to several Carnatic music artistes, including Vidwan Padmanabha. Located some 27km from the taluk centre, facilities were hard to come by for its government primary school.

Spread over 2.5 acres, the school has all of six teachers, including an in-charge headmaster, and 141 students from Classes 1 to 7. It does not have a kindergarten section or English medium of instruction.

Padmanabha first came to know of the poor state of his school in 2014 and gave computers and UPS units for students. Over the years, he helped build washrooms for boys and girls and developed a garden on the campus. To ensure the village continued to nurture talent, he commissioned a permanent stage, ‘Rangavedike’, for cultural activities.

Last Dasara, the musician joined efforts with Ocwen Financial Solutions Private Limited, and helped build three classrooms with overhead projectors, white boards and sound systems. The Vidwan also donated band instruments, a printer, water filter and contributed for a borewell.

Padmanabha’s brother, RK Srinivas, donated Rs 1 lakh to expand the garden. Among the maestro’s friends, Brigadier Sitaramayya set up a welcome board while engineer Rajegowda contributed towards the sound systems. The gram panchayat has put up concrete fencing along the boundary.

“I have donated more than Rs 10 lakh for the school. My friend has also contributed around Rs 15 lakh through sharing his company’s profits,” said Padmanabha.

Students are enjoying the vibrant environment in the school – while the windows are named after Kannada Jnanpith winners, there is a Nali Kali classroom for students of Classes 1 to 3 to engage in fun learning and computer lab for all. The school walls are also painted with informative messages and images.

Haridwar: A long-pending demand of seers is likely to be fulfilled with the district administration initiating measures to earmark land for their burial spots (bhoosamadhi).

Deputy Kumbh mela officer Kushm Chauhan accompanied by Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad general secretary Mahant Hari Giri and other members of akharas visited certain areas suggested by the seers such as Bairagi Camp, Gauri Shankar, Chandi Ghat and Neel Dhara areas of the Kumbh mela land as well as village Missarpur on Friday. A few weeks ago, the cabinet had decided to allocate land to akharas for making samadhi sthal of seers.

The seers had made the demand decades ago as immersion of their bodies in the Ganga (jalasamadhi) causes river pollution. They had therefore asked the administration to provide them land for burial so that the practice of jalasamadhi could be given up. Since the land requirement was quite large, the administration had so far not been able to meet the demand. However, the recent cabinet decision to provide land to seers for use as samadhi sthal has now raised the hope of an early fulfillment of their demand.

Giri told TOI, “If a sadhu dies during Kumbh, we will have to immerse his body in the Ganga, in the absence of land for burial. That is why, we want to expedite process of land being made available for samdahi sthal.” He added that commissioner of Prayagraj had allocated 5 acres for burial of sadhus if they happened to die during the Prayagraj Kumbh 2019.

Meanwhile, Chauhan said that the seers have been given some options of possible land. “These include land at Haddipur village, Devpura Ehatamal opposite Satikund and Gauri Shankar Dweep. Once they finalise their choice, the administration will decide on the area of land to be allotted to them.”

OMALUR (SALEM): It looked like just another wrecked vehicle towed and dumped on a police station campus. The damaged minibus on the Omalur station premises, however, has five Nepal citizens living in it — cooking, eating and sleeping. It was on February 20 that a private bus rammed the vehicle near Omalur on the Salem-Bengaluru National Highway killing nine of the 32 passengers on board, all from Nepal.

Life hasn’t been easy for the two drivers and a tour agent who escaped unhurt in the accident as they wait for formalities to be completed so that they can return to their country along with the other survivors. On Thursday, two survivors who were discharged from the government hospital in Salem joined the trio in the bus.

Talking to TOI, 51-year-old tour agent Amarnath Chowdri said they had to be on the police station premises to complete the formalities. “The inquiry is going on. We have to submit documents such as vehicle registration certificate and insurance papers to police.”

Drivers Kaluram Chowdri, 38, and Anil Chowdri, 36, besides 65-year-old Baglu Chowdri and his wife Daithin Chowdri, 62, are with him.

They cook, eat and bathe on the police station premises. Police have allowed them to use washrooms at the station.

Deputy superintendent of police M Baskaran said, “We had arranged a marriage hall for them to stay, but they declined our offer. It seems they are wary of accepting any help from us. Language is also a barrier and it has affected the inquiry too.” Amarnath Chowdri, meanwhile, expressed hope that they would be able to leave for Nepal with fellow passengers in a couple of weeks. “It will take at least a week for us to reach our native place.”

While four people were killed on the spot in the accident, two others died in the hospital the same day. The toll rose to seven on February 21, when another critically injured person died in the Salem government hospital. Another injured person died in a private hospital in Chennai on February 23 and the ninth victim died in a private hospital in Coimbatore on February 25.

At present, five injured people are undergoing treatment in the Salem Government Mohan Kumaramangalam Medical College and Hospital, one in a private hospital in Salem and 12 others in private hospitals in Coimbatore and Chennai. Their condition is said to be stable.

Bareilly: The fast track court of additional district magistrate Shrikrishna Chandra Singh has ordered Meerut SSP Ajay Sahni to stop the salary of Rohata station in-charge Upendra Singh Yadav till further orders for failing to depose before the court in an ongoing gang rape case in which he was the investigating officer.

According to sources, inspector Yadav was previously posted in Bareilly and was the investigating officer of a gang rape case dating back to 2017. Additional district government counsel Suresh Babu Sahu said that the officer failed to appear before the court to record his statement despite several reminders, thereby delaying the trial. At present, he is in-charge of Rohata police station in Meerut.

The ADGC said that, in its order to the Meerut SSP, the court stated that all witnesses had recorded their statements in the matter except investigative officer Yadav.

The court stated in its directive, “Despite several orders, he has intentionally been disregarding of court due to which judicial work is being hampered. In such a condition, it is necessary to stop his salary until he appears before the court and records his statement.”

Sahu said that the case pertains to the gang rape of a nurse of a private medical college while she was going to work on foot in 2017. He added that the three accused dragged her into the bushes and took turns to rape her.

The ADGC said, “When the three accused attacked her, she was talking over mobile phone with her husband. Hearing her screams over phone, her husband sensed that something was wrong and alerted police before rushing to the spot. On information, a police team also headed to the spot. Before they reached the crime scene, they found two persons near the said location and asked them if they had spotted a woman in distress. They denied having any knowledge of such a thing.”

Sahu said, “Police, however, clicked their photos on mobile phones. A further ahead, they found that a man was raping a woman. During interrogation, he revealed that his two accomplices had left the spot a few minutes ago and identified them when police showed him their pictures. They later arrested the other two accused too.”

Defunct cameras are being replaced by police, VMC

VADODARA: With Delhi riots spreading panic among the citizenry, even an innocuous routine activity like replacement of old CCTV cameras was looked upon with a suspicious eye in the city.

According to sources, fear was further triggered by the rumour mills spreading false messages on social media that the cameras were being ‘removed’ ahead of a “Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) support rally” in the city.

Looking at the misgivings, the police had to issue a clarification on Friday stating that the CCTV cameras were being repaired and replaced with new ones and not as being aired. In fact, there is no such rally proposed to be taken out in the city, they said.

The detection of crime branch (DCB) will also file a police complaint against unknown persons for spreading rumours and causing panic among the citizens. “Some days ago, the process of repairing old CCTV cameras and replacing defunct with new ones was initiated. It is a routine process. But some mischievous elements began spreading rumours to create unrest in the city,” said Jaydeepsinh Jadeja, DCP (crime).

The messages states that many CAA, NRC supporters have planned a rally in the city in the lines of Delhi and incite the minority community members in old city to be “prepared for three days to face any kind of trouble” and to be on the alert on Saturday and Sunday. On Thursday night, a group of minority community members had also gathered in Yakutpura due to such rumours.

The police said that such messages are intended to spoil communal harmony in the city. “We have initiated the process to identify those spreading such rumours. We will also act against those who continue to make such posts viral,” Jadeja told TOI.

The police said that it is planning to install 1,400 CCTV cameras in the city and work on installing 400 high definition CCTV cameras in the walled city will begin within a few days. The walled city already has 257 cameras in Panigate, Wadi, City and Karelibaug.

196,['29/02/2020'],Extremists are preparing India for another partition: Pon Radhakrishnan,"This story is from February 29, 2020

Pon Radhakrishnan

MADURAI: Extremists are trying to divide India by misguiding people on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), former Union minister and senior BJP functionary Pon Radhakrishnan said on Friday.

He was talking to reporters after taking part in a pro-CAA rally towards the Tuticorin district collectorate that was organised by the BJP to create awareness on CAA and urging the state government to take action against those protesting against the same.

Stating that there is no problem for anyone due to CAA, Radhakrishnan said that the situation has been thrown out of proportion by portraying it as an Act against the Muslims and the common man. “Fear is instilled in their minds by spreading false news that they will be dislocated or deported from India,” he said and accused the DMK of heading them in Tamil Nadu and the Congress of guiding them.

Playing the video of an anti-CAA protester terming the ongoing protest as a next freedom fight, Radhakrishnan said that similar speeches were taken lightly when they were made from 1905 to 1947 and that it has to be viewed seriously now. “Extremists are preparing India for another partition and it will not be permitted,” he said and added that such acts are common for everyone and they don’t distinguish Hindus, Muslims and Christians.

In Madurai, a large number of cadres from the BJP and Hindu outfits took part in the pro-CAA rally on Friday.

The rally, which started at the Raja Muthiah Mandram ended at the Gandhi Memorial Museum in the evening. A large number of members started gathering at Raja Muthiah Mandram starting from noon onwards. They raised slogans supporting CAA and NRC all along the way till they were stopped at the museum. They also condemned the DMK and its allies for spreading rumours against CAA to gain political mileage.

According to police, around 1,500 cadres, inclduing 300 women from various parts of the district took part in the rally. The rally was organised by district secretary of BJP K K Sreenivasan. Around 350 police personnel were deployed throughout the stretch to make sure no untoward incident took place.

After they were stopped by the police, a group of representatives left to petition Madurai district collector T G Vinay.

Meanwhile, the protest carried out by people from the Muslim community at Rajaji Thidal in Mahaboobpalayam entered the 15th day on Friday.

Rampur: Samajwadi Party leader Muhammad Azam Khan’s counsel on Friday filed a contempt petition against Rampur jail authorities, local administration and the police over the transfer of the party leader, his wife Tazeen Fatimah and son Abdullah Azam from Rampur jail to Sitapur district jail.

Azam’s counsel Khalil Ullaha Khan informed the court, headed by additional district and sessions judge Dhirendra Kumar Kamboj, that their transfer amounts to “custodial torture” as they were forcefully shifted to Sitapur jail without informing the court.

Khan also cited the judgments of the Supreme Court and the Allahabad high court while presenting his arguments.

“Tazeen Fatimah is suffering from spinal related diseases and Azam Khan is a patient of high blood pressure. They were forced to travel for five hours and sent to Sitapur district jail without informing the court,” Khan said.

Responding to the argument, state government’s counsel Ajay Tiwari said Azam and his family were shifted due to security reasons.

The team of the prosecution counsels, headed by Tiwari, also produced the Uttar Pradesh government order 2018 which talks about the transfer of the under trial jail inmates to another jail without informing the court.

Tiwari told the court that Azam Khan and his wife Tazeen Fatimah would also get better medical facility inside Sitapur jail. “Since Lucknow is merely 90 kilometres from there, they can get better treatment if any compilation occurs,” Tiwari said.

The next date of hearing has been fixed on March 3.

We have taken appropriate legal decision as per the government order. We will file appropriate reply of the petition before the hon'ble court into the matter.""

Representative image

MADURAI: Who is a ‘senior’ lawyer to be nominated by district collectors to conduct trials under SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989? Is he a designated senior counsel or a lawyer of eminence with considerable standing in the Bar?

Clarifying this tickling issue, the first bench of Madras high court Chief Justice A P Sahi and Justice Subramonium Prasad said: “Even though a long standing at the Bar beyond the period of 10 years may be a necessary benchmark, apart from this, the eminence of a lawyer should be gauged from the nature and number of cases handled by him, particularly in the field of criminal law, to place him in the panel of eminent senior advocates.”

The judges were addressing the issue, after one Mallika filed a petition in 2008 to declare the term ‘senior’ as found in Rule 4(5) of SC/ST Rules as null and void. She had said that years of practice in itself would not be sufficient to decide the eminence of a lawyer. She said guidelines may be fixed by the court or the state government keeping not only the years of practice in mind, but also the actual and effective practice of a lawyer befitting his accomplishments.

The judges observed that the petition raised a question of vital importance pertaining to legal assistance provided to SC/ST people and the level of competence of lawyers to be engaged for conducting a case on behalf of the prosecution to protect the sanctity of the procedure and also to ensure justice to the victim.

The judges also said the state government must formulate guidelines and parameters so that it could be uniformly applied by district collectors to assess the eminence of lawyers, the judges said, adding: “Care should be taken about integrity and ethical standards of the lawyer as well, which is more important in matters of such crimes to ensure that the advocate is otherwise not influenced either way while conducting the trial.

“Though the online system is in place, touts are taking the call in many of the offices because the officers keep the touts to indirectly take bribe from applicants. Having no other option, the applicant also shell out their hard earned money to get the work done at the earliest.

It should be in place so that the people can meet them conveniently,” he said. The collector has assured to look into the matter.

212,['29/02/2020'],Chennai: MTC reduces frequencies of AC buses during weekends,"This story is from February 29, 2020

The frequency cut on Sundays will mostly affect buses on routes 102, 570, 21G and 91

CHENNAI: The Metropolitan Transport Corporation has reduced frequencies of new air-conditioned buses during weekends.

Nearly 29 out of the 48 new AC buses will not be operated on Sundays so that that they can serviced at depots as a part of weekly maintenance drives. The other 19 buses will not run on Saturdays.

This includes buses operated along routes 102 (Kelambakkam-Broadway), 570 (Kelambakkam-Koyambedu), 21G (Tambaram-Brodway) and 91 (Thiruvanmiyur-Tambaram).

Orders were issued to all depot managers regarding this on February 20. TOI has a copy of the order that came into effect from February 22.

A senior MTC official clarified that that there were no intentions to cut down frequencies but maintenance works were unavoidable.

“Weekends will be the best time to service the buses as crowd is less compared to regular working days,” the official said.

The 48 buses had hit city roads in January this year. Ticket cost on these buses is higher compared to regular MTC buses.

Passengers are charged Rs 15 to Rs 60 per head for travelling in AC buses. On an average, an AC bus collects Rs 14,000 per day, according to official data.

Besides cost, confusion over bus colours has deterred many from opting for AC buses, said G Venkatraman, a resident of Tambaram.

While all new buses were painted red, grey colour was chosen for AC buses.

213,['29/02/2020'],Fund woes hit rare disease patients,"This story is from February 29, 2020

Participants perform at a rare disease awareness program held at Indira Priyadarshini auditorium on Friday

HYDERABAD: The draft of the National Policy for Rare Diseases introduced by the Union government on January 13, this year, was much debated in medical circles due to the suggestion of using crowdfunding as a method of addressing funding issues. Even as the world observes World Rare Disease Day, several patient groups and experts say that the Centre’s suggestion is hardly a solution, given the huge cost of medicines and support infrastructure involved.

“It is like saying if you have a problem, beg for it and solve it yourself. Crowdfunding is a wrong premise for a policy, especially for funding. The fact is that as it is entirely dependent on people’s individual mood to donate, it is not a sustainable model,” said Syed Sanaullah, management committee member, Indian Organization of Rare Diseases (IORD) adding that the government must earmark a basic fund to start with.

While access to orphan drugs (drugs used for treatment of rare diseases) is difficult due to unavailability, as per IORD, of over 450 U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved orphan drugs, only a handful are available in India. Additionally, the prohibitive cost means less availability.

“In such a scenario, delay by even a few hours when a drug is needed can mean loss of life. It seems like the government is washing its hands off by suggesting crowdfunding,” said Karimulla Shaik, who lost a child to Spinal muscular atrophy.

Listing voluntary crowdfunding as an option, the draft policy document stated, “Keeping in view the resource constraint and competing health priorities, it will be difficult for the government to fully finance treatment of high cost rare diseases.”

The policy document elaborated that the notified hospitals will share information relating to the patients and the diseases they are suffering from, prognosis, estimated cost of treatment and details of bank accounts for donation/ contribution through online system. This will allow donors to view the details of patients and donate funds to a particular hospital.

Experts, meanwhile suggest that having a dedicated corpus fund can be the way forward. “It would be helpful if the Central and state governments could set-up a MediFund with seedfunding. Various companies and NGOs could organize fund-raising events to add to this MediFund. Every rupee raised through donation must be matched by three rupees by the government,” said Nidhi Swarup, who is launching a patients support group for Crohn’s diseases in Hyderabad and a few other cities, and runs a group in Singapore. They also suggested that tax-incentives can be provided to individual and corporate donors.

The accused trio in police custody

VADODARA: Bapod police arrested three persons who tried to extort money from a truck driver on national highway late on Thursday. The trio introduced themselves as members of International Human Rights Organization (IHRO) and even produced identity cards.

According to the police, complainant Sakeer Sindhi said that the accused identified as Ankit Rana, Ashraf Haji and Manish Koshti , all residents of Ahmedabad, stopped his truck and started probing what goods he was ferrying. Sindhi told them that he was transporting goats to Mumbai. One of the accused suddenly slapped Sindhi, followed by the other two too. They then demanded Rs 10,000 from Sindhi and in an attempt to put pressure on him, even placed a call to the police control room.

“We questioned the trio and even checked their identity cards of IHRO. We even called the helpline of the organization and it was confirmed that the identity cards were genuine. They had joined the organization just one-and-half months ago,” said V P Chauhan, police inspector, Bapod.

“The accused were trying to extort money from Sindhi. We have arrested them and will soon write to the organization to cancel their identity cards,” Chauhan added.

The cops are also investigating if the trio had extorted money with similar modus operandi from any other person in the past.

Representative image

MADURAI: The Tamil names of class X and XII students at many of the city schools, both government and private, who are writing their board exams next month, are getting misspelt on their hall tickets . While there is a provision to get it corrected, the issue has inconvenienced teachers and parents.

Nowadays the candidates’ names appear in both English and Tamil on hall tickets and mark sheets. The school is responsible for providing hall tickets, which are downloaded by uploading the students’ information online. “We had many cases where Tamil names were getting misspelt. Even when we type correctly, due to some technical error, the font end up changing at different spots thereby leading to a misspelt name. Sometimes, we also had the candidates’ date of birth going wrong,” said the principal of a private school. Several students and parents said they had to repeatedly ask to make corrections.

“Hall tickets for class XII students were first printed early because of practical examinations. We found that many students had misspelt names at that time and corrected them temporarily with red ink. However, later in the final nominal roll, all corrections were made and it was resolved. But, it was definitely a troublesome work,” said a teacher at a corporation school. Schools also said they were being blamed for an issue that is not in their control. “Parents think we are the ones making the mistake and many of them get easily annoyed. The students are inconvenienced when they have to repeatedly check such basic things,” added the teacher.

Meanwhile, education officials maintained that it was a matter for the heads of schools to handle and they had no part in it. “Even if it is an issue now, there is ample time to correct and processes are in place to ensure least disturbance. What matters is what appears on the final mark sheets. Till then, there is plenty of scope for making corrections,” said a senior district education official.

Students perform at Vignan cultural fest in Guntur on Friday

Guntur: Putting students on high alert, AP State Council for Higher Education (APSCHE) vice-chairman Dr K Rammohan Rao said it wouldn’t be too long until people faced competition from robots in the job market. He called upon students to go out of the box and come up with new ideas to stay in the race. He said routine studies and scoring well in the subjects alone would not help in the future after the development of artificial intelligence. Dr Rao was addressing an annual sports and culture festival at Vignan Nirula Women’s Engineering College on Friday.

The college campus at Palakalur village on the outskirts of the city teemed with over 5,000 girl students from different engineering colleges and universities across the state. Speaking on the occasion, Dr Rao said that more than 30 million robots would be working in different industries in the next five years. “Competition might get bigger and tough with the arrival of robots in a massive scale. You will be required to work overtime to outsmart robots and grab lucrative jobs,” cautioned Dr Rao. He advised the students to learn at least a few foreign languages right at the degree level in order to get jobs in the future. He said expertise in big data, ethical hacking, networking and data science would be a must in the next few years.

Vignan Group chairman Dr Lavu Rathaiah, however, said that only team work would pave way for success in future. He asked the students to become social animals to achieve success as no one could achieve success as singles in the coming days. “Don’t always think about big victories. Try to be courageous to face defeat. It will only make you a champion,” said Dr Rathaiah.

Later in the evening, film crew of Ore Bujjiga including hero Raj Tharun, music director Anoop Rubens and singer Meghana interacted with the students on campus.

Dehradun: BCCI vice-president Mahim Verma filed his nomination for the election of the secretary post in Cricket Association of Uttarakhand (CAU) on Thursday. Interestingly, Verma resigned as the secretary of CAU in October 2019 as he got elected unopposed as the vice president of BCCI in the same month. Verma has served as the CAU secretary for around two months as he was elected unopposed in August 2019.

“I have filed my nomination for the post of the CAU secretary and will contest the election with my full dedication. I decided to contest the election as I can see that the development of the sport is not taking place by my standards in Uttarakhand. Therefore, I believe that it is important for me to return back as CAU secretary in order to speed up the development process here,” he said.

Verma asserted that if he wins the election, he will resign from the post of BCCI vice-president. “According to Lodha reforms, a person cannot hold two posts. So, I will resign from the post of BCCI vice-president if I win the election as CAU is my priority,” said Verma.

Notably, the final list of the candidates will be declared on February 29 but as per the tentative list, six candidates are contesting for the post —Mahim Verma, Deepak Mehra, Kumar Thapa, Sanjay Gusain, Rajeev Jindal, and Siddharth Bisht.

The nomination of Verma has sparked a speculation that CAU has got divided into factions. However, the members of the cricketing body are dismissing such speculations and stress that the unity of the association is intact.

To recall, it was after years of struggle that CAU had received recognition from BCCI in August 2019.

Vadodara: Florists who were operating since decades opposite the Nyay Mandir are up in arms against the civic body after they were asked to leave the place ahead of the inauguration of the renovated Sursagar pond. The florists are not being allowed to return to the place from where they operated.

The Nyay Mandir had become a go to destination for many looking for flowers, garlands and bouquets. While the florists here did not keep exotic varieties of flowers, they were very popular for the local varieties of flowers like marigold, roses, jasmine, magnolia, lotus and others.

Florists held protests at Nyay Mandir stating that ahead of the inauguration of Sursagar they were asked to leave temporarily for security reasons and to avoid congestion in the area. They alleged that even after the inauguration, they were not being allowed to return.

It seems that the florists were caught unawares of a notification brought out by the civic body ahead of the Sursagar inauguration. The notification had barred street vending in the periphery of Sursagar as well as around Nyay Mandir.

The florists said that they had been permitted by the VMC and were also paying rent to the civic body. The florists had even gone to make representations to VMC officials on Thursday night, but did not get proper response. They have also met the mayor seeking permission to set up shops again.

Tiruvarur: A two-day synchronized annual bird census began at three bird sanctuaries in Tiruvarur and Ariyalur districts on Friday to survey migratory and resident birds in this region.

Jointly conducted by the forest department and the Biodiversity Conservation Foundation (BCF) in Trichy, a 30-member team surveyed Muthupet Lagoon (mangrove forest ecosystem), Vaduvur and Uthayamarthadapuram bird sanctuaries in Tiruvarur on Friday.

The study, on the migratory pattern and nesting behaviour, is part of assessing the status of the bird sanctuaries. “There was a slight decline in arrival of birds last year following Gaja cyclone. However, the direct impact of the cyclone can be ascertained only this year based on migratory pattern of the bird species,” said S Ramasubramanian, conservator of forest, Thanjavur circle.

“Teams from Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT), Periyar EVR College and ornithologists from across state are taking part in the census,” said conservation scientist A Kumaraguru, founder director of BCF, who gave orientation to the team on the census.

Kumaraguru said that the migratory season starts from January when migratory birds start moving from Rann of Kutch in Gujarat and arrive in central regions.

“A total of 114 bird species were recorded last year. This was slightly less than the previous year when 138 species were recorded in these sanctuaries,” Tiruvarur district forest officer K Arivoli said.

“The population of spoon bill, painted stork, pelicans and greater flamingo have fallen significantly post Gaja cyclone in the sanctuary,” he said.

In the bird census at Karaivetti bird sanctuary in Ariyalur, 30 students from the zoology and biology streams of arts and science colleges in the district took part. Karaivetti is one of the biggest freshwater bird sanctuaries in the state with over 20,000 migratory and resident birds.

As a part of the annual exercise to encourage students in exploring ornithology, the study of birds, Ariyalur forest department conducts the enumeration of migratory and resident birds in the sanctuary. “The enumeration programme will go on till 7pm on Saturday. With the support of ornithologists, data gathered will be analysed to study the diversity of the sanctuary,” a forest department official said.

Dehradun: With just a month left before the 2019-20 financial year ends, Dehradun Municipal Corporation ( DMC ) might not be able to meet its house tax target of Rs 50 crore. The civic body said it that it is 20% short of its target, having been able to collect Rs 40 crore tax till date. It attributed the shortage to government offices failing to pay their property taxes.

Notably, 86 government offices were newly incorporated in the list of property tax payers in the financial year 2019-20. The defaulters in this category include Mussoorie Dehradun Development Authority, Uttarakhand Housing and Urban Development Authority, Uttarahand Waqf Board, Madarsa Doon Urdu Academy, Uttarakhand State Biodiversity Board, Uttarakhand Jal Sansthan, Uttarakhand Skill Development Mission, and Uttarakhand Transport Corporation among others.

“When we served them the notice, the authorities expressed inability to submit property tax, stating that their departmental budget had no provision for payment of property tax. Some of them have promised to pursue the matter in the next financial year and make adequate arrangements to clear the liability,” DMC Commissioner Vinay Shankar Pandey told TOI.

Meanwhile, DMC officials said that they had already exceeded their last year's property tax target of Rs 25 crore. On plans to boost tax collection for the upcoming financial year, authorities said that individual owners and commercial property owners will remain the focus. “We are providing a tax rebate to encourage self-submission of house tax,” said Dharmesh Penuli, Revenue and Tax Superintendent, DMC.

Penuli added that the exact property tax expected from all the 89 government offices is being calculated. However, estimates point the figure to be around Rs 8 crore for the financial year 2019-20.

Officials stated that the house tax collected will be kept aside as “Nagar Nigam Fund” and will be dedicated for the maintenance of city infrastructure and provide for creation of new building pathways, cleaning of drains and other developmental work.

The stretch where tree saplings were removed to make way for a concrete road in Chengalpet

CHENNAI: More than 60,000 tree saplings planted at an open space reserve in Mahindra World City, Chengalpet, were uprooted to lay roads for an upcoming community hall .

A section of local residents have moved the Madras high court alleging that the location chosen for the hall, currently surrounded by industries, was too far from their houses.

Mahindra World City Limited (MWCL), an industrial park located 27 km from Tambaram, in 2012, gifted 76 acres (10% of total land extent) to Anjur village panchayat, as mandated by law.

In 2018, 1.7 lakh tree saplings were planted in the 10% reserve land by MWCL with the help of various NGOs.

In 2019, Kancheepuram district collector P Ponniah (before bifurcation of Chengalpet district) ordered construction of a community hall and access roads at the site named 'Greenery-40', which is a part of the reserve land, at a cost of Rs 72 lakh, according to official documents.

Recently, all saplings at the site were uprooted and the government began laying roads.

Local residents lodged a complaint with the collector along with photographic evidence and later moved the HC.

Petitioner V Rajendran questioned the need to choose a distant site when the local body had already passed a resolution earlier to construct a community hall at a site near their houses.

VT Leemarose, local block development officer, denied all these allegations while speaking to TOI. She, however, informed the court that the local body had no role in choosing the site for community hall.

The actual reason to lay this road was to connect a newly-opened private CBSE school to the main road, the petitioner said. This was done to ensure school vans did not have to take a detour to reach the school, Vikas Mantra Public School, run by the son of an AIADMK MP, a source said.

When TOI visited the spot, it was evident that the road was laid till the school's compound wall and didn't end at the site proposed for community hall. This site was located clearly 150m-200m before the school.

Civic activist SP Thiyagarajan said that no construction should actually happen at OSR lands but government should first clarify whether such halls were exempted from the rule.

Sattar Vohra and Pravin Chunara (R) both of their houses were left completely charred

VADODARA/ANAND: For three consecutive days last week, Anand’s coastal town Khambhat remained on the boil. But in Akbarpura locality, at the epicentre of communal riots in town, these septuagenarians did not let smiles on their face wane despite rioters leaving their houses completely charred.

The decades-old friendship between Sattar Vohra and Pravin Chunara, both in their mid-70s, has remained rock solid despite frequent flare-ups in this sensitive locality.

They have been neighbours since childhood and the rioters set ablaze both their houses. But every riot has only strengthened their bond. Vohra and Chunara blame social media for frequent flare-ups in this sensitive area.

The duo has their residence in Akbarpura area of Khambhat where just a petty argument between kids of Muslims and Chunaras playing on the streets have often snowballed into full-fledged riots that leave several including cops injured.

The recent flare-up which Akbarpura witnessed between members of the two communities was the first time that both Sattar and Pravin lost the only roof they had. But they are helping each other, gathering whatever is left from the charred metal sheets that once provided them shelter.

“As kids we have played ‘kancha’ (marbles) together, shared biscuits from the same packet and snacks that we used to take to school. We have been friends since we were kids and nothing has shaken our bond,” said Pravin, who stays with his nephew at a house just 300 metres away Sattar’s.

Pravin has lost all his documents including ration card, identity cards like election card, aadhar card, clothes, shawls which the rioters set on fire along with the small house where he stayed.

Like him, Sattar too has nothing much left except smoke-blackened tin sheets from the ‘kutcha’ house that the rioters set ablaze.

“It must be a loss of nearly Rs 4 lakh. I had gathered some cash which I was supposed to return for the two buffaloes that I had purchased. But even that has turned into ash,” said Sattar. The cattle was his only source of income.

CHENNAI: Chennai Corporation will finalise the design consultants for the first phase of the mega streets project by March-end, after which they will be expected to create a plan for pilot project.According to civic officials, sixteen consultants from across the country have applied to be part of the project; six will be selected. Each will be allotted a neighbourhood in the first phase, which is divided into six packages.The selected consultants will study a total of 110 kms of arterial and sub arterial roads in six neighbourhoods -- Anna Nagar, Tondiarpet, Nungambakkam, Mylapore , Velachery and Adyar — and come up with a holistic plan.“Each neighbourhood has a different characteristic and that is why we are opting for a different consultant for each neighbourhood, instead of one for the whole phase,” an official with the city corporation said.The design will also have to account for utilities underground as much as those above ground to ensure that no road cut is done for the next 30 years.The project, which was announced earlier this month, was given a fillip in the Tamil Nadu budget, which provided Rs750 crore for the Integrated Urban Development Mission (IUDM) and Rs500 crore for Chennai Mega City Development.Chennai became the first city in the country to adopt a non-motorised transport policy in 2014, prioritising its pedestrians. The city’s first pedestrian plaza in Pondy Bazaar inaugurated three months ago is an example that we back up our vision, said a senior engineer with the civic body.Why does the city need a mega streets programme though? Researchers at the Institute of Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP), think-tank partners of the city corporation for the project, point out that our city roads push the vulnerable road users -- pedestrians, cyclists, differently abled — to the fringes, resulting in loss of lives.In 2017, 3,507 pedestrians were killed in Tamil Nadu, the highest in the country followed by Maharashtra (1,831) and Andhra Pradesh (1,379).“Unsafe roads also lead to inactive lifestyles. If we look at cities across the world, they are envisioning a system for greener and healthier cities,” said Aswathy Dilip, senior programme manager at The Institute for Transportation and Development Policy.Singapore has prepared a land transport master plan, envisioning safer, healthier roads with vibrant community spaces, which it aims to achieve by 2040. London has an action-plan to encourage walking and wants to become the most walkable city in the world, Ashwathy said.“If we look at Singapore, there are covered walkways and benches for pedestrians to rest. Similar practices can be adopted here,” Ashwathy said.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74413274,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-468462,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/corpn-to-pick-six-design-consultants-by-march-end-for-mega-streets-project/articleshow/74409373.cms

228,['29/02/2020'],Govt removes MGNREGA social society director,"This story is from February 29, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: Armed with a high court order that refused to grant immunity to government officials from cancellation of deputation service, the state government on Thursday removed MGNREGA social audit society director Abey George from the post.

A government order issued late on Thursday night also pronounced the appointment of new director, E Sreekumar, social development specialist, with effect from February 28.

The government had in December issued orders for the removal of George. But the same was challenged by the official who alleged political reasons behind the premature termination of his service as the society director. The court had then stayed the termination order. The petitioner was appointed as the society director after a rigorous selection process in December 2017 for a period of three years. The fresh order for his removal was issued after the government completed the necessary formalities, which it bunked initially in its hurry to dump the official at the earliest.

It was alleged that many in the government were not much appreciative of the fastidious nature of George in conducting the affairs of the social audit society. Inspection in various panchayats had revealed that several works under MGNREA were not in sync with the guidelines.

His refusal to go by political whims in the appointment of district and village-level resource persons, say sources, prompted the government to terminate prematurely his service in the society.

The latest HC order on February 18 gave the government freehand to decide on cancellation of the deputation service of the official.

TRICHY: The special court for prevention of corruption act (PCA) cases in Trichy on Friday convicted a woman multipurpose health worker of taking a bribe of Rs 300 from a pregnant woman for issuing her the government’s maternity assistance.

The judge handed out simple imprisonment for one and two years to T Kalaiselvi, 39, of Ponnagar for accepting gratification and criminal misconduct respectively. The judge also ordered her to pay Rs 1,000 each as fine for the two offences. The judge however released the woman on bail considering the quantum of punishment, which is below three years.

It was a 12-year-old case that came to an end on Friday. Kalaiselvi was a multipurpose health worker at the urban primary health centre (UPHC) in Periya Milaguparai. S Elizabeth Rani, 28, a pregnant woman from Edamalaipattipudhur, enlisted her help for getting financial assistance of Rs 6,000 under the Dr Muthulakshmi Reddy maternity assistance scheme, and got the first instalment of Rs 3000 before her delivery.

After the child was born, Kalaiselvi waited for the second instalment of Rs 3,000. However, instead of giving the cheque addressed to Elizabeth Rani, she demanded Rs 300 as bribe to hand it over. Unwilling to bribe her, the woman lodged a complaint with the directorate of vigilance and anti-corruption (DVAC) in Trichy on May 27, 2008. The team laid a trap the next day and caught Kalaiselvi red-handed at the PHC when she was accepting the money from Elizhabeth Rani.

231,['29/02/2020'],KFRI helpline becomes answer to creative kids,"This story is from February 29, 2020

THRISSUR: A helpline started by Kerala Forest Research Institute (KFRI) at Peechi in Thrissur district around a year ago has helped children in clearing doubts on a varied number of topics.

It was on February 28, 2019 that KFRI launched ‘First Question’, a project that offers children an opportunity to ask any environment-related questions through the phone. The helpline has received more than 3,000 questions from children across the country in its first year.

The kids can call the helpline (0487-2690222) from 9.30am to 5.30 pm on Monday to Friday. The members of the project will attend to the calls from children. The questions will be answered in English, Hindi, Malayalam, Telugu and Kannada languages.

“Once a call is received, we first collect basic information such as name and location of the children and then record the question. The question is then passed over to an analysis team which prepares the answer by referring a subject expert and the kid is called back and given the answer,” said prof T V Sajeev, principal scientist, KFRI.

“There are two reasons to start the helpline. The first is that very young kids even before they start going to school ask a lot of questions which are seldom taken seriously by adults. We know that unless these questions are taken seriously and scientifically answered, that would lead to their first disconnect with the process of learning,” Sajeev said.

“The kids also raise some interesting questions like what is the actual colour of a chameleon and which came first, the chicken or the egg. At many times, teachers will not have answers to these unique questions. The helpline will give answers to all these questions and also nurture the habit of asking questions on children,” he said.

“A 15-year-old boy Abhay Singh used to regularly call the helpline and ask questions. Through regular calls we tracked the kid. He was suffering from some illness and was continuing studies from home. Last month, since we didn't receive any call from him, we contacted the number. The boy's father attended the call and said he died 17 days ago. It was a big shock for us. Abhay Singh had urged us to start the helpline in all states,"" Sajeev said.

Entry of tourists to the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary (WWS) has been temporarily banned from March 1 to April 15

KOZHIKODE: Entry of tourists to the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary ( WWS ) has been temporarily banned from March 1 to April 15 in view of the intensifying summer and the possibility of forest fires in the 344 sq km sanctuary.

The state wildlife warden has issued an order temporarily banning the entry of tourists in the eco-tourism centres of Muthanga and Tholpetty in the sanctuary which is the prime tiger habitat in the state under Section 33 of the Wildlife Protection Act 1972.

Forest officials said that with mercury rising, large number of wild animals from the contiguous forest areas in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka have started trooping to the WWS in search of water and fodder in the largest annual inter-state animal migration in the region. “Also there is a threat of forest fires in the sanctuary due to the summer heat. If tourists are allowed entry in ecotourism zones, it would pose disturbance to wild animals,” WWS warden P K Asif said.

He added that tourist activity inside WWS during the summer months, when wildlife population swells in the sanctuary significantly, could also pose threat to the safety of tourists.

KOLKATA: Waiting in serpentine queues at blood banks will soon be a thing of the past as the system is set to go online, with the state health department planning to introduce e-requisition of blood.An orientation training on e-requisition software was held for representatives of all the 73 state-run blood banks at Swasthya Bhawan on Friday.Under the existing system, when patients require blood, their families have to stand in queues at hospital banks with requisition slips and blood samples. If the required units are not available in the hospital bank, they have to run from one facility to another. But once the system goes online, the application will go straight from the hospital’s ward to the hospital blood bank. If the unit is not available there, the application will be sent to other banks, like the Central Blood Bank at Maniktala.“Once the online requisition system starts, it will not only spare patients’ families the harassment but also rationalise blood supply,” said a blood safety official at Swasthya Bhawan. For example, if a patient needs 4 units of blood, the hospital bank can directly ask with the ward whether two units were enough for the moment and the remaining two could be sent later. This would prevent wastage of blood. Once the software is in place, an alert will be sent to the registered mobile number of the patients’ families about the availability of blood units.The first phase of training on how to use the software on e-requisition and e-tendering of blood at the state’s health headquarters was attended by doctors and technicians. To be implemented in phases, the pilot project is about take off at Calcutta National Medical College (CNMC). “The ground work is prepared to run the pilot project. This is a great, patient-centric initiative,” said Sandip Ghosh, medical superintendent and vice-principal at CNMCH. Once the pilot project takes off, the health department plans to implement it in Kolkata hospitals and expand it to facilities in the district. Later, it will be taken to private nursing homes and private blood banks. “We will check for glitches at CNMC and rectify them before going all out,” said a senior health official.D Asish, an activist, said, “Online requisition will also eliminate blood racket. But more blood donation camps have to be held.”",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74410196,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-584122,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/no-more-queues-blood-requisition-set-to-go-online/articleshow/74408777.cms

CHENNAI: Madras high court on Friday directed a city civil court here to dispose of in two weeks, a plea moved by music maestro Ilayaraja seeking to restrain owners of Prasad Studio from interfering in his peaceful access to the studio for music composition.

Justice V Bharathidasan passed the order as the music composer and the studio owners failed to reach an amicable solution through mediation as suggested by the court.

Ilayaraja has been composing music at a recording theatre on the Prasad Studio campus for more than four decades and wants to continue to do so, whereas the studio management has sought to vacate him from its premises in Saligramam .

Aggrieved, Ilayaraja moved a city civil court seeking to restrain the owners of the studio or their agents from interfering in his free access to the composing room in the studio, which he was using for the past 40 years.

Subsequently, citing unreasonable delay by the civil court in disposing of the plea, Ilayaraja moved the present plea in the high court.

On December 4, Justice Bharathidasan directed the parties to appear before the mediation centre on the high court premises and try for an amicable solution to the dispute.

When the plea came up for hearing on Friday, Maestro’s counsel A Saravanan submitted he suggested to settle the dispute amicably if he was granted free access to the studio for two to three months to complete his ongoing works.

“Since the owners of the studio refused to provide the limited access, we could not arrive at an amicable solution,” Saravanan added.

Wondering why the management of the studio was not willing to accept the reasonable deal even though composing room was used by Maestro for over 40 years, the court directed the XV Assistant Judge, Chennai to dispose of the injunction plea moved by Ilayaraja in two weeks.

KOCHI: Alappuzha , Kozhikode and Kannur are on alert for high temperatures of more than 2-3 degrees above normal on Saturday. Following this, the Kerala state disaster management authority (KSDMA) issued warning to the public to protect themselves from direct exposure to sun during the peak hours of 11am to 3pm.

Meanwhile, temperatures fell in some places due to showers. The state has received some light showers during the last 24 hours. While Karipur received 2mm rain, Kochi reported 4mm rain on Friday. Kudulu (Kasaragod district) reported a rainfall of 1.2mm but the state remains 58%deficient. Skymet weather said March which is looked on as a pre-monsoon month is likely to bring some rain to the state.

At present, temperatures have already grown more than 35°C on multiple occasions throughout the state, which is a little above normal. The rising temperatures are indicative of early arrival of pre-monsoon.

It predicted light to moderate showers for the next three to four days. These rains will be widely spread throughout the state while being concentrated towards the North. Places like Kozhikode, Kannur etc., are likely to receive these rains. The reason for rain will be a feeble trough extending from the southern end of Kerala to Karnataka.

Interestingly, America’s weather company AccuWeather in its annual forecast said that central and southern India are predicted to warm up much faster than average this year. Heat waves will be more frequent across these areas due to limited soil moisture to begin with. “There is even the chance the southwest monsoon can reach Kerala toward the end of May, which would be sooner than in 2019,” AccuWeather lead international meteorologist Jason Nicholls said in a statement.

Following this, the Kerala state disaster management authority (KSDMA) issued warning to the public to protect themselves from direct exposure to sun during the peak hours of 11am to 3pm.

Meanwhile, temperatures fell in some places due to showers. The state has received some light showers during the last 24 hours. While Karipur received 2mm rain, Kochi reported 4mm rain on Friday. Kudulu (Kasaragod district) reported a rainfall of 1.2mm but the state remains 58%deficient. Skymet weather said March which is looked on as a pre-monsoon month is likely to bring some rain to the state.

At present, temperatures have already grown more than 35°C on multiple occasions throughout the state, which is a little above normal. The rising temperatures are indicative of early arrival of pre-monsoon.

It predicted light to moderate showers for the next three to four days. These rains will be widely spread throughout the state while being concentrated towards the North. Places like Kozhikode, Kannur etc., are likely to receive these rains. The reason for rain will be a feeble trough extending from the southern end of Kerala to Karnataka.

Interestingly, America’s weather company AccuWeather in its annual forecast said that central and southern India are predicted to warm up much faster than average this year. Heat waves will be more frequent across these areas due to limited soil moisture to begin with. “There is even the chance the southwest monsoon can reach Kerala toward the end of May, which would be sooner than in 2019,” AccuWeather lead international meteorologist Jason Nicholls said in a statement.

Exhibition titled ‘Trans-disciplinary facets of Archaelogy’ got under way at Mahatma Jyotiba Phule campus, on ... Read More

Nagpur: To celebrate the rich heritage of India, the postgraduate department of ancient Indian history, culture and archaeology organized a two-day exhibition — ‘Trans-disciplinary facets of Archaeology’.

Inaugurated by Nagpur University vice chancellor SV Kane on the Mahatma Jyotiba Phule campus on Thursday, the first day

saw students of indology preparing a Vedic thali with recipes based on the ancient diet system.

Nearly 4,000-year-old pre-historic stone tools retrieved through excavation by university students were displayed at the exhibition.

Black on red ware from the Harappan site of Bhirdana, Jorwe culture pottery and painted grey ware from Sinauli were the fascinating artefacts that caught many an eye.

The exhibition also featured replicas of sculptures of Durga from the 10th century and Vishnu’s head from the 11th century made of Plaster of Paris. On display were megalithic iron implements and semi-precious stones like jasper, carnelian and crystal.

Photos of human vandalism at heritage sites and smuggling and its antiquarian laws were pinned on the wall to make the visitors familiar with the rules and regulations surrounding archaeology and historical artefacts.

Visitors got an opportunity to get an understanding of the origin and evolution of the Stupa architecture and Indian temple architecture.

The highlight of the exhibition was the smallest sarcophagus of child burial with human skeletons excavated from Dhamna-linga, Nagpur. The only horse remains ever found from a burial in Ubali was also laid out.

Second year MA students Bipin Bansod and Pawan Harde designed simplified models to show water harvesting mechanism in the Mauryan period.

Professor and head of the department, Preety Trivedi, said, “The exhibition was organized with a view to familiarize people with the interdisciplinary facets of archaeology that comprise not just excavation and exploration. By bridging the gap between archaeology and molecular biology, we have been able to solve many historical riddles and we wish to communicate the same.”

244,['29/02/2020'],Capital area tense as YSRC takes out rally backing 1-cent project,"This story is from February 29, 2020

Amaravati: Tension ran high in the capital area villages of Krishnayapalem, Venkatapalem, Thullur and Velagapudi on Friday when YSRC activists, including several women, took out a rally in support of distribution of house sites to the poor. Raising slogans backing the government’s decision, they said those opposing the move were anti-poor.

They also demanded the arrest of those involved in the attack on Bapatla MP Nandigam Suresh. Suresh is a resident of the capital city area and has every right to go there whenever he wants, they said, and asked TDP to shed its upper caste and arrogant attitude and refrain from orchestrating attacks on local leaders.

“We are also from the capital city area and strongly defend the decision of the state government to grant house sites to the poor from other areas like Krishna and Guntur districts in the capital region. It will make it a more inclusive city. Landlords backed by the TDP are behind the litigations against the grant of house sites. The TDP wants only one community to have its hold on the capital city area,” alleged YSRC activist P Sambaiah. Tension prevailed for some time when the rally passed the dharna camps of pro-Amaravati farmers, with both groups shouting slogans in favour of their demands. While local farmers shouted ‘Jai Amaravati’ slogans, YSRC activists raised ‘Jai Jagan’ and ‘Jai Nandigam Suresh’ slogans. The farmers, who have been protesting for over 70 days now, said it’s unfortunate that the government is deliberately encouraging Dalits to take out counter rallies to precipitate the issue.

As a precautionary measure, additional police force were deployed in the area which ensured that the rally passed off peacefully without any untoward incidents.

Meanwhile, the Amaravati JAC has dismissed talks about gheraoing the residence of actor and former Union minister Chiranjeevi as “baseless rumours”. JAC leader Gadde Tirupati Rao said they have no plans to agitate outside Chiranjeevi’s residence as he has been away from active politics for many years now.

“Some vested interests are spreading such false information to dilute the movement as Jana Sena chief Pawan Kalyan is supporting our agitation,” Rao said.

245,['29/02/2020'],Coronavirus proves a body blow for inbound tourism in Tamil Nadu,"Passenger arriving at Chennai airport wearing mask

With hundreds of international tourists who had booked a trip to Tamil Nadu in March forced to put off their plans, the Coronavirus (COVID-19 ) outbreak has thrown the tourism sector into a crisis.While some foreign travellers could not make their trips to India due to travel restrictions from coronavirus-hit countries, many are cancelling their tour programmes due to fear surrounding the virus outbreak.At least 3,000 tourists who were scheduled to visit Tamil Nadu and Kerala, kickstarting their India tour from Chennai, have called off their plans, said K Pandian, state chief of Indian Association of Tour Operators.""There were six groups of Italian tourists each consisting of 25-27 individuals and two Japanese groups. Coronavirus has proved a disaster for the tourism sector… and has led to largescale cancellations not seen in the last two decades,"" he said. Several tour operators and hoteliers are suffering monetary losses, he added.Due to the virus spreading across the world, the Union government had announced that people travelling from Korea, Iran and Italy or having a travel history to these countries since February 10 may be quarantined for 14 days on arrival in India. ""Not just travel restrictions, many do not want to venture out of their country out of fear over contracting the disease,"" Pandian said.Tamil Nadu has received the highest number of inbound tourists in the country consecutively for the last four years. The peak season for foreign travellers is between October and March. Approved Tour Guides Association president P Asoka said that approximately 20,000 inbound tourists would have booked their trips for March. ""Most of these travellers are from European countries including France, Italy and UK, besides North America. The numbers are dipping because of Coronavirus, a havoc for the tourism sector,"" he said.Another tour guides association official said that 50 % of their booking have seen cancellations. Secretary of Tourist Guides’ Federation of South India, Charles M, said that the tourist groups that are handled by members of their association are associated with more than 10 tour operators specialising in inbound tourism. ""In some cases, hardly a few individuals are part of group tours. There is also an impact on free independent travellers from abroad,"" he said.For tour operators, the virus that emerged out of the blue is proving to be a double-whammy as thousands of Indians have put off their foreign trips for the upcoming summer vacation. Southeast Asian countries are the worst hit for the tourism industry, while European countries are putting up travel restrictions, he said. City-based tour operator Sriharan Balan said several travellers from Tamil Nadu think flying out of India is a health risk. ""We were pinning our hope on European countries.

Representative image

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: In the wake of repeated incidents of children going missing in the state, the state human rights commission ( SHRC ) has asked the state police to explore the possibilities of setting up a special cell to keep all the suspected people involved in such cases under watch.

Commission chairperson Justice Antony Dominic asked state police chief Loknath Behera to submit a report in this regard before the commission in four weeks. The SHRC chairperson observed that in 2017, 100 children were kidnapped, while it rose to 205 in 2018. In 2019, this figure further increased to 267. As many as 578 children have been kidnapped from the state since May 2016 till the end of 2019.

He said that while the child, Devananda , went missing, everyone suspected the role of nomads and migrant workers and traders. There are complaints that thousands of such people come and leave the state every day and there are no records of such people with the police. When children go missing, such people are the usual suspects.

“If a special cell under an officer of the rank of an SP is created, the tendency of even the innocent nomads and migrant traders being suspiciously watched can be allayed to an extent. The cell should maintain the records of such nomads or migrant traders whenever they come to state and an identity card also should be issued to them by the police. In addition, all the cameras installed by the police should be functional, as the feeds from the cameras help in such cases,” Justice Dominic said.

The police had in 2017 given special instruction to all the schools to set up school safety committees that will be coordinated at the state-level by an officer of the rank of an ADGP.

The responsibility of supervising the awareness and information regarding safety measures for the children under each police station was handed over to the station house officer concerned and the circle inspector. The schools were also given specific tasks to ensure the safety of children. The class teachers were strictly asked to monitor the students and share all the information regarding the children with their parents. In case a student is missing on a day, the teachers should contact the parents of the child.

Also, the schools have been asked to create groups of three of four children so that those in the groups will be able to monitor each other regarding safety.

Mamata Banerjee

BHUBANESWAR: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Friday expressed anguish at the communal violence that swept parts of New Delhi over the CAA but made it clear she did not support the Congress’ demand for Union home minister Amit Shah’s resignation for his perceived failure to prevent the riots. “The problem should be resolved first. We can discuss politics later,” she said.

Mamata was speaking to the media after attending the meeting of the Eastern Zonal Council here chaired by Shah.

The West Bengal CM urged the Union home minister to ensure that peace is restored in the violence-hit areas of Delhi. “I told him (Shah) that I am upset with what has happened in Delhi. It’s urgent to bring back peace.”

Mamata said the government give adequate compensation to the families of those who died in the violence. “A police constable and an IB official also died. If there is any problem in any part of the country, its repercussion is felt in other parts as well. I urged him (Shah) to take steps so that the situation doesn’t aggravate,” she added.

Mamata said the council meeting did not discuss the CAA. She added, “The issue of CAA or NRC was not on the agenda. The meeting was about development of the four eastern states. Nobody raised the issue.”

251,['29/02/2020'],"Man who drove car, Pulwama bomber held","This story is from February 29, 2020

Shakir Bashir Magrey, 22, a resident of Kakapora in Pulwama, is the first accused to be arrested in the case.

NEW DELHI: In a key breakthrough that will help reconstruct the conspiracy behind the Pulwama terror attack , the National Investigation Agency (NIA) has arrested a Jaish e Mohammad overground worker who not only fitted the IED in Maruti Eeco vehicle used for the attack but also drove it, with suicide bomber Adil Ahmad Dar in the front seat, till 500 metres short of the attack site on February 14, 2019.

Shakir Bashir Magrey, a resident of Kakapora in Pulwama aged just 22, is the first living accused to be arrested in the case. While Adil had died during the suicide attack, other five identified accused were killed subsequently in separate operations by the security forces between March 11, 2019 and January 25, 2020.

The Pulwama attack on February 14, 2019, which left 40 CRPF personnel martyred, was a turning point in India’s counter-terror journey as it led to the first ever cross-border airstrikes by Indian fighter jets on Jaish e Mohammad facilities deep inside Pakistan.

Magrey, owner of a furniture shop not too far from the Pulwama attack site, is an important catch as he will help piece together the events leading up to the suicide strike. His initial interrogation, an NIA officer told TOI, has revealed that he was with Adil Dar on the day of the attack. “This shows the level of trust the conspirators had in him,” said the officer.

As Adil was a shaky driver, it was Magrey who took the wheel of the explosives-laden Maruti Eeco car as they drove to the attack site. It was only 500 meters before the site that Magrey got off, given that only Adil had been chosen by Jaish for the suicide mission. Adil then drove himsef to the attack spot.

Magrey was key link in the Pulwama attack conspiracy. He had harboured Adil Dar and co-accused Pakistani terrorist Mohammad Umar Farooq in his house from late 2018 till the attack in February 2019 and helped them in preparation of the IED. As his shop is located near Lethpora bridge, he, as advised by Umar, conducted reconnaisance of the movement of CRPF convoy on Jammu-Srinagar highway in January 2019, and accordingly briefed Umar and Adil.

Magrey has revealed during his interrogation that ammonium powder, gloves and batteries for the IED used in Pulwama attack was bought from Amazon e-retail site. Ammonium powder has multiple applications, including in fertilisers.

Magrey was introduced to Adil in mid-2018 by Umar Farooq and he became a full-time OGW of JeM. He had collected and delivered arms, ammunition, cash and explosive material to JeM terrorists , including those involved in Pulwama attack, on several occasions.

Magrey was involved in modifying the Maruti Eeco car and fitting the IED in it in early February 2019.

During investigation, the make, model and number of the car used in the attack was ascertained by NIA to be a Maruti Eeco car through forensic examination of its tiny remnants. This has now been corroborated by Magrey.

The explosives used in the attack were determined to be ammonium nitrate, nitro-glycerin and RDX through forensic investigation. Investigation also confirmed the identity of suicide bomber as Adil Ahmad Dar through DNA matching with that of his father. Other key terrorists involved in the attack were found to be Muddasir Ahmad Khan, (JeM’s Divisional Commander of South Kashmir killed in an operation by security forces on 11-03-2019) Pakistani terrorists viz. Muhammad Umar Farooq and IED expert Kamran, (both killed on 29-03-2019) the owner of the car viz. Sajjad Ahmad Bhat r/o Marhama, Anantnag (killed on 16-06-2019) and Qari Yassir, JeM’s Commander for Kashmir (killed on 25-01-2020). NIA believes RDX may have been brought in by Pakistani terrorists.

Magrey was produced before the NIA Special Court at Jammu on Friday and remanded to 15 days of NIA custody.

252,['29/02/2020'],Odisha CM Naveen Patnaik seeks special package for infra development,"This story is from February 29, 2020

Naveen Patnaik

BHUBANESWAR: Chief minister Naveen Patnaik on Friday demanded a special economic package for infrastructure development in the eastern part of the country.

He was speaking at the 24th Eastern Zonal Council meeting held at the state convention centre and chaired by Union home minister Amit Shah. It was also attended by West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee and her Bihar counterpart Nitish Kumar. Jharkhand was represented by its finance minister Rameshwar Oraon

“If a nationwide analysis is done for tele-density, banking density, rail and road density, the east zone would be at the bottom in all these subjects that are on the Union List. There is a need to double the allotments made to this region so that they catch up with the national benchmarks,” Naveen said. He added that as the eastern states like Odisha , Jharkhand and West Bengal contribute the most to the mineral wealth of the country because of the huge coal block reserves, which in turn helps in the energy security of the country, the fruits of this wealth should boost the economic growth of this region and its people.

He reiterated the demand for the revision of coal royalty, which was last revised in April 2012. “There is an urgent need to revise royalty on coal and to share the proceeds of clean energy cess with the state governments,” the chief minister said.

The royalty on coal is 14% at present. Though there is a provision to revise it every three years, it has not been done in the past eight years. The Odisha government has long been calling for an increase in the coal royalty to 20%.

The demand, which was also raised by other coal-bearing states like West Bengal and Jharkhand, is reportedly not being considered by the Centre as revision of coal royalty is directly linked to power tariff.

The state government has been demanding a 60% share in the national clean energy cess (collected from coal mining) for the coal-bearing states to deal with negative externalities.

Expressing gratitude to the Centre for extending help during Cyclone Fani that devastated the state in May last year, Naveen reiterated the demand to consider vulnerability to natural calamity as a criteria to declare Odisha as a special focus state. Odisha has faced at least 18 natural calamities in the past 20 years.

On the occasion, Naveen also expressed concern over the slow progress of railway projects in the state despite the state sharing the cost for some important projects.

The state provides 50% funds and land, free of cost, for important railway projects, but the progress has been very slow, he pointed out. He also emphasized on the timely completion of the 25-year old Khurda Road-Balangir line and others like the Jeypore-Malkangiri and Jeypore-Nabarangpur projects.

He also used the opportunity to talk of the delay in the release of grants to urban local bodies and non-release of the subsidy of paddy procurement to farmers and the inclusion of Ho, Bhumij and Mundari in the Eighth Schedule of Constitution that would make them the official languages of India.

Naveen, who also delivered the welcome address in the meeting being the chief minister of the host state, underlined its importance saying prime objectives of zonal councils are national integration and creation of healthy interstate and centre-state relations.

“The integration has to be financial, infrastructural, technological, so it leads and strengthens emotional integration. It is in this regard I would like to present points both concerning the region and my state Odisha in particular,” he added.

Jaisalmer: A Dalit youth, who was taken into custody by the Barmer rural police over theft charges on Wednesday, died under suspicious circumstances on Thursday.

The youth was taken to a hospital following lunch over deteriorating health on Thursday and was declared dead by the doctors. No case had been registered against the youth at the station. Jodhpur range IG Navjyoti Gogoi too reached Barmer and started investigating the case.

Late on Thursday, the state government put Barmer SP Sharad Chaudhry on awaiting posting order (APO) until further orders.

The issue was also raised in the assembly on Thursday and the government is expected to give a reply on Friday.

Earlier in the day, Barmer SP Choudhary suspended SHO Deep Singh and shifted the entire staff of the police station.

A judicial inquiry too has been ordered. The youth’s family held a protest outside the hospital.

According to police, junk dealer Jitendra Khatik (24) was taken into custody from Barmer city without registering a case on Wednesday after the cops allegedly recovered items stolen from a private company.

Around 9am on Thursday, his family members came to the police station and met him. In the afternoon, the youth’s health suddenly deteriorated, and the police took him to the hospital where he was declared dead.

Choudhary said that no case had been registered against Khatik at the station and admitted that he should not have been kept at the station after inquiry.

“If the SHO had called him to the station, he should have been released immediately after the inquiry. But keeping him at the station despite having no case was not right. Action will be taken against culprits as per rule. At present, we are investigating the case,” he said.

His body has been kept in the government hospital mortuary and post-mortem will done by the medical board.

255,['29/02/2020'],"States demand revision in coal royalty, special status during meeting with Shah","This story is from February 29, 2020

Bhubaneswar: Demands for revision of coal royalty and special status to Odisha and Bihar dominated the Eastern Zonal Council meeting chaired by Union home minister Amit Shah here on Friday. Coal royalty was last revised in 2012 and the states of Odisha, West Bengal and Jharkhand, which produce the majority of coal in the country, have been demanding a greater share from the sale proceeds than the 14% they currently get.

“There is an urgent need to revise royalty on coal and to share the proceeds of clean energy cess with the state governments,” a statement issued by the office of Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik, stated. Odisha has been demanding 60% share in the national clean energy cess (collected from coal mining).

The states currently get 14% royalty on the sale of coal. As per norms, the royalty should be revised every three years. But it has not been done in the past eight years. The states have been demanding that the royalty be increased to at least 20%. Last month, the Centre constituted a committee to study the proposal of coal royalty revision.

Talking to reporters after the 24th meeting of the council, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee said, “Odisha, Jharkhand and our state raised the issue of coal royalty revision. The Union home minister said there needs to be a policy decision on it.”

Besides Naveen and Mamata, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar and Jharkhand finance minister Rameshwar Oraon attended the council meeting. Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren could not attend the meeting which coincided with the first day of the budget session in his state assembly.

Reiterating his demand to declare Odisha as a special focus state owing to its vulnerability from natural disasters, Naveen said, “Odisha has faced at least 18 natural calamities in the past 20 years, the last being Cyclone Fani that devastated the state in May last year.”

Bihar CM Nitish Kumar also pitched for special category status for his state for speedier development and to bring it on a par with other states. He also asked for formulation of National Silt Management Policy to take care of floods in Ganga river, a release issued by Nitish’s office said.

Mamata raised the issue of pending GST compensation with the Centre. “We have raised the issue of delay in payment of GST compensation by the Centre. Initially, there was commitment to release GST compensation every two months. But it is being released after six months, which is leading to financial crunch. This is not good. How will we pay the salary (of employees) on the first day of the month if money reaches us on the 20th of each month,” she said.

The West Bengal CM also raised the issue of pending dues. “We have not got Rs 50,000 crore in dues from the Centre. Bengal is yet to receive the required assistance for calamities like Cyclone Fani and Bulbul. Bengal has been deprived of many things,” she added.

During the meeting, Shah suggested discussion on issues relating to law and order and administrative reforms. He exhorted various central government departments to expedite pending decisions relating to the states. The home minister, who later tweeted that “the meeting was very cordial and fruitful”, suggested regular discussions and data sharing beyond the council meetings. He also laid stress on expanding banking services to ensure that the benefits are available even in the remotest areas.

The council members emphasized the need on speedy investigation of cases of sexual offences against women and children. Among others, the council discussed issues relating to Phulbari dam under the agreement of 1978 signed by Bihar and West Bengal on the Upper Mahananda Water Scheme, extension of Nuapada-Gunupur-Therubali rail link project in northern districts of Odisha, besides determination of pension liability between Bihar and Jharkhand.

BHUBANESWAR: A day after allegation of child sale surfaced in Bhubaneswar, the Khandagiri police arrested four persons, including the 19-day baby boy’s father, on Friday. The accused were identified as Dilu Das, 32, the baby’s father, and his acquaintances Prasant Kumar Gochhayat, 34, Manas Ranjan Mohapatra, 33, and Padua Das, 65.

Police said the reason behind the alleged child sale was poverty of the parents, who are daily-wage labourers. Dilu and his wife have five children. The infant, they allegedly sold, was their fifth child. The couple had sold their baby to Manas of Mancheswar for a few thousand rupees. Prasant and Padua helped the couple in selling the kid, a police officer said. On Thursday, the Childline volunteers came to know about the child sale and rescued the baby from Manas’ custody. The child welfare committee lodged a complaint with Khandagiri police, seeking action against those responsible. Incidents of child sale had come to the light in the capital city in the past as well. In December 2017, the child welfare committee here had rescued a 3-month-old boy from a house in Salia Sahi slum following allegation that the kid’s mother sold him for money to a couple. The Kharavel Nagar police here in July 2014 had arrested a couple for allegedly selling their three children in different places in the state.

BHUBANESWAR: The Utkal University on Friday installed a Micro Raman Spectrometer worth around Rs 1.5 crore in the physics department for research purposes on the occasion of National Science Day on Friday.

The equipment was lying idle in the university since December 2017 due to lack of space for its installation. Office of the accountant general, Odisha, had last year asked vice-chancellor of Utkal University to reply on procurement of this apparatus without planning for its installation.

In March 2017, the syndicate approved the proposal to procure the equipment from the funds provided under Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA) during 2017-18. The newly-installed instrument can be used for research in the field of physics, chemistry, medicine and biological sciences for characterisation of material, detection of explosives and to generate fingerprints of the universe.

“We use this equipment to provide a structural fingerprint through which molecules can be identified. We measure the bond length between two atoms. It is an important device for research,” said Prafulla Kumar Panda, head of the physics department, Utkal University.

He said National Science Day is celebrated on February 28 every year commemorating Indian physicist C V Raman’s 1928 discovery of the scattering of photons or light particles by matter popular as Raman Effect. Installation of this device based on his theory is a tribute to the great scientist, he added.

Vice-chairman of Odisha State Higher Education Council Asoka Kumar Das inaugurated the room with installation of the equipment in the presence of university vice-chancellor Soumendra Mohan Patnaik and teachers of the institution.

The equipment can be used by the university’s post-graduate students and researchers for education and research activities in the field of material science, physics, chemistry, biology and geological studies. Research scholars from other government universities or institutions can access this facility, said the vice-chancellor.

COIMBATORE: The city police on Friday arrested three men who ‘raided’ a women’s hostel at Chinnavedampatti a week ago posing as cops to steal mobile phones of inmates.

A four-member gang had visited the private hostel on February 12 around 1.30am, a police officer said. “One of them was dressed as a police officer. They introduced themselves as Narcotics Intelligence Bureau (NIB) officers and said they were looking for ganja stashed in the building. The hostel authorities gave them permission to conduct a search,” the officer said.

The gang questioned some inmates and asked them to surrender their mobile phones on the pretext of conducting checks. “They took away three phones and told the owners to get back the phones from the Saravanampatti police station.

Nagpur: Play ‘Up Down’ beautifully captured the nuances of interaction of daily commuters on a local train, during the 59th Maharashtra Rajya Hindi Natya Spardha at Scientific Society Hall in Laxmi Nagar on Thursday. The competition is being organized by Directorate of Cultural Affairs.

Staged by Kruti Theatre and Sports Academy Sanstha, Nagpur, ‘Up Down’ is written and directed by Sheetal Dodke.

Mukta (Nirvani Chaudhary) is a deaf and mute girl who has amassed over Rs1 lakh by working hard and selling popcorn on the train. She deposits her hard-earned money with a trusted friend whom she calls as her ‘mama’. However, a police officer (Bhismark Bhivgade) who is an acquaintance has been eyeing the money for some time. Portraying that he cares for her and is helping her, the police officer fixes her marriage with a tea vendor (Ashish Meshram) who is a notorious guy and drunkard.

When the police officer makes good with Mukta’s hard-earned money, the drunkard tea vendor physically abuses Mukta. Refusing to be bogged down by cruel fate, she speaks out against her husband, packs up her belongings and leaves him for good.

The peak of the play is the emancipation of Mukta — a girl who is not only betrayed by a trusted friend but also faced a lot of trials and tribulations in life. She refuses to accept defeat. Mukta boldly says, “I am dignified and I have a lot of strength and perseverance in me. I am not the one to cry but to fight back. I will face the problems head-on. I am not a damsel in distress, I am an empowered woman.”

Her forceful dialogue ‘Mai abla nahi sabla hu,’ gained a lot of appreciation from the audience.

The play was produced by Mayur Shende and Vijay Gaikwadi. Other members of the cast were Vijay Ramteke, Anwar Sheikh, Shravan Ghode, Naresh Yende, Deepak Bombe, Rajivraj Niketansahare, Nitesh Supatkar, Diwakar Shirke and Milind Ramteke.

KOCHI: With concern over noise levels in airports going up over increased traffic, Kerala state pollution control board (KSPCB) is planning to undertake real time noise level monitoring at all airports in the state including Kochi .

KSPCB member secretary S Sreekala said these monitoring stations would be set up along with the proposed network of continuous real time noise level monitoring stations ( RTNLMS ) that are being planned. “We would be soon commissioning four such stations — two each in Ernakulam and Thiruvananthapuram ,” Sreekala said.

KSPCB is currently not monitoring noise levels in airports. “Sometime ago, we had received complaints from a person staying close to the Kochi airport and measured noise levels but currently, there is no continuous monitoring,” said a PCB official. The board had earlier asked the airports to initiate monitoring of noise level.

A spokesperson of the Cochin international airport limited ( Cial ) said they regularly monitor the noise output with the help of an outside agency. “The measured level so far is much lower than the prescribed outer limit. The lush green cover outside the perimeter wall also helps us,” said the official.

Philomina Eldho, president of Nedumbassery panchayat, where the airport is situated, said they have not received complaints regarding noise pollution . Union ministry of environment forests and climate change (MoEFC) had in 2018 notified limits for noise levels in airports. As per the notification, civil airports with more than 50,000 aircraft movements per year, categorized as busy airports, should not exceed noise levels beyond 75 dBA Leq (decibels) during between 6am to 10pm and 65 dBA between 10pm to 6am. Airports having more than 15,000 but less than 50,000 movements annually have noise limits of 65 dBA between 6am to 10pm and 60 dBA between 10pm to 6am.

As per a white paper by Union ministry of civil aviation published in February 2019, all aviation stakeholders shall strive to minimize the adverse effects of aircraft noise on communities by implementing effective noise management as per guidelines of International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) guidelines.

COIMBATORE: Officials of the directorate of information and public relations (DIPR) on Friday conducted an inquiry into the complaints against two former collectorate employees, who allegedly cheated several people of lakhs of rupees by promising them government jobs.

Joint director D Saravanan and additional section officer Vadivelu met accused V L Prabhu, who was an upgrade superintendent and S Sureshbabu, a driver earlier attached with the office of public relation officer (PRO) in the city.

The duo had collected up to Rs 5 lakh from job seekers by promising them posts of clerk, office assistant and driver, a source said. “Even though they had been cheating public since 2013, the issue came to light only two years ago, when the PRO received the first complaint. Subsequently, both the office of PRO and the collector received 15 complaints from people across the district, including Annur, Pollachi and Valparai,” the source said. “The district administration also received complaints from people in other districts, including Sivaganga.”

Both the accused were transferred to other districts six months ago and suspended after some time.

The officials had sent letters to the 15 complainants, requesting them to appear for the inquiry. “But as many as 20 victims turned up for the inquiry,” the source said. “The accused confessed to their crime during the inquiry.”

The entire session was videographed.

The inquiry reports will be submitted to the director of DIPR.

KOCHI: Even as the national capital is recovering from the aftermath of the riots, Kochi witnessed a gesture of peace and harmony as the Grand Masjid invited members of the Sikh community to the mosque during Friday Namaz, as part of their Open Masjid Day initiative.

Men from the Sikh community of Kochi, sporting their turbans visited the mosque on Friday and stood alongside Muslims in the hall where the Friday Namaz was conducted.

After the Namaz, the Sikh community members interacted with the Muslim community. “It was wonderful to attend the Namaz. I always wanted to go to a mosque but I could never. When the imam reached out to us, I felt really happy,” said Bunty Singh, a member of the Sikh community.

He added that they were well received at the mosque. “The people were really warm and they all came and spoke to us. It was a new experience to watch their worship up close,” said Bunty.

The event was held at Grand Masjid near the Kerala high court and was attended by around five members from the Sikh community.

“It is part of a declaration that there is no place for hatred amongst us. We are basically opening up and allowing our brothers from other religions to come and see our practices and get rid of misconceptions. It is a gesture aimed at communal harmony as harmony and peace is the real answer for hatred,” said M P Faisal Azhari, the imam of Grand Masjid.

The mosque launched their Open Masjid Day initiative, around a month back as part of their communal harmony initiatives. “About a month and a half ago we did our first Open Masjid Day. Community leaders from Christian, Hindu communities and dignitaries from other religions were invited then,” said the imam. “We are planning to invite the Jain community at the next Open Masjid Day. This would be repeated every two months,” said the imam.

COIMBATORE: District collector K Rajamani on Friday directed agriculture and horticulture officers to issue crop loss certificates to farmers, who approach them for the same, after verifying the truth in their claims.

The move came after farmers said the certificate was essential for them to move the consumer court against their seed, fertilizer, pesticide or machinery suppliers or brands.

The farmers said the agriculture and horticulture departments have, of late, been hesitant to issue the certificate, as they were under pressure from agri companies.

The order came at the monthly agriculture grievance day meeting, which was held on Friday, as the collector disposed of a petition by P Senthil Kumar, who owns four acres banana farm at Kalikanampalayam near Theenampalayam .

Rajamani ordered the agriculture officer in Thondamuthur to immediately inspect the farmland and issue a crop failure certificate, if warranted.

Senthil Kumar, a member of Tamil Nadu Vivasaigal Sangam, said he had bought a herbicide to control the growth of unwanted weeds called “Saathi” from a company named UPL in November. “They assured me that the herbicide was apt for my farm and my problem. They also inspected my farm and gave me the application instructions. As a trial, I sprayed it across one acre on November 26. Since then, the banana plants in that area look diseased and have not grown at all.”

Kumar, who later approached the company’s salesperson, found he was supplied with a pesticide that was beyond its expiry date and that was meant for paddy farms and not banana. “The company also admitted in a letter that their herbicide was expired. But they have been refusing to compensate me. I want to move the consumer court against them but can’t do that as I don’t have a crop failure certificate.”

Kumar said he was not in a position to clear the affected banana plants, which he said was the only evidence to prove his claims.

Earlier, the Tamil Nadu Vivasaigal Sangam had taken up the issue of crop loss certificate with the collector. “The crop failure certificate is essential for us to move against our suppliers in the consumer court,” said P Kandasamy, its state secretary.

274,['29/02/2020'],"Bengaluru: Now, traders can get their licence renewed online","This story is from February 29, 2020

Representative image

BENGALURU: From now on, one needn’t make rounds of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) office to get his/her trade licence renewed. For, the civic agency has taken the process online.

With trade licences due for renewal at the end of every financial year, February and March are the months when touts — who fleece traders by promising to help them get the crucial document — thrive.

Taking note of the tout menace and to make life easy for traders, the Palike has started the online approval system. The move is also part of its endeavour to improve the ease of doing business (EODB) in the city. With the World Bank deciding to look into Bengaluru and Kolkata apart from Mumbai and Delhi while deciding India’s EODB rankings, BBMP has initiated several measures to help entrepreneurs.

“During these two months, we receive an average of 50,000 trade licences for renewal and 4,000 fresh applications,” said Ravikumar Surpur, special commissioner, projects.

As most traders find little time to deal with the red-tapism amid their hectic schedules, they end up approaching middlemen who charge anywhere between Rs 10,000 and Rs 25,000 to get a renewed trade licence. “The bribe is directly proportional to the size of the business,” Surpur said.

Under EODB, a trader can apply for renewal online and get it done in a few minutes. If the trader wants to obtain a licence in commercial areas, he needs to upload only two documents — one that establishes occupancy of the premises like title deed or lease agreement, and the electricity bill, said another senior BBMP official.

For residential areas where the road is wider than 40ft, the owner needs to submit a document detailing occupancy of the premises, copy of the electricity bill and consent letter from neighbours. “The trader is now allowed to renew the licence either every year or for five years straight,” said senior BBMP official.

An Indiranagar pharmacist said in the locality and surrounding areas, bribes for licences range from Rs 5,000 to Rs 5 lakh.

SG Aditya, general secretary, Indiranagar Owners and Traders Association, welcomed BBMP’s online initiative. Simplifying the process and taking it online will bring transparency to the system, he added.

Sajjan Raj Mehta, trade activist, however, said trade licences should be done away with. “But if BBMP insists, then we need a little more time to get familiar with the online process,” he said.

275,['29/02/2020'],There’s no blindsiding this 25-year-old Bengaluru student on a tennis court,"This story is from February 29, 2020

Nibin Mathew

BENGALURU: Playing tennis could be hard for the blind even if the ball makes a tinkling sound when it hits a surface. But 25-year-old Nibin Mathew, a visually challenged student pursuing MSc in digital society at International Institute of Information Technology-Bangalore, has aced it.

In the recently held national blind tennis championship in Patiala, Nibin defeated 11 participants and qualified for the international blind tennis championship to be hosted by Italy in June 2020.

Nibin, who’s from Wayanad in Kerala, lost his sight due to glaucoma. He got the first taste of blind tennis at a workshop in Mumbai where he was working with the railways for three years. “I was one of the 20 participants when The Indian Blind Sports Association and Maharashtra State Lawn Tennis Association conducted a tennis camp for coaches and visually challenged players. Initially, it was the excitement of movement, where a sponge ball flying in the air makes a tinkling sound on hitting the racket or a synthetic surface. That excitement drove me to the next level and I began practising regularly,” recalled Nibin.

In blind tennis, players listen to the sound of the specially modified ball as it strikes the ground and swing the racquet according to their prediction of the ball’s location, calculating its speed and distance. “We struggled to get an inclusive court, a sound ball and support for practice as the sport is new to our country. The IBTA-approved sound ball manufactured by a Japan company is costly (around Rs 1,500 a piece) and is very fragile,” he said.

Nibin entered IIIT-B to chase his dream of pursuing pure sciences. “When I moved to Bengaluru, I felt I would lose opportunities related to the sport. But the institute ensured I didn’t stop pursuing it. The authorities had a dozen balls imported from Japan for me. Tactile court is an important factor of this tennis model, which helps a player get proper orientation. All lines except the service box should project from the court surface. IIIT-B designed a portable version of an inclusive tennis court using carpet pieces on an experimental basis,” he explained.

“Apart from this, my friends who can see, including integrated MTech student Risshi Sunkum, took out time to play with me. We used to practise at midnight or whenever we were free. He also described how blind players from other countries play by observing YouTube videos. All this helped me,” Nibin said.

The sport, he admitted, has helped improve his mobility. “Many people on campus now ask me whether I can see a little bit,” said Nibin, who plans to rigorously practise for the upcoming matches.

Nagpur: “We should certainly progress, but in harmony with the environment,” said professor Anushree Malik, head of the centre for rural development and technology, Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi.

‘Science: Beyond the labs’ was the theme on which Malik shed light at the NEERI auditorium, Nehru Marg, where CSIR NEERI celebrated National Science Day on Friday.

An initiative by the department of science and technology, ‘Vigyan Jyoti’ by Navyodaya Vidyaya Samiti was inaugurated by Malik, senior scientists of NEERI, Hemant Purohit, JS Pandey, Prakash Kumbhare and Zareena Qureshi, principal of Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya (JNV).

The initiative, inspired by the theme ‘Women in Science’, aims to encourage girls from rural areas to join the science stream and do research. “Around 50 districts have been selected and JNV, Nagpur, is lucky to be on the list with support of NEERI,” said Qureshi.

The entire talk was focused on women’s contribution in the field of science and environmental-friendly development.

Star activist Greta Thunberg’s views were discussed by the dignitaries present on dais.

Malik spoke about how their centre works to find solutions for problems that arise from society, industries and the arena of environmental biotechnology. She explained in detail the practical projects undertaken by her in collaboration with the industries and other scientific institutes, including NEERI. Some of her notable contributions include Mycotablets, a technology for the treatment of harsh textile effluents, algal mediated wastewater treatment and biogas development and algal bio-harvesting process.

Renowned Indian scientist CV Raman was remembered and revered too. Young scientists were encouraged to follow in Raman’s footsteps and pursue science with an environmental perspective and not industrially required research which will develop our country economically, but will not be in harmony with the environment.

PATNA: A drug peddler with brown sugar worth around Rs 4 crore was arrested by the police from road number three of Postal Park colony under Jakkanpur police station area in the state capital late Thursday night. He was identified as Sudama Kumar (24), a native of Bhilwara village under Gopalpur police station area in Patna district.

Jakkanpur police station SHO Mukesh Kumar Verma on Friday said two kilograms of brown sugar was seized from his possession during a raid in his rented accommodation. “He had already made 1,300 small packets, each containing one gram of brown sugar, to supply across Patna. Besides that, Rs 90,000 in cash, two cellphones, an electronic weighing machine and passbooks of several banks were also seized,” the SHO added.

The SHO further said that the apprehended drug peddler was just a pawn and was acting on the directions of drug lords who are lodged inside Beur central jail since the last few months.

“Sudama was getting directions and contact numbers from Abhimanyu, alias Mannu and Guddu Kumar over the phone from inside the jail for procuring drug from outside state and selling it across Patna. Abhimanyu surrendered after the police had seized a large amount of brown sugar from him last year. Guddu, with his wife Bhabhi Ji alias Radha, the masterminds behind the steadily expanding drug racket in state capital, were also nabbed in October last year.”

“The racket was first exposed when five members were arrested from the Jakkanpur police station area with 300grams brown sugar in their possession in September last year,” he said, adding that further investigation was going on in the same connection.

279,['29/02/2020'],Normal summer in Bihar this year: IMD,"This story is from February 29, 2020

Bihar is likely to witness nearly normal temperature between March and May (File photo)

PATNA: Bihar is likely to experience normal temperature in the summer season of March to May — contrary to the earlier forecast of above normal temperature in the core heat zone in the country, the Met office has predicted.

An extended weather bulletin issued by the Patna Meteorological Centre on Friday for forecasting weather parameters over the next fortnight said maximum temperature in Bihar was likely to cross 30 degrees C in the second week of March. The current temperature is hovering in the range of 26-27 degrees C.

The daily weather bulletin by Patna Met office on Friday also said that gradual rise in day temperature by 2 to 3 degrees was expected over the next two to four days.

On the expected seasonal temperature from March to May, a senior official at the Patna centre said: “Though there is 43% probability of temperature to remain 1-degree C above corresponding normal in core heatwave region, which covers Bihar, but as per detailed observation of different weather parameters, Bihar is likely to witness nearly normal temperature between March and May.”

The seasonal outlook for temperatures during March and May issued by the Indian Meteorological Department on Thursday stated that there was about 43% probability of maximum temperatures in the core heatwave zone to be above normal.

Core heatwave zone covers Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Orissa and Telangana and metereological subdivisions of Marathawada, Madhya Maharashtra and Coastal Andhra Pradesh. “This in turn suggests that normal to slightly above normal heat wave conditions are likely in the core heatwave zone during the season,” the season outlook bulletin of the IMD said.

Heat apart, weathermen have also predicted light showers along with thunderstorm at isolated places in all 38 districts in Bihar on March 1 and 2 but the intensity of showers is likely to be comparatively higher on March 2.

280,['29/02/2020'],Oriental Insurance eyes 3k cr capital infusion from Centre,"This story is from February 29, 2020

Kolkata: Public sector general insurer The Oriental Insurance Company is looking for Rs 3,000crore capital infusion from the Centre for growth and solvency in 2020-21. The board of OIC is meeting on March 18 to look into the budget for growth in the next fiscal. This was disclosed by Oriental Insurance chairman & MD A V Girijakumar on the sidelines of an interactive session with the members of Merchant’s Chamber of Commerce and Industry (MCCI) here on Friday.

He also indicated that the current valuation of the company would be in excess of Rs 10,000 crore. It is to be noted that valuation of all the three PSU insurers which would be merged to form a single entity is going on.

Elaborating on capital requirement, the OIC CMD pointed out that the requirement is based on the initial business plan of the insurer but this can be tailored as per the situation and availability of capital.

The Centre has already announced Rs 6,500crore capital infusion in three PSU general insurers — OIC, United India Assurance and National Insurance Company (NIC).

Girijakumar argued that since the inception of OIC it has paid Rs 9,500 crore as tax and dividend to the government, its promoter. After giving the initial capital in 1974, there was no further capital infusion in any of the PSU insurers by the Centre.

“GIC and New India Assurance had raised capital through an IPO. All the other three companies too were supposed to tap the capital market but that has not happened. This is why the Centre is infusing the capital,” he added.

According to him, third-party motor insurance (TP) which was administered till 2013 but the claim was based on actuary valuation and with no time limit was the main reason behind the PSU insurers losing money. “The loss ratio in motor TP at one point of time was 200-220%. Now, we are trying to settle the TP cases first. We have a target of cocealeation of 24,000 cases this fiscal and already did 18,000,” he added.

Elaborating on the growth plan of the company, the CMD added that they will look at different options like economy of business, growth for the insurer. “This year, we are concentrating on economy of business and grown so far by only 6% which is lower than the industry average. Our focus was consolidation. Last year, we grew at 15% which was higher than industry average so we increased out market share,” he added.

This fiscal, he indicated that the company did a lot of repricing to improve the bottomline. The company has a total premium target of Rs 14,250 crore for 2019-20 compared to Rs 13,450 crore in the last fiscal. Now, health constitutes 30% of its portfolio while motor is 34% and crop is 17%.

The incident took place when they were away.” His brother, meanwhile, found that 39 hens were missing from the coop and alerted Dinakaran, who returned home on Thursday morning and lodged a complaint with the Harur police.

During inquiry, police came to know that the hens were stolen by Ponnumani and his friends, who confessed to the crime. “We arrested all the four based on their confessional statement. Ponnumani, who was on leave, was planning to leave for Chennai on March 1 to rejoin duty,” the officer said.

The four were lodged in the Salem Central Prison under judicial custody the same night.

282,['29/02/2020'],Indian Oil to release LPG from renewable sources,"This story is from February 29, 2020

Coimbatore: Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL) is targeting to ensure that at least 10% to 20% of LPG produced in the country is from renewable energy sources in the next two to three years, said director of the research and development wing of the company S S V Ramakumar.

He was speaking at the inauguration of the two-day National LPG Conclave 2020 in the city on Friday.

He said their research has so far shown that LPG can be produced from alternate sources like vegetable oil, glycerol and biomass. Indian Oil is now working on technology to scale up that production.

“We already have proof of concept that bio mass can be converted into LPG. Now we are working on the technology for us to do that in large scale,” Ramakumar said.

“The technology to convert glycerol, vegetable oil or even biomass into LPG is present already but yet to mature,” he added.

The conclave acknowledged that LPG’s growth potential as a cooking gas has nearly saturated, with more than 95% of households already being connected. Now, promoting LPG as an auto fuel has potential. In this regard, Ramakumar said Indian Oil had developed a technology to extract “auto LPG” directly from the fossil fuels.

“LPG as an auto fuel needs more olefinic properties, being a mixture of propane and butane, which is slightly different from our cooking gas requirements. However, this technology is also in the laboratory stage. We will install it soon in one of our refineries,” Ramakumar said.

Auto gas in our country is now CNG (compressed natural gas), which is slightly more efficient than LPG, he said. LPG produces less NOX and methane emissions, making it a cleaner form of energy. “CNG may give 1km more mileage than LPG per kg, but it gives more NOX and methane slip emissions, which are polluting. Auto LPG may also become more cost efficient, because our new extraction technology requires lower temperatures than usual,” Ramakumar said.

The conclave also plans to discuss potential for LPG being used in industrial and commercial purposes, including hotel, food and glass industries, among others.

283,['29/02/2020'],SBI sees corporate credit growth for Q4 at 5-7% YoY,"This story is from February 29, 2020

Kolkata: State Bank of India , the largest bank in the country, is expecting that corporate credit growth for it during the fourth quarter this fiscal could be around 5-7% on year-on-year basis. The bank has witnessed fresh interests in the project finance side in various sectors, particularly in road, city gas distributions and renewable energy, SBI deputy managing director P N Prasad said on Friday.

“There are a lot of interests from renewable side. Our bank has particularly been involved in large renewal proposals and we have been appraising many of the requirement. So, there are fresh shoots coming in that sectors,” he emphasized, adding corporate credit was expected to see good growth in the next fiscal.

“Some of the PSUs, central government and state government indeed do disburse money and consume money in the last quarter. So, normally we expect the credit growth to surge in the months of February and March. At the current trends it could be around 5-7% for the fourth quarter this fiscal, it cannot be more than that,” Prasad told reporters on the sidelines of an event on insolvency and bankcrupcty code organised by CII and NFCG. So far the banking sector has experienced muted credit growth in corporate banking so far, and SBI saw a marginal 0.5-1% y-o-y growth in this segment during the third quarter of the current financial year.

Significantly, growth in bank loans to companies and individuals plunged to 6.3% year-on-year in the fortnight to February 14, the lowest pace seen since May 2017. Non-food credit between April 2019 and mid-February grew at just 2.5%. In a recent report, CRISIL, however, said the prolonged slowdown in bank lending may be bottoming out this fiscal, with gross credit offtake set to rise 8-9% on-year in fiscal 2020-21, a good 200-300 basis points (bps) over the likely growth of ~6% this fiscal.

“A gradual pick-up in economic activity, continuing demand for retail loans, and strong growth in lending by private sector banks should drive the uptick. Recent policy moves announced in the Union Budget, and by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) are also expected to provide spur,"" it added.

The deputy managing director of SBI said thermal power, NBFCs and commercial real estate sector were currently facing some stress. ""We are generally facing some kinds of stress in the power sector. There are some thermal power projects which are facing some challenges in terms of their tariffs and delay from payments from discoms (distribution companies). And, we are seeing some stress in some of the NBFCs, and commercial real estate,"" Prasad informed. On asset quality in corporate segment, he said sequentially fresh slippages came down. SBI's exposure to NBFC sector is currently around Rs 1.70 lakh crore, including investments.

Speaking on resolution mechanism under Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), Prasad said prolonged litigation of some of the cases which are under NCLT has been a cause of “frustration” for bankers.

285,['29/02/2020'],Kerala: Buying water from private tankers? You may also get shrimps and fish,"Ever since the government issued guidelines for supplying drinking water through tanker trucks in February 202... Read More

KOCHI: Recently, when residents of an apartment complex in Pettah cleaned their large water tank, they were shocked to see shrimps and freshwater fishes. They said that the tank remained tightly closed, and only water brought by tanker trucks was used to fill it.“Water was stored for drinking purpose and there is no way fishes can enter that tank. We do not grow fish in it. They came with the water pumped from the trucks. This shows, the water supplied by tankers lack quality and there is no mechanism to check the same,” said an officer bearer of the apartment owners’ association on condition of anonymity.Ever since the government issued guidelines for supplying drinking water through tanker trucks in February 2020, residents of apartment complexes alleged they were being denied quality water. They said that the water supplied by trucks weren’t tested.“The trucks generally have all the documents needed for transporting water, but the problem is with the source from where they draw water. Residents don’t get reports of the mandatory tests that are done at government or NABL-accredited labs. Even if we insist on providing water from Kerala Water Authority ’s ( KWA ) filling points, we don’t know whether the same will be given to us by them,” he added.All Kerala Apartment Owners' Apex Association president VK Sankarankutty said if office-bearers insisted on seeing documents regarding trucks and their water source, then there is every possibility that these trucks will refuse to bring water. The trucks come at night. “Except the security personnel, there wouldn’t be anyone to check the documents. There is no assurance on quality and nobody cares,” he said.He also demanded that KWA should say how much water they can supply for domestic purpose in city and how they would meet the shortage during summer.Meanwhile, Ernakulam Residents’ Association Apex Council president Rangadasa Prabhu said that when large apartment complexes start depending on water supplied by KWA, it could result in water scarcity.“People, whether they live in individual houses or apartments, should get pure drinking water. At the same time, there should be no scarcity. Hence, water from other alternative sources should be filtered and treated and then supplied through tanker trucks. Large apartment complexes can install water treatment plants,” he said.",kochi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74409971,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-234732,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/buying-water-from-private-tankers-you-may-also-get-shrimps-and-fish/articleshow/74408911.cms

ERODE: Two elephants were electrocuted after they came in contact with live wires of an illegal electric fence around a sugarcane field at Karalavadi village near Jeerahalli in Thalavadi forest range here on Friday evening.

Forest officials have arrested farm owner M Karuppasamy in connection with the incident. A forester said Karuppasamy hadn’t obtained permission to erect the electric fence around his sugarcane field that was close to the Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve (STR).

“He said elephants used to raid standing crops such as sugarcane on his farmland as it was very close to STR. So, he installed the electric fence to save the crops,” the official said.

On Friday around 4pm, a six-year-old tusker and a five-year-old female elephant, attempted to damage the fence and enter the sugarcane field. “They touched the live wires and got electrocuted,” the officer said.

When alerted, Jeerahalli ranger S Kandeepan and other officials rushed to the spot and buried the carcasses in the STR forest area after the autopsy. “We have registered a case against Karuppasamy and arrested him. Further inquiries are on,” the officer said.

Pune: The chairman and managing director of the Kotak Mahindra Bank, Uday Kotak, on Friday proposed diluting government stake to below 50% in three of the 12 state-owned banks and running the other three under public-private partnership.

“After the merger of various state-owned banks, we are now down to 12 state-owned banks. I still believe that we need to have a six-three-three formula. Six banks should remain in the public sector. In three others, state ownership should go below 50%. And for the others, we should think out of the box and find out a transparent way for public-private partnership, with domestic and non-domestic players,” Kotak said, while speaking at the Asia Economic Dialogue (AED) in Pune.

He said India was at the cusp of making some serious choices in the financial sector and people needed to ask some tough questions. “India nationalized its banking system in 1969. I want some analysis on the amount of taxpayers’ money that has been put into these banks from 1969 to 2020…Then we need to ask that over a period of 70 years, what is the return to the Indian taxpayers on the crores of rupees that have been put into the state-owned banks?” Kotak said.

Kotak said he did not advocate moving away from state-owned banks, but state ownership, in some of them, could be reduced.

He added that he saw a potential battle for the global financial technology order in the future, between Western and Chinese systems, currently exemplified by the debate over 5G wireless technologies that were being aggressively marketed by Chinese companies.

289,['29/02/2020'],"They kept rioters out, preserved amity","This story is from February 29, 2020

New Delhi: While communal tension gripped Maujpur, less than a kilometre away, Babarpur village kept hostility at bay, with the Hindu and Muslim residents living as neighbours deciding not to be provoked into senseless violence.

“On Monday, when news of stone pelting emanated from Maujpur, senior citizens immediately called a meeting and asked the residents here not to allow outsiders entry into the village,” disclosed area resident Ajay Sharma. “We also decided to nab any suspicious people and hand them over to the residents’ welfare association or the local police.”

Sharma’s neighbour and childhood friend Waseem Khan joined the conversation to add, “Some people claimed that Muslim houses were being targeted elsewhere in northeast Delhi and that we should join the protests. But we didn’t give heed to such talk, opting instead to say at home.”

While the cops began patrolling the area, the residents took it upon themselves to take the rounds of the village in batches, especially at night. “Our only objective was to keep goons or anti-socials away from our area. We were worried that the harmony shared by the people here would be affected by the presence of such people,” said Desh Raj.

Social life in Babarpur has been marked by communal amity. Mohammad Imran shared how all Muslims keenly wait to partake of the bhandara organised every year at the local temple and how dishes prepared during the Eid celebration are distributed to all Hindu houses. Mangu Singh affirmed that his Muslim landlord was very protective about his family. “I saw a few tenants in my neighbourhood collecting stones to deal with any unforeseen incident, but I convinced them that no violence would take place here,” said Singh.

In Mustafabad, amid the hatred, chaos and violence, this spirit of amity was in evidence at the Mankameshwar Mandir. Muslims sacrificed sleep the whole night to protect the Shiva temple from attacks by rioters. They also assisted Hindus employees of a sweet shop to leave the area when rioting broke out.

The mandir is surrounded by Muslim residences. As soon as reports of vandalism at a mosque in Ashok Vihar started being circulated, the residents became angry, “But we didn’t let anyone attack the temple,” claimed carpenter Mohammad Khalid. “Most of those indulging in violence were people from outside our localities. It was our responsibility to make sure our Hindu brothers and sisters did not face hostility.”

Harikant Sharma, the son of temple priest Indradev Shastri, commended the act of the local Muslims. “It was the Muslims who ensured our safety and protected the temple,” he corroborated. “Policemen were nowhere to be seen during all this, and if not for the locals we don’t know what could have happened.”

Mukesh Kumar, who runs a sweet shop in Mustafabad, expressed gratefulness at how the local Muslims alerted him to the violence in the nearby areas on Monday and helped him reach his home in Nand Nagri. “I have never seen anything like this before. I can’t even imagine how it all began,” said Mukesh, who returned to Mustafabad on Saturday to open his shop and meet with the locals.

DHARWAD: A team of advocates from Bengaluru on Friday submitted applications in the district and sessions court here, seeking bail for three Kashmiri engineering students, who were charged with sedition on February 15 for allegedly raising pro-Pakistan and ‘azadi’ (freedom) slogans in their Hubballi hostel . The case was filed after a purported video containing their act went viral.The advocates submitted the bail applications to the court administrative officer. The district judge will decide on the jurisdiction court before considering the applications. To avoid public glare, police let them into the court hall from the backdoor. After filing the bail applications, the advocates walked out from the front gate amid tight security.The development comes a day after the Karnataka high court said that a senior member of the Hubballi Bar Association (HBA) or its Dharwad counterpart (DBA) should argue the case on behalf of the Kashmiri students to uphold the best traditions of the legal profession. However, the lawyers who finally filed the bail petitions are from Bengaluru.DBA, which had opposed the Bengaluru advocates appearing for the accused students on Monday following an HBA resolution, chose not to resist their entry into the court on Friday. HBA had on February 15 passed the resolution barring its members from appearing on behalf of the accused students and requesting members of other bars to follow suit.Police, who had come under the HC scanner after unruly scenes erupted during the Bengaluru advocates’ visit to the court on Monday, had imposed prohibitory orders around the court premises on Friday. More than 500 personnel and half-a-dozen escort vehicles were on the court premises during the visit of the Bengaluru advocates.After the HC rap, police had requested the court administrative officer to enable the advocates of the accused to move their bail applications during lunch hours. The applications were submitted at 2:30pm.Earlier in the day, the advocates were escorted to the Hindalga jail in Belagavi by the Hubballi-Dharwad police to meet the Kashmiri students lodged there.

Nagpur: An ayurvedic medicine dealer and a truck driver were killed in separate accidents in the city and rural between Wednesday and Thursday.

In both the cases, police have registered rash driving and death due to negligence cases. Further investigations are on.

In the first incident, a truck driver was killed after his speeding vehicle rammed a stationary truck from behind at Mahalgaon, around 20km from Mauda police station, on Wednesday. The deceased has been identified as Mohnish Bhaisare, while the driver of the stationary truck Sunil Sahare sustained injures.

Mauda police have registered a case against the deceased for rash driving and death due to negligence while Sahare for parking his vehicle on road without following any safety measures.

In another incident, Kailash Gajbhiye, 39, was knocked dead by an unidentified vehicle near Wathoda village on Jabalpur-Hyderabad highway on Thursday. Gajbhiye was returning from Seoni on a bike.

Cops said Gajbhiye, an ayurvedic medicine dealer, was found lying on road by passers-by who informed police control room. Wathoda police rushed to the spot and shifted Gajbhiye to Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) where he was declared brought dead.

Police suspect that Gajbhiye’s bike must have been dashed by an oncoming vehicle as the two-wheeler’s headlight was found broken. Police also suspect that Gajbhiye may have died due to internal injuries as there were no major external injuries on his body. Gajbhiye’s body was later handed over to his relatives after post mortem on Friday.

293,['29/02/2020'],Narrow margin victories: EC urged to delay results till count of voter turnout,"This story is from February 29, 2020

Amaravati: The narrow margins of victories in Guntur and Visakhapatam Lok Sabha seats in 2019 have figured prominently in a public interest litigation filed by Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) and Common Cause, an NGO , in the Supreme Court seeking declaration of results only after completion of voter turnout .

In Guntur TDP’s Galla Jayadev won by 4,205 votes but there was a mismatch of 6,982 votes in the final voter turnout.

In Visakhapatnam, YSRC’s MVV Satyanarayana won by 4,414 votes but the final voter turnout was up by 4,956 votes.

Noted lawyer Prasant Bhushan, appearing for ADR and Common Cause, sought a direction from the SC to the Election Commission not to announce results based on provisional and estimated vote count and wait till the completion of the tally of total votes.

The results in Guntur and Visakhapatnam were taken as basis for filing the case since ADR found serious discrepancies between voter turnout and votes counted.

Modugula Venugopala Reddy, YSRC candidate in Guntur who lost the election, said he would file a petition to implead in the case.

ADR and CC contended that there was no justification in declaring results before the final vote count was released.

“To maintain veracity of elections and uphold voter’s confidence a statutorily valid election result should be given importance over a few days of delay. That results based on estimates and assumptions and without any statutory backing defeats the very purpose of elections,” the petitioners argued. They said the EC too had admitted in its disclaimer of ‘result sheet’ which was available on the EC website that these election figures are provisional, based on estimates which are subject to change and has no statutory validity that “the data is estimated and subject to change”.

They said the EC had introduced My Voter Turnout app during 2019 Lok Sabha elections, a real-time reporting of voter turnout for every constituency.

The reporting was done on the basis of voting at booth level at any given point of time which was consolidated and put up on a mobile app called ‘My Voter Turnout’ app. They said the EC published the voting data on real time basis for the first six phases through the app.

A team of experts with ADR and CC found discrepancies between the number of voters in different constituencies such as voter turnout data collated and provided by the EC and the number of votes counted. The study of discrepancy patterns in all the constituencies based on the data available on the EC website and the ‘My Voters Turnout’ app found discrepancies in 347 out of 542 constituencies. Only 195 seats were without discrepancies.

“The discrepancies range from 1 vote (lowest) to 1,01,323 votes @ 10.49% of the total votes (highest). There are six seats where the discrepancy in votes is higher than the winning margin,” the PIL said.

294,['29/02/2020'],Chennai Metro rail forms panel to acquire land for phase-2,"This story is from February 29, 2020

Representative image

CHENNAI: Instead of fighting lengthy legal battles, Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL) has begun acquiring land for phase-2 construction by holding talks with the property owners through a private negotiation committee to quicken the process. According to CMRL officials, the approach helps convince property owners as CMRL is also ready to make changes to station design and location, if possible, to save owners from parting with large parcels of land.

On Friday, Good Shepherd School in Nungambakkam handed over land for building Sterling Road Junction metro station after a delay due to lengthy legal proceedings.

A metro rail official said they have acquired several properties through the private negotiation committee. “Recently we cleared five cases including those for Kellys, Chetpet, Adyar Gate junction stations,” the official said. “Private talk is mutually beneficial instead of long legal battles as we make people understand they can give us the land for more than the market price which they may not get by fighting a case,” the official said. CMRL requires 117.12 hectare land to construct the 118.9km phase-2.

Private negotiations with property owners come after CMRL faced difficulties in acquiring land for the construction of the 45km phase-1. This time, CMRL is also making changes to the design and location of stations, wherever possible, to cut down on the amount of land acquired.

“Since it is a design and building contract, we have the flexibility to change design and minimise the area of land being taken from owners as much as possible. We take our design consultants along with us when we hold talks with owners and make changes,” an official said.

For instance, officials said they have taken over 17,495sqft instead of 0.88 acre, as was initially planned, from Good Shepherd school, a major portion of which is the school’s playground. The school had moved the court against the acquisition.

On Friday, a cheque was handed over to the school authorities for giving the land. “We are not taking the playground. We have taken over a piece of land from a corner of the school campus where there is a school block. We will rent out the building to the school for a year till they get a new block ready,” the official said.

295,['29/02/2020'],Hospital that admitted to bribing back on govt panel,"This story is from February 29, 2020

Chennai: The state health department has brought back Gleneagles Global Hospitals into the list of empanelled hospitals under the state health insurance scheme, three months after it suspended the hospital citing “moral hazard” and “public interest”. The temporary suspension was following reports that it offered money to ambulance drivers and paramedics for bringing patients to its facility.

Incidentally, an inquiry committee appointed by the state health department in its report said that the hospital admitted to paying money to some drivers and paramedics. The letters to Directorate of Medical Services recommending action under the Clinical Establishments Act and to state transplant authority, Transtan for “suspension of transplant licence” are still pending. But more than two weeks ago, the state revoked the “suspension”. “Action based on the inquiry is still pending action,” senior health department official said.

The officials in the health department refused to comment further, but a Global Hospital spokesman said one of the hospital employees was found paying money to get patients into the hospital.

“We have removed him from the company rolls. We told the government he does not work with us anymore. After the inquiry, we were allowed to treat patients covered by the state health insurance scheme,” he said.

In September, former employees of the hospital complained to the government that the hospital was offering money to ambulance drivers and paramedics to bring patients including road accident victims into their emergency room. They told TOI that cash they gave to drivers soon after the drop ranged between Rs 700 and Rs 5,000 and the hospital transfers a percentage of the total bill as commission after the patient is discharged, they said, showing ‘entries’ of Rs 45,000 shown as being deposited into back accounts of some EMRI staff.

A fortnight later, GVK-Emergency Management and Research Institute, an agency outsourced by the health department to run 108 ambulances, dismissed 10 of its contract employees and placed nine other permanent employees on suspension after an internal inquiry against its drivers and paramedics.

Almost simultaneously, the health department ordered a detailed inquiry by a team of officials and suspended the hospital from empanelled list of hospitals for the chief minister’s comprehensive health insurance scheme of Tamil Nadu (CMCHISTN ).

296,['29/02/2020'],Ministers told to be at sectt on Wednesdays,"This story is from February 29, 2020

Amaravati: Responding to complaints about the unavailability of ministers in the secretariat, the state government has directed all ministers to be available in their chambers on every Wednesday in the secretariat at Velagapudi.

Many ministers were not going to the secretariat after chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy announced plans to shift the secretariat to the executive capital in Visakhapatnam.

Except for finance minister Buggana Rajendranath Reddy, deputy CM Pilli Subhash Chandrabose, municipal administration minister Botcha Satyanarayana and transport minister Perni Nani other ministers were rarely visiting their offices in the secretariat, said sources.

The ministers were not even taking stock of the matters in the respective departments at regular intervals, said sources. Since the chief minister is holding reviews of all the departments on a regular basis, the ministers were attending the reviews mostly held at the CM’s camp office in Tadepalle.

The CM himself is rarely coming to the office in the secretariat either for cabinet meeting or to interact with district collectors via video-conference, said sources. Recently, the CM’s meetings with foreign delegates have been taking place at his camp office.

Although there would be no big difference for the CM as the entire administration would be at his side at either place, the absence of ministers in the secretariat was said to be adversely affecting the administration.

According to sources, the CM has received reports about the unavailability of ministers for important delegations from industry or foreign countries to hold discussions on different projects.

In recent times, many people could not meet the ministers at the secretariat. Taking the feedback into consideration, the state government directed the ministers should be available in the secretariat on every Wednesday.

Chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy inspects the Polavaram project works at the project site on Friday

Chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy has directed irrigation department officials to ensure release of water from Polavaram project by 2021. The CM, who visited the project site and conducted a high level review meeting on the progress of works on Friday, made it clear that the government is committed to complete the project and release waters to coastal and north Andhra districts including Visakhapatnam by the end of this year or early next year.

“The next five months are going to be crucial for the project. Meticulous planning is needed to complete it before deadline, without compromising on quality. The work should continue in the months of June, July, August, September and October,” Jagan said. He also asked officials to ensure that the spillway works are completed by June so that water can be diverted through the spillway.

“Work on the approach channel should also be done with the same pace and gaps in the coffer dam should be filled as soon as possible,” he added. As several villages are likely to get submerged once the coffer dam is completed, the CM directed the authorities to focus on rehabilitation works without further delay.

He further asked the project authorities to have a special officer posted in New Delhi to ensure that there is no delay in getting permissions for drawings and other technical issues. With regard to the left main canal connectivity, the officials told the chief minister that works are going on in two phases. Jagan suggested that the bridge to be built on the spillway should be called ‘YSR gateway’.

The CM also reviewed the relief and rehabilitation measures for the project displaced. Project officials told him that 41.2 metres of water can be stored in Godavari if the gaps in coffer dam are filled and six villages should be vacated immediately. He asked for an officer to be appointed to oversee the relief and rehabilitation works. “Be compassionate towards the displaced people even the expenditure escalates,” he said, while assuring speedy release of funds for setting up of rehabilitation colonies.

Earlier, Jagan conducted an aerial survey of the Polavaram project.

KOLKATA: A 24-year-old sales executive employed at a Quest Mall shop was allegedly pushed off a moving train between Park Circus and Sealdah stations last month when she tried to escape from a molester and call for help. The incident, the woman claimed, had happened last month and on Wednesday evening, she took to Facebook to describe her ordeal and shared some images of her bruised face, head and hands.Reasoning for the delay in coming up with the complaint, the Ranaghat resident said she was under treatment till now and was not in the perfect frame of mind to speak about the ordeal. But on Wednesday evening, she gathered courage and wrote about the horror ride back home in detail. Some of her friends tagged Kolkata Police and the Sealdah GRP in the post that was shared 11,000 times over the last two days. Kolkata Police has already replied her on Facebook Messenger saying they had passed on the information to Sealdah GRP, under whose jurisdiction the incident had happened but none from the GRP called her till late on Friday. A senior GRP official told TOI on Friday that they were yet to receive an official complaint about it but will look into the matter.“I live in Ranaghat with my mother and hence, neither my mother nor I could go to Sealdah and lodge a complaint all these days. But now, I am a bit stable and plan to visit the GRP by Saturday and lodge an official complaint,” said Mita Das, who had suffered multiple injuries in her head, hands and legs.According to the woman, on January 29, she had boarded the ladies compartment of a train to Sealdah from Park Circus station around 8pm. She would have got down at Sealdah and take another train to reach Ranaghat. “There was only another girl in the compartment but just as the train chugged out of the platform, a youth in his 20s hopped into our compartment and started making indecent gestures towards us and sat beside us. He started making advances towards me and asked the other girl to go away. I protested and just as I was about to scream for help and pull the emergency chain, the youth grabbed me by my hand, pulled me towards the gate and pushed me out of the running train,” said Das.Das lost consciousness after the fall and when she gained sense, she realised she was lying beside a railway track. She somehow dragged herself towards the Park Circus railgate and pleaded for help. “Two men took me to Kolkata National Medical College and Hospital but asked me not to tell anyone about the accident as it would have meant a police case and more hassles for them and me. So, I stayed mum. The doctors treated me and later called my family. I was under treatment at home all these weeks,” she told TOI over phone.Within hours of her post, people began commenting on the incident and sharing her post. One such user posted about another woman who also met with a similar fate on the same day. “It looks like the work of a same set of men. I want cops to take some action,” Das said.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74410162,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-162646,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/woman-pushed-off-running-train-after-resisting-assailant/articleshow/74408210.cms

301,['29/02/2020'],Milch cows owners demand hike in insurance amount,"This story is from February 29, 2020

Coimbatore: Farmers who own milch cows and supply milk to Aavin in the district have raised their concern with the district administration about the cap imposed by the animal husbandry department on number of cows to be insured and the insurance amount for each cow.

The Tamil Nadu Vivasaigal Sangam petitioned collector K Rajamani in this regard at the collectorate in the city on Friday.

According to the farmers, the animal husbandry department is agreeing to insure only two cows per farmer with the maximum insurance amount of Rs 30,000 per cow. State secretary of the association P Kandasamy said, “The department insures most cows for only around Rs 20,000. Even if a farmer owns 10 cows, he can insure only two. Moreover, if his two insured cows are worth Rs 50,000 each, he can insure them only for Rs 30,000 each.”

The animal husbandry department has reduced the insurance amount because it has only limited funds, the association said.

“As per the scheme, a farmer must pay 1% of the insured amount as premium. 50% of that 1% will be borne by the government. So, for a Rs 30,000 insurance amount, the government pays its share of premium of Rs 150. So, if they insure a cow for Rs 70,000, then the government must pay a premium of Rs 350, and more cows means more premium,” Kandasamy said. tnn

Kolkata: A private bus packed with passengers, mostly returning home from Sector V offices, were injured when the vehicle rammed into a Metro pillar near Unnayan Bhavan in Salt Lake on Friday. According to cops, 12 passengers suffered injuries and nine of them had to be taken to the hospital.

Power connection to the E-W Metro third rail was switched off for nine minutes from 9.13pm for inspection. No pier was damaged, said a Metro official.

Around 7.30pm, the bus of route 215A/1 was speeding towards Howrah from Sector V. “As it crossed Central Park, it tried to overtake another bus of the same route from the right but hit a pothole. The driver lost control. The bus climbed a median divider before ramming into a Metro pillar,” said Ajit Ghosh, who was passing by the area at that time.

As the bus came to a halt, the driver jumped out of the cabin and ran away leaving passengers, many of them lying on the floor, injured. Locals and guards and a medical team from Sabala Mela helped the passengers and treated them initially, before those with serious injuries were rushed to Bidhannagar sub-divisional hospital.

“ The moment it crossed Karunamoyee, the bus picked up speed and began overtaking vehicles from the right. We were finding difficult to stand. Suddenly there was a jerk. The bus rammed into something. I fell on the floor,” said Priyanka Jhawar, a passenger. Though police said 12 were injured, witnesses claimed the number was much more. “We have started a case of rash and negligent driving,” said an officer.

A view of the BHEL MIG Colony

HYDERABAD: In a land scam which has come under GHMC radar, a total of 38 plots have allegedly been sold in the graveyard and open space in BHEL MIG Housing Society Colony in Serilingampally. Complaints have been filed against some housing society members and Chandanagar police have begun looking into the charges of irregularities.

Deputy city planner of GHMC Serilingampally zone R Srinivasa Rao told TOI that they have received a complaint on February 26. “We have sent teams for inspection at the site. We will take suitable action,” he said.

Human Rights and Consumer Protection Cell, in a complaint filed with various authorities on February 24, alleged that the space earmarked for the graveyard in the colony was being sold as plots of 80 square yards each to various persons. “The HUDA-approved layout clearly shows that the area is designated for a graveyard,” it said.

Apart from GHMC town planning, revenue and police officials are also seized of the alleged sale of graveyard and shopping complex areas in the housing society. An encumbrance search of stamps and registration department records has revealed that the plots had been sold between 2017 and 2019.

The BHEL MIG Colony was founded in 1989. As per Hyderabad Urban Development Authority-approved layout, 2,500 houses with space for parks, garbage, dumpyards and a graveyard were planned.

Whistleblower Thakur Raj Kumar Singh, who filed a complaint, said some old houses which sprung up in the graveyard should be demolished. “If they are any BPL families, they should be relocated,” he said.

Meanwhile, the housing society has asked the authorities to protect the graveyard and take suitable action against the members who resorted to irregularities. Repeated attempts to reach housing society president Venkat Reddy went in vain.

305,['29/02/2020'],"For 2nd time, HC stays Uttarakhand’s ‘forest’ definition","This story is from February 29, 2020

NAINITAL: Two months after it stayed the definition of ""deemed forests"" introduced by the state government in November last year, the Uttarakhand high court (HC) on Friday once again put a stay on the changes made by the administration in February.

As reported by TOI earlier, the HC had on December 10 last year put a stay on the state government’s office order which defined deemed forest as “a patch of land of at least 10 hectares and having at least 60 % canopy cover along with at least 75% native species.”

This, environmentalists said, was ""an arbitrary definition"". They alleged that it was unclear how the government arrived at the figure of 10 hectare and 75% native species in categorising an area as forest land. They pointed out that in 2017, the Forest Survey of India had defined forest as one hectare or more land with 10% canopy cover. However, this definition was also questioned in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change that sought to know how this conclusion was reached.

""The dictionary meaning of the word forest ( any large area with trees and undergrowth) is being tampered with simply to make profit out of forest land,"" environmentalist Reenu Paul had told TOI when the definition was first announced.

Even as the HC was hearing three petitions challenging the original government order — the move had been opposed by several environmentalists who alleged that the decision was meant to primarily benefit the land and mining mafia in taking over forest land — the state government this month further tweaked the definition. As per the revised definition, deemed forest was now “a patch of land of at least five hectares and having 40 % canopy cover.”

Ajay Singh Rawat, a Nainital-based former professor of Kumaun University , who has petitioned against the state government in the matter, told TOI on Friday, “We welcome the HC directive. The new definition was primarily intended to duck the high court stay order, and to make the pending petitions in the case infructuous.”

Rajeev Bisht, the lawyer representing Rawat, added that the bench of Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia and Justice Narayan Singh Dhanik heard the case for three consecutive days before deciding to stay the new government order. “We argued before the court that the new definition was in complete violation of a Supreme Court order and is also against the Forest Conservation Act. However, the government through their counsels and forest officials said that the new definition was justified and that it benefits the forests. After hearing the arguments of both sides, the court decided to stay the revised definition as well,” Bisht said.

Rawat said, “If one went by the revised definition of the state government, around 9,000 square kilometer of forest land will not be considered so in the state. It is therefore clear that the aim of passing such orders is to …benefit the builder mafia.”

Madan Kaushik, urban development minister and spokesperson for the government, told TOI, “We will study the HC order in detail and further course of action will be decided accordingly.”

CLEARED SKHER

Nashik: The state government has terminated the membership of Sripad Chindam, an independent corporator of Ahmednagar Municipal Corporation, for his alleged remarks with regards to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.

Top AMC sources confirmed to TOI that the civic body had received a communique from the state urban development department on Friday on the issue.

State urban development minister Eknath Shinde had conducted a hearing on the issue at his office in Mumbai on Thursday and ordered for the termination of the corporator’s membership. Chindam was not present at the hearing although the department had sent him prior notice to appear for the hearing. Chindam could not be contacted despite several attempts.

“The minister has the powers to terminate membership of a corporator as there is a provision under Maharashtra Municipal Act. There will be fresh polls to elect a new member from that ward,” AMC sources added.

In February 2018, Chindam had allegedly passed derogatory remarks after Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj while pulling up a civic employee for not doing his work. At that time, he was elected on a BJP ticket and was the deputy major of Ahmednagar.

His remarks against the Maratha king had created a huge furore in Ahmednagar, although Chindam had later apologised for his remarks.

The AMC’s general body had then passed a resolution asking the state urban development department to terminate his membership as the elected member of the corporation for the alleged insulting remarks against Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.

Even the local BJP unit had sacked him from the party. Ahmednagar city Shiv Sena chief, Dilip Satpute, had lodged a complaint against Chindam in the local police station. Chindam, however, won the subsequent polls held in December 2018 as an independent candidate.

“The previous BJP-led government did not act on the resolution passed by the AMC general body. A few days back, a delegation of Shiv Sena leaders from Ahmednagar city met Shinde in Mumbai. They urged him to expedite the issue. He ordered his department to immediately conduct a hearing,” said Satpute.

Ujjain: A fire incident that fatally injured a youth in Nanakheda area of Ujjain turned out to be a murder on Friday. The victim succumbed to his injuries at an Indore hospital.

Preliminary investigation and statements of eyewitnesses had brought up the notion that the victim, Ganesh Gupta, a 22-year-old engineering student, sustained burns after flames from a bonfire spread on the night of February 28.

Two days later, the theory fell apart when CCTV grabs of Ganesh catching fire came to fore. His friends Suraj Yadav and Shubham Yadav, were seen pouring kerosene on him and starting a fire.

Nanakheda police station sub-inspector Vikas Devda said investigation revealed that Ganesh picked up a fight with Shubham and Suraj over money for purchasing chewing tobacco. The fight escalated and Ganesh was set on fire.

He sustained critical injuries and was admitted to a hospital in Indore. However, he was later referred to a hospital in Indore where he died on Friday.

“We have registered a case of murder against Suraj and Shubham,” Devda said.

COIMBATORE: More than 500 cadre of BJP took out a rally from Senchiluvai Sangam to the collectorate in the city on Friday in support of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

More than 300 police personnel, including Rapid Action Force, provided security for the rally.

Addressing the protesters at the end of the rally, state general secretary of BJP Vanathi Srinivasan said DMK and its allies were spreading false information without understanding about CAA.

She said that both the state government and police should take necessary steps to control the ongoing protests against CAA in the state. “If they fail, we would also engage in similar protests,” she said.

Pointing out that BJP national general secretary P Muralidhar Rao had challenged DMK chief MK Stalin for a debate on CAA, she said Stalin is yet to respond to the challenge.

Following the rally, representatives of BJP submitted a petition to district collector K Rajamani.

Meanwhile, nearly 100 advocates staged a protest on the court premises in the city condemning the recent communal violence in northeast Delhi. The protest was organized by the All India Lawyers Union (AILU). They raised slogans and condemned the police for their inability to control the violence that erupted over CAA.

An advocate said the police department was hand in glove with Hindutva outfits in the violence.

N Chandrababu Naidu

VIJAYAWADA: Andhra Pradesh Police Officers’ Association (APPOA), Amaravati, slammed former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu for describing police ‘shepherds of donkeys’ at the Visakhapatnam airport .

They asked Naidu to detract his statement and not criticise the police personnel.

In a press release, APPOA said police were safeguarding law and order and were not ‘shepherds of donkeys.’ APPOA said the police swing into action spontaneously to deal with unpredicted situations to protect public and private properties and safeguard law and order.

Accusing Naidu and his son Nara Lokesh for trying to threating the police, APPOA said the police played a vital role in guarding Naidu against the agitators. But Naidu blamed the police and threatened to take action if they returned to power, it added.

It has become routine for TDP leaders to criticise the police. We want Naidu and other TDP leaders to stop threatening the police, said APPOA. tnn

Naidu protesting at the Vizag airport after his convoy was blocked, on Thursday

Visakhapatnam: Home minister Mekathoti Sucharitha on Friday said nobody arrested TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu during his visit to Visakhapatnam on Thursday. Speaking to reporters after visiting the central prison in Kadapa, she said Naidu visited the city only for doing politics and it was the people who resisted his visit. “We had to send him back due to law and order issues and also to ensure his security,” she said.

Tourism minister M Srinivasa Rao also lashed out at Naidu, saying the people of north Andhra and Vizag sent him back. “All those who demonstrated against the former CM were residents of Visakhapatnam and north Andhra. Naidu’s comments belittling Vizag and his stance against it becoming the executive capital angered people. He is trying to play divisive politics and is unnecessarily raking up the issue of land pooling claiming that the land is being grabbed from the public. Now, the people have taught him a lesson,” he said in Vizag.

He also dismissed allegations that people were hired from outside to orchestrate the blockade. “This is absolutely absurd, we have no reason to muster people or stage a dharna,” he said, while adding that people of north Andhra have for long been fighting for their rights, which they have been denied. Giving the examples of Rampa rebellion and steel plant struggle, the minister said people of the region are not the kind to give in without a fight. “Naidu, instead of playing divisive politics, must learn to conduct himself with dignity. He should not blame the police for what happened at the airport, instead he must thank them for protecting him,” the minister added.

Two students were seriously injured as they were stung so many times.

As students went haywire to save themselves, passersby came to their rescue. “We saw students running and crying with pain of bees sting. We removed some bees which got stuck on their body,” an eyewitness Salim told media-persons.

Another eyewitness Imran claimed, “It was after we informed City Kotwali police, an ambulance reached the spot to take students to hospital.

Taking stock of the incident, naib tehsildar Kavita Katel said, “We will check whether the school administration reacted in an appropriate manner to the bee attack or not.”

Movement of wild animals, especially elephants, has increased in the past couple of months

COIMBATORE: Estate workers in Valparai have sought collector K Rajamani’s intervention to keep wild animals off human habitations.

Movement of wild animals, especially elephants, has increased in the past couple of months, V Paramasivam of the Kovai District Estate Workers and Officials’ Association said in a petition to the collector. “An elephant herd has been straying in Mudis, Thekkamudi, Periyakallar and Korangumudi,” he said.

Remembering estate worker P Suresh, who was killed by an elephant at Thonimudi in January, Paramasivam said that the animals destroy crops and buildings. “They raid houses in search of ration rice. The movement of elephants in residential areas has been increasing as the summer season is fast approaching. The situation has become more serious compared to the last year.”

“A separate fund has been allotted to construct water tanks inside forest and fill them on a regular basis. The government has also made provisions to set up salt licks in forest. But we don’t know if the forest department officials are maintaining them. If they at least fill the tanks during the summer season, wild animals will not intrude into human habitats,” he said.

As the streetlights installed by the Valparai municipality are not functioning in some areas, residents often bump into wild elephants, Paramasivam said. “The forest department should station kumki elephants in the region to chase away wild elephants as soon as they enter human habitations,” he added.

PUNE: The collective water stock in 35 major dams of the division was on Friday recorded at 69% ahead of the three summer months of March, April and May.This was the highest collective water stock in the division comprising Pune, Satara, Kolhapur, Sangli and Solapur districts in the past four years, state irrigation department data revealed.In 2018, the 35 dams had 65% collective stock during this period. In 2017 and 2016, the storages were 52% and 28%, respectively.The current water availability in the division appeared much better as compared to what it was in 2019, when the collective storage in the 35 major big dams had slipped below the halfway mark (up to 47%) at the end of February.The irrigation department has categorized the dams as “major”, “medium” and “minor” on the basis of their respective storage capacity. This year, the division has more water stock in dams belonging to all three categories. The Pune division has 50 medium, 641 minor and 35 major dams.An irrigation department official said the extended rainfall during the last monsoon in the catchments and the command areas of many dams has led to the additional water in the reservoirs.“Many dams recorded heavy rain till November last year. The demand for water remained low during the four months of winter. This meant lesser release of water. For instance, water stock in the Ujani dam is 69% now. In contrast, the dam had only 15% live stock at the end of February last year,” the official said.The demand for water might go up because the local (water) sources generally become dry during summer. The official said instructions have been issued for releasing water from the dams in accordance with the requirements.Another irrigation department official said the quantum of water also released from the four dams supplying water to the Pune city was less after last monsoon. “Water was released from Panshet, Varasgaon, Temghar and Khadakwasla in two rotations during winter.

External affairs minister S Jaishankar addresses the dialogue in Pune via video-conferencing on Friday

Pune: External affairs minister S Jaishankar has said that undertaking changes to make India an effective player in the global supply chain and dealing with the implications of an unfolding knowledge economy on mobility and migration are challenges.

He was addressing the inaugural session of the 1st Asia Economic Dialogue (AED) in Pune through video-conferencing on Friday.

The three-day event is organized by the Pune International Centre, a think tank of eminent persons that provides inputs to the government for policy making.

Jaishankar said links to non-trade issues like social or security concerns have complicated the emerging trade situation. Narrow economic thinking of most societies is other influencing factor, he added.

“The two striking developments of our times are the rise of China and the nationalism of the US, both inextricably tied to the performance in trade. The sharper dichotomy between the two leading economies of the world pose larger challenges. Economies of low per capita income whose livelihood are affected by policy changes (Asian economies), are vulnerable in this context,” he added.

Jaishankar said the changing trade scenario is reflected in forging new partnerships, dependence on sourcing and mapping of supply chains. The debate on connectivity and technology underlines the complicated era in which we now live. An erosion of globalization will influence trading habits of many societies. Reaching international understanding against this backdrop is a challenge, he added.

The challenge for India is how well it is prepared to engage the global economy more openly. “Competing against those with structural advantages can’t be a casual decision justified by political correctness. Many trade relations have a direct livelihood and social consequences. The choices we make in terms of capability and balance are critical. The task ahead not only involves diplomacy but also good governance,” he said.

Earlier, K V Subramanian, chief economic advisor to Government of India, presented his vision on `Ethical Wealth Creation’ and how the invisible hand of trust will play a big role in global markets and trade.

Maldives minister of economic development Uzman Fayyaz Ismail said the island nation faces a challenge in populist governments and climate change. Integration of economies also brings challenges like the Covid-19 virus which is impacting the tourism-based economy of Maldives, he said.

Sri Lankan state minister of development banking and loan schemes Shehan Semasinghe said his country was revising all its micro-economic policies and trade regimes to adjust with the global scenario. The fruits of people-centric development must be felt in the lowest strata, he added.

Former Indian Ambassador to China Gautam Bambawale, convener of the event, said, “The AED will be the third of the annual events organized by MEA and PIC focusing on geopolitical, technological and geo-economics.”

Puducherry: Pondicherry University turned the South Asian regional cooperative centre within the campus into a detention centre and confined 90-odd students, who are on an indefinite strike against fees hike since February 6, for more than 20 hours during the visit of vice-president M Venkaiah Naidu on Wednesday, alleged the students’ council.

Council president Parichay Yadav said the students were confined at the centre from 4pm on Tuesday to 1pm on Wednesday. The students as soon as they were released marched towards the administration block and resumed their protest reoccupying the corridor of the block demanding the university to revoke the hike in fees for all courses.

He said the university hosted the 28th convocation on Wednesday during which Naidu, who is also the chancellor of the university, awarded degrees to the students when 94 students were under detention within the campus.

The students were kept under custody until the convocation ceremony concluded. ""Such an unfortunate incident of converting a university into a detention camp is quite unheard of,"" said Yadav.

The council regretted that the university continues to propagate 'lies' through its statements. ""The attempt to malign the cause of the protest is highly condemnable. The arrogant language in each of these releases is a testimony to their lack of concern for the students,"" Yadav said.

The council said the university promised to reconvene the fee revision committee on February 28 to redress the concerns raised by the students. ""We will continue our indefinite strike until our demands are met,"" he said.

The university claimed that the fees for all courses were hiked after a gap of 10 years. It said the hike for most of the courses were between 25% and 50%. However, various students' forums termed the university's justification as a set of lies and furnished the old and revised fee structures to prove that the university has steeply hiked the fees. They pointed out that the fees for MCA, MSc/MTech (computer science) and MBA courses were hiked by 132.3%, 124% and 95% respectively.

Meanwhile, Democratic youth federation of India and Students Federation of India and other students' forums staged an agitation in the town on Thursday. The agitators blindfolded themselves and raised slogans demanding the university to revoke the fees' hike.

University public relations' officer R Venkatesakumar denied that the students were detained at the silver jubilee block. ""The campus was brought under the control of security agencies on Tuesday, 24 hours ahead of VVIP visit, as a security measure and protocol related procedure.

The students were not locked in the campus,"" said Venkatesakumar.

Representative image

PANAJI: The high court of Bombay at Goa slammed the police for not having showing seriousness in investigating the suicide case of former Merces sarpanch Prakash Naik , because the accused, Wilson Godinho, is “brother of the local minister”. It also spoke about the “clout wielded” by Wilson over the investigating agency.

The court observed that the investigating agency would be better equipped to unearth the crime only when Wilson is in police custody, and rejected his anticipatory bail application. Panchayat minister Mauvin Godinho is his brother.

Justice Nutan Sardessai observed, “The offence by itself is serious and the seriousness required to investigate such a case has unfortunately not been exhibited by the investigating agency obviously for the reasons of the applicant being the brother of the local minister, and it appears from the manner of the investigation conducted thus far, as borne out from the case diary, that there is no seriousness to actually probe the role of the applicant in the crime.”

The court said that the manner in which the police allowed him to go at the inception itself, on the specious premise that no FIR was registered against him, speaks volumes about the clout wielded over the agency by the applicant being the brother of the local minister.

The judge held that Wilson had dealings with Naik relating to the property at Merces and that there were money transactions between them. Besides, the applicant wanted access to the property he had purchased with Naik’s intervention, but this was not possible in view of the objections raised by villagers of Merces, following which construction was stalled.

“It appears from the records that the deceased was under tremendous pressure over the money transactions between the applicant and the deceased himself,” the court said.

COIMBATORE: A goldsmith has been booked for duping a businessman of 211g gold bar.

The Big Bazaar Street (crime) police said they have registered a case against Ravikumar based on a complaint lodged by 57-year-old S Ramasamy, a gold merchant from Kempatti Colony.

“Ramasamy used to give gold bars to goldsmiths for making ornaments. In August 2018, he had given 211g gold bars to Ravikumar. But Ravikumar didn't make gold ornaments. When Ramasamy approached him a few months later to reclaim the gold bars, he feigned ignorance of the same and threatened the gold merchant with dire consequences,” a police officer said.

More than one and half years later, Ramsamy lodged a complaint with the Big Bazaar Street police, who registered a case against Ravikumar under Section 406 (criminal breach of trust), 420 (cheating) and 506(i) (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code.

326,['29/02/2020'],MSEDCL takes action against 40 consumers in Malegaon for power theft,"This story is from February 29, 2020

Nashik: The Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited ( MSEDCL ) officials have taken action on 40 consumers , including one plastic process unit, for illegally tapping power from open sources in Malegaon .

The MSEDCL has earlier snapped power supply of all the 233 units as per the NGT orders; however, the officials said that there were chances of people tapping power from illegal sources. “On the backdrop of the strict guidelines of National Green Tribunals (NGT) the officers in Malegaon did a surprise visit on February 26 to disconnect the power of over 233 plastic process industries. During the visit, one plastic process unit was caught tapping power from illegal sources,” said BK Janvir, chief engineer of MSEDCL, Nashik Zone.

The MSEDCL officials have been keeping a close watch on the unit holders to see if they were relying on some alternate source of power. “Ankush Nale, the regional director of Konkan Region, of which Nashik Zone is a part, visited Malegaon on February 26 and in the surprise visit caught the unit using power. The team of officials also visited other premises – commercial as well as residential – in which the officials found 37 more consumers who were tapping power illegally,” the officer said.

The accused either drew power from the overhead lines, or tapped the same from the nearby distribution points. The power lines drawn from the overhead were even naked at certain points endangering the lives of the people. The underground power lines were also dangerously laid as they were not deep enough to prevent any untoward incident from happening. The lines ran up to 100 meters drawing power from the sources till the house, shop or even other purposes.

All these premises were raided by the team and the penalty was slapped against the guilty parties. “The teams found out that two connections were drawing excessive power than the contract load. The people had connection for residential purpose but that was being used for some other purposes as well, and hence the power consumption was higher. The assessment of the power theft is being further evaluated,” the officer said.

The team was hopeful that the power could be drawn in the night especially in the backdrop of the fact that it was unlikely for any officials to visit there. “The MSEDCL therefore took help of the police department,” the officer said.

Nashik: The Nashik cybercrime police on Wednesday arrested a 24-year-old man from Raver in Jalgaon district in connection with the case of a fake website of the tribal department. The suspect has been accused of cheating several people through it by posting a recruitment drive and seeking money in the form of examination fee.

Identified as Jitendra Rama Tayade, the suspect has been remanded in police custody till March 2 for further investigation.

Devraj Borse, senior police inspector of the cybercrime police station, said that on February 22, an official of the Tribal Development Commissionerate approached them with a complaint stating that a fake website of the department was created under the name https://mahatribal.webs.com.

The official told Borse that the person who had created the fake website had put up an advertisement of a recruitment drive stating that 3,199 posts were to be filled in the tribal department, under which 1,031 were to be filled in Mumbai, 866 in Pune, 724 in Nashik and 578 in Jalgaon.

The conman had also put a certain link on the website to fill the examination form and had also created a link for payment.

Police said that the conman’s aim was to dupe people of their money in the form of accepting examination fees.

PI Borse said that soon after the compliant was lodged, they sought help of the technical analysis wing to determine the location from where the conman was opearating. Working on the lead, police reached the suspect in a matter of three days.

“Tayade is unemployed. On checking his bank account, we found that he had collected Rs 34,000 in the form of examination fees in a matter of few days,” Borse said.

Police said that since the examination fee charged by the conman was somewhere between Rs 350 and Rs 500, the victims did not bother to report the fraud and file a complaint with the police.

Pune: A branded wrist watch of the general manager (44) of a private firm in Dubai was allegedly stolen from the airport in the early hours of Thursday soon after he landed in the city.

The passenger’s Air India Express flight from Dubai (IX 212) reached the Lohegaon airport around 1.30am. He was in the city for meeting his mother.

The Dubai-based manager told TOI over the phone, “I placed my watch, belt and cellphone on a plastic tray of the X-Ray conveyer belt for security check and walked up to the machine for collecting my valuables after I was frisked. I found one of the helpers holding my phone. I took it from him and enquired about my watch because it was not on the tray. He told me he was clueless about it.”

The flyer said, “My phone went missing in just 40 seconds. I reported the incident to the customs officials instantly and appealed them to check other passengers. The officials appealed to passengers to return the phone, but no one responded.”

The manager then asked the officials to show him the CCTV footage and stop the passengers, but they did not consider his request. “After checking the CCTV cameras, the officials told me that they do not cover the conveyer belt. By that time, most of the passengers had left. They told me that the incident could have been averted had I been alert.”

The officials then referred the flyer to the Central Industrial Security Force. “After checking the footage of the CCTV cameras, they expressed doubts about some people and advised me to lodge an FIR,” the flyer said.

Deputy commissioner of customs Motilal Shete said, “The watch got misplaced after the handbag scanning procedure, when the passenger was required to collect it. The customs officers immediately tried to help the passenger to search the watch by seeing CCTV footage. The officers made announcement regarding the misplacement. Even baggage and baggage scanning of passengers present at the location were checked.”

Representative image

HYDERABAD: The forest department has imposed a fine of Rs 53,900 on the executive committee of Indu Fortune Fields Gardenia Apartments for the cutting and translocation of about 36 trees without permission. Some residents, however, contested the move on the grounds that the number of trees cut was much higher.

Sudhakar Reddy, the district forest officer of Medchal, inspected the premises before taking the decision. The department held that while the said trees had been translocated, this was done in an unscientific manner. Stating that the act was in violation of WALTA Act, the department also said that 80 saplings had to be planted for the trees.

Confirming the development to TOI, Satish Duvvuru, general secretary, Indu Fortune Fields Gardenia Apartment Owners Association, said there was no malafide intention behind the move. “Last year, we faced an acute water shortage because of which we decided to make way for an addition water tank. We translocated the trees in the interest of the community,” he said adding all 32 stumps have been translocated. Last week, TOI reported that the trees at apartment complex had been cut in December and translocated a few weeks ago.

K Dasaradhi, a resident and former president of the executive committee of Indu Fortune Fields Gardenia Apartments, contested the fine set by the forest department. He said, “The management cut 55 trees out of which only 32 have been translocated. The forest committee is being very lenient.”

In a complaint to Sreedevi Saraswati, forest range officer, Dulapally, Dasaradhi wrote, “It seems around 30 tree stumps were moved to KBR park, Jubilee Hills and the remaining tree trunks or trees are either moved to an unknown location or may have been sold.”

Another apartment owner, Sreekanth Yenamala said, “This fine is not enough of a deterrent. It will encourage people to continue felling across the city. We will be meeting the forest department officials tomorrow to take this matter more seriously.”

Madurai: While traditional snack items like murukku, kadalai mittai, karachevu and the Geographical Indication (GI) tagged Srivilliputtur palkova have frequently been exported due to their high demand in other countries, it is the first time that Madurai’s famous drink jigarthanda has been flown to Singapore by an Air India flight on Wednesday.

S Thanga Pandian, customs clearance agent, said that traditional Indian sweets were in high demand in other countries and over the past few months, he had seen the exports of not less than 1,000 kg of traditional sweets and snacks being flown from the Madurai airport to various destinations.

The makers of the famous jigarthanda recently received a request from a local trader in Singapore for their jigarthanda. After completion of all formalities, including the FSSAI certification, the first consignment of 135 kg was flown to Singapore on a trial basis on Wednesday.

Pandian said that all the ingredients for jigarthanda including the milk, almond gum, sea algae, sugar and the ice cream for the constitution of the drink were being taken from Madurai. “It is the taste of cow’s milk and the handmade ice cream from Madurai that gives the specific taste to the drink, hence all the ingredients have to be taken from here, only the algae is taken in the dry form and will be soaked once it reaches its destination,” he said.

As the fasting season of Ramzan is coming up, jigarthanda is expected to be in demand in Singapore as it is an energizer and also has cooling properties. Pandian said that based on the reception that the drink receives in Singapore, the frequency of export may be enhanced to even daily.

Pune: The Chatushrungi police late on Thursday night booked 12 people, including the owners and bouncers of a restaurant in Pashan, on the charge of thrashing seven college students following a tiff over playing music.

The seven students suffered injuries in the incident. One of them is undergoing treatment at a hospital. A 20-year-old student from Gokhalenagar has lodged an FIR with the Chatushrungi police.

“The suspects have been booked under sections 323, 324 and326 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons or means) and 143, 148, 149 (rioting) of the Indian Penal Code,” an officer of the Chatushrungi police said.

The incident occurred around 11.50pm when about 100 students were attending the farewell party of their college at the restaurant. “When the restaurant staffers switched off the music, the students requested them to restart it. When they denied, the students had heated arguments with the staffers,” another officer from the Chatushrungi police said.

He said when the students started leaving the place, the owner and the bouncers reached there and started thrashing them with sticks and iron rods. “While some of the students left the spot, others suffered injuries on their heads, backs and legs during the attack,” the officer said.

Assistant inspector of the Chatushrungi police Vishal Pawar is investigating the case.

Restaurant manager lodged cross-complaint

The manager of the restaurant has also lodged a cross-complaint with the Chatushrungi police, alleging that the group of students beat up five employees of the restaurant.

Senior inspector of the Chatushrungi police Anil Shewale told TOI, “We have registered cross-complaints. We are yet to make any arrests as the victims as well as suspects in both the complaints are undergoing treatment.”

Despite repeated calls, the restaurant owner could not be contacted.

Pune: Parents of the children seeking admission to pre-primary sections under the 25% Right To Education (RTE) quota have a task cut out for them.

The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) city unit said there are only 7% seats reserved for the pre-primary sections in the city under the RTE while 93% was reserved for admissions to Standard I and beyond.

An AAP member the 972 schools in Pune district have a total of 17,053 seats reserved under the RTE quota. Of these, 15,638 seats are for admissions to Standard I and beyond.

The state education department had announced in 2015 that schools can choose their own entry level. Several schools across the city said that since the state government stopped reimbursements for RTE students in kindergarten, they decided to recognise Standard 1 as the entry and reserved the maximum seats for the same.

""Schools with pre-primary sections as entry level refuse to admit students under the RTE quota. Parents hoping to send their children to kindergarten under the quota are stuck,"" AAP’s city unit president Mukund Kirdat said.

Parents of beneficiaries said the lack of seats is a cause for concern. “While filling up the forms for admission under RTE in Baner area, I realized that there was no school in my vicinity that offers admissions to pre-primary section,"" Bhagwan Khandare, father of a four-year-old, said.

""Most schools have set standard I as the official entry level for which they would be reimbursed,” director and honorary secretary of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan Nandkumar Kakirde said.

House in Habeeb Nagar where the wall collapsed on Friday

HYDERABAD: Two-year-old Geetha, who sustained injuries after the old wall collapsed on her at her Afzal Sagar house in Habeebnagar on Thursday night, is out of danger but has lost two fingers on her hand.

Her father K Gabbar said Geetha had a close shave. “My two daughters were inside the house along with Roshini, Pavani and Sarika. My elder daughter Geetha sustained head injuries but is conscious and talking to us. She, however, lost two fingers,” he said. Geetha was shifted to Osmania General Hospital.

The younger daughter, who was sleeping a little away from the wall, escaped without any injuries, said Gabbar, brother of Mithai Lal. Mithai’s three daughters had died when the wall crumbled.

K Ganesh, who runs a kirana shop, said the houses in the locality were old. “Some of them were constructed in 1982 and some in 1993. Most of the dwellings are rickety,” he said.

A resident said roofs in some of the houses often fall off. Recently, a portion of the roof in a house collapsed but luckily, there was nobody present at that time, he recalled.

“In 2001, a similar accident occurred and five persons had died after a wall collapsed on them. Then chief minister Chandrababu Naidu visited our basthi,” recalled Tirath Lal, a resident.

Locals said they were promised double-bedroom houses by the Telangana government but nothing much has happened. “Officials said 2BHK houses will be built in Mangar Basthi and issued notices in 2015 asking us to vacate our dwellings. The foundation stone was laid but nothing has happened since then,” S Laxman, a local said.

He said they met the collector and revenue officials. “But, there has been no word on the houses,” he complained.

It was decided not to exempt the requirement of house owners staying in the PG accommodation. However, shortly a new category will be introduced in which owners can rent out buildings for hostels after meeting the statutory stipulations, he said.UT adviser Manoj Parida said the policy was revised keeping in view the need for accommodation of students in private houses and their safety and security. He clarified that the intention is not to close down the PGs but to get them regularised through registration. The deputy commissioner had opened the registration counters at the UT estate office. They will remain open even on Saturday and Sunday this week, he said.The administration will soon start accepting online applications for the registration. Those premises which do not have occupation certificates will be allowed provisional registration, subject to the condition that they will obtain occupation certificate within three months. The administration has also allowed the PGs to operate on the undertaking that necessary fire clearance will be obtained within a month, an official said.In a bid to reduce the woes of students, the administration has allowed various bhawans located in the city to accommodate them on a payment basis. Similarly, the colleges have been told to accommodate students evicted from illegal PGs temporarily in spaces or dormitories available. The UT engineering department has already started construction of hostels for 6,000 students in colleges located in sectors 42, 46 and 50.The DC has directed that all applications for registrations be cleared within two days, so that the house owners do not have to run around various offices.

Nashik: Members of parliament Hemant Godse (Nashik) and Bharti Pawar (Dindori) on Friday asked the authorities to present their reports about the road construction , power supply and other issues.

Addressing the District Development Coordination and Monitoring Committee (DISHA) meeting, convened by the district committee, the MPs expressed their displeasure on lack of developmental works in the rural areas by the government agencies – especially the construction of roads and processing of government aide for the destitute under Sanjay Gandhi Niradhar Yojana, etc.

The meeting, which was also attended by district collector Suraj Mandhare, ZP president Balasaheb Kshirsagar and Zilla Parishad CEO Leena Bansod, saw representatives being unhappy with the agencies for failing to construct the roads despite government making all efforts to improve the connectivity. “There are villages with more than 250 people living in there but there are no road connections forcing the people to walk and trek,” one of the members said.

MP Hemant Godse questioned the officers about the construction of the road on which the officers present were unable to give a proper explanation. They were asked to furnish the information about the same at the earliest.

MP Bharti Pawar noted that the numbers of the beneficiaries of various government schemes including the help for the destitute, people with disabilities, etc were far less in Kalwan and Deola taluka. She said that people were forced to make repetitive rounds of the respective offices for getting the necessary help.

The issue of the government grant for the toilet blocks also came up during the meeting. While 7,264 toilet blocks were constructed in Nashik city limits, there were about 13,000 constructed in the rural areas. The members raised the issue of expediting the clearance of dues to the beneficiaries.

The members also demanded that MSEDCL raise the electricity infrastructure in Trimbakeshwar to Dahalewadi but the forest department land is becoming a hurdle in the process. “We are in consultation with the forest officials for the permission,” the MSEDCL officers assured.

Pune: Savitribai Phule Pune University’s Joyita Sarkar was one of the 21 people and the only one from an educational institute in the state to be awarded by President Ramnath Kovind for her role in science communication and popularisation on the National Science Day in New Delhi on Friday.

She received 'Augmenting Writing Skills for Articulating Research' (AWSAR) award for her science story, 'Coming soon: Animal model-free system for Pharmaceutical Testing', which she penned as a postdoctoral research fellow of the SPPU's physics department. Since January this year, she has been working as an assistant professor at the Institute of Chemical Technology's Marathwada campus.

“It was a great and motivational experience to receive an award from the President. But I hope this is the beginning of many such achievements, and not just once-in-a-lifetime thing,” said an elated Sarkar.

“I had applied for the award in October but forgot about it,” she said.

“The aim of the AWSAR award, as envisioned by Ashutosh Sharma, secretary, Department of Science and Technology, is to convey what scientists are doing in their labs to the common public,” said Sarkar.

Explaining her work, Sarkar said, “Before coming to the market, pharmaceutical drugs are tested on animals. It is very unethical and results are sometimes erroneous because despite having similar systems, we are different from them.

“In today’s day and age, when we are so aware of animal rights, using them for testing a drug that will be used by humans, is wrong. So, multiple research works are going on to build a system which can effectively test medicines that can then be used by humans.”

Sarkar turned this into a story about an imaginary world where all the animals are free and happy in the wild. “The copyright of the story belongs to DST,” she said.

Nagpur: The directorate general of GST Intelligence (DGGSTI) has registered yet another case of tax collected from the customers, but not passed on to the government. Following a raid on Mascot Motors, a two-wheeler agency, the taxmen have found a default of Rs18.50 crore towards GST. Dues pending since March 2019 were not cleared.

The tax component was recovered from customers during sale of vehicles but was not deposited to the government exchequer. Mascot Motors has paid up Rs16.70 crore after the raid, with rest of the amount expected to be recovered soon.

This is second such action against auto dealers in the last one year. In September 2019, the DGGSTI had pulled up five luxury car dealers for similar reasons. GST dues to the tune of Rs25.04 crore were recovered after a raid at that time.

339,['29/02/2020'],Bus accident survivors from Nepal stranded in Salem,"This story is from February 29, 2020

Omalur (Salem): More than a week has lapsed since the tragic incident in which nine pilgrims from Nepal were killed after an omnibus rammed the minibus that they were travelling in near Omalur on Salem-Bengaluru National Highway. While the two drivers and tour agent in the minibus escaped unhurt, life hasn’t been any easy for them since the incident, with them spending the days in the damaged bus. On Thursday, two victims, who were discharged from the government hospital in Salem, have also joined the trio in the bus, which is stationary on Omalur police station premises.

Talking to TOI, 51-year-old tour agent Amarnath Chowdri said they had to be on the police station premises to complete the formalities. “The inquiry is going on. We have to submit documents such as vehicle registration certificate and insurance papers to police.”

While he was in the company of drivers Kaluram Chowdri, 38, and Anil Chowdri, 36, so far, they were joined by 65-year-old Baglu Chowdri and his wife Daithin Cowdri, 62, who were discharged from hospital, on Thursday.

All the five occupants of the bus are left with no other option, but to cook and bathe on the police station premises. The Omalur police have, however, allowed them to use bathrooms in the station.

Deputy superintendent of police M Baskaran said they hadn’t forced the trio to stay in the vehicle itself. “We had arranged a marriage hall for them to stay, but they declined our offer. It seems they are afraid to accept any help from us. Language is also a barrier and it has affected the inquiry too.”

Amarnath Chowdri, meanwhile, expressed hope that they would be able to leave for Nepal with fellow passengers in a couple of weeks. “It will take at least a week for us to reach our native place.”

It was on February 20 that the minibus, with 32 people on board, met with the accident. While four people were killed on the spot, two others died in the hospital the same day. The toll rose to 7 on February 21, when another critically injured died in the Salem government hospital. Another injured, meanwhile, breathed his last in a private hospital in Chennai on February 23 and the ninth victim died in a private hospital in Coimbatore on February 25.

Now, five injured are undergoing treatment in the Salem Government Mohan Kumaramangalam Medical College and Hospital, one in a private hospital in Salem and 12 others in private hospitals in Coimbatore and Chennai. Their condition is said to be stable.

K Chandrasekhar Rao

HYDERABAD: With income from various sources drying up and economic slowdown casting a shadow on revenues, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Friday asked senior officials to focus on income-generating measures.

Towards this end, highly-placed sources said the government is certainly going to jack up the stamps and registration duty, power tariff and municipal tax.

Worried with the fact that implementation of various government schemes and programmes could face rough weather, the chief minister urged the officials to rejig their plans to mop up revenues.

The government would focus on sale of land, particularly at Kokapet where decks have been cleared. Officials are expecting to net Rs 2,500 crore this year from the Kokapet land sale.

“Increase in taxes and fees in various forms will help the state generate more income,” officials said. It was also felt that any increase in municipal taxes may not provide direct relief to the government exchequer. “But, the local bodies stand to gain and execute various schemes locally,” an official said.

The chief minister, who also reviewed the state budget proposals with finance officials, asked them to look out for ways and means to get more funding and support for the state schemes from the Centre.

Loan waiver scheme and Rythu Bandhu are set to get a major chunk of funding in the budget. Sources said the discussion on budget would continue for three more days before allocations are finalised.

According to sources, the budget session will begin either on March 6 or March 9. The budget would be introduced on the second day of the session, officials said.

Malkajgiri MP A Revanth Reddy

HYDERABAD: Congress working president and Malkajgiri MP A Revanth Reddy on Friday filed a petition in the Telangana High Court seeking increased security with central forces.

He alleged threat to his life from chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao and businessman and managing director of My Home Construction Pvt. Ltd, Jupally Rameshwar Rao, against whom he had filed PILs.

In his petition, Revanth named Union home secretary, Telangana, state principal secretary (Home) and Rameshwar Rao, who is also said to be close to the TRS, as respondents. “Before the bifurcation of the united state of Andhra Pradesh , there were physical attacks on me and due to the threats, I was provided 3+3 security. The chief minister of Telangana, in the assembly, openly proclaimed that an operation like Operation Blue Star would terminate me. I have been implicated in a false case. My security cover was reduced to 2+2 from 3+3 in 2016,” he told the high court.

Revanth said that he had filed several PILs on controversial issues involving TRS leaders. “I had filed a PIL in 2018 against the allotment of prime lands to Rameshwar Rao in and around Hyderabad. I filed another PIL against the ruling party in allotting the land in the prime locality of Hyderabad near IT Hub to IKEA on nomination basis without calling for tenders, causing loss of nearly Rs 400 crore to the public exchequer. I filed another petition seeking CBI enquiry into garnering of huge funds by the TRS leaders in the name of Bangaru Coolie,” he said.

He added that the ruling party leaders who collected the amount in the name of Bangaru Coolie received notices from the Income Tax Department.

Nashik: The farmers in the Samruddhi belt on Friday met with the district collector Suraj Mandhare and demanding better service roads for the residents travelling across the Nagpur-Mumbai Super Communication Expressway.

The farmers led by local member of legislative assembly Manik Kokate met the collector to draw his attention towards hardships faced by them. The farmers hailed from Manegaon, Pandhurli, Shivade, Jaypraskash Nagar, Marhal, Gonde, Sonambe and many other districts.

The farmers said that the current condition of the roads is because of the heavy vehicles transporting construction equipment and goods. “The roads have huge pits. The two wheeler and four wheelers find it difficult to negotiate the road resulting into accidents,” the farmers said.

The officials of Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC), who are behind the construction of the Samruddhi Expressway, assured the farmers that they will look into the matter. “The engineers will survey the roads and look for some engineering solution by compacting soil for people to travel safely,” a senior MSRDC officer said.

The farmers also raised the issues of constant water-pipeline bursts. “The contractors repair the pipelines immediately. Introduction of utility ducts after every 500 meter section will be constructed and the pipelines will be connected as long term solution by the corporation,” the MSRDC officer said.

Another major demand was of the underpasses and services roads, to which the officers said that the underpasses were already planned for the sections and as far as the service roads were concerned they would be constructed as per the demands only, the officer added.

343,['29/02/2020'],"Rain in some places, but cloudy sky for Pune with 34 degree Celsius day temperature","This story is from February 29, 2020

Only partly cloudy sky conditions have been forecast for Pune during the weekend (File photo)

PUNE: Isolated parts of Madhya Maharashtra, Marathwada and Vidarbha may witness lightning and very light to light rain on Saturday and Sunday. But neither will Pune city nor the district get any rain.

Only partly cloudy sky conditions have been forecast for Pune during the weekend, with day temperatures of around 34 degree Celsius.

India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Friday said due to the convergence of lower level easterlies and westerlies, isolated to scattered rainfall with isolated thunderstorm/hailstorm was likely over Madhya Pradesh, Vidarbha and Chhattisgarh on February 29 and March 1.

Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather, IMD, Pune clarified that these would be related to moisture incursion due to the western disturbances over north India as well as the confluence of easterly and westerly winds. The confluence zone of these winds would be over Vidarbha, Madhya Pradesh and Chhatisgarh mainly.

An IMD forecast on Friday said, lightning could occur at isolated places over Marathwada on Saturday, while a thunderstorm accompanied with lightning, hail and gusty wind (speed reaching 30-40 kmph) could occur at isolated places over east Vidarbha on March 1, among some other parts of the country.

No lightning or thunderstorm occurrences have been forecast over Madhya Maharashtra during the weekend, except very light rains possibility at isolated places in the region.

Kashyapi said by Friday evening, this interaction had already started and began to show its effect by partially increasing the cloud cover over parts of Maharashtra.

“Since the westerlies and easterlies will be the two dominating wind flows, which will have interaction over the state, night temperatures (which had fallen significantly of late) will start to rise from Friday once again. The clouding may cause a slight dip in day temperatures, temporarily. Slowly, by March 1-2, the interaction zone will shift eastwards, but some clouding would continue to occur over parts of Maharashtra thereafter too,” Kashyapi said.

344,['29/02/2020'],"Delhi: Pay professional tax if you earn Rs 50,000 a month","This story is from February 29, 2020

SDMC is hoping to earn Rs 50 crore from the move

NEW DELHI: After rejecting the commissioner’s proposal for four years, the standing committee of South Delhi Municipal Corporation ( SDMC ) on Friday decided to impose a professional tax on everybody with a monthly gross income of Rs 50,000 and above under its jurisdiction.

As per the move, those with a gross income of up to Rs 50,000 will have to pay Rs 1,800 annually or Rs 150 per month as the professional tax, and those earning above Rs 50,000 will be charged Rs 2,400 annually or Rs 200 monthly. The tax will be charged even if the person doesn’t live in the SDMC areas but works there. Traders will remain outside the ambit of this tax.

The SDMC commissioner had proposed the tax in the four consecutive budgets, including the current one that was passed last December. But the BJP-dominated deliberative wing rejected it every time. On Friday, the standing committee, however, argued that the move had become necessary after Delhi government drastically reduced the corporation’s grants, increasing its financial burden. SDMC is hoping to earn Rs 50 crore from the move.

Refuting any link to BJP’s loss in the recent assembly elections, standing committee chairman Bhupender Gupta said the proposal was in the pipeline for a long time. “We don’t believe in the concept of freebies and the decision is an attempt towards making the civic agency self-dependent. In case of unauthorised colonies, too, we want to collect property taxes at least from 2019,” he claimed.

“Every service-class person, including professionals such as lawyers and chartered accountants, working out of offices in the SDMC areas will have to pay the tax. They may not be living here but still use our services every day,” said Gupta.

The proposal will now be placed before the corporation’s House and if approved, it will be implemented from April 1, 2020. “We are working on arrangements to collect the tax. It will be either added to the property tax bill or collected annually in bulk from offices after its deduction in bulk from salaries,” said a senior official.

“The tax is already levied in 21 cities, including Mumbai. With no funds from Delhi government, we are left with no choice now. Even our recent file submitted to the government for releasing a Rs 500-crore grant due from the last quarter has been kept aside,” he alleged.

Pune: Surveillance has been stepped in three districts — Aurangabad, Hingoli and Parbhani — in Maharashtra since the beginning of this year after four horses tested positive for glanders, a highly infectious and often fatal zoonotic disease.

“Being a zoonotic disease, the persistence of glanders poses a potential threat to occupationally exposed human beings, especially equine handlers and veterinarians. Therefore, targeted surveillance of human population in affected areas of the district is recommended,” surveillance officer Pradip Awate of the state health department said.

The animal husbandry department (AHD)'s Disease Investigation Section (DIS) has identified 13 cases of the glanders infection in horses in six districts — Aurangabad, Hingoli, Parbhani, Buldhana, Akola and Thane — between April 1, 2019 and February 15, 2020.

""Blood samples of two persons in Hingoli, living in proximity to infected horses, have been sent to the National Research Centre on Equines in Hisar (Haryana) to rule out infection after they complained of minor illness,” Vinayak Viithal Limaye, joint commissioner of AHD and head of the DIS, told TOI.

“This is just a part of our surveillance. There is no need to panic as glanders has not been reported in humans in the recent past,"" he said.

Surveillance has been intensified around stables and animal sheds in the state’s affected districts to prevent the bacterial infection from affecting human beings.

The symptoms of the glanders disease in human beings include fever with chills and sweating, muscle aches, chest pain and muscle tightness, among others.

Limaye said, “Since April last year, we have detected glanders in indigenous horses used for drawing carts and in marriage ceremonies. Thoroughbreds used in horse-racing events showed no symptoms. The disease gets detected when owners of the ailing horses seek help of veterinarians.”

""Blood samples of around 2,500 to 3,000 animals — mainly horses, mules and donkeys — are drawn and tested for glanders, annually, as part of surveillance in the state,"" Limaye said.

NAGPUR: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has slapped a fine of Rs2.46 lakh for loss of drinking water drom damaged pipeline, and also warned of filing FIR over non-restoration of trenches made by an MSEDCL contractor for laying power cables. The contractor has already started restoration of trenches , though with inferior quality work.

TOI had, on February 20, reported NMC did not levy fine and initiate any action against a MSEDCL contractor for damaging drinking water pipeline and leaving trenches without restoration in Sonegaon , Sahakar Nagar, Trimurti Nagar, Swavlambi Nagar etc.

Taking serious cognisance of TOI report, municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe , known as a no-nonsense IAS officer, directed chief engineer Ulhas Debadwar to take appropriate action. Debadwar directed NMC Laxmi Nagar Zone officials to take appropriate action and ensure restoration of trenches.

The MSEDCL contractor had damaged drinking water pipeline while laying power cables on newly constructed cement road at Sahakar Nagar on January 22. TOI had reported this and also alerted officials from NMC Laxmi Nagar Zone.

NMC Water Works Department on February 21 issued a letter to MSEDCL, asking it to direct its contractor to deposit fine of Rs2.46 lakh in NMC’s account for loss of drinking water.

On February 25, NMC public works department issued a letter to MSEDCL executive engineer warning of FIR if trenches are not restored. The department also warned of fixing responsibility on MSEDCL in case of any incident due to the trenches.

On Friday, MSEDCL contractor started restoration of trenches at Sahakar Nagar and Sonegaon. In HB Estate, Sonegaon, the contractor has restored trenches in residential area.

The contractor had removed tiles and dug up newly constructed footpath along cement concrete road at Sahakar Nagar for laying cables. The footpath was restored on Friday.

Unfortunately, the contractor replaced the tiles removed from the same spot, and some of them were broken. Also, the surface layer of footpath has become undulating due to shoddy quality work. People, especially senior citizens and children, may get injured due to undulating surface and broken tiles.

NMC had concretized the road and constructed footpath a couple of months ago.

Debadwar has also directed engineers of NMC public works department not to give permission for trenching roads before restoration of earlier trenches. He warned of action against engineers if his orders are not followed.

The team serving food at NIMS hospital in Panjagutta

HYDERABAD: By day, they are either accountants, engineers, trainers or photographers. But come 5 pm, they shun this professional avatar and take on the role of ‘food soldiers’ -- delivering a hot plate of dinner to thousands of people across hospitals, orphanages and old-age homes in Hyderabad.

But this isn’t the only noble deed that the ‘No Food Waste’ team does every day. This band of orange t-shirt-clad men and women also ensure that the city wastes as little food as possible.

“The food we distribute is collected from functions, corporate events. Every time we get a call from the organisers, informing us about excess food, our volunteers go there and collect it,” said K Venkata Murali, who started the Hyderabad chapter of the group, which took roots in Coimbatore, three-and-half years ago. In between serving a plate of rice, dal and vegetable curry to an old man outside NIMS, he said they get at least 25 to 30 calls (for food collection) every day. The quantity is enough to feed at least 2,000 to 3,000 people.

Every item on the menu is personally tasted, for quality, by the volunteers before being served. “We check the food while collecting and also at regular intervals as we travel around the city,” said 54-year-old Murali who runs an IT firm. Though there are enough good Samaritans supporting his team of 250 volunteers, the donations, he added, are never in cash. “Some corporate firms sponsored our vans…we have a network of hotels that donate food regularly. A kind-hearted lady gives us 200 rotis every day. That’s how we function,” he said tracing back to that Karthika Masam of 2016 when the idea struck him. He realised people starved during that period and started by encouraging friends and family to donate that saved rice to the poor.

“This food is so much better than the Rs 5 meal served near the hospital. It is tasty and fulfilling. Also, they feed us with a lot of compassion,” said Zeenat Begum of Jeedimetla, living at the free shelter at NIMS for over a week. Also in the crowded dorm was 70-year-old B Dasari who teared up as he hoped more people did such “good deeds” for the poor. “Of course, the food is very tasty as well,” the Mahabubabad resident said.

Nashik: Mayor Satish Kulkarni on Friday said that many traffic junctions in the city are faulty and the works done so far on those junctions are not satisfactory.

Kulkarni appealed to the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) and Nashik Municipal Smart City Development Corporation Ltd (NMSCDCL) to resolve the issue.

The mayor was addressing a gathering during the inaugural session of the Smart City conclave attended by officials of different smart cities of the country.

He said that the traffic chaos is a major problem in the city and it seems to be increasing every day.

“Though the commissioner of police Vishwas Nangare-Patil has been monitoring the city traffic, the problem is still continuing,” said mayor Kulkarni.

Commissioner of police Vishwas Nangare Patil, district collector Suraj Mandhare, municipal commissioner Radhakrishna Game, ZP CEO Leena Bansod, NMSCDCL CEO Prakash Thavil and officials from other smart cities were present at the inaugural session of the Smart City conclave.

“Smart cities and smart policing is the need of the time. Smart policing is the goal given by the government to the police machinery. We are facing a lot of challenges like security, terrorism, law and order, and other problems. Smart cities should work on how these problems can be worked out,” said Nangare-Patil.

Mandahre said that Nashik district will be completing 150 years and the liveability index of the city is better than other cities across the country. The target for smart cities should be to make the cities more liveable, he said.

Apart from the smart cities, Focus should also be on smart villages, he said. The development as a whole will not take place unless the villages are not developed, he said.

He added that people should be put in the centre of development to in order to achieve our goals.

Municipal commissioner Radhakrishna Game and NMSCDCL Prakash Thavil informed about the ongoing smart city projects in the city.

The discussion was held on smart and sustainable cities, the future of smart cities, intelligence solutions for non-revenue water, connected and integrated eco-system for smart cities related to infrastructure, transportation and mobility.

After Thackeray declared implementation of the Census and National Population Register (NPR) processes in the state, Thorat had tweeted and shared a video on the social media opposing its implementation in the state and that an all-party meet would be held to take a call on the issue.

“We had one meeting on the issue with our alliance partners. But no decision was taken. We will have another meeting, during which we will raise our concerns about the NPR that will be the base for the National Register of Citizens (NRC),” Thorat told TOI.

“The Congress party is opposed to anything that causes discrimination in society. There seems to be some hidden agenda of the Centre to forcefully go ahead with Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and NPR in the wake of rampant violence in many parts of the country,” he said.

A senior Congress leader said a resolution should be passed in the ongoing assembly session, like what happened in Bihar, where the BJP is in power with the JD(U), on the issue. The Bihar Assembly unanimously passed a resolution favouring caste-based census in 2021 on Thursday, two days after expressing a united resolve that the NPR exercise be done strictly according to its 2010 format.

Thorat said the CAA in its present form was “divisive”, unlike its 2003 format. He said, “Why should ancestral details be sought for the CAA exercise?”

Hyderabad: The Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) has proposed increased association with Japanese industries and academia as well as research laboratories as part of its collaboration with the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).

While various projects were undertaken under Phase 1, which will conclude in March this year, Phase 2 will will place greater emphasis on exchange of PhD students as well as joint post-graduation and PhD programmes.

The collaboration began in August 2007 and JICA initiated a project for ‘future researchers at IIT-H to enhance network development with scholarship from Japan’ (FRIENDSHIP) in July 2010.

Speaking about the collaborations, IIT-H director Prof BS Murty said, “With the current FRIENDSHIP project ending soon, we are enthusiastically looking forward to Phase 2 of the project so that we can continue with our collaboration and take it to greater heights for the benefit of both Japan and India.”

The institute received significant assistance for research in five areas — next generation communication technologies, design and manufacturing, sustainable development, environment and energy and nano technology and nano science.

The JICA also supported the construction of buildings and procurement of equipment necessary for high-end research.

353,['29/02/2020'],Detailed land acquisition plan for Purandar airport within a week,"This story is from February 29, 2020

Pune: The land acquisition officers are expected to submit a detailed plan to the district collector next week, charting out the area required from seven villages in Purandar for the proposed international airport.

A source in the district administration said the work was on to chart out the detailed plan on the land required from each village with survey numbers. “The detailed plan, as per discussions and the land required, would be submitted to Pune collector. He will take forward the land acquisition process in the coming month after holding talks with the villagers,” an official said.

The land for the proposed airport would be acquired from Pargaon, Kumbharvalan, Ekhatpur, Munjwadi, Khanvadi, Vanpuri and Udachiwadi.

On Thursday, Pune collector Naval Kishore Ram had told TOI that the land acquisition process for the new airport would start from the next month after the Maharashtra Airport Development Company (MADC) — the Special Planning Authority of the project — shared the detailed land acquisition plan. The direct purchase method has been put forth as a quicker system for the land acquisition. The collector also said the process should be completed within six months.

The district administration officials claimed that they would be checking the sales and transactions in the area for the past three years to understand the realty sector there and the ready reckoner rate.

“While deciding the compensation amount for each hectare of land, the ready reckoner would be considered as the base rate. The sales and transactions in the area as well as people’s demands would also be taken into count before finalising the rates,” said another official.

The landowners, who had earlier staged protest against the land acquisition for the greenfield airport project, are still firm on not parting with their land. Pargaon sarpanch Bapu Memane said they had been opposing the project for the past three years.

“The sudden announcement of starting the acquisition from the next month is alarming. We shall not allow any land acquisition and take extreme measures if the government does not heed to our request,” he said.

The landowners have decided to hold a joint meeting of all the seven villages in the coming days to draw up the action plan to protest against the acquisition.

Many plot owners in the villages feel that they might be neglected because government is only discussing land being acquired from farmers. While the government has iterated that no land occupying houses would be acquired, adjacent plot to the land acquired may face an issue, stressed the plot owners. “Do the plot owners of such land stand to get any benefits and can they be likely partners for the airport project,” asked many people. Jobs and other issues too are being raised.

Edited | Aishani

Nashik: The district administration has handled 7.80 lakh Right to Service (RTS) applications since April 1 2019, said Suraj Mandhare, the collector of Nashik.

The administration claims to have resolved 7.20 lakh applications filed in person or through online. Though most of them were online.

“The inflow of the applications through the RTS has been tremendous and every application has been followed closely to ensure that the applicants do not have to worry about the delay or unnecessary visits to the collectorate,” the district collector said.

There were 56,297 applications which were delayed till February 25, the collector said. The delays amounted to less than 8% of the applications

He added that the administration was keen on analysing the causes for the delay.

“Since there have been delays overtly, the RTS has come into the picture. There should be no delays at all, hence we are keen to find out the reasons,” collector said.

The collector pointed out that after the delays, the system would be strengthened and there will be an increase in efficiency.

“Our target is to improve the system and hence after analysing the things, it will be put in to place. Those performing best would be felicitated by the administration in order to encourage others. Those lagging behind shall get an opportunity to improve and they will also be given tools to improve their performance,” the collector added.

The income certificates are the most sought from the revenue department. As many as 4.05 lakh applications were received by the administration.

Similarly, there were 1.44 lakh applications related to age, nationality and domicile certificates.

The third service to top the chart was caste certificates in which 1.37 lakh applications were received.

The revenue department of Nashik district with its office ranging from a talathi of a village, to a circle officer – who overlooks a set of villages, to the office of tahsildar (executive magistrate), the sub-divisional officer, and the district collectorate, have collectively received the 7.80 lakh applications from the citizens in the district.

Picture used for representational purpose only

NEW DELHI: Electricity may become costlier for people living in south Delhi from the next financial year. South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) on Friday passed a proposal to increase the electricity tax , which is added to the final bill.

Standing committee chairman Bhupender Gupta said the proposal to increase the electricity tax from 5% to 6% will soon be forwarded to the House for approval. “We have decided to increase it by 1% to get more funds for development work. SDMC is burdened due to reduced financial assistance from Delhi government,” Gupta added.

As per Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, electricity firms or power discoms have to collect the electricity tax on behalf of the municipality, while other agencies or individuals consuming electricity are supposed to pay this tax directly to the corporation.

An SDMC official said that the proposal specifies the maximum increase, properties to be taxed, exemptions and system of assessment to be adopted.

“The ultimate burden of this tax will be transferred to residents or Delhi government (in case of subsidised bills),” said a senior south corporation official.

Once the proposal is approved in the House meeting, SDMC will forward it to the state government for final approval. “After its approval, we will give direction to the power discoms to increase the tax rates,” said an official.

With the increased electricity tax, SDMC is expecting to generate Rs 30 crore extra annually.

The company had managed the parking lots from June 2017 to Feb 2019

CHANDIGARH: The municipal corporation (MC) has issued a notice to a private company managing the paid parking lots from June 2017 to February 2019 to pay a penalty of Rs 99.78 lakh for violating the terms and condition of the agreement in operating 25 paid parking lots and the underground multi-level parking lot in Sector 17.

The notice mentioned that the penalty amount is subject to the outcome of the case that Arya Toll Infra Limited has filed against the civic body in the Punjab and Haryana high court.

The civic body has written to the company numerous times on different issues like bounced cheques or non-payment. The MC offices had also called the representatives of the company in the past for a meeting but the financial issue was not resolved.

The penalty notice said, “It is intimated to you that you have not deposited the amount of penalties imposed from time to time on breach of terms and condition of the agreement till date. The amount of notices issued to you (without interest) comes to Rs 88.06 lakh. Further, an amount of Rs 11.72 lakh (without interest) is also liable to be deposited by you on account of inspection,” the notice said.

“You are required to deposit the outstanding amount of Rs 99.78 lakh (without interest) and interest will be charged up to realization of amount as per the terms and condition of agreement subject to the final outcome of the civil writ petition in the Punjab and Haryana high court...” the notice said.

The implementation of smart features in the smart parking had caused friction between the MC and Arya Toll Infra Limited. The general house of the MC had constituted a committee led by the then municipal councillor Rajbala Malik to inspect the parking lots. The committee in its report had pointed out that there were no smart features in the parking lots as committed in the tender document. On the other hand, representatives of Arya Toll Infra Limited had accused the MC of noncooperation, claiming the civic body had failed to stop illegal parking leading to revenue loss.

PANAJI: Police on Thursday searched a cafe and hostel at Ashvem and arrested two persons for running a drug den. Five foreigners who had been staying there without filling up police verification forms were detained.

After the raid, which resulted in the seizure of ganja and charas from the premises, North Goa SP Utkrisht Prasoon said the state’s police force had zero tolerance for drug trafficking.

Anti-narcotic cell SP Shobit Saxena said the raid was conducted soon after police received information that one person had been operating a cafe and hostel that allowed foreigners to stay without police verification.

“When police personnel reached the spot, they noticed that the owner of the cafe and hostel had laid a table where foreigners sat and consumed drugs ,” Saxena said, adding that the two persons arrested in the case were both non-Goan.

“The owner was found to be keeping foreigners without submitting the requisite ‘C Form’. The deputy collector has been requested to lock down and seal the said premises,” Saxena further said.

A picture of the tiger captured by a motorist in Jainath mandal

HYDER ABAD: Authorities of the forest department on Friday began efforts to monitor the movement of a tiger and ensure that there is no man-animal conflict after the sighting of the animal created a flutter in certain villages of Jainath mandal in Adilabad earlier this week.

Adilabad forest divisional officer V Chandrasekhar Rao told TOI that they have deployed 30 forest guards and divided them into teams in the border areas of the village. “We have deployed our personnel and are conducting awareness drives in the villages. We have warned people against venturing out alone early in the morning or late evenings because that is usually the time when most wild animals are active. Since the tiger has attacked a cow, we are ensuring that cattle grazers don’t venture into the fields,” said Rao.

Forest officials further said that there was nothing to worry about as the forest officials are taking all necessary measures to keep the villagers and the tiger safe. “There is no need to panic because the tiger was just passing by the village towards Sathnala reserve forest. Sathnala project itself is a huge forest area spread across nearly one lakh acres which is directly connected to Kawal Tiger Reserve. So, the tiger may have already crossed the villages and moved into Kawal,” said Rao.

Experts said that the growing tiger population in Tipeshwar in Maharashtra, a tiger reserve just across the Telangana border along NH-7, about 20 km north of Adilabad, is leading to an increase in big cats from neighbouring states crossing over into Telangana. “Tigers migrating to Telangana is a good sign. Villagers in these areas need not panic. Tigers are not going to stay in these forest patches for long or make it their home,” said Mirza Kareem Baig, a member of the Forest and Wildlife Protection Society (FAWPS).

Baig said that the forest patches in Adilabad are just a passage for tigers moving from Tipeshwar to Kawal Tiger Reserve. “There are more than 20 tigers in Tipeshwar, which is very high, according to the area of the reserve which is spread across 140 sq km. This could be a reason why the tigers are entering Telangana,” said Baig, adding that the only thing the state needs to do is make the high tiger movement routes safe for these animals.

HYDERABAD: The Congress , referring to Delhi riots , on Friday charged the BJP of taking revenge against the people of Delhi for defeating it in the recently concluded assembly elections.

Telangana Congress spokespersons G Niranjan and Addanki Dayakar among others demanded a probe into the alleged role of the BJP’s ‘private army’ in Delhi violence .

They reiterated the demand made by Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi that Union home minister Amit Shah should resign for failing to keep law and order under control in Delhi. The police in Delhi is under the control of the central government and not the Delhi government. “Cases should be booked against the BJP and MIM leaders for their provocative statements,” Dayakar said.

Dayakar said the BJP has brought the situation to such a state that some of the saffron party leaders are openly praising Nathuram Godse, who killed Mahatma Gandhi.

Nashik: The standing committee of the Nashik Municipal Corporation ( NMC ) on Friday gave its nod to appoint Ahmedabad-based private IT firm for operating the Intelligent Transport Management System (ITMS) for city bus service .

The Amnex Infotechnologies Pvt Ltd will operate the city bus service for five years at a total cost of Rs 22 crore.

Four IT firms had filed bids for operating the city bus service after the municipal corporation had issued a tender for the purpose. After much consideration, the civic administration finalised the Ahmedabad-based IT firm and tabled the proposal in the standing committee meeting.

The ITMS will help the municipal corporation locate its buses through the GPS system and will help to keep a tab on the revenue collected through bus fare as ticket machines will be mapped online.

Moreover, the system will also help to know the exact location of the buses and the routes they take. This new system will also help the NMC to know if the buses are delayed or running behind schedule.

In addition, the buses will be equipped with an LED display and public announcement system through which the passengers in the buses as well as those waiting for the buses at the terminals and bus stops will be able to get information about the vehicle, its routes, etc.

The NMC plans to operate 400 buses through private agencies. Of these 400 buses, 200 will be CNG, 150 electric and 50 will run on diesel.

The municipal corporation has already finalised three agencies to operate these buses in the city. The civic administration has also given a letter of intent to the selected agencies; however, the further process was stopped due to the model code of conduct enforced due to the state assembly elections last year.

Civic officials said that the municipal corporation will soon start the process of deploying the selected agencies for operating buses in the city.

People from Chand Bagh and Khajuri Khas have taken refuge in the neighbourhood colony of Chandu Nagar

NEW DELHI: Over the last few days, Chandu Nagar , a small neighbourhood in northeast Delhi has become a “temporary” refugee colony. Each one of the 60 houses here has virtually been converted into a bunker, well-stocked with essentials and medicines.

The colony’s entry point has been barricaded with bamboo sticks and young men keep a watchful eye on outsiders. But despite the restrictions on entry, residents of the area are a welcoming lot, having opened their hearts and homes to over 800 strangers from Chand Bagh and Khajuri Khas. These newcomers to the colony are victims of riots that have left behind a trail of destruction in the past few days.

When TOI visited the neighbourhood, Mohammad Ishaq and his wife, Nasreena, had been living there for the last three days. As mobs ran amok, the couple suspected that they would be the next target. They just had a few seconds to decide the next course of action. They used that time to convince their eldest daughter and son to flee to their paternal aunt’s house. They could not escape with their children because of their youngest son, two-year-old Liyan, and the elderly in the family.

“We took our children to the terrace and they climbed on to other people’s rooftops to escape the area,” Nasreen said. The 35-year-old has not had a chance to meet her children since then. “We have spoken to them on phone. But we have not seen them for the last five days because nobody can leave their homes. We feel extremely unsafe,” said Nasreen.

According to the couple, they only managed to escape later in the day when several men from the neighbouring Chandu Nagar came to their colony aided by policemen. “When we heard about the attack, we made several calls to the police. When the cops finally arrived, we accompanied them to aid the rescue operation,” said Ikramul Haque. Haque, a government official with Food Corporation of India, also opened his house to several families, one of them Nasreen’s.

As TOI spoke to Nasreen, her youngest stayed in her lap, clutching her dupatta, even while deep in sleep. Liyaz’s forehead bore a deep cut and a purple bruise, a testimony to the violence that the couple escaped. “As we were escaping, the mob started pelting stones in our direction. When the stone hit him and he started bleeding, I thought I would lose him,” said Nasreen.

The two rooms in Haque’s house are now a safe haven for 21 people. He is not charging any rent. But Haque is not the only one doing this. Several others have opened their houses to complete strangers. Zakir Hussain, 35, a cloth manufacturer has four rooms in his small home. While his family occupies two rooms, he has sublet the other to a family whose house was gutted in the fire. The third room is filled with milk packets, which are crowdsourced through volunteers, NGOs and Khalsa Aid.

A corner in the road has become an open kitchen, with everyone pitching in foodgrain and vegetables.

Even though their houses lie just a kilometre away, most victims have not mustered the courage to go and see the fate of their residences. A group of men went on a march together to assess the damage but could not retrieve anything from the charred remains. Mohammad Salim, a parking contractor, was one of them. He had escaped with just the clothes on his back. The 22-year-old said he was unsure of going back home “as the friends who I played cricket with, came and attacked my home”. “One of them put petrol on my father. It is just luck and the help from the police that he survived,” he said.

But amid the despair, the young are determined to reclaim their lives. Fifteen-year-old Laiba is one of them. The teenager, who is to appear for her Class X boards, has got a duplicate admit card and is determined to take her examination. “It’s my father’s wish that I become an IAS officer. I will work towards that. The country needs honest people in the administration,” she said.

TimesView The Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations should immediately probe how The Right to Education Act was flouted by the school. The law says no student can be detained up to class VIII. Also, it should be seen whether a councillor was appointed to check the IQ level of the child and if the school, in coordination with parents, worked out a performance improvement plan

HYDERABAD: After allegedly forcing a class 2 student to repeat the same academic year for two consecutive years, St Joseph’s Public School , Malakpet , is now allegedly forcing the child’s parent to take transfer certificate (TC). Father of the boy said that the school management assured to promote his son provided they took a TC and made him join class 3 in another school.“My son was studying in the same school since kindergarten. Why is the school blaming the child and us for his performance. Does the school not have any responsibility,” asked P Janardhan Rao, the boy’s father.He added, “When I questioned the management, they said that he was not performing well. What is the point of paying lakhs of rupees if they can’t even teach a class 2 student,” asked Rao.The school management said that they wanted to issue a TC during the last academic year, but gave the boy another chance as his parents pleaded with them. “This is an ICSE school and the boy is not able to keep up. We asked the parents to shift him to another school last year, but they did not do so. We are issuing TC keeping the child’s future in mind,” said the in-charge of the primary division of the school, who did not want to be named as she was not authorised to talk to the media. She added that she was not aware of any rule prohibiting schools from issuing TCs or detaining primary school students in the same class. The district education officer of Hyderabad said that they did not receive any complaint from the parent on the issue.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74412947,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-140514,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/school-forcing-my-class-2-kid-to-take-tc-dad/articleshow/74409065.cms

CHANDIGARH: All hospitals will have a registry of organ donations , allowing states and others to know the waiting list and which organ donor is available at the nearest place.National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (Notto) head Dr Vasanthi Ramesh made this announcement while visiting PGI during the organ transplant games.The Punjab and Haryana high court had directed to have a national registry of voluntary organ donors last year, prompting Notto to begin work.“We are signatory to the world health assembly. The mandate of this assembly is to have a national-level organisation to oversee work of organ donation and transplantation. To achieve this, it is important to establish a national registry, which was structurally done in 2015. We are striving to make it functional,” said Dr Ramesh.To be a part of the registry, the Notto’s website has been created in a manner which has national, state and regional-level components. “Every treating hospital registered with the state authority should also register on the Notto’s website and upload the data. This includes doctors performing surgeries and patients’ waiting list,” said Dr Ramesh.Besides, the government is planning to convert all trauma centres into organ retrieval centres. Also, to facilitate deceased organ donation programme, Notto has started reworking on the organ airlifting project mooted in 2017. “The Indian Society for Heart and Lung Transplant had approached the health ministry more than two years ago. Recently, the health ministry has again shown interest for the airlifting of the deceased organs,” said Dr Ramesh.Clarifying that the Notto is coordinating at all levels and not taking over the functions of the state or regional level organisations, Dr Ramesh said, “We are asking hospitals and other state and regional level organ transplant organisations to upload their database of donors and recipients to make things easier for the transplant coordinators. This is in no way a takeover of the functions of these organisations.”Data on Notto siteThe Punjab and Haryana high court had directed to have a national registry of voluntary organ donors last yearEvery treating hospital registered with the state authority will have to register on Notto’s website and upload dataInformation on doctors performing surgeries and patients’ waiting list will have to be uploadedThe government is planning to convert all trauma centres into organ retrieval centres",chandigarh,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74412993,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-102797,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hospitals-to-have-organ-donations-registry/articleshow/74408359.cms

369,['29/02/2020'],BJP moves HC over stay in appointment of standing panel members,"This story is from February 29, 2020

Nashik: The group leader of BJP in the civic body, Jagdish Patil, has moved Bombay high court challenging state urban development department’s stay over appointment of eight new members of the standing committee and town secretary’s decision to stay elections for the post of the standing panel chairman.

Sena group leader Vilas Shinde had complained to urban development department accusing mayor Satish Kulkarni of appointing more BJP members in the panel although its strength in the civic body had reduced after the state assembly polls.

When contacted, lawyer of the petitioner Jay Bhatiya said the high court has admitted the petition and the hearing is to be held on Monday.

On Monday, Kulkarni had declared the names of eight new members of the standing committee — four from BJP, two from Shiv Sena and one each from Congress and NCP — after the term of eight former standing committee members came to an end.

In the 16-member standing committee, the BJP had nine seats, while Sena had four and Congress, NCP and MNS had one member each. The quota of standing committee members to the political parties is decided on the basis of their strength of corporators.

During the 2017 civic elections, the BJP had won 66 seats and Shiv Sena got 34. Accordingly, the comparative strength of both BJP and Shiv Sena was 8.65 and 4.45, respectively. Hence, BJP had got a quota of nine members, while Sena had got a quota of four members.

The total number of BJP corporators later reduced from 66 to 64 and Sena’s number increased to 35. Owing to this the comparative strength of BJP reduced from previous 8.65 to 8.39, while Sena’s increased from 4.45 to 4.59.

After the drop in comparative strength of the BJP in the civic body, Sena had demanded the mayor to reduce the BJP’s quota to eight members and increase Sena’s quota from four to five members. The proposal, however, was rejected by the mayor.

Following this, Shinde lodged a complaint with the urban development department. Accordingly, the urban development department stayed the appointments of the new members.

After this, the town secretary of the NMC also stayed the elections for the post of standing committee chairman that was to be held on March 3.

Nashik: During a meeting with the youth wing of National Congress Party (NCP) in Mumbai on February 26, guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal said he would ensure that a full-time deputy director of education for Nashik division is appointed within a few days.

The Nationalist Youth Congress (NYC) delegation also submitted a memorandum of their demands to Bhujbal. The NYC is the youth wing of the NCP.

The NYC members drew Bhujbal’s attention to the problems faced by schools, junior colleges as well as teachers.

“The present incumbent is a zilla parishad (ZP) secondary education officer and has been given additional charge as deputy director of education for over a year,” said Chinmay Gadhe, city president of NYC.

The NCP leaders said that, at times, the students and school authorities return empty handed as the deputy director is unavailable.

“It gets difficult for the students from the division to meet the deputy director as he has to visit both the offices which are located far from each other. The divisional office is at Nashik Road while the ZP office is in the city,” added Gadhe.

Bhujbal has assured the NCP leaders that he will look into the matter and will appoint a person on the post soon.

“We have been assured by the guardian minister that he will appoint an individual in the capacity of the deputy director of education within eight days,” he said.

The deputy director, also known as the regional director, is a governing authority for schools and junior colleges of Dhule, Nandurbar, Nashik and Jalgaon regions.

If a junior college wihes to open an additional branch, sanction new policies, send a team for inspection of schools, junior colleges or implement a government’s scheme, the deputy director has to take the charge for it.

Nitin Bachhav, who is currently handling the charge of deputy director of education, told TOI “It has been difficult handling two departments. I had also asked the guardian minister to relieve me from the position a couple of months back. It would be a great relief if he finds a replacement soon.”

Mohammad Anees’ father was at their Khajuri Khas residence with a relative when the mob struck

NEW DELHI: Among the scores whose houses were targeted by mobs over the last few days is BSF jawan Mohammad Anees. Currently stationed in Odisha, Anees told TOI over the phone that it was his father, Mohammad Munees, who was at their home in Khajuri Khas Gali No. 5 with a relative when all hell broke loose.

Chand alias Guddu, the younger of the two brothers, was also out station with the rest of the family. When TOI caught up with him on Friday, Chand said: “Even as tension escalated, my father refused to leave the locality in the belief that police will protect them.” On February 25, as a mob tried to force its way into the house, Munees tried to reason with them, but to no avail.

As things appeared to be getting out of hand, some relatives whisked Munees and his relative away to their place in the nearby Chandu Nagar. When police did arrive the next day, their house had already been burned down to ashes, Chand said, adding that the house next door, belonging to a Sikh family, was spared.

At Chandu Nagar, where hundreds of families from Khureji Khas have taken refuge, there is a strong sense of anger. “Anees bhai fought for the country on the borders, but they (the mob) didn’t think twice before burning down his home,” said Mohammad Saleem, a neighbour who has also moved out temporarily.

“The 4% reservation in jobs and education has so far empowered nearly 20 lakh poor Muslims under BC-E category in both Telugu states since 2004-05. The former Congress regime had implemented the Muslim quota in 58 days after coming to power in 2004. However, given the way the BJP government is functioning at the Centre and the manner in which the TRS government is pursuing its hidden agenda, fears over continuation of Muslim quota have increased,” he said.

NEW DELHI: In view of contradictory reports of Bureau of Indian Standards and Delhi Jal Board on quality of drinking water in the capital, the Supreme Court on Friday directed the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to undertake fresh laboratory testing of piped water supplied to residences.

In its recent report, BIS said water quality of many cities was found to be below par with Delhi’s water being the worst among 21 big cities. The study was conducted on the directions of the ministry of consumer affairs, food & public distribution to check quality of piped drinking water being supplied in the country in keeping with the objectives of ‘Jal Jeevan Mission’. The Centre and Delhi government had traded allegations soon after the report was made public.

Standing by the BIS report, its counsel Vipin Nair told a bench of Justices Arun Mishra and Deepak Gupta that the testing of water samples were done by two reputed accredited laboratories in Delhi and Mumbai and their findings cannot be questioned.

But the BIS findings were dismissed by the Delhi government and Delhi Jal Board which contended that water samples from eight out of nine places picked up by BIS had been found to be fit for drinking during a second analysis. They also conducted a separate study by a committee which included specialists from National Environmental Engineering Research Institute which said the water quality was good.

Facing dilemma on whose report should be relied upon, the bench said water samples have to be retested again by another agency and entrusted the task to CPCB. It directed the Board to collect random samples of water from different locations and analyse them. It asked the Board to also involve officials from BIS and DJB in the task and file report before the court within 15 days. It said the contamination of drinking water may be because of leaking pipes and asked the authorities to suggest measures to deal with the problem.

HYDERABAD: BJP national secretary P Muralidhar Rao on Friday said state governments will have a key role in finalising the roadmap for implementation of NPR.

Taking part in a debate on CAA here, he said: “NPR needs to be implemented by the state governments. They all know it, but are politicising it.”

He said GST became a reality with the help of state governments. “Similarly, NPR will be implemented.”

Stating that no decision on NRC had been taken, Rao said what Union home minister Amit Shah was saying is BJP’s line of thinking. “As party leaders, we support both NPR and NRC.”

Rao said that CAA was not against any citizen of this country. There was nothing in CAA that harmed the interests of Muslims.

He informed the audience that during Prime Minister Narendra Modi regime, more than 550 Muslims were given citizenship. Whereas about 13,000 Hindus and Sikhs were given citizenship when Manmohan Singh was prime minister.

PUNE: An international team of scientists has detected the biggest explosion in the universe since the big bang — a blast from a supermassive black hole at the centre of the Ophiuchus galaxy cluster, 390 million light years away.

The colossal explosion, five times bigger than anything observed before, was discovered using four telescopes, including the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope ( GMRT ) in Pune. The other three were Nasa’s Chandra X-ray observatory, ESA’s XMM-Newton and the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) in western Australia.

Radio data from the GMRT played an important role in unravelling the mystery about the nature of this explosion. The data was taken in 2008 and was available in the observatory archive. It was re-analysed by researchers to get an improved radio image, which nicely complemented the frequency coverage of the Australian MWA telescope while providing higher resolution for a more detailed look at the cluster, said Yashwant Gupta, director of the National Centre for Radio Astrophysics here.

Scientists detect the explosion, which happened many million light years ago and wasn’t in the visual range, by studying the cavity in the hot gases surrounding the black hole.

All black holes have super-heated gas surrounding it called the cluster plasma. In the plasma of this supermassive black hole in the centre of the Ophiuchus galaxy cluster is a massive cavity.

The cavity around the plasma of this black hole had been previously seen with X-ray telescopes, said Melanie Johnston-Hollitt from the Curtin University node of the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research.

To create such a cavity, an explosion of a huge magnitude would be required and scientists dismissed the hypothesis that it could have been caused inside the black hole.

To know more about the size of the cavity, scientists wanted to analyse the radio waves emerging from the cavity walls, which are in a very low frequency. “This would help understand the size of the cavity and also the nature of gas surrounding it. The diffused radio wave emission and its analysis told the scientists that it was coming from a very aged fossil of one of the most powerful energy outbursts. It is a fairly known fact that only explosions can cause such cavities in the cosmic world and scientists in a way reverse engineered to understand the magnitude of the explosion that most probably caused the cavity,” said Gupta

The finding underscores the importance of studying the universe at different wavelengths, Johnston-Hollitt said.

“This is a great example of how archival data from the GMRT can be mined for interesting new finds and justifies the efforts and resources NCRA has put in to preserve every bit of interferometric data taken with the GMRT since its inception in 2002,” said Gupta.

NEW DELHI: Seated on her wheelchair, Kanika thought it was important to raise her voice against the way Delhi Police, the Centre and the state government allowed riot to take place in northeast Delhi . On Friday, this political science student at DU’s Miranda House along with hundred others held a march in North Campus demanding action against perpetrators.

Holding banners and placards with messages “stand for peace and communal harmony”, “stop killing Muslims” and “DU for Communal Harmony”, students from different colleges came together and demanded BJP functionary Kapil Mishra be arrested for his alleged involvement in inciting violence. “Our college already organised sit-ins against the riots. Now, we are collecting material for the victims,” said Kanika.

Teachers also joined in the march, which started from Arts Faculty and covered Ramjas College, Shri Ram College of Commerce (SRCC), Daulat Ram and finally reached the Swami Vivekananda statue at Arts Faculty. Students from Lady Shri Ram College for Women (LSR) also came all the way to lend their support.

“It is high time we came out and called out the wrong doings of the government. What took so long to act and let the violence continue,” said a student from LSR.

They said they were even willing to volunteer and assist in the rehabilitation work and have collected relief material for the victims. Ambedkar University has also contributed for the same. “We have heard the prices of vegetables are very high in the area, considering that everything has been destroyed. We all need to come together and help them with necessary items,” said a student.

Calling it a “state-sponsored attack on Muslims,” Jawaharlal Nehru University Students’ Union (JNUSU) also took out a march till the secretariat, but were stopped midway. It demanded Delhi government to take responsibility and activate services to rescue, provide medical facilities and shelter to the victims.

Nashik: An unidentified person has cheated as many as 26 people on the pretext of updating their know your customer (KYC) details and asking them to click on a link sent on their cellphones. A complaint in this regard has been lodged with the cybercrime police station.

Senior inspector Devraj Borse of the cybercrime police station said a resident of Mahatmanagar lodged a complaint stating that he was cheated by an unidentified person on the pretext of updating the KYC of a payment wallet.

Later, more people came forward with the same complaint. They were also similarly cheated on the pretext of doing the KYC. The complainants said that they were made to download certain mobile applications, which are remote access through which the suspects got access to their bank accounts.

The cybercrime police said they had received many complaints wherein the suspects asked the victims to either click on certain links sent to them or download certain apps on their cellphones. This allowed the suspects entire access of the victim’s cellphone.

The police said that they had repeatedly urged people through different programmes not to share personal details to unknown telecallers. At the same time, people should also never share the One Time Password they receive from a bank for any transaction.

Residents protest against the Delhi police and Citizenship Amendment Act at Masjid-e-Azazia in Mehdipatnam on ... Read More

Charminar: Hundreds of people protested against Delhi police and the Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ) after Friday prayers.

Many youths and elderly people came out of mosques shouting slogans and holding placards in large numbers at different places in Old City. They took strong exception against the Delhi police’s role during violence and demanded PM Narendra Modi to roll back contentious laws immediately with an effective manner.

Similarly, many people protested outside other mosques, including, Saidabad, Yakutpura, Chandrayangutta, Mehdipatnam, Vijaynagar Colony and Mallepaly, demanding a halt on NPR process immediately. Expressing solidarity with Delhi violence victims, the protesters marched and urged the central government to take immediate action against the trouble makers in eastern Delhi.

Anti-CAA stickers were distributed among the people by TS AP JAC members at some places to paste them at doors and vehicles. The people, however, were also asked to keep the enumerators at bay by maintaining silence and no information should be shared with them.

“You have to paste these stickers at the doors and vehicles so as to let enumerators know that you are Indian and have nothing to do with controversial NPR,’’ one of the TS AP JAC members, Osman Mohammed Khan urged public while distributing stickers at Vijaynagar Colony.

Mushtaq Malik, convener, TS AP JAC told TOI that the movement would not paused till demands are met. He alleged that Chief Minister. K. Chandrashekar Rao was misleading people by making false assurance.

“The Government must make clear it’s stand if it’s really concerned with regard to public worries. Though there are reports or speculations are making rounds that NPR may get stayed but it is being clearly assured by this government. JAS insists this Government to make it’s stand clearly and sincerely,’’ urged, Mushtaq Malik told TOI.

383,['29/02/2020'],Coal handling cap relaxed for 2 cos at MPT,"This story is from February 29, 2020

Panaji: The Goa State Pollution Control Board ( GSPCB ) on Thursday relaxed the cap on coal handling by South West Port Ltd (SWPL) owned by Jindal Steel Works and Adani Mormugao Goa Port Terminal Pvt Ltd, at Mormugao Port Trust ( MPT ). The capping had been imposed following complaints of air pollution in Vasco .

The board’s chairman, Ganesh Shetgaonkar, told TOI that the relaxation was permitted upon the request of both companies. SWPL had sought reinstatement of the original consent to handle 5.5 million tonne of coal/coke annually, while Adani had sought to handle 5.2 million tonne per year.

Shetgaonkar said that under the current consent to operate, the monthly coal handling capacity for both companies had been cappped at 4 lakh tonne per month and 4.8 million tonne per year. The monthly capping, he said, had made it difficult for the companies to adjust shipments, due to which they had had to pay demurrage.

“Now, with the relaxation, if the coal handled during a particular month is less than the capping quantity, it can be adjusted in the following month’s shipment,” he said.

A decision on the relaxation of the cap had been deferred at GSPCB’s last meeting in December, 2019, when member secretary Shamila Monteiro said that IIT-Bombay had submitted a report on the source appropriation study at Vasco and that it was required to be analysed by the board’s scientific section. The report was expected to quantify the contribution of emissions from various sources that lead to air pollution in Vasco.

After deliberations, the board had decided that since IIT-Bombay had not submitted its final report, no amendment would be made to the consent to operate yet.

385,['29/02/2020'],Act against illegal buildings around Goa airport: HC to Navy,"This story is from February 29, 2020

Representative image

PANAJI: The high court of Bombay at Goa on Friday directed the Navy and director general of civil aviation (DGCA) to initiate action against unauthorised constructions around the Goa International Airport within nine months and submit a compliance report by March 31, 2021.

The high court passed the judgement in a writ petition challenging the construction of around seven highrises around the airport and airbase at Dabolim.

Among these highrises are buildings owned by panchayat minister Mauvin Godinho's close aide Kamla Prasad Yadav, who has ""unauthorised constructions"" in survey No. 60/2 of Chicalim by his firm Venture Building Dreams. Yadav is also a deputy sarpanch of Chicalim.

“In so far as the constructions, which have come up in the property bearing survey No 60/2 of Chicalim village, we direct the Flag Officer, Commanding, as well as authorities enjoined to make final orders under Rule 6 of 1994 Rules to initiate or complete action as expeditiously as possible and in any case within a period of six months from today,” said justices Mahesh Sonak and Mukulika Jawalkar in the judgement.

The court also took serious note of the resolution passed by Mormugao Planning and Development Authority (MPDA) on November 18 rejecting the Navy's colour-coded zoning map (CCZM).

Godinho, the Dabolim MLA, and Yadav are both members of the MPDA that rejected the colour-coded map and granted permission to builders to construct highrises within the path of an aircraft which is landing or taking off from the airport.

The court said aviation safety is paramount and thus provisions of the Aircraft Act, the 1994 Rules, the 2015 Rules and the CCZM prepared by the Navy take precedence over MPDA’s resolution.

The court has also issued directions to DGCA, South Goa collector, Chicalim panchayat and MPDA to ensure that unauthorised constructions are not allowed to come up in proximity of the Goa International Airport.

Godinho had accused the Navy of ruling Goa by proxy and regulating construction around the state’s lone airport. At the core of Godinho’s outrage are buildings with over 100 flats—survey numbers 60/2, 63/5 and 63/8— built by Yadav.

The Union civil aviation ministry’s rules, issued in 2015, restrict the height of buildings within a 20km radius of a runway.

The court has given some relief to builders who had complained that the Navy takes more than six months to grant clearance for construction.

“We direct the Flag Officer, Commanding to dispose of the applications seeking the NOCs for constructions as expeditiously as possible and in any case within a period of three months,” the court said.

387,['29/02/2020'],"25,000 saplings to boost green cover in south Delhi","This story is from February 29, 2020

As many as 5,000 saplings were planted at the biodiversity park

NEW DELHI: The Hero-TOI Green Drive continues to boost the flora cover in the national capital. A large number of responsible citizens participated in the latest event held as part of the green campaign and did their bit for the environment.

Hero MotoCorp and the Times Group had jointly organised the mega plantation drive at south Delhi Biodiversity Park on Wednesday. As many as 5,000 saplings were planted at the biodiversity park, which is located behind Kalindi Colony and close to Kilokari village. In the next few days, over 25,000 saplings will be planted to complete the drive here.

It has been cited as a great initiative to restore the fast-depleting green cover of the region that has seen an increase in pollution levels and cases of respiratory diseases in residents.

Addressing the people gathered at the event, CR Babu, noted environmentalist and professor emeritus from CEMDE-Delhi University, said, “This area sees traffic round the clock. When you look around it, there is no green cover to assimilate the emissions. What we are doing today is something unique. This kind of plantation does not exist anywhere around this traffic-congested area.”

The park is spread over 167 hectares of land and 95% of it is covered by wetlands, which are extremely beneficial for CO2 consumption.

“We are working towards the conservation of these wetlands to ensure safety for millions of birds. Conserving these wetlands can also help in addressing the water scarcity in south Delhi and nearby areas since they replenish groundwater constantly,” Babu added.

“Today, professor Babu’s green vision has already come true with the start of the plantation. I am sure within a couple of years, this place will be very different, with vast greenery,” said Vijay Sethi, chief information officer, chief human resource officer and Corporate Social Responsibility head at Hero MotoCorp.

Dr Randeep Guleria, director, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, talked about how plantations at such a large scale can help reduce the carbon footprints of major events, conferences and routine life. “This will help reduce the carbon footprint and increase the green cover in the area.”

The drive, a major initiative by Hero MotoCorp and the Times Group, which began in Delhi, has managed to boost the greenery quotient of cities across the country over the past few years. After over 1 lakh saplings were planted across Delhi’s three biodiversity parks in 2015, the drive moved to Indore and Chandigarh where 2 lakh saplings were planted in 2017. In 2018, the drive covered Indore, Ahmedabad, Chennai and Delhi, and these cities went greener by 5 lakh trees. As many as 3.6 lakh saplings were planted as part of the drive during the financial year of 2019-20, while total 12.5 lakh saplings have been planted since 2015.

Representative image

QUEPEM: Residents who have rented out their houses or rooms have raised a banner of protest over the move of Quepem Municipal Council (QMC) to impose property tax on such properties from 2016 to 2020, alleging that the process has been initiated without proper verification and consultation.

QMC has sent hundreds of these notices to house owners under Section 110 of the Goa Municipalities Act, 1968.

“QMC has imposed the tax without verifying whether rooms or houses were given on rent from that period,” a property owner said.

In its notices, QMC stated that tax should be assessed based on rateable value — rent for which such as building on land reasonably be expected to let or for which it is actually let from year to year, whichever is greater.

The owners have to pay annually 8% of the rented amount. The annual value is arrived out after deducting 10% of annual value in lieu of all allowances for repairs. The notices follow QMC’s resolution on May 23, 2017, for imposition of property tax, but no notices had been issued.

Former chairperson Thereza Travasso is one of the recipients of two notices, with a directive to pay Rs 18,664 within a month’s time. “How can they send me such notices when I am not the house owner?” she said.

Around 50 Condi residents gathered in their ward on Thursday, demanding withdrawal of the notices.

“I am suffering from cancer. There is no earning member in my house. I am running my house on rent which is collected from my adjacent house. Now I received a notice to pay Rs 16,000. Why should I pay this tax when I am paying house tax of that house?” questioned Luis Rodrigues.

QMC chief officer Rohit Kadam said the notices have been sent as per the procedure. “If anyone has any grievances they should come and resolve them with the council,” he said.

BSES staff work overtime to restore power lines in Shiv Vihar

NEW DELHI: Delhi government would start distributing Rs 25,000 in cash as immediate relief from Saturday to people whose houses were burned in the riots in northeast Delhi , chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Friday.

Addressing a press conference, the CM said: “The balance cheque will be provided to them after proper assessment is done by PWD. Any NGO, social organizations and individual donors who would like to contribute to our relief and rehabilitation activities can contact the office of DM North East,” he said.

The government has also set up nine shelters for the riot-affected people. On Friday, it started distributing food there. On the treatment of patients currently admitted in government hospitals, Kejriwal said, “We are being contacted by the people regarding their friends and relatives admitted for serious injuries in government hospitals, but not getting proper treatment due to huge crowds. Delhi government will assess the situation and, if needed, patients with serious conditions and injuries will be shifted to private hospitals for proper treatmen.”

Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said a compensation form would be issued on behalf of Delhi government. A mobile application will also be developed where citizens can lodge details of the loss of property, loss of vehicles, damage to the business and details of injury and death. The government will ensure quick verification and assessment of the details to provide immediate ex gratia amount of Rs25,000, Sisodia said, adding that the full compensation amount would be provided after 2-3 days.

Kejriwal said the government had appointed 18 magistrates and four night magistrates to assist in the relief work. “Night magistrates can coordinate relief and rehabilitation activities in any emergent situation at any time, along with measures like fixing street lights to ensure the security of residents at night,” he said.

The government was getting support from NGOs and RWAs in providing relief to the riot-affected areas, the chief minister said. He requested people to provide the government with relevant information on anyone needing food or other amenities.

Representative image

AHMEDABAD: The state government, which plans to integrate all the ‘model schools’ with the newly announced scheme for ‘ Schools of Excellence ’, has decided to hold a common entrance test for these 84 schools.

“The aim was to enrol most meritorious students at taluka levels in the model schools. But this could not be achieved fully due to various reasons. So, we have decided to hold an entrance test in April to fill vacant seats from Class VI to IX,” said a senior government official.

Currently, a model school can admit a maximum of 360 students, but they are often underutilized. The government however remains confident that more students will come forward once these schools are included in the Schools of Excellence scheme and the government has decided to raise the school limit to 480 students per school. A provision of adding another 20 students in case of requirement has also been made. The total allotted strength of these 84 schools is about 30,000 students, which has now been enhanced to 42,000.

The concept of model schools was introduced by the Gujarat government in 2014 to provide quality education in government schools at par with any private school.

In all, there are 84 model schools in the state starting from upper primary (sixth standard onwards) to secondary and higher secondary classes.

Of these 84 schools, nine have science stream for class 11 and class 12 students while the remaining have general stream education. On Friday, the government also decided to introduce science stream in all the remaining 75 model schools. This decision is likely to benefit 11,000 students in the coming academic year as they can enrol for science stream in these schools. A budgetary allocation of Rs 4 crore has also been made for setting up lab facilities in the 75 model schools.

“The government has also decided to recruit highly meritorious teachers on a contractual basis to improve the education quality,” the official added.

The state government, on Wednesday, announced the scheme of Schools of Excellence in the state budget for 2020-21 in which it aims to develop 500 state-run schools by March end next year. The 84 model schools will be integrated into the scheme, for which a provision of Rs 250 crore has been made in the budget.

393,['29/02/2020'],All eyes on SC as Goa hopes for some relief on Mhadei,"This story is from February 29, 2020

Panaji: Faced with an uncertain future over sharing the Mhadei’s water after the Mhadei Water Disputes Tribunal’s final decision was notified on Thursday, Goa now waits the March 2 Supreme Court hearing to stop Karnataka in its tracks.

A day after the Centre notified the tribunal award, Karnataka has decided to expedite work on the Kalasa-Bhandura project.

With very few options available, Goa is gearing to put up a strong case in the Apex court on Monday to stall Karnataka from going ahead with the controversial project.

The state government on Friday asserted that Karnataka cannot go ahead with work on the Kalasa-Bhandura project.Reacting to the publication of the notification of the Mhadei tribunal order and reports that Karnataka is preparing to go ahead with its drinking water project works, chief minister Pramod Sawant said that “till preparation and approval of revised detailed project report (DPR) and till all permissions in law are obtained, Karnataka cannot divert or use water”.

He also said that mere publication of the award in the gazette does not prejudice the state of Goa.

“Government of Goa is fully committed to the cause of protection of Mhadei and will strongly defend the interest of the state before the Supreme court”, he said in a statement on Friday evening.

Advocate general Devidas Pangam said the interim order passed by Mhadei Water Disputes Tribunal on April 17, 2014, that stated that Karnataka cannot start work till it prepares and revised DPR and gets it approved by the Centre or the Mhadei Water Management Authority, still stands.

Though Sawant told TOI on Thursday that the state would seek a stay from SC against the notification, Pangam said there was no need for it as the SC had clearly said that the tribunal’s award would depend on the outcome of the petitions that will come up for hearing in July.

He also said there is already an urgent hearing on March 2 where Goa has sought an interim stay from the SC to restrain Karnataka from carrying out construction or any other activity on the Mhadei.

Pangam said that Karnataka has to now get central government permission, forest and wildlife board permission. “Before they take all the permission our case will be decided in the apex court,” he said.

On February 25, the state government filed an application before the Supreme Court seeking an interim relief to restrain Karnataka from carrying out construction or any other activity on the Mhadei.

The chief minister’s office said after senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi pleaded before the bench presided by justice D Y Chandrachud for urgent hearing, the court posted the matter for March 2.

February 20, the Supreme Court, in an interim order, directed the Centre to notify the Mhadei Water Disputes Tribunal’s award of August 14, 2018, but said it was subject to the outcome of the petitions filed by the riparian states—Goa, Karnataka and Maharashtra—against the award.

The Supreme Court also admitted Goa government’s special leave petition challenging the award and posted it for final hearing on July 15, 16 and 24.

MoEFCC minister Prakash Javadekar in a letter to Karnataka in December had said that Karnataka can start the work on Kalasa-Bhandura water drinking projects on Mhadei river after gazette notification of the tribunal and necessary forest and ildlife permissions.

The traffic police notification, signed by additional commissioner Sanjay Shinde, cited the inconvenience caused to citizens for the new arrangement decision. It stated, “Vehicles coming from Narveer Tanaji Wadi, Patil Estate, Model Colony and University Road could not turn on to FC Road and had to take a detour from Sancheti Hospital and SG Barve Chowk. The notification was passed after a study by the officer in-charge of the Shivajinagar traffic division.”

Shinde said the FC Road stretch road would be made two-way for 15 days on an experimental basis. “Suggestions and objections have been invited from citizens. We will study the impact of the change. We will make the system permanent if there’s a visible impact,” he said.

The traffic police, through a notification in 2008, had converted the arterial Jangli Maharaj (JM) Road and FC Road into one-way stretches. Over two years ago, the police installed barricades on FC Road to develop a contraflow lane between Hotel Lalit Mahal and Dnyaneshwar Paduka Chowk to prevent a traffic choke-up in Model Colony.

Save Pune Traffic Movement director Harshad Abhyankar said, “Making both FC Road and JM Road one-way thoroughfares was a big decision in 2008. But there were no data to prove the impact of the arrangement. Have they now collected any data to prove that the situation will improve by making the FC Road stretch a two-way facility?

Parisar programme director Ranjit Gadgil said, “My concern is that the FC Road design was done keeping in mind the one-way traffic. There has to be a significant revision in the street design for the two-way system. The Pune Municipal Corporation may have to intervene to understand the objective of making the FC Road stretch a two-way facility and what it means for the design.”

Kozhikode: The Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) facility of the Indian Customs will start functioning at Beypore Port in a month. The full-fledged functioning of the EDI will help the movement of international vessels to Beypore Port and help the port to offer services to many exporters and importers from northern Kerala.

The EDI facility is coming up at Beypore Port as part of the initiative of the Union and the state government to promote coastal shipping through minor ports. At present, the exporters and importers from Kozhikode and other parts of north Kerala depend on Cochin Port for their business.

Installation of EDI is mandatory for getting customs clearance for the port. Only domestic vessels are permitted at Beypore and other minor ports in the state as the ports lack customs clearance.

“We have already received the EDI number and only the installation of the networks and other facilities are remaining at the EDI facility,” said Aswani Pratap, port officer. We are expecting more import business than export business; he said adding that the port was expecting to slowly attract the importers from northern Kerala.

Though Beypore Port received nod for starting export and import of goods to foreign countries over a year ago, the port has not been able to make use of the facility owing to various reasons. With the introduction of EDI at Beypore more business groups who import commercial goods from China and other countries are expected to depend on the port for cargo movement.

The introduction of the EDI facility will avoid the use of hard copies and manual customs clearance. The facility will also help to ensure the quick movement of containers. The EDI facility is coming up at the port at a cost of Rs 20 lakh.

According to the port officer, the government has announced special incentive for the promotion of coastal shipping. The vessels will first reach Cochin Port and then move towards Beypore, he said adding that port department was holding discussions with the clients to divert containers to minor ports.

At present, the importers are forced to pay for transporting the goods from the major port to different places in Malabar. Many such business persons are expected to depend on the Beypore Port once the port is permitted to accommodate vessels from foreign countries.

However, many other aspects including the size of the foreign vessels and the depth of the channel will play crucial role in the development of Beypore to a centre of international cargo movement.

Azam Khan gestures during a book release funtion at CM's official residence in Lucknow on wednesday

LUCKNOW: Mosquitoes tormented the Sultan of Rampur, Azam Khan , and his son Abdullah as shadows lengthened over the Sitapur prison ’s special cell, which bears a colonial stamp and an infamous label of housing notorious and hardened criminals like Unnao rape accused Kuldeep Singh Sengar and slain mafia don Munna Bajrangi. A jail official told TOI the cell was built by British in 1878 and only select prisoners were lodged here and the tradition has continued.

Azam, along with legislator wife Tanzeen Fatima and son were shifted to Sitapur jail on Thursday morning.

After meeting Azam on Friday morning, his daughter-in-law Sidra and elder son Adeeb lamented their family members were unwell and their first night behind bars was traumatic. “Mosquitoes bit them all through the night. Despite ill health, my elderly father-in-law and mother-in-law were moved from Rampur to Sitapur jail and nobody in the family was informed,” she told reporters.

She also claimed her mother-in-law Tanzeen was suffering from severe back ache from an old fracture. “Both parents are old and in pain. We have asked lawyers to take up the matter in court about the sudden transfer,” she added. Adeeb told newsmen he was eagerly waiting for his father, mother and brother to be released soon.

Just not Sidra and Adeeb, Azam had more visitors on Friday. At least 50 people, including SP members came calling. A jail official said the father and son skipped dinner on Thursday, but had tea and cracked wheat (dalia) for breakfast on Friday. “A video wall has come up at prison headquarters in Lucknow and a close watch is kept on activities of prisoners and visitors,” said a senior jail officer.

Former CBI special director Rakesh Asthana (PTI file photo)

NEW DELHI: A war of words broke out in a special CBI court on Friday between two investigating officers (IO) in the bribery case in which former CBI director Rakesh Asthana was given a clean chit recently. While former IO A K Bassi, appearing after a direction, accused current IO Satish Dagar of shielding “big names” despite clinching evidence, Dagar retorted saying Bassi was acting on a “presumption” and never showed up when asked to assist in the probe on multiple occasions.

Appearing before special CBI judge Sanjeev Aggarwal, Dagar accused Bassi of making “personal allegations”. The judge, after hearing both men, intervened and remarked, “Don’t wash your dirty linen in public.” He also said that both officials would be called in future, if required, but not together.

CBI had recently filed a chargesheet concluding that there was no connection between Asthana and the alleged middleman Manoj Prasad, and no evidence to prove that the former CBI director ever demanded or received a bribe to save Hyderabad-based businessman Satish Babu Sana in a money laundering case related to meat exporter Moin Qureshi .

During the proceedings, however, the court inquired about the status of investigation in the Moin Qureshi case. “Two guardian angels of CBI are involved in the case... How much time will you take to investigate the Moin Qureshi case where the two guardian angels, the two bosses, are involved? That case is Bhagirathi (sic),” the court remarked.

Earlier, Bassi claimed that on the day he handed over the charge of the bribery case, he was accused of filing a false FIR against Asthana. “The clinching evidence present in phone of Rakesh Asthana was never seized. From day one, he (Dagar) is working to give clean chit to Rakesh Asthana… There are WhatsApp messages.”

The former IO also claimed that nothing was asked about the messages lying in Prasad’s mobile phone. “When Sunil Mittal (Prasad’s father-in-law) was examined, he was under the influence of alcohol as per the CFSL report,” he added.

Mittal and Prasad’s brother Someshwar Srivastava are also involved in the case.

Following Bassi’s statements, Dagar responded: “And how does he know about all this? We would definitely like to know. How is he infiltrating the investigation?”

When Bassi said the details were in the newspapers, Dagar countered by saying “it never came out in newspapers”.

The current IO further accused Bassi of having “made personal allegations on his integrity”. He said, “I have better antecedents than him in the organisation.”

According to Bassi, during interrogation, Prasad admitted that he was in touch with special secretary R&AW Samant Kumar Goel and disclosed numbers of Srivastava in London, Singapore and Dubai. “He refused to divulge anything how CBI officials received money,” Bassi said.

Asthana and DSP Devender Kumar, who was arrested in 2018 in relation to the bribery case and later got bail, were given a clean chit owing to lack of evidence to make them accused.

Bassi said that following Kumar's arrest on October 22, 2018, he made a proposal for carrying out searches at Asthana's residence and office premises. “But that file never came back to me,” he said.

On October 23, 2018, he said, the Delhi high court was informed that CBI required Asthana’s mobile telephone and all electronic record lying in his possession and that he be directed to preserve the record. “There is an order that he should preserve the record,” said Bassi.

The former IO also said that at the time of handing over the case, he told Dagar that Asthana’s mobile has to be seized because there is clinching evidence. “There is an eight-page secret note of intercepted calls handed over to the current IO. It clearly says money was exchanged. Clearly mentions Rakesh Asthana,” Bassi claimed.

Dagar responded, “We’ve intercepted 11,381 calls, it is before the court. We haven’t shut the case. He (Bassi) hasn’t brought any evidence. He is acting under a presumption.”

After the court proceedings, Chavan told TOI, “We have opposed around 22 pleas on the grounds that some investors have demanded distribution of money on a pro-rata basis.

S N Shrivastava, 1985-batch IPS officer, was appointed special CP (law and order) on Tuesday

NEW DELHI: IPS officer S N Shrivastava was given the additional charge of the next Delhi Police commissioner on Friday. The 1985-batch officer will be heading the 90,000 strong force from March 1 as the extended tenure of present police chief Amulya Patnaik ends on Saturday.

An order issued by the ministry of home affairs said that Shrivastava will hold the charge till further orders. Sources said a regular order of his appointment will also be issued within a week after necessary approvals are sought and obtained. Shrivastava is set to retire from the service next year.

Shrivastava was serving in CRPF in the profile of special director general (DG) since 2015. After Delhi Police came under fire for being unable to quell the northeast Delhi riots, Shrivastava was hand-picked by the home minister and the national security advisor to control the situation. In quick developments that unfolded on Tuesday evening, Shrivastava was repatriated to his parent cadre (i.e. AGMUT) and then placed as the chief of law and order, a move which took everyone by surprise.

Shrivastava took charge immediately. Led by Doval, Shrivastava remained on the ground for over 20 hours.

Known for his integrity and no-nonsense attitude, Shrivastava was the anti-terror chief in Delhi Police till 2015. Officers who have worked under him said he was a hard taskmaster with an eye for details. He had headed several departments in Delhi Police before proceeding on deputation to CRPF.

It was during his tenure that the Special Cell had wiped out the Indian Mujahideen and Lashkar-e-Toiba network from the capital. Brought in to the Special Cell in the aftermath of the High Court Blasts in 2011, he played a crucial role in strengthening it. While preventing any terror attack in the capital for over three years, the Cell went on to arrest 37 terrorists, including 22 from IM and 7 from LeT, since he took charge.

“IM’s deputy chief Tehsin Akhtar, Pak bomb-maker Waqas, Abdul Qarim Tunda and IM’s shadow techie Ajaj Shaikh are among the terrorists who are now behind bars due to his team’s efforts. His team also solved the 2012 Pune serial blasts and the Jama Masjid blast cases,” said a senior police officer.

Pune: A boy (15) was detained on Thursday for allegedly sexually assaulting an eight-year-old girl of his neighbourhood.

The boy was detained under Section 376 (rape) of the Indian Penal Code and the relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. The Yerawada police also registered an offence against the boy’s mother for beating up and abusing the girl after the latter’s grandmother informed her about the incident.

An officer from the Yerawada police said the incident occurred on Wednesday evening. The complainant said her granddaughter went missing while playing outside the house around 5.30pm.

“When the complainant went on the terrace of her single-storey house after searching for her granddaughter at other places, she was shocked to see the boy harassing the eight-year-old girl,” the officer said.

The woman rescued her granddaughter, went to the boy’s house and complained to his mother. The boy’s mother, instead of taking her son to task, started abusing and beating up the girl.

“The girl’s grandmother then came to the police station and lodged a complaint. We have detained the boy and booked his mother for abusing and beating up the girl,” the officer said.

Pune: A shopowner in Kasba Peth foiled an attempt by a bike-borne duo to rob his cellphone late on Wednesday night and caught one of them in the process.

Police said shopowner Aniket Dhas (38) caught hold of Arshad Salim Shaikh (20) and dragged him down the vehicle when he tried to snatch his cellphone from his trouser pocket.

Seeing him falling off the vehicle, Shaikh’s accomplice drove away.

Dhas later lodged an FIR with the Faraskhana police. Shaikh has several cases of thefts registered against him, police said.

Tejasvi Patil, sub-inspector, Faraskhana police, told TOI that complainant Dhas runs a footwear shop near Kasba Peth fire station. Around 9.45pm on Wednesday, he was waiting in front of his shop to cross the road when Shaikh and his accomplice, riding a two-wheeler, stopped near Dhas.

“Shaikh who was riding pillion, checked whether Dhas was wearing any gold chain. He then tried to snatch his cellphone from the pocket of his trouser. But Dhas caught Shaikh’s hand and dragged him down the vehicle,” Patil said.

On seeing Shaikh falling off the motorcycle, his accomplice drove away.

“With the help of locals, Dhas nabbed Shaikh and handed him over to the police,” Patil said. She said Shaikh has several cases of thefts registered against him.

“We have launched a search for his accomplice,” she said.

“Our further investigation is on,” she said.

The crime branch of the Pune police recently recovered nine stolen cellphones worth Rs 1.60 lakh following the arrest of two men from Kharadi.

They used to snatch cellphone from women carrying the devices in their hands..

NEW DELHI: The Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) administration has served a notice to JNU Students’ Union (JNUSU) for asking the needy riot victims to take shelter in the campus. The varsity has asked the union to refrain from such activities.

In the notice, registrar Pramod Kumar, said: “JNUSU has no legal right to make the JNU campus a ‘shelter’. You are strictly advised against any such activity failing which appropriate disciplinary action will be taken against you.” Kumar claimed that some residents in the campus were feeling insecure with the JNUSU’s call.

The students union, however, claimed that the JNUSU office comes under their purview and that “JNU has always been open for people in need. We had also provided shelter to the 1984 riot victims.”

As part of their drive to “uphold social harmony,” the JNUSU had given a call for volunteers. It had stated while there are many rescue teams working in the city, “we would like to inform that our campus/JNUSU office is open to all people who need shelter.” Their posters had the names and numbers of four JNUSU central panel members.

Saket Moon, the JNUSU vice-president, who has also been served the notice, said that the administration should reconsider the notice.

“JNU has always been open for people in need of help. The campus had even opened its doors for the victims of 1984 riots, ” he said.

NEW DELHI: The house of Mudassar Khan in Mustafabad rang with joy a fortnight ago with the birth of a daughter. There are only tears in the house today. The 35-year-old was shot dead during the riots and his body discovered at Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital on Thursday. Imrana held the 15-day-old Inaya, named so by her husband Mudassar, and wept continuously on Friday. She has seven other daughters, not all of them of an age to understand the tragedy that has struck the family.Kesar Jahan, Mudassar’s mother, sorrowfully said, “Look at the faces of these children. The younger ones don’t even know what has happened. Who will secure their future now?” The eldest daughter, just 14 years old, mumbled, “It was my birthday on February 14, and papa gifted me a gown.”Yusuf Khan, younger brother of the deceased plastics manufacturing businessman, described Mudassar as a ‘problem solver’. “My brother had gone to Kardampuri for some work on Monday. He got stuck there and told me about the outbreak of violence. I asked him to stay indoors until the situation improved. The following day he called in the morning. He was worried at the escalating situation and asked me to come and accompany him back home.”Yusuf reached the Brijpuri bridge, where he found rioters from both communities furiously throwing stones at each other. “I called my brother repeatedly but he did not answer his phone. I was really afraid. Then the phone was answered by a stranger who said my brother had been lying dead on the road and a man driving a Tata 407 had left his body at GTB Hospital.”The family took the help of a local politician and the station house officer to reach the hospital and claim his body. Teary-eyed and lost, Mudassar’s father muttered, “He had a gunshot wound on his head. He was a responsible son.”Even though a large contingent of security officials was deployed in the area on Friday, the residents did not feel secure. “The situation is tense and we venture out of our houses only for a couple of hours,” said Yusuf. “People of both communities live in the locality and we had never faced this horrible situation. In fact, the locals say it was unfamiliar outsiders who created havoc.”",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74410501,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-153633,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/from-house-of-joy-to-sound-of-silence/articleshow/74409203.cms

Umar Khalid

NEW DELHI: After Delhi government gave permission for the prosecution of former JNU Students’ Union (JNUSU) president Kanhaiya Kumar and nine others, including student leader Umar Khalid , many of them welcomed the decision. They claimed that it would allow them to prove their innocence in court and that they would be free from “media trial.”

Umar Khalid, one of the principal accused in the chargesheet that was filed last year, said: “I am glad this case will reach a court. I am convinced of my innocence and I will stand vindicated by the end of the trial.”

He added that they have been demanding for the past four years that the trial should begin. “It took the government four years just to begin the trial. It shows how weak the case is. I will cooperate with the trial as I have full faith in the judiciary. A legal trial will prove our innocence, and it will show how baseless, false and malicious the media trial was.”

He also released a joint statement with Anirban Bhattacharya on Twitter. “...And as we will defend ourselves in the court, we will expose the lies of the ruling regime and its fake claims of being nationalist,” he tweeted.

Kanhaiya Kumar was not available for a response.

N Sai Balaji, AISA national president and former JNUSU president , said: “We have been saying it from the first day that the matter should go to a court because the whole case was part of the media propaganda. Now, it will be exposed that police have no evidence against the accused.”

However others, who were named in the chargesheet, but not as principal accused, questioned the timing of the government decision. “The delay showed that the central government was using the case to divert attention. But it is now clear that Delhi government also wants to use this case to divert the whole narrative about its inadequacy during Delhi riots,” said Ashutosh, former JNUSU president.

Rama Naga, who was then the general secretary of JNUSU, said that “seeing the overall situation in Delhi right now it is clear that a pressure has been built, which is reflected in the action of Delhi government.” “There should be a speedy trial and people should know the final verdict. We have said time and again that we will cooperate with all forms of inquiry,” added Naga, a PhD student at Centre for political studies.

PUNE: A security guard (30) of a housing society was arrested on Thursday on the charge of outraging the modesty of a 11-year-old minor girl .

The guard was arrested under Section 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) of the Indian Penal Code and the relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.

An officer with the Vishrantwadi police said the incident occurred on the premises of the housing complex on Thursday afternoon. “The security guard lived with his family in a room in the parking area. During the afternoon, the minor girl visited his room to play with his three-year-old daughter,” the officer said.

The officer said according to the complaint lodged by the minor’s mother on Thursday afternoon, the guard asked the 11-year-old girl to enter his house. “The complaint stated that he touched the minor inappropriately and attempted to disrobe her. He also used lewd language. The terrified girl managed to escape from the room and told her mother about the incident,” the officer said.

The police arrested the guard following the mother’s complaint. “Our probe is on,” the officer added.

In Barabanki, two superintendents were removed on Thursday for negligence. At Jagriti Inter College, Suratganj, centre superintendent Ramesh Chandra Ojha and external superintendent Sarita Bharti were relieved of their duties after examinees were seen seated in two rooms that neither had a camera nor a router.

“Despite strict instructions to conduct exams under CCTV vigil, students at this centre took the paper without camera surveillance. A report has been sought,” said Rajesh Kumar Verma, district inspector of schools, Barabanki. Notices have been issued to 13 more colleges for undermining the sanctity of board exams. At Sundar Lal Inter College in Safdarganj, Barabanki, an official on surprise inspection found girls taking exams in rooms where DVRs were disconnected.

414,['29/02/2020'],Citizens’ groups meet MP Jayant Sinha,"This story is from February 29, 2020

Pune: Citizens’ groups working in the realty sector met MP Jayant Sinha, the chairman of the standing committee on finance, on Monday to discuss their objections to the amendment to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, which requires a “minimum threshold” of homebuyers for approaching the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).

In December, the government had passed an ordinance to amend the code, mandating a threshold of a minimum of 100 or 10% of total homebuyers in a project, whichever is less, to take the builder to an insolvency court.

The groups, under the Forum for People’s Collective Efforts (FPCE) led by Abhay Upadhyay, had objected to the threshold on social media, following which Sinha invited them for a hearing. The meeting was attended by FPCE’s Abhay Upadhyay, Tarun Jindal and OP Bangur.

In a separate and revised letter to the standing committee on finance on Saturday, FPCE had said the right of a homebuyer to approach a court of law for help cannot be termed as potential abuse. Also, it cannot be construed that only facts can be considered as genuine when either 10% or 100 people say it together.

“If we start this practice of considering genuineness and authenticity of allegations based on number of complainants, it will have unmanageable adverse ramifications. There will never be any convictions as gathering numbers will be an impossible task,’’ the groups stated in the letter.

The members of the groups have reiterated the request for removal of the condition of “minimum threshold” to initiate insolvency proceedings. “Developers are using this as an escape route as no such categorization is done at the time of booking and seeking refund on account of unreasonable delay in possession cannot be a crime for any category of customers,” they said.

Prashant Bhushan

NEW DELHI: Activist lawyer Prashant Bhushan on Friday claimed Delhi Police officials were complicit with the rioters in northeast Delhi and asked whether they could carry out a fair investigation into the riots which has so far claimed 42 lives and injured hundreds.

Bhushan was requesting a Supreme Court bench headed by CJI S A Bobde for early hearing on a contempt petition filed by former DGP Prakash Singh for non-implementation of the SC’s 2006 judgment directing extensive reforms in police establishments to reduce the political executive’s role in its functioning.

Bhushan said to avoid situations like Delhi riots, the 14-year-old judgment in the PIL filed by Prakash Singh had directed separation of law and order control wing from investigation wing of police. “Law and order is essentially an executive function, whereas investigation into crime is part of the criminal justice system and hence needs to be independent of the wing tasked to control law and order,” he said.

The SC had in September 2006 directed fixed tenure for top cops, separation of law and order wing from investigation wing of police and setting up of police establishment boards and grievance redressal authorities in each state. “Though so many years have passed, none of the states have implemented the directions which are crucial to functioning of police as a professional force,” Bhushan said.

The bench said it would list the matter immediately after it completes hearing in the faith versus fundamental rights case arising from reconsideration of the SC judgment quashing the religious custom banning entry of women in the 10-50 year age group into Sabarimala Ayyappa temple.

Hyderabad: One of the rare diseases which is on a definitive rise in the city and many other parts of south India country is the Crohn's disease-a type of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD).

While Telangana alone has 1,231 identified patients of the disease (as per figures from the Indian Organization of Rare Diseases), the actual numbers are estimated to be much higher. The ambiguity is numbers has been attributed to the fact that identifying the disease is an issue due to lack of awareness about this rare disease.

The numbers have been on a constant rise over the last decade and experts in the city point at an increase in incidence among professionals. “The increase in westernisation and globalization could be a reason for rise in IBD (including ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease). In developing countries usually, incidence of ulcerative colitis is higher. But in India we are seeing a rising incidence of Crohn’s disease . In fact, the incidence among Indians migrating to other countries is also very high, possibility due westernisation and environmental changes,” said Dr Rupa Banerjee, head Emerging Nations consortium on IBD.

While living with the disease is a challenge, the first hurdle to cross is getting the right diagnosis. Nidhi Swarup, a patient who is consolidating a patient support group in the city said that she had to visit 20-25 experts before her disease could be diagnosed.

The symptoms of Crohn's disease include abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhoea, bleeding from rectum, weight loss, anaemia and fatigue. While some people may be symptom free most of their lives, other have severe chronic symptoms that never go away.

“Crohn’s disease incidence is rising in India, where the burden is second only to USA. Researchers believe the numbers are actually much higher as cases are often misdiagnosed. Indeed, Crohn’s disease is complicated to diagnose generally, and especially in a country where infectious diseases are still prevalent, and many have symptoms similar to Crohn’s. Misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis often leads to further health complications, which can include the need for surgery,” as per an official statement from the Helmsley Charitable Trust, which has partnered with the research and training wing of city based, Asian Institute of Gastroenterology (AIG).

Thiruvananthapuram: In a major catch, the Venjarammoodu police have seized huge quantities of ganja stashed in an uninhabited house at Kottakkunnu near Nellanad.

The ganja weighed 10kg in total and was stored in three briefcases in one of the rooms of the two-bedroom house, which is in a dilapidated state.

According to the police, the ganja was seized around 4pm on Friday following a raid conducted under the leadership of Venjarammoodu station house officer inspector Aji Chandran Nair. The raid was launched following reliable information received by the inspector. However, the police are yet to find those who stored the ganja in the house.

The police said that the house belonged to one Rajappan Achari. But he lived in another house in the neighbourhood and had given the house for rent. The last tenant of the house vacated one and a half year ago and the house had been lying empty ever since. The house did not have any doors.

Venjarammoodu sub-inspector Bineesh Lal, who was part of the team that conducted the raid, said that the ganja was stored in five packets inside three briefcases. Each packet weighed 2kg each.

“We suspect whoever stashed the ganja here was using the old house as a storage place. They might have been selling it in small quantities,” the SI said. The police suspect that a few youths in the neighbourhood, with a history of ganja peddling, are involved in the incident.

Gujarat high court

AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court has issued notices to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), the state government and the Delhi Public School, East over a petition filed by parents of four kids studying in the school.

The parents have challenged the CBSE’s decision of November 30, 2019 to cancel school’s affiliation and the state government’s order passed on December 5, 2019 to cancel its recognition. They have argued that the decision to close the school was taken without giving any opportunity of hearing to the school management as well as parents. This is against the provisions of the Right to Education Act (RTE) and the primary education laws. The government could not have derecognized school without issuing notice and hear the stakeholders for any alleged violation of norms.

The HC has sought reply on this by March 5, said petitioners’ advocate Dhaval Barot.

Another such petition, filed last month by parents of 369 students, is pending in the HC objecting to administration’s decision to close the school on March 31, 2020.

Meanwhile, the DPS has withdrawn its petition filed in the Delhi high court challenging the CBSE’s order to de-affiliate the school over the allegations that it was obtained on a forged NOC.

424,['29/02/2020'],"Prodded by HC, time state acted on PoP idol makers","This story is from February 29, 2020

Nagpur: The Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court has directed the state government to bring in legislation for banning Plaster of Paris (PoP) idols across the state.

The court was hearing a petition filed by chief officer of Khamgaon Municipal Council Dhondiba Namwad against whom a complaint was lodged for disposing Ganesh idols in the waste dump yard.

Accusing Namwad for hurting religious sentiments of people, the complainant Omprakash Gupta had filed a criminal complaint against him in 2016. Refuting all allegations, Namwad had knocked the doors of judiciary seeking quashing of the first information report (FIR).

While hearing his petition on Thursday, HC asked the government to introduce a legislation for banning PoP idols and imposing heavy fine on its manufacturers. It also asked the government to explore the option of a uniform policy for disposing PoP idols in artificial tanks across the state.

The HC further quashed the FIR and imposed a fine of Rs1 lakh on Gupta for filing bogus complaint and misuse of law.

Environment activists have been demanding a blanket ban on manufacturing, sale and use of PoP idols since many years. Welcoming the court’s directives, they demanded urgent action by the state.

“The ban has come at right time as the process of idol making is yet to start. The government needs to first address the idol makers rather than the sellers. Also, religious sentiments are attached and hence public awareness about ill-effects of PoP idols need to be done on a war footing level,” said Kaustav Chatterjee, founder of NGO Green Vigil Foundation.

Stating that a lot myths are associated with the outer looks of idols, Anu Chhabrani from NGO Swachcha Association said, “The government should start by sensitizing the idol makers as well as citizens. Also, policy should be framed to construct small permanent tanks in all areas, periphery of lakes inside cities and big permanent tanks on the outskirts for the convenience of mandals.”

Stressing that the real challenge is immersion of big idols, Chatterjee said, “Number as well as height of big idols need to be reduced. The policymakers should formulate a law to fix the height of community idols. Administration should identify specific water- pit like abandoned mines for immersion of big idols.”

Chhabrani added that importing of idols in the city should be strictly checked for POP content.

LUCKNOW: A police constable was on Friday awarded life imprisonment while the then circle officer was sentenced to five years in jail in connection with the murder of a minor girl inside Nighasan police station in Lakhimpur Kheri on June 10, 2011.

The court, however, acquitted two other policemen, Shiv Kumar and Uma Shanker, for want of evidence.

The court had convicted two accused, constable Atiq Ahmad and the then circle officer Inayat Ullah Khan, on February 24 and fixed February 28 as the date for pronouncing the quantum of sentence.

CBI judge Pradeep Singh had found constable Atiq Ahmad guilty under sections 302 (murder) and 201 (disappearance of evidence) and circle officer Inayat Ullah Khan under section 201 of IPC. Atiq was posted as the gunner of the circle officer.

The court also imposed a fine of Rs 1 lakh on the constable and Rs 50,000 on Khan.

On June 10, 2011, girl’s mother had lodged an FIR at Nighasan police station claiming that her daughter had gone to graze the buffalo but did not return.

She said while searching for her daughter, she went inside Nighasan police station and found the girl’s body hanging from a dry tree.

She alleged that injuries on the girl’s body suggested that she had been raped and hanged from the tree to make it appear to be suicide case.

The investigation was initially conducted by CBCID which filed charge sheet against Atiq for rape and murder and accusing Shiv Kumar and Umashanker of destruction of evidence. “Later, CBI took up the probe and filed a charge sheet against Atiq for murder and disappearance of evidence and charging the other three, including the CO, with disappearance of evidence,” CBI public prosecutor Deep Narayan said.

427,['29/02/2020'],"Utttarakhand government defines 'forest' twice, high court rejects it both times","This story is from February 29, 2020

Representative image

NAINITAL: Two months after it stayed the definition of "" deemed forests "" introduced by the state government in November last year, the Uttarakhand high court (HC) on Friday once again put a stay on the changes made by the administration in February.

As reported by TOI earlier, the HC had on December 10 last year put a stay on the state government’s office order which defined deemed forest as “a patch of land of at least 10 hectares and having at least 60 % canopy cover along with at least 75% native species.”

This, environmentalists said, was ""an arbitrary definition"". They alleged that it was unclear how the government arrived at the figure of 10 hectare and 75% native species in categorising an area as forest land. They pointed out that in 2017, the Forest Survey of India had defined forest as one hectare or more land with 10% canopy cover. However, this definition was also questioned in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change that sought to know how this conclusion was reached.

“The dictionary meaning of the word forest ( any large area with trees and undergrowth) is being tampered with simply to make profit out of forest land,"" environmentalist Reenu Paul had told TOI when the definition was first announced.

Even as the HC was hearing three petitions challenging the original government order — the move had been opposed by several environmentalists who alleged that the decision was meant to primarily benefit the land and mining mafia in taking over forest land — the state government this month further tweaked the definition. As per the revised definition, deemed forest was now “a patch of land of at least five hectares and having 40 % canopy cover.”

Ajay Singh Rawat, a Nainital-based former professor of Kumaun University, who has petitioned against the state government in the matter, told TOI on Friday, “We welcome the HC directive. The new definition was primarily intended to duck the high court stay order, and to make the pending petitions in the case infructuous.”

Rajeev Bisht, the lawyer representing Rawat, added that the bench of Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia and Justice Narayan Singh Dhanik heard the case for three consecutive days before deciding to stay the new government order. “We argued before the court that the new definition was in complete violation of a Supreme Court order and is also against the Forest Conservation Act. However, the government through their counsels and forest officials said that the new definition was justified and that it benefits the forests. After hearing the arguments of both sides, the court decided to stay the revised definition as well,” Bisht said.

Rawat said, “If one went by the revised definition of the state government, around 9,000 square kilometer of forest land will not be considered so in the state. It is therefore clear that the aim of passing such orders is to …benefit the builder mafia.”

Madan Kaushik, urban development minister and spokesperson for the government, told TOI, “We will study the HC order in detail and further course of action will be decided accordingly.”

428,['29/02/2020'],Delhi: Shaheen Bagh women grieve for the riot-hit,"This story is from February 29, 2020

The chatter centred on the lives lost and grieving families

NEW DELHI: A sharpened need for their own security, a shared grief with “families who lost their sons” in the northeast Delhi violence and some disappointment that the case was deferred to March 23 marked the first reactions at Shaheen Bagh after Supreme Court said it did not find the climate conducive to proceed on the road-closure case.

“Supreme Court took the decision recognising the circumstances. It had already recognised our right to protest. In the current situation, if only SC had also seen it fit to say something about our own protection,” said Ritu Kaushik on the 75th day of the women’s protest on Thursday.

The report from SC on Wednesday had brought the women to their feet. After a cathartic spell of Delhi Police hai hai and Amit Shah hai hai, the men and women collapsed back into position, grieving the “riots and attacks” in northeast Delhi where some have family and friends.

“How many mothers must see sons killed for politicians to gain?” asked Fatima. From the stage, Amna Faheem tried to calm frayed tempers: “This fight is not of religion and it will not be allowed to become one despite all efforts. People of all faiths are here and we grieve for all who are shaheed in the violence.” Notably, the elder men were also out, taking to the stage to share animal parables that talk peace and humanity. “All youth have to be guided.”

Fear in their heart, steel in their eyes and message of peace on their lips, Shaheen Bagh spent Wednesday afternoon in dua, a tentful of people in quiet prayer.

The chatter centred on the lives lost and grieving families. “The instigators, the ones behind it, will all have to answer god — call him allah, call him bhagwan.”

Talking of the massive 2019 victory for Modi-led BJP, Bushaira Parveen said: “Vote dene ka sazaa hai ye? (Is this what we get for voting them?”

The violence came as a body blow. “This is what they will do? They keep talking population. So, kill some, nullify documents of some, chase people out by destroying their homes and documents and those who are left, keep them under their thumb,” said a woman, who had returned from visiting the affected families in Jafrabad. “They should know the public is against riots. That is a fact.”

Kehkeshan Riyaz said: “One Kapil Mishra wreaked havoc. Imagine how many Kapil Mishras would have been born had the Ayodhya verdict been in our favour.”

After every outburst, they returned to talk of their protest and the necessity to secure the “sanctuary of peace”. “What has happened is that their misrule and kala kanoon has brought Hindus and Muslims closer. That they cannot tolerate,” said Bushaira.

“The plan was to fatigue us out. Let this linger, the women will get tired. The idea is to crush the andolan. We held together through very difficult days, we shall continue,” said Zia Bano. They are wary for their own security. “Should we not be given adequate security?” Shaheen Kauser said, “Police in places is playing a role in worsening the social fabric,” but refused to paint all police with the same brush. “Yahan ki police seem more responsible,” is the general sentiment.

“We have no expectation from any government now,” said one, while Kauser added, “Our only hope lies with Supreme Court.” On AAP government, Riyaz said, “In our situation, we cannot trust political parties. But we plan to call Amanatullah Khan, our MLA, here and ask him if (CM) Kejriwal will pass a resolution against CAA and announce there will be no NPR.” Kauser said, “We will not accept the new format.”

429,['29/02/2020'],"After 2 yrs, waste removal begins at old trenching site","This story is from February 29, 2020

Dehradun: The Dehradun Municipal Corporation (DMC) has started the exercise to clean the Sahastradhara Road dumping site and ensure bio-treatment of the waste that had piled up in the area for over two years when the site was closed.

Recently, mayor Sunil Uniyal Gama had announced that a “Shaheed Smarak” will be built at the site.

Ved Prakash, assistant engineer, DMC who is co-ordinating the cleaning drive at the ground, told TOI onFriday, “The removal of legacy waste is in full swing. We have divided teams for segregating plastic waste with other trash for recycling purposes. We are also leveling the land and making it ready for the construction of Shaheed Smarak.”

Though the removal of garbage has brought some relief to area residents, absence of a proper garbage disposal system and lack of basic amenities like water supply still remain major challenges. Residents allege that though the site hasn’t been used as a trenching ground for two years, people from nearby localities often dump their domestic waste there.

Badal Sajwan, a resident of the locality, told TOI, “I have seen private vehicles coming late in the night to dump trash bags here. On occasions, we have intercepted such people but the practice hasn't stopped.”

Availability of clean drinking water is another major issue, residents add, complaining that they still have to depend on 1.5-inch-long water pipes for supply despite the locality comprising of around 30 houses and multi-storey buildings. “The population of the ward has increased significantly over the years but we still do not get adequate water supply for our households. Even after several complaints to Jal Sansthan and visits by officials, no concrete step was taken,” said Sundar Singh Tomar, another resident of the area. Manjula Tomar, president of the Vedant Puram Residents’ Welfare Association told TOI, “The closure of the dumping ground has given us respite from the constant stench and has paved the way for better property deals here. However, DMC has not yet provided us with the door-to-door garbage collection facility. The residents of the area still have to hire private vehicles for garbage disposal.”

Kamlesh Bhardwaj, who owns a shop in the area, added, “I settled here around a year ago. Since then, the land rates here have shot up from Rs 18,000 to Rs 25,000 per square yard.Many of us are hopeful that once the site is landscaped and a memorial to martyrs comes up on the site, it will give a further boost to the property market here.”

It isn’t just the onset of spring causing health disturbances, but the city’s deteriorating air quality too. According to the Safar Air Quality monitoring stations, air quality in Ahmedabad ranged from poor to very poor with AQI ( Air Quality Index ) readings from 282 to 345 across the city. Overall, the AQI was 302 for Ahmedabad, which is ‘very poor’.Track the pollution level in your cityAir quality at Pirana was the worst with an AQI reading of 345, which is considered ‘very poor’, whereas the lowest AQI value was in Satellite, at 282, which is ‘poor’.Dr Manoj Singh, consulting chest and critical care specialist, said there are two health issues arising from poor air quality. “If a person is healthy, he/she can have very bad viral infection due to the simultaneous hot and cold weather in the city. If a person is suffering from asthma or lung disease, suspended particles can enter the respiratory tract and can work as irritants, causing acute lung disease or asthma attack,” said Dr Singh.Experts from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said that this season, there have been colder days and hotter nights than normal. On Thursday, the city saw a change in weather due to the western disturbance.Doctors confirmed that the deteriorating air quality had led to an increase in cases of upper respiratory tract infections. Experts have called for initiating surveillance and regular monitoring of cases of respiratory illness. “The state health department and civic authorities must begin monitoring cases of bronchitis, asthma and other respiratory diseases, map them with the changing air quality and identify the threshold levels for public health. This data can come handy in deciding how and when alerts should be issued,” said Prof Dileep Mavalankar, director, IIPH, Gandhinagar.On measures taken, Dr Chirag Shah, in-charge of air quality in the AMC, said, “Various initiatives are being undertaken. The AMC has bought electric buses to reduce its carbon footprint, and the roads and buildings department has begun wall-to-wall carpeting to eliminate dust.”",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74409744,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-333823,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/air-quality-in-ahmedabad-deteriorates-to-very-poor/articleshow/74408504.cms

Thiruvananthapuram: Kerala water authority’s (KWA) decision to divert more water to Technopark has resulted in resentment in other parts of the city. This, along with its attempt to stock water for Attukal Pongala in the Iranimuttam tank, has resulted in water shortage in several parts of the city. Residents in Peroorkada protested by gheraoing the office of KWA assistant engineer on Friday.

Residents of AKG Nagar, Darshan Nagar and Krishna Nagar in Kudapanakkunnu gheraoed assistant engineer and assistant executive engineer of Peroorkada division after they failed to receive water continuously for several days.

“For the past two months, residents in these areas are deprived of drinking water. Most of them are senior citizens, who find it difficult to fetch water from tankers. These areas have never experienced water shortage in the past years. I am 63 years old. Never in my lifetime I witnessed such a shortage. When enquired, we learned that the water was diverted to Pongumoodu through valve control. If they wanted to divert water, it has to be done without bias,” said Hariharan P, president of Darshan Nagar residents’ association.

The residents withdrew the protest only after they received water following a meeting with KWA executive engineer in the presence of police.

Senior officials of KWA said that water was indeed diverted for Technopark as it was experiencing shortage for the past ten days.

“Technopark is located in the tail end of the areas coming under the Peroorkada tank. For the past 10 days, they have been experiencing shortage. We had to divert water to this area, which created shortage in other areas in Peroorkada,” KWA officials said.

Residential areas such as Sastamangalam, Vellayambalam and Nathancode etc. in the city, which are already facing water crisis, had to make calls for tankers again on Friday after the KWA division (South) started stocking water for Pongala in the Iranimuttam tank. KWA has to stock additional water in the tank to meet the requirements for the pongala on March 9 when lakhs of devotees will reach the city.

Due to the additional requirement, water could not be released from the PTP Nagar tank to affectied areas such as Sastamangalam and Kowdiar.

KWA officials said that considering the shortage experienced in several areas, a campaign would be launched soon to curb wastage of water. “Treated water is used for various purposes, including washing cars and watering plants, while people in other areas are not getting water to meet basic needs. We will launch a campaign after Attukal Pongala to make city residents aware of the situation,” said KWA officials.

A school was burnt in northeast Delhi during communal riots (File photo)

NEW DELHI: Delhi high court on Friday ordered the AAP government and police to make full-proof security arrangement at board exam centres in northeast Delhi , which has been rocked by violence.

Justice Rajiv Shakdher issued the direction while hearing a plea of a school seeking change in its centre, which is located in the area.

The court issued notices to the government and Delhi Police and sought their stand on the petition by March 4. It noted that the government and police “should ensure the (exam) centres are sanitised and there is no breach of security”, adding that the situation in northeast Delhi appears to be “improving.”

During the hearing, CBSE told the court that it has already postponed the exams for classes X and XII scheduled for Friday and Saturday at 86 centres in northeast Delhi. However, it was hopeful to conduct the papers from March 2. The board added that it has no plan to shift the centres to other locations.

Advocate Kamal Gupta, appearing for the school, informed the court that there was no police presence at the centres in northeast Delhi and highlighted news reports that schools and buses had been burnt down in the area. The court on Wednesday took note of the “worsening situation” in the area and directed CBSE to come up with a plan to reschedule the board exams or change the affected centres.

The private school, Bhai Parmanand Vidya Mandir at Surya Niketan in east Delhi, has said in its plea that the centre allotted to them was 16km away from their school and situated in Chandu Nagar-Karawal Nagar road, one of the violence-hit areas. The petitioners, including some students, have said it would be difficult for them to reach the centre due to the clashes. They have urged the court to direct CBSE to change the centre.

Aurangabad: In a first, Yavatmal district police have successfully conducted an online crime review meeting, thus saving precious man-hours and money spent on travelling of police officers for the meeting.

According to senior police officers, this project has been set up without spending a single rupee of the state exchequer.

“As setting up and running of this unit does not require any approval for spending money, the scope of red-tapism in implementation of the project has automatically been wiped away,” M Raj Kumar, Yavatmal superintendent of police , said to TOI.

The project is the brainchild of Noorul Hasan, an officer of 2015 IPS batch, currently serving as additional superintendent of police (Yavatmal district). Additional SP Noorul told TOI, “We have used the existing resources. All we had to do was get a license from NIC Delhi, followed by NIC Yavatmal for using the secured line and open interface.” It requires a software from NIC Delhi, locally available internet and an android device, he added. Police can also review pendency of cases, law and order situation as well as progress in any given case during such meetings.

In the recently concluded crime review meeting, the district superintendent of police was connected with an additional superintendent of police, six sub divisional police officers and officers heading each of the 31 police stations in the district. This crime review was attended by all the investigation officers till the rank of constabulary.

The officer said that it is mandatory for all the sub divisional police officers, police station in-charge, local crime branch and special branch heads to attend the crime review meeting. “For the crime review meeting, the officers end up leaving their respective jurisdictions to reach the police headquarters. If any untoward incident takes place on the meeting day or any law and order situation arisis in their jurisdiction, the police’s response time becomes poor. Use of this application, which can be used through the cellphone, laptop as well as desktop has addressed several such odd problems,” said Noorul, who along with his officers has implemented the project after successfully carrying out six months’ testing.

The protest tent served as the prayer venue

NEW DELHI: At the mosques, roads and even in rubble-riddled compounds in Jafrabad-Maujpur, Friday prayers passed off peacefully. In other areas in northeast Delhi , where 42 people were killed in communal clashes, the Jumma prayers similarly went off without incident. Bhagirathi Vihar in Mustafabad, however, remained on edge when the locals were prevented from praying at the mosque there.

While Section 144 of CrPC had been lifted for 10 hours to allow assembly of people, police used drones to monitor the situation in the sensitive areas. “The drones have a range of one kilometre and we can be forewarned of any suspicious gathering,” a police officer said.

On the main Jafrabad road, hundreds gathered at the Faizan-e-Madina Masjid located adjacent to the anti-citizenship laws protest site. The protest tent served as the prayer venue. Mohammad Faizan, a resident of Welcome Colony, said that whenever situations like these arose, the community gathered for Jumma namaz here to support each other.

In Maujpur, Muslims offered prayers on the rooftop of the Brijpuri masjid, which was burnt down by rioters on Tuesday, the Indian flag fluttering by their side. In Chand Bagh, the worst affected locality, hundreds turned up at the Moonga Nagar Jama Masjid around 1pm, while police filtered the crowd to permit only those going to the mosque to proceed. “There were many more Muslims living in the area,” noted Farhan. “But after what happened, they were scared and have vacated the area.”

At the Ashok Nagar Badi Masjid — the alleged attacks on it had gone viral on social media — there was no namaz on Friday. Instead of the faithful, there was a heavy presence of paramilitary forces and non-Muslim residents. Asked by TOI reporters about prayers at the mosque on normal days, a resident said that “over 300 people gather here for prayers, and they always block the road”.

When asked why none had reached the mosque on Friday, an angry local bristled, “How can they come? We will not let them come here.” He also heckled the TOI reporter and photojournalist.

Normalcy in social relations will take time it seems, with people not being allowed to go to the local mosques in some places here. Mahmood Hassan, a retired AIIMS official, claimed that the lane on which he lived near Meena Masjid had witnessed intense clashes on Monday. “Our neighbours are not allowing us to enter the mosque because they feel outsiders will also gain entry to the locality.”

Rajeev Dixit, another resident on the lane, maintained, “There are only 5-7 Muslim households here. So where is the need to go to a specific place for worship in this tense scenario? There are many places where they offer prayers.”

Nitin Gadkari

PUDUCHERRY: Union road transport and highways, micro, small and medium enterprises minister Nitin Gadkari said the ministry will consider the Puducherry government’s request to declare stretches of state highway as national highway in the Union territory.

He was here on Friday to review the national highways projects in the Union territory. Later speaking to reporters, he termed the outcome of the meeting ‘positive’ and assured that the ministry will clear all the issues raised by chief minister V Narayanasamy. He said one of the issues – declaring stretches of state highway into national highway may take some time’.

“First of all, let me complete my commitment and in future, we will think about it (declaring state highways into national highways,” he said.

He revealed that the ministry has changed the alignment of the ring road after the objections raised by the ashram and people. “We have made a new study and based on that we have selected a new alignment and today we finalized it (new alignment),” he said.

On the proposed elevated roads within the town limits, Gadkari assured that the ministry will complete the project with essential components like underpass and adequate lighting arrangements before transferring it to the Puducherry government.

Narayanasamy said he urged the minister to expedite four road projects connecting Mahabalipuram and Puducherry, Villupuram with Nagapattinam , Murungapakkam with Sivaji statue junction on the east coast road and Madagadipet with the Puducherry town. Gadkari earlier visited National institute of technology (NIT) at Karaikal and awarded degrees to the successful students at the 6th convocation ceremony. Speaking on the occasion, he urged the students to imbibe entrepreneurial skills and undertake research to come out with innovate ideas, projects and solutions catering to the needs of their local communities and regions.

“Education, knowledge and technology are important but what is most important is entrepreneurship skills. We have financial management institutions offering masters in business administration and human resources. But we don’t have an institute for development of management of entrepreneurship and enterprises,” he said. He pointed out that when sugar mills in Maharashtra started incurring huge losses, he mooted the idea of extracting ethanol from sugarcane. He said ethanol has a wide range of uses including manufacturing plastic materials that will degrade within 72hours. “You have to undertake research on the strength and weakness of your region and analyse the raw materials available,” he said.

436,['29/02/2020'],Traffic law enforcement drive from tomorrow,"This story is from February 29, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: The accident involving a speeding car at Kowdiar on Wednesday night has prompted the city police commissioner to intensify traffic law enforcement in the city. The decision has been taken after it has been confirmed that the accident was a case of rash and negligent driving.

City police commissioner Balramkumar Upadhyay said that the police will start a special law enforcement drive from March 1 onwards.

The focus will be on young motorists and two-wheeler riders, including pillion riders, who are not wearing helmets.

“It is a fact that death rate has come down ever since helmet was made compulsory for pillion riders. But we have noticed that majority of pillion riders are still reluctant to wear helmet,” the commissioner said.

In the previous year, the city police had booked as many as 22,567 two-wheeler riders for riding without helmet. The goal of the police is to drastically bring down this figure.

In January, the police had booked over 500 motorists for helmetless riding as part of a special drive conducted in connection with Road Safety Awareness Week.

The special drive of the city police will coincide with an awareness campaign being launched by the state police department, in association with a private firm, to encourage use of helmets. The campaign will be inaugurated here on Monday.

The second priority under of the special drive will be checking rash and negligent driving among the youths. It was a 21-year-old youth who was driving the car that crashed into the electric pole on the median on Kowdiar–Vellayambalam stretch on Wednesday night. The police are yet to verify whether he had a driving licence or not. He is still under treatment.

As per the latest available data on road accidents released by national crime records bureau, which is of the year 2018, there were a total of 14,247 cases of accidents owing to rash and negligent driving reported in the state. This is the highest in the country. As many as 1,515 people had died in those accidents.

Hundreds offered prayers for the people killed in the rioting

NEW DELHI: Congregational prayer in the aftermath of riots can be an uneasy affair. But Friday felt like most other days of prayers at old Delhi’s Jama Masjid and its neighbourhood. At the Jamia Millia Islamia Central Mosque , however, the proceedings were tinged with sadness at the loss of lives in the communal frenzy in northeast Delhi .

At the historic Jama Masjid, people came in decent numbers for the Jummah prayers amid strong police security. Farooq Ahmed of Kaumi Ekta Sangathan Trust stood outside the mosque with a placard requesting citizens to maintain communal harmony. “Our trust organised peace marches outside various mosques today. I have already visited two places,” Ahmed said.

Arshad Ali Fehmi, who lives near the masjid, said everyone desired peace and amity and were contributing in their way to maintain calm. Another man, who requested not to be named, added, “Those indulging in violence are misguided by miscreants who don’t want peace or social unity.” Many people at Jama Masjid, however, avoided talking much about the anti-citizenship law protests.

At Jamia Millia Islamia in south Delhi, hundreds offered prayers for the people killed in the rioting, with some breaking down in the middle of the prayers. Khalid Faruqi, 75, a Jamia Nagar resident, was aggrieved at the lack of official action to prevent the violence. “Ask Modi, Ask Amit Shah. They could have stopped the violence in five minutes. It has to end now,” he said. “Humanity is dying, not Hindu or Muslim. Lives, homes and livelihoods, regardless of religion, have been lost.”

Before prayers, the imam pleaded on the loudspeaker for peace and asked people to assist the riot victims. “We should help in every way possible. Try and adopt the orphans. This is our Hindustan. Let us not spread the various rumours going around. We have to keep the peace,” he said. He sobbed at one point while addressing the congregation.

While the prayers finished without incident, some Jamia students sat on an impromptu protest afterwards, raising anti-government slogans targeting both central and Delhi leaders. Mohammad Shabeeb, a 24-year-old international relations student from Kerala, said, “I am not politically active, but today I am standing against what happened in northeast Delhi. Against police, aggressive Hindutva, against brutality.”

On the main road, local residents collected food supplies and money for the families affected by the violence. “We are giving everyone, irrespective of their religion, ration, water and first aid,” a volunteer said.

Delhi high court (File photo)

NEW DELHI: Delhi high court on Friday sought the response of the Centre , Delhi government and police on a batch of plea demanding registration of FIRs against several politicians, including Congress’ Sonia and Rahul Gandhi , and AIMIM’s Akbaruddin Owaisi , for allegedly making hate speeches .

One of the plea by a lawyers’ group has named the Gandhis as well as Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, MLA Amanatullah Khan, and AIMIM’s Owaisi and Waris Pathan. A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice C Hari Shankar issued the notice on the Lawyers Voice’s petition, which wants setting up of a special investigation team (SIT) to look into the alleged hate speeches.

The court also acted on three separate applications — by one Sanjjiiv Kkumaar, Hindu Sena’s Vishnu Gupta and Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad — who have sought to intervene in a petition moved early this week for lodging FIRs against BJP’s Anurag Thakur, Parvesh Verma and Kapil Mishra for alleged hate speeches.

Kkumaar has sought an FIR against activist Harsh Mander, who has demanded an FIR against the BJP leaders. Kkumaar has also sought FIRs against Khan, Bollywood actor Swara Bhasker and RJ Sayema for alleged hate speeches. Gupta has sought prosecution of Pathan, Asaduddin and Akbaruddin Owaisi. Azad argued that an FIR against Mishra must be registered immediately, alleging his speeches were “responsible for inciting” the violence in northeast Delhi. All matters will be heard along with Mander’s PIL on April 13.

Aurangabad: The Aurangabad bench of Bombay high court on Friday directed the civic body, Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) and the public works department (PWD) to fill potholes within 10 days after a complaint has been filed.

The bench, comprising Justices Z A Haq and S M Gavhane, said: “If the grievance of the citizen/citizens is not addressed within 10 days, the police department shall start an investigation and if the police find that a crime needs to be registered, the same shall be done within 3 days of starting the investigation.’’

The bench added that “on receipt of any complaint by email or on social media, the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) official shall redress the grievance within 10 days from the receipt of the complaint. On receipt of the complaint directly by the police department, the same shall be forwarded immediately to the municipal corporation.”

A lawyer, Rupesh Jaiswal, had filed a PIL in September 2013 seeking directions to the civic body and other agencies to fill potholes and properly maintain the roads in Aurangabad.

“The matter came up before the bench on Friday and the next hearing has been posted for March 3,” Jaiswal said.

A Nagpur-bench — headed by justices Z A Haq — in a suo motu petition had passed similar order on October 16, 2019 to the Nagpur Municipal Corporation.

The respondents in Aurangabad’s PIL admitted that they were aware of the Nagpur bench orders and subsequently, on Friday, the AMC deputy commissioner (revenue) Sumant More, executive engineer of the PWD Sundardas Bhagat and MSRDC’s Vikram Jadhav filed separate affidavits stating that they would comply with the high court order.

They also agreed that if residents wish to lodge complaints regarding potholes with their departments in their respective jurisdictions, they could do so by lodging their grievances on the helpline number, WhatsApp number and other social media platforms. They also said these numbers would be given wide publicity.

Assistant commissioner of police (traffic branch), Dineshkumar Kolhe also filed an affidavit stating that the police department will provide the email ID of Aurangabad police by giving wide publication in local newspapers, appealing citizens to lodge immediate complaints regarding potholes which may become reason for vehicular accidents or hurdle for smooth road traffic.

“The police department will also share WhatsApp number and twitter handle so that the complaints can be lodged by citizens,” he said.

UP deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma

LUCKNOW: For the first time, UP government has said in writing that none of the protestors, arrested for violence which rocked the state during anti-CAA protests in December last year, has been booked for sedition.

Speaking in the Vidhan Parishad on Friday, deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma said 126 people, arrested for violence, had been charged with damage to public property and under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

Samajwadi Party MLC Shatrudra Prakash, in response to whose query the details of cases were shared, said his purpose of asking the question was to make the government admit that none of the arrested persons had been charged under sedition.

“I am glad that the government has finally accepted this. You have been accusing all the protesters of being anti-national but it is clear from your response that they have only been arrested for damage to property and for protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act,” he said.

Prakash added it was the constitutional right of citizens to hold protests.

He also sought to know whether, as per directions issued by the Supreme Court, notices were issued to arrested persons like activists Sadaf Jafar, SR Darapuri and Deepak Kabir, as punishment for sections slapped against them was maximum of seven years.

“Now, that the government has accepted that these people are not anti-national, did it bother serving them notices at all? Has investigation into their cases ended,” he asked.

Responding to a question by SP MLC Shashank Singh who claimed there seemed to be no proof of Jafar, Darapuri and Kabir being involved in violence, the deputy CM said cases against them would not be reviewed as it were already in court and government would not interfere in police investigation.

Around 33 lakh tonne of sugar cane has been crushed in the last three months

KOLHAPUR: The state government has failed to take action against most of the private and cooperative sugar factories which have failed to pay farmers as per the fair remunerative price (FRP) for the current crushing season within the stipulated time.

Of the 140 sugar factories in the state, 71 mills have made payments as per the FRP. As many as 69 factories have arrears to the tune of Rs 853 crore.

According to the data released by the office of the sugar commissioner, it has not served notice to a single sugar factory for failing to pay farmers as per FRP for the current crushing season, which began in last week of November, 2019.

The government’s current stand assumes significance as it had served notices to almost 100 private and cooperative sugar factories during the last crushing season. Notices were served for violating the Sugarcane Control Act, under which it is mandatory for sugar mills to pay farmers as per FRP within 15 days after cane is taken for crushing.

Sources in the sugar sector said that the government was going slow on making payments to the farmers in view of the financial crisis before factories because of water scarcity and flood in parts of Maharashtra .

Sugar commissioner Saurabh Rao told TOI that the government would serve notices to sugar factories if they did not make payment as per FRP. “Most of the factories are in the process of making payment as per FRP. We will act if we get any complaint,” he said. As per data, sugar factories in Maharashtra have total arrears to the tune of Rs 390 crore till date.

Cane production in Maharashtra is likely to be affected by 30 % due to water scarcity in Marathwada region and flood and unseasonal rainfall in western Maharashtra.

In the last crushing season, around 952.6 lakh metric tonne of cane was crushed and sugar production had crossed 1,000 lakh quintal. In the current season, Maharashtra has crushed 33 lakh metric tonne of cane in the past three months. Sources in the sugar sector said that the availability of cane for crushing has come down by 30 % this season, because of which sugar production may also be affected.

Aurangabad: City police commissioner Chiranjeev Prasad has directed his personnel to carry out surprise checks of mobile phones of citizens in the backdrop of videos about the recent Delhi riots going rife on social media.

Prasad told TOI, “After we found that some anti-social elements are trying to peddle hate by using videos showing the riots, violence and desecration of religious places, we ordered our personnel to carry out surprise checks of mobile phones of people they find suspect.”

“We have told our personnel to register offences against such people found sharing or spreading such messages and videos,”he said.

Prasad, however, said that he has cautioned his personnel to check only social media accounts and group messages on mobile phones.

Over the past two days, the police have issued notices to two people after some hate content was found in their mobile phones.

Deputy commissioner of police (zone-II) Rahul Khade, along with a few police sub-inspectors (PSIs), carried out checks in his jurisdiction over the past two days.

A PSI who was part of Khade’s team said, “We are not even concerned about adult content in a mobile phone. We are just checking if any message or video about communal hatred has been shared by the person or has been received in any group he is part of, such as on WhatsApp.”

Civil society members are divided on Prasad’s diktat, with some in support of the police action and others citing rulings of the Supreme Court.

Social activist Faisal Qureshi said, “Social media is more misused than used. The spread of communal hatred as well as false propaganda is done through elements who want to divide the country. We welcome and support the police’s move.”

However, human rights activists, while maintaining that the objective may be good and in the interest of the overall law and order, said the diktat also has to be legal.

Human rights activist and lawyer Asim Sarode said, “First of all, it is the duty of commoners to delete any such hate content or video they receive over social media. At the same time, when the Supreme Court in 2017 had decided that right to privacy is a fundamental right, it would be inappropriate for the police to check someone’s mobile phone without prima facie reason as well as substantial ground.”

Retired police officer and assistant commissioner of police Khushalchand Baheti said civilians have a right to know the identity of the policemen before they hand over their mobile phones to them.

Moreover, social media content shared in groups should be checked in the presence of mobile phone owner.

Firozkhan lost 10 of his family in the massacre. Among those who were killed were his mother, grandmother, brother, sister-in-law, nephew, nieces and aunt. He was also the complainant against human rights activist Teesta Setalvad , accusing her of misappropriating funds collected in the name of Gulbarg Society victims.

Firoz Bandeli Shaikh, who lived with his family in the Gulbarg Society flats , says he will move into his old house if the others do. “As so many people died there, most are reluctant to return,” said Firoz, who has a music band and currently lives in Juhapura.

The uninhabited Gulbarg Society wears a haunted look with soot still visible on walls of the burnt houses. Weeds and thorny shrubs have covered most part of its premises. The only person who can be seen in the society every day is Qasam Mansuri, who is also the owner of a house. Qasam runs a mattress-making business and can be seen making matresses with a helper from 10 am to 6 pm. If all these people move in, the society will see life after 18 years.

Kajal

GHAZIABAD: A 29-year-old man allegedly strangled his wife, four-year-old daughter and two-year-old son with his hands before tying a noose with his wife’s dupatta and using it to hang himself.The bodies were discovered on Friday morning at their first-floor apartment at Sanjay Nagar in Arthala, Sahibabad. The man, Dheeraj Tyagi (29), was from Bijnor and worked at a welding shop in Sahibabad. He lived in the single-room apartment with his wife, Kajal (27), and their two children — Ekta and Dhruv. Ekta had just started out as a nursery student at a school in the locality.“Main Dheeraj Kajal se bahut pyaar karta tha, par Kajal ladkon se phone par baat karti thi (I, Dheeraj, loved Kajal a lot, but she would speak to men on the phone),” went the purported suicide note, scribbled with a black marker on a pink wall, right next to photos of Kajal and Ekta. To the left of the note was a heart pierced by an arrow and the letters ‘D’ and ‘K’, and four numbers of the “men Kajal would speak to”. A nearly empty bottle of rum lay toppled on the floor. “It’s possible that he got drunk, killed his family and then himself,” a police officer said.Every morning around 9, Dheeraj and a friend, Bheem, would go to work together. “When Bheem got here on Friday morning and called him outside the house, there was no response. He called Dheeraj on the phone and got no response again. He went upstairs and knocked. When there was no response again, he managed to prise open a window and get in,” said Kaushalya, the landlady. “He found Dheeraj hanging and the bodies of the others on the bed.”Bheem scrambled downstairs, told Kaushalya and they informed police. “They had to break the door open to gain entry … Just yesterday night, I had seen Dheeraj return from work with dinner he had bought for the family,” Kaushalya said. She didn’t hear anything on Thursday. And the single-room apartment right next to Dheeraj’s is occupied by a single man, who was away at the time.And there may have been other problems. Their son, Dhruv, had been sick since birth and undergoing treatment at a Delhi hospital. “Dheeraj had been facing a financial crunch. Dhruv’s treatment was expensive and Dheeraj had borrowed money for that but not been able to repay his creditors … In September last year, Dheeraj had bought a 50 sqm plot in Ghaziabad , registered in Kajal’s name. He had been planning to sell that off to pay for their son’s treatment,” he added.Dheeraj seems to have suspected Kajal’s brothers were trying to get hold of that plot, a family member said. “Is saari kahaani ki wajah Kajal ke bhai hain (At the root of all this are Kajal’s brothers),” a postscript to his ‘note’, scribbled in pencil, said.A neighbour said she had never witnessed any sign of trouble in the household.Police are waiting for the autopsy reports before deciding on the next line of investigation. “The reports will disclose the exact cause of death but it does look like Dheeraj strangled his wife and children with his hands. We will look into everything Dheeraj wrote in his suicide note,” said Ghaziabad SSP Kalanidhi Naithani.",ghaziabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74409754,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-127533,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/suspecting-infidelity-man-strangles-wife-and-2-kids-before-hanging-self/articleshow/74409272.cms
452,['29/02/2020'],SC: Can Uttarakhand hydel projects be shifted to non-eco fragile zones?,"This story is from February 29, 2020

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday suggested exploring the feasibility of shifting hydro-electric power projects on Bhagirathi and Alaknanda rivers in Uttarakhand to non-eco fragile zones to facilitate resumption of the projects which have been stalled for the last seven years.

“It should be considered for all projects across the country and not only for Uttarakhand. Pure commercial consideration cannot be the sole criterion. We agree there is need for power. But protecting environment and lives of people are more important. Power projects can be relocated. They need not be in ecologically fragile areas,” a bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices B R Gavai and Surya Kant said.

“Our anxiety, in addition to environment, is to protect the lives of people. For project proponents, it is profit. We are suggesting the government to relocate as we have larger interests to guard. Thermal power plants should be stopped. Have you been to Chandrapur (where a super thermal power plant is located)? You cannot breathe in that city,” CJI Bobde said.

But the suggestion of relocation did not go down well with senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, who was appearing for GMR Badrinath Hydro Power Generation Pvt Ltd, which is constructing a 300 mw project on Alaknanda river near Badrinath. He said, “We will go away. Seven years after investing huge amount in a project that is stuck because of court orders, relocation would mean constructing the hydro-electric power project from scratch at a new location. What happens to the economy?”

Appearing for a PIL petitioner, advocate Prashant Bhushan said the state was power surplus and did not require more hydro-electric projects. Two committees had concluded that these projects contributed to the unprecedented floods that devastated the state in 2013 and that the SC had directed the ministries of power, water resources and environment to file a consolidated affidavit after taking into account all aspects, he said and complained that no such affidavit had been filed yet.

Rohatgi said one of the committees set up by the government had recommended resumption of work at six hydro-electric projects, including the one being constructed by GMR. But the SC adjourned hearing for four weeks while asking the ministry of environment and forests to file a consolidated affidavit.

After unprecedented floods devastated the hill state in June 2013, the SC on August 14, 2013, ordered fresh environment impact assessment of 24 under-construction hydro-electric projects, which involve an investment of Rs 20,000 crore, on the two rivers to examine whether these projects “contributed to the tragedy”. All projects have been stalled since then as many committees have examined the issue.

The SC had also asked the environment ministry and the state government not to grant environmental or forest clearances to any project till further orders. But it had cleared construction of Srinagar hydro-electric project in Uttarakhand by the Alaknanda Hydro Power Company .

454,['29/02/2020'],Govt rebuffs plea on Census caste data,"This story is from February 29, 2020

File image used for representation.

NEW DELHI: The Centre has rebuffed an attempt to secure an OBC headcount in the population by cold-shouldering a plea to rescue the data of the socio-economic caste census (SECC) that has been lying in disuse for over six years.

It is learnt that the “national commission for sub-categorisation of OBCs” lobbied the Centre to put the SECC data to use. The subject was discussed with the government and the Registrar General of India but there was no positive indication from the government. Since then, the Justice Rohini panel has got another extension but without the assurance that it will be handed the SECC data.

With the government having refused to enumerate the OBCs in the 2021 decennial census starting in April, the reluctance to move on the SECC means blowing an opportunity to collate caste-wise population count. The decennial census only collects the specifics of SCs, STs and religious identity.

On Thursday, the contentious subject got a fresh lease of currency after the Bihar assembly passed a resolution seeking a caste-wise census in 2021. The Maharashtra assembly has already passed a Bihar-like resolution while Biju Janata Dal raised the demand in Lok Sabha this month. Interestingly, then home minister Rajnath Singh in August 2018 announced that 2021 census will enumerate OBCs but the Centre went back on it.

Inserting the caste parameter in the census at this late stage may be difficult and the hope of Mandal advocates may now rest only on the SECC. The SECC, ordered by UPA-2, collected caste details of the households in addition to socio-economic parameters, in what was billed as the first backward caste census since independence. The last caste census, which gave details of OBC headcount too, was done in 1931.

However, Modi government refused to process the caste dimension of the SECC. Owing to the campaign launched by RJD of Lalu Prasad ahead of 2015 Bihar polls, the Centre announced the constitution of an expert panel to analyse the SECC data. But the government never constituted the expert committee.

According to sources, the Rohini panel suggested to the government that caste data will help in better sub-categorising the OBCs, which entails division of Mandal castes into sub-groups and apportioning of 27% reservation quantum among them.

“If there has been such an elaborate exercise, its data should be used. Else, it will go waste. But the problem is that neither Niti Ayog nor social justice ministry nor the home ministry want to take responsibility for classification of castes as received in the survey,” said a senior official.

455,['29/02/2020'],Small plot key to solving MIDC Hingna transport woes,"This story is from February 29, 2020

Nagpur: Industrialists in MIDC Hingna have demanded handing over of a small patch of land that once had a railway siding to MIDC for easing of traffic congestion on Hingna and Amravati roads. The land, around one km in length and 12-16 metres wide, splits MIDC Hingna into two parts. It belongs to Ordnance Factory Ambajhari (OFAJ).

A delegation of Chamber of Small Industry Associations (COSIA), Vidarbha Chapter, led by Mayank Shukla and Julfesh Shah met divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar and joint director of industries Ashok Dharmadhikari and requested to pursue the matter with with Defence Ministry and OFAJ for handing over land to MIDC Hingna.

Shukla told TOI, OFAJ had already handed over 5.5km stretch having the same defence siding to Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) for London Street project. This 1 km stretch within MIDC Hingna is left and is causing serious problems to industries and people.

“Heavy vehicles and people from Wadi side or Hingna side cannot cross over easily. They have to use Hingna road and Amravati road for reaching the other side. or for going towards Outer Ring Road. Three internal roads can be constructed this land become available easing pressure on these roads. Industries can use remaining land for expansion or parking,” he said.

Shah said people using Hingna road and Amravati road will get a huge relief. “Hingna road and Amravati road from MIDC Hingna square to Amravati national highway have become congested due to flow of heavy traffic. Also, Metro Rail corridor on Hingna road has made Hingna road narrow. Large number of students of colleges situated in areas near MIDC Hingna use it daily. Heavy vehicles and huge manpower coming to industries will not need to use Hingna road and Amravati road if abandoned line is handed over to MIDC Hingna,” he said.

Shah added OFAJ will get revenue from land and MIDC Hingna will get some revenue from lease of land to industries. “Otherwise too, OFAJ cannot use this land for any other purpose,” he said.

A railway siding used to link OFAJ with main trunk line near Narendra Nagar via Khamla, Parsodi, Yashoda Nagar until 80s. The line fell into disuse later.

COSIA requested Dharmadhikari to give vacant industrial plots to existing industries for expansion and other usages instead of entertaining new ones. “Urgent need is to establish common effluent treatment plant for ensuring zero discharge of industrial wastewater and sewage water. State transport bus facility for employees, development of parking zones, installation of CCTV cameras at prominent places, 24x7 water supply and collection of garbage on daily basis also needs to be resolved,” memorandum said.

456,['29/02/2020'],Gadkari close aide Dive on Mafsu’s executive council,"This story is from February 29, 2020

Nagpur: Governor of Maharashtra Bhagat Singh Koshyari, who is also chancellor of all universities in the state, nominated city-based Sudhir Dive as member of executive council of Maharashtra Animal and Fishery Sciences University (Mafsu) on Friday.

Dive is one of the close aides of Union minister Nitin Gadkari. He was officer on special duty (OSD) and public relation officer of Gadkari until recently. During the Lok Sabha elections held last year, BJP had appointed Dive as in-charge of Wardha Lok Sabha constituency.

Dive owns a fairly big gaushala (cowshed) in Dhanoli village of Wardha district and also runs Dive Bandhu Cow Products Pvt Ltd, a company under Late Wamanrao Dive Charitable Trust. He has been nominated as representative of dairy industry as per the provisions in the university laws.

As per Mafsu Act, executive council is one of the four highest authorities of the university and it has power to outline broadly what programmes the university should have in the academic sessions. The council also frames annual financial estimates of the university, establishes and maintains constituent colleges, departments, hostels, research institutes, farms, schools, and also sanctions honorary degrees. It has power to transfer any movable or immovable property on behalf of the university.

With vice-chancellor as its ex officio chairman, the executive council has more than 45 members. Commissioners of agriculture, animal husbandry, fisheries, dairy development, and principal chief conservator of forest, three MLCs, two MLAs nominated by their respective Houses, one representative each nominated by ICAR and ICMR are some of them. Governor-nominated members of this council include one eminent scientist in the field of veterinary and animal science, representatives of dairy, poultry and fisheries industries, and one eminent woman social worker.

Maharashtra’s minister of animal husbandry and dairy development is ex officio pro-chancellor of Mafsu. He can also nominate two progressive livestock breeders or fisheries breeders on this body. Presently, minister Sunil Kedar is pro-chancellor of the university and he is yet to do his nominations. Sources at Mafsu said the chancellor is yet to nominate representatives of poultry and fishery industries.

Dive is known to have introduced latest embryo breeding technique for desi dairy cows in his cowshed. Recently, first calf of Gir breed was born in his gaushala to a desi cow with this technique. Mafsu vice-chancellor Dr Ashish Paturkar said Dive’s experience will be beneficial for the university.

“Dive has been working on breeding and conservation of desi cows for the last several years. He has done some projects in collaboration with Mafsu scientists in the past too,” said Paturkar.

Dive was not available for his comments, but a senior office-bearer of his cow product company said his focus will be on making desi cattle rearing a profitable business.

Dharwad: Shadakshar Settar, popular among his readers as Sha Settar , 85, a man of wide-ranging interests and encylopaedic knowledge on disciplines ranging from history and archaeology to spirituality breathed his last at a Bengaluru hospital on Friday morning. An itinerant academic , Settar’s passion took him far from the place of his birth – a tiny village called Hamapasagar in Ballari district – setting him traipsing across the globe.

His years as a student, when he travelled from Ballari to Mysuru, then Dharwad before setting for Cambridge University in England, anticipated his life as a roving scholar. He returned to India, to Dharwad, more specifically, where he served as a professor of history in Karnatak University.

From treatises on Halegannada (Ancient Kannada) to a work on Hoysala sculptures preserved in a museum in Denmark, his scholarly corpus encompassed and oftentimes, integrated many disparate disciplines.

Keenly interested in Jain rituals, Settar’s study on ‘Sallekhana’, a practice among monks to fast unto death bagged him the prestigious Kundukunda award. Settar worked at the National Museum Institute of History of Art, Conservation and Museology in 1978, and was associated with the Indian Council for Historical Research in 1996, besides which he served as a visiting professor at the National Institute of Advanced Studies in Bengaluru.

Dubbing Settar an unparalleled scholar, historian HS Gopal Rao told TOI, “It is a massive loss. Settar’s contributions were not confined to one branch of history. His research ranged from art history to linguistics, and philosophy to archaeology. In fact, the first volume on a subject he was occupied with is now ready for publishing.”

A longtime resident of Dharwad, Settar owned a sprawling mansion in the city called ‘Malamaddi’. Although he sold his opulent mansion, and left for Bengaluru, his love for Dharwad remained undiminished. Never did he miss an opportunity to visit Dharwad, even making an appearance and participating in the Kannada Sahitya Sammelana that was hosted in the city. His impressions on the city he cherished, Settar chronicled in the column ‘Why I Love Dharwad’ that was published in TOI.

Mangaluru: Adline Castelino, who was last week crowned LIVA Miss Diva Universe 2020 had a glorious homecoming on Friday. Hailing from Udyavara in Udupi district, she will now go on to represent Incredible India at the Miss Universe.

“This journey is not only mine. To represent India at Miss Universe is not just the dream of a girl, I am going to represent the hopes and dreams of an entire nation. When I do that I need your support and love. It is everyone’s dream and when we are all united, we can definitely achieve it,” she told reporters.

On winning the LIVA Miss Diva Universe 2020 crown, she said, “From the past two years I have been envisioning the finale and wearing the crown. When it happened, I wanted to hug everyone on stage. I could not believe that my dream had come true,” she gushed.

Daughter of Alphonsus and Meera Castelino working in Kuwait, Adline graduated in business management from Wilson College in Mumbai. Hailing from the coastal belt, she is keen on being involved in agriculture and support farmers. She is associated with Vikas Sahayog Pratishthan and believes that bringing together NGOs with like-minded visionaries who wish to help farmers will increase their revenue and help in a sustainable livelihood.

Adline is keen on empowering women and their leadership qualities by conducting leadership programmes as well as spreading more awareness about the acceptance of the LGBTQ community.

A badminton player during her school and college days, Adline loves sports. Deepa Mallik, the first Indian woman to win a medal at the Para Olympics, is her inspiration. She embodies the belief that “What the mind can conceive, a person can achieve.” Dancing, reading and cycling are hobbies and prawns is her favourite seafood.

459,['29/02/2020'],Karnataka: Lingayat math in Bagalkot anoints Kuruba woman as pontiff,"This story is from February 29, 2020

Neelamma Taayi

BAGALKOT: A Lingayat mutt in Jamakhandi on Friday anointed a 47-year-old woman as its pontiff — the first time it has named a woman and a member of a backward community as its head. The move comes days after another Lingayat mutt in Gadag named a Muslim disciple as its pontiff.

Neelamma Taayi of the Kuruba (shepherd) community was ceremonially anointed at Basava Kendra Mahant Mutt in Mareguddi-Budni PM village in the presence of more than 15,000 devotees and 20 Lingayat seers. Having taken deeksha at the age of 15, she has been teaching at the mutt’s primary school since 2010.

Former minister and MLC Basavaraj Horatti, who attended the ceremony, said while women have been heading mutts of the Jagadguru tradition, this is the first time a mutt of the Virakta (renouncement) school has chosen a woman pontiff. “Gender equality has been spoken of since the 12th century but implementation is rare,” he said. The virakta tradition calls for seers to live within society but renounce all emotions and attachments, and dedicate themselves to public service.

The mutt is involved in social and cultural activities, including weekly discourses on Basava’s teachings. It draws about 1 lakh followers.

Guru Mahant Swamiji of Chittaragi Sansthan Mutt in Ilkal, who administered the ‘Shatsthala Upadesha’ to Neelamma, called it a revolutionary step. “A woman from the Kuruba community heading a Lingayat mutt is a dream of the Sharanas of the 12th century. Lingayats upheld gender equality even 900 years ago but sadly, society continues to discriminate against them,” he said.

Neelamma Taayi will now be known as Vijaya Mahantamma Taayi. “The late mahant swamiji of Ilkal took me under his wing for 35 years and inculcated lessons of equality and reform. He was instrumental in the appointment of Dalits as pontiffs in the 90s. We have fulfilled another ideal of his by appointing Neelamma Taayi,” said outgoing pontiff Gurumahant Mahaswamiji.

Abdulla Musba

MANGALURU: A restaurateur’s offer of free biryani for those donating blood has a lot of takers, especially youngsters. Abdulla Musba , who runs ‘Ootada Mane’, a restaurant on Light House Hill Road, floated the idea five years ago after realising how difficult it was to get blood for the needy.

“I came across a person from north Karnataka who was attending to his ailing father at a hospital in Mangaluru,” Musba said, adding: “He had a hard time arranging blood. I knew some students and I asked them to donate, and they obliged happily. The next day, I gave them a biryani treat for volunteering. I continued the initiative at our restaurant to encourage others to donate blood and save lives.” Musba’s restaurant is known for its authentic Bhatkali biryani.

In February every year, Abdulla organises a special campaign at his hotel to spread awareness on blood donation. “Valentine’s Day is celebrated in February, and I believe true love can best be displayed by donating blood,” he said. The initiative is being carried out in association with KMC Blood Bank.

The response has grown over the years. Abdulla said he serves free biryani to around 40 people every year. But it’s not an indication of the popularity of the campaign.

“The aim is not to make people eat biryani or patronise my hotel, but to encourage them to donate blood and save lives. Some donate blood and inform us about the same on call. But they don’t turn up for their plate of complimentary biryani,” Musba said.

He said people who donate blood at KMC Blood Bank receive a coupon which can be redeemed for biryani at the restaurant.

BELAGAVI: In an unfortunate incident, a great Indian gaur died after slipping into an open well in a place called Hanchinala near Hattaragi in Belagavi district. The animal reportedly tumbled into the well late on Thursday evening.Forest department personnel, working in two teams, struggled for more than 12 hours to get the wild animal out of the well. The officials have learnt that the well was owned by a man named Kulkarni.“We started the operation to rescue the gaur on Thursday night, and succeeded in pulling it out of the well on Friday evening,” said a forester.The forester went on to add that the population the Kakati Forest Range had a healthy population of the great Indian gaur, before pointing out that this was the first instance of the wild animal meeting its death owing to a fall. “There have been incidents of the gaur dying in road accidents on national highways.

This was carried on through Thursday night and on Friday morning, forest personnel went into the well and extracted the gaur with the help of a crane,” he said.Another official in the forest department said that a postmortem had been conducted, the details of which would be divulged later.In Video: Great Indian gaur dies after tumbling into open well in Karnataka",hubballi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74410962,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-448707,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/great-indian-gaur-slips-into-open-well-in-belagavi-dies/articleshow/74407795.cms
462,['29/02/2020'],ICSE helps students manage time better,"This story is from February 29, 2020

Nagpur: ICSE ’s language exam comes with a valuable time management guidelines by the board which is helping students to pace their exams well. Every question in English exams (there are two papers) comes with an advice to students about how much time they should be spending on it.

The most recent example is the English-1 exam where every question came with a clear mention of the suggested time limit. CISCE board, popularly known as ICSE which is the name of its Std X certificate, clearly mentioned, “Do not spend more than 30 minutes on this question” on top of question number one.

This pattern was followed throughout the paper in all five questions. Students were advised in each question about the maximum minutes they should spend on them.

Kenneth Mendonca, principal of Seventh Day Adventist School, said “This has been a trend for quite some time in language papers. No doubt, it is of immense help to students because this gives them a clear idea on time management during the crucial board exam.”

A few state board academicians say this is something which should be implemented by other boards as well. Ashok Gavhankar, a senior academician, said, “In board exams, it is all about time management. Many times children get nervous and are unable to time themselves leading to anxiety when they enter the last 30 minutes.”

Indira Gandhi National Open University (Ignou) does something similar during its exams where it tells candidates the expected length of answers. P Sivaswaroop, regional director of Ignou, said “We give approximate word limit so that students do not spend too much time on a particular question and struggle with the others.”

This also eliminates the problem of students devouring extra answersheets in the misguided belief that writing long answers will get them more marks.

AHMEDABAD: “What does not kill you, makes you stronger,” said renowned German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche.This ode to resilience ironically applies to micro-organisms which are apparently not even seen by naked eye.A joint study by researchers from India, Sri Lanka and Japan on three wastewater treatment plants ( WWTPs ) in Ahmedabad in India and three places in Sri Lanka revealed that the multidrug-resistant bacteria are more prevalent in the treated water of these plants.“The study included three plants at Jaspur, Chandkheda and Vasna in Ahmedabad. Maximum E.coli prevalence was found at Vasna, which was highest across the six places studied. The study measured bacteria level in the influent, at the discharge point, 20 meters and 50 meters from the point,” said Prof Manish Kumar of IIT Gandhinagar (IIT-Gn), lead author of the study.Polluted water used for irrigationIt is a cause of worry because treated water from Jaspur andChandkheda isusedfor irrigation in 769 hectares collectively, as recorded in 2018. The Vasna plant's water is released into Sabarmati River.Titled ‘Treatment enhances the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes in the wastewater of Sri Lanka and India’, the study was published recently in ‘Environmental Research’ by Elsevier. Other authors include Bhagwana Ram from IIT Gandhinagar (IIT-Gn), Himaya Sewwandi and Tushara Chaminda from University of Ruhuna in Sri Lanka, Sulfikar and Ryo Honda from Kanazawa University, Japan.Prof Kumar added that while the treatment – done by activated sludge process (ASP) – reduces the overall prevalence of faecal bacteria significantly, the bacteria that survives the process are majorly of drug-resistant ability.‘E.coli prevalence was reduced during treatment, but seemingly the remaining bacteria could adapt in the presence of antibiotics that lead to a further increase in resistance... As far as the gravity of the situation is concerned, the resistance to Fluoroquinolone is worse and thus Sri Lankan condition seems better than India’ mentioned the study.The study also mentioned that E. coli strains of all the locations in both countries exhibited multidrug resistance implying a serious health concern in the near future.

464,['29/02/2020'],Pvt schools firm on boycotting RTE admissions,"This story is from February 29, 2020

Nagpur: Many private unaided English medium schools are upping the ante in their clash with the government over unpaid RTE fees by going on a statewide trip to garner support.

Senior office-bearers of Independent English Schools Association (IESA) will be arriving in Nagpur on Saturday and meet local school trustees in a show of strength. The association says that it cannot carry the financial burden of RTE any more and hence, is resorting to a head-on clash with the education department.

Rajendra Dayma, president of IESA, said “All our members from Nagpur and surrounding districts are standing behind strongly our resolution to boycott RTE admissions . For years, the education department has not paid us our dues and yet expects that we implement their guidelines.”

Schools say that with RTE, the financial strain has become unbearable for majority of schools. “The government has fixed the annual reimbursement at less than Rs 20,000. Almost every school nowadays charges around Rs 40,000 per year as fee. So, we are loosing out on revenue drastically from 25% of the seats,” said a school trustee from Nagpur.

“On top of this, the government is either delaying or not giving us any reimbursement even though bills have been submitted,” he said.

Dayma said that it is incidents like these that have been going on for years which IESA is protesting against. “The irony is that the education department refuses/delays reimbursements citing lack of one or the other document. So, we have to prove that the student actually exists, is enrolled and attends school.”

“But these students were selected and sent our way by the education department only. So, if the student is ‘legal’ enough to be admitted, he should be legal enough for us to claim reimbursement,” said Dayma.

On Saturday, the association will hold a detailed discussion with its members and prepare them for the aggressive stand of boycotting admissions.

465,['29/02/2020'],Parents wary of new divisional level fee authority,"This story is from February 29, 2020

Nagpur: Even though Maharashtra’s school education minister assured speedy setting up of appellate committee for disputes between parents and schools, many are questioning its practical implementation. Parents from six to seven CBSE schools in Nagpur have been trying to organize themselves under a common banner, to give themselves added leverage in disputes with school managements.

Girish Pande, a member of the group calling itself ‘Jagrut Palak Parishad (Aware Parents Council)’, said there are some basic issues which could lead to failure of good initiatives. “As of now, it is clear that there will be no representation of parents in such committees. If stakeholders are not part of such committees, it will never achieve its goal,” said Pande.

He was part of the group that met district collector Ravindra Thakre on Monday over the issue of fee hikes in school, and inaction by the education department. Pande said, “Another problem is that to take the issue before a committee, you require consent of 25% parents, who can approach as a group of affected parties. I think the same rule will continue in the protocol governing appellate councils.”

Even academicians, who are supporting parents’ cause, feel that the new initiative may become a toothless tiger. Sapan Nehrotra, divisional secretary of Shikshak Bharti, said parents’ rights need to be protected at all costs. “Currently, parents are completely at the mercy of school management because they fear for their children. There is always a fear that their children will be ill-treated at school or failed later in Std IX, which can be detrimental to the child’s future,” said Nehrotra, who had accompanied the parents to meet collector Thakre.

He says the best way out will be to amend the Maharashtra Fee Regulation Act itself. “Either scrap it or amend it heavily to ensure that parents are empowered. Otherwise, we are simply doing ornamental work by announcing initiatives which will never be successful at ground level,” said Nehrotra.

Nagpur: A fire was averted at the Ambazari biodiversity park after forest officials apprehended a group of five people who were illegally fishing and cooking food near the water body on Thursday.

Forest officials have been on high alert for such incidents ever since a PIL regarding forest fires came up before the high court.

On Thursday evening, assistant conservator of forests, Surendra Kale, range forest officer AS Ninave, round officers Praveen Badole, S Bhamkar and forest guard Nilesh Tavle were on their regular rounds when they spotted the group indulging in illegal fishing.

The group of five, residents of nearby Pandhrabodi, had also lit a fire to cook food, thus posing a major threat to the surrounding areas. The forest officials booked all five of them under the Forest Act following which the district court granted one day custody.

S Prabhu Nath Shukla, the deputy conservator of forests, said, “The Ambazari biodiversity park is spread over 750 hectares and hence, forest officials are always on high alert because of threats due to fire. Last year, an incident concerning a forest fire was taken up seriously by the court.

There are strict orders from the court to ensure that safety measures are in place to prevent incidents of forest fires. Hence, it is a regular practice by forest officials to go on rounds and inspect the area.”

The entire proceedings by the forest officials were conducted under the guidance of Shukla and Nagpur chief conservator of forests, P Kalyan Kumar.

Union minister Amit Shah addresses a rally in support of CAA, in Bhubaneswar (ANI photo)

BHUBANESHWAR: Union home minister Amit Shah on Friday hit out at the opposition parties over their anti-CAA stance at a rally here on Friday. “The entire opposition — Congress , communists, SP, BSP, Mamata Didi (Bengal chief minister) — are opposing CAA . They are saying minorities will lose their rights. Why are you spreading lies,” Shah said.

His remarks on the West Bengal chief minister came hours after he interacted with her at a meeting of the Eastern Zonal Council here.

Reiterating the government’s commitment to provide citizenship to minorities persecuted in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan, Shah said: “After Partition, there were forced conversions, forced marriages and rapes were committed. Many (refugees) came to India to save their self-respect. It has been 70 years, but lakhs of such people don’t have citizenship. They don’t have access to healthcare and education. What about their human rights?”

Shah said in the 1950s, every Congress politician had said that Hindu and Sikh refugees from Pakistan will be given Indian citizenship. “The Congress leaders on 27 different occasions made such promises, but never honoured them,” he said, adding, “While introducing Citizenship (Amendment) Act, we knew attempts will be made to malign us. But we are not afraid of such slander campaigns.”

The home minister also touched upon issues like the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya and nullification of Article 370 in Jammu & Kashmir. “Tell me whether Article 370 should have been abrogated or not? Be louder so that those Congressmen who are opposing it can hear you. Tell me whether a Ram temple should be built in Ayodhya or not? Whenever the issue of the Ram temple came up in the past, Congress tried to delay it in the Supreme Court. With your blessings, the Modi government has returned to power with a massive mandate. Now, a sky-touching Ram temple will be built at the place where Lord Ram was born.”

Visakhapatnam: The Andhra Pradesh public transport (APPT) department is planning an advanced Rapid Autonomous Connected Bus Transit System (RACBTS) for Visakhapatnam. The project is likely to be funded by the World Bank.

If this happens, Visakhapatnam will be the first city in the country to have such a unique transport system. The government is planning a 200km-long stretch of an elevated corridor for every nook and corner of the city, with a halting point for every 500 meters.

Some of the prime characteristics of this RACBTS are— no property will have to be acquired, no right of way issues, no need of expensive signalling system, no electrical overhead cables, no rails. The system, at least at the planning stage, boasts of a simple design and is deemed to be cost effective.

Apart from public buses, permissions to use this system might also be given to taxies, cargo vehicles and other private vehicles during lean hours.

Significantly, a dedicated software-based system will be a key component of the system which will not require a driver or a conductor.

The proposal for this project was made following the recent policy decision meeting over public transport system organized by the NITI Aayog association with the World Bank in New Delhi.

Representatives of various states including Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra attended the NITI Aayog meet, wherein stakeholders are believed to have decided to introduce the RACBTS on an experimental basis in Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra.

A senior APPT official attended the NITI Aayog meet on behalf of the Andhra Pradesh. Following the meeting, APPT also held discussions with experts in public transport system to further discuss the project at the secretariat level.

Confirming the proposal of RACBTS to TOI, an official of APPT said that while the proposal is true, but it will take lot of time to get an official cognisance.

“We are currently holding discussions with stakeholders. We will have to explain this project and the minutes-to-minutes of the NITI Aayog meet to the chief minister. We have proposed this project in Visakhapatnam. If this system is okayed (sic), there will be no need of metro rails which are expensive,” the APPT official said.

MUMBAI: A 28-year-old woman, who is employed as a visual effects artist, was dragged out of a moving Vapi passenger train when she caught the man who snatched her phone near Borivli station. The accused, Wasim Shaikh, was later arrested. Cops said he is a history-sheeter who had been externed from railway property.

The incident took place on February 20, when the woman (name withheld on request) was returning from Palghar .

The train was packed, but I managed to get a seat in the general coach,"" she told TOI. By 8.11pm, the train reached Borivli's platform 10. ""The train halted for nearly 10 minutes at the station. I dialled my mother, but as I was not getting network, I moved to a single seat closer to the door."" Just then the train started moving. As she was going through photographs on her phone, a man, who was in the coach, snatched her phone. ""I grabbed his arm, confident that he could not escape as the train had left the platform. But to my horror, he jumped out of the moving train and dragged me along. I landed on the tracks and hurt my head and shoulders even as he scaled a wall and fled. I screamed for help and a couple from a building near the tracks came to my rescue,"" she said. They offered her water and cotton to stop the blood flowing from her head, and helped her reach the platform where a policewoman rushed her to hospital.

Ravi Shankar Prasad (L) and Randeep Surjewala (R)

NEW DELHI: A day after Congress delegation called on President Ram Nath Kovind seeking his intervention over the Delhi riots , Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Friday hit out at Congress president Sonia Gandhi and other party leaders saying they should not try to preach “raj dharma” to the government as they themselves have been inciting people with provocative statements.

At a press conference, Prasad said, “Please don’t preach us raj dharma. Your record is full of violations, twists and turns for plain and simple vote-bank politics. Look at yourself in the mirror of raj dharma.” He accused the main opposition party of politicking when time was to make collective bid towards restoring peace and normalcy in the national capital.

Congress functionaries, led by Sonia Gandhi, met Kovind on Thursday and demanded Union home minister Amit Shah 's resignation for “abdication of duty” during the communal violence in northeast Delhi. Gandhi had reminded the Centre for its 'rajdharma' and protecting people of all faiths.

Prasad referred to Sonia Gandhi's “ aar paar ki ladai (fight to the finish)” remark at an anti-CAA rally at Ramlila Maidan here in December and asked the Congress chief to explain if such remarks do not constitute provocation.

He accused Congress of changing its stand on granting citizenship to persecuted minorities from the neighbouring countries. “Manmohan Singh had demanded citizenship rights for people displaced due to religion. Ashok Gehlot had written letters to Shivraj Patil and even Advaniji, both then home ministers, that citizenship should be given to minorities from other countries,” Prasad said questioning the change in stance.

“Sonia ji tell us what kind of 'rajdharma' is this that everyone has backtracked? What we have done your government could not do in 10 years... If Congress does something, it is good. But if we do the same thing, they provoke the people. What type of 'rajdharma' is this?” Prasad asked.

The minister accused Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi of making provocative statements saying the opposition party is so frustrated by its defeat that it could stoop to any level for “vote-bank” politics. “Congress should act responsibly for maintaining peace and harmony in the country,” he said.

He said the Citizenship Amendment Act was implemented through constitutional means. “CAA was passed in both the Houses after extensive deliberations. “You had also supported it in the past ... Why did you provoke people (against the CAA)?” he said.

He also lashed out at Congress for its opposition over the NPR exercise recalling as how the opposition party itself had once initiated the exercise. “Congress brought a notification for NPR on March 15, 2010. Chidambaram was the Home Minister, Manmohan Singh was the Prime Minister and Sonia Gandhi was the UPA chairperson. You started this exercise... When you do something it is fine, but you provoke people when we try to do the same thing,” he said.

Asked about the controversial remarks made by BJP members like Kapil Mishra and Parvesh Verma , Prasad cited statements of Shah that the party doesn't approve such statements.

About concerns expressed by BJP allies, including Shiromani Akali Dal and LJP, over the violence in Delhi, the minister said if they have any doubts, it would be addressed.

477,['29/02/2020'],Legal troubles: Pachipenta-Araku road works to get further delayed,"This story is from February 29, 2020

Visakhapatnam: Pachipenta-Araku road works, which have been going on for over ten years, may take longer than expected to be completed even as the R&B department locks horns with the contractor of the works.

Sources in the R&B department said the contractor’s contract had been scrapped because of the delay, after which he approached court. We are now in the process of attempting an out-of-court settlement.

The project was first mooted two decades ago, but work began in earnest only after 2010. “As of now, 24 km of the 42-km stretch has been completed. We were faced with two problems: One, we needed the forest department’s permission to construct the road; two, the contractor was delaying the project by years,” said, S V Ganga Raju, DEE, S Kota.

“There has been a two-year delay and the only silver lining, so far, is that the forest department has granted permission for us to go ahead with road construction along an 11-km stretch. However, for this to be taken up, we need the contractor to get on with work,” Ganga Raju said.

Officials involved in the project said the inordinate delay in the construction was mainly due to legal squabbles and that if they were resolved, the project could be completed in no time.

Tobacco board chairman Y Raghunatha Babu at the meeting

Guntur: The Tobacco Board has reduced the crop size for Karnataka for the upcoming season at its board meeting held on Friday.

The crop size was brought down to 99 million kg from 100 mkg last year. Board chairman Yadlapati Raghunatha Babu presided over the session held in Bengaluru. Raghunatha Babu said the board discussed the issue of Karnataka crop size at length as it was the main agenda of the meeting.

”After taking the requests of the growers and grower representatives, indents given by manufacturers and exporters through Indian Tobacco Association(ITA), we have decided to fix the size at 99 million kgs for 2020-21 crop season in Karnataka,” Raghunatha Babu said.

He said that they studied the past export and domestic performance, global supply and demand position before taking the call. He said that ensuring fair and remunerative prices to the growers was at the top of their agenda to fix the crop size at 99 million kgs.

The board had put the Karnataka’s crop, which is considered to be a premium variety, at 100 million kgs in the last two years.

The board had fixed AP’s crop size at 136 million kgs in the last two years and is likely to go with the same size for 2020-21 season. The crop size for AP would be decided around June as the cultivation season would commence around September-October.

480,['29/02/2020'],Mumbai: CBI books GST officer for disproportionate assets,"This story is from February 29, 2020

The CBI has alleged that two flats at Sweet Home building in JVPD are in the name of his older son, Ashutosh.

MUMBAI: The CBI has registered a case against assistant commissioner, CGST, Deepak Pandit, for possessing assets disproportionate to his known sources of income. Three of Pandit's family members have been booked too.

Searches were conducted at six premises in Mumbai belonging to Pandit on Thursday.

Pandit, who is the brother of filmmaker Ashoke Pandit, had allegedly bought six flats in residential societies at JVPD, Juhu, and Thakur Village, Kandivli East, besides two shops. He had also made investments in gold. The CBI examined the assets he had amassed between 2000 and 2014 when he was posted in Mumbai.

Two flats in Oberoi Gardens, Thakur Village, are in the name of his younger son, Divyansh. He had also purchased a flat and a shop in Divyansh's name in Vasant Sagar Complex in the same area. CBI also found investment in gold worth Rs 95 lakh.

The CBI has alleged that two flats at Sweet Home building in JVPD are in the name of his older son, Ashutosh. Pandit's wife Arushi had purchased some immovable properties in her name, which she subsequently sold. Pandit had a flat in Juhu gifted by his mother, which is not counted among these assets.

Pandit paid Rs 1.49 crore to purchase the six flats and two shops at JVPD and Thakur Village. He had also made other investments and had fixed deposits worth Rs 2.9 crore. Pandit had invested a total Rs 4.4 crore which was far more than his savings from salary, CBI said. The FIR stated Pandit earned a salary of Rs 1.05 crore during the period and saved Rs 43 lakh after deducting household expenses of Rs 62 lakh. His wife and their two sons have no source of income and they had purchased these properties on behalf of Deepak Pandit.

The CBI estimated the value of the properties based on their purchase price between 2000 and 2014. For instance, Pandit had paid the builder a total Rs10.3 lakh in 2000 for the two flats in Thakur Village, though their present market value is over Rs 6 crore.

Last year, Pandit courted controversy after he submitted a report accusing three three Indian Revenue Service officials posted at Customs of indulging in corrupt practices. Pandit was then transferred to Bhubaneshwar. He challenged the transfer, but lost the legal battle in Supreme Court.

NEW DELHI: Ayodhya Parv , a three-day celebration to showcase the cultural heritage of Ayodhya, the birthplace of Lord Ram, started in Delhi on Friday. This is the first such event organised by the BJP and Ayodhya seers after the Supreme Court’s judgment on Ram Janmabhoomi in November last year.

As Ram Dhun (chants of the Lord’s name) played in the background at the Indira Gandhi National Culture of Arts (IGNCA) grounds in the national capital, visitors thronged stalls that displayed ‘made in Ayodhya’ wares.

At one kiosk, Jai Prakash and Nand Kishore, visiting Delhi for the first time, were busy serving lentil dumplings, also known as ‘dal fara’, a popular snack in Ayodhya. Nearby were stalls selling Ram prasad (a mixture of peanuts and jaggery), wooden khadau, sandalwood and puja items such as conches. A ‘Sita rasoi’ has also been set up to specially prepare local delicacies. Poetry recitations by locals as well as classical musical performances will take place.

Faizabad BJP MP Lallu Singh, the organiser of the event, said this was an effort to showcase the local produce of Ayodhya. “Whenever Ayodhya is mentioned, only the Ram temple issue is talked about. This event is a message of peace and a display of Ayodhya’s culture . It’s time we do this at an international platform as well. This event will also see current and former Union ministers like Ravi Shankar Prasad, Manoj Sinha, Dharmendra Pradhan in attendance,” Singh told TOI.

RSS joint general secretary Dattatreya Hosbale was present at the event along with newly-appointed Ram Janmabhoomi Kshetra Tirth Trust chief Nritya Gopal Das. Hosbale said, “People like me or Champat Rai of VHP were part of Ran Janmabhoomi movement but even a socialist ideologue like Ram Manohar Lohia celebrated Ramayan mela for several years in Chitrakoot. It’s his template that we are following to celebrate.”

A photograph of the chief of Maganahalli village kissing the woman went viral

DAVANAGERE: A remote village in Davanagere district organised a fair on Friday in which the village head planted a kiss on a woman soon after she enthralled onlookers with a dance recital.

Hundreds of villagers attended Ooramma Devi Jatre (a festival of the village goddess) at Maganahalli in Davanagere taluk, 270km from Bengaluru.

The once-in-a-decade fair is believed to have started around 100 years ago and it’s said to bring good health and prosperity to all those taking part, besides protecting the village from bad times.

“The fair that was to be held in 2018 was postponed because of floods and drought in the village. We decided to hold it this year to appease the village deity,’’ said a 48-year old villager, Parashuram, who has participated in the fairs since 1982.

Fair organisers had invited an eight-member troupe, including two women, from Magala village in Huvinahadagali taluk of Ballari district to perform on the concluding day of the nine-day event.

Just after the dance performance ended, the village head, Rajashekharappa, 52, spontaneously planted a kiss on the woman to express his gratitude and appreciation. The photograph soon went viral. A villager said Rajashekharappa was affectionate towards the dancer, and nothing more should be read into the incident. The fair ended with villagers, including women and children, dancing to folk beats to appease the village goddess.

Shenazbanu and Rashidkhan Pathan in police custody

AHMEDABAD: Acting on a tip-off, a city crime branch team apprehended a family of three - husband, wife and 3-year-old girl - with 5.95gm charas worth Rs 29.75 lakh from near the exit gate of Kalupur railway station on Thursday evening. DCP, crime branch, Deepan Bhadran said the accused, Rashidkhan Pathan, 37, and Shenazbanu, 33, of Vatva were caught with the charas wrapped in Hindi newspapers and stuffed in two bags. ""He used to take his wife and daughter along when smuggling charas to appear as an ordinary family and escape the suspicions of security personnel,"" Bhadran said.

ACP crime branch B V Gohil said inspectore D B Barad received information about the charas consignment. ""We sent a team in plain clothes to keep a watch around Kalupur railway station. At about 6.10pm we intercepted Rashidkhan, his wife and child on a bike. Rashidkhan had a bag kept on the petrol tank of the bike. His wife was riding pillion with the child, while holding another bag,"" Gohil said.

When the bags were checked, charas balls weighing 5.95kg were found. ""We called the scientific officer to the spot. He confirmed the stuff was charas,"" said a crime branch official.

Pathan used to bring charas from Rohtak: Crime branch officials said Rashidkhan was once caught in a case regarding fake indian currency notes (FICN). He had met a Kashmiri youth recently.

""He then got into drug trafficking and began selling charas. The Kashimiri used to send the charas from Kashmir to Rohtak and Pathan used to bring it from Rohtak to Ahmedabad.

Changed transport to avoid being caught: From Rohtak, Pathan and his wife used to board different private vehicles, transport vehicles and trains so that it became tough to catch them. Pathan used to park his bike at the railway station. ""This time around they had gone to Rohtak by train and came back by bus. They changed buses from Jajjar, Mount Abu and separated at Mehsana and then decided to meet at Ahmedabad railway station where Rashidkhan parked the bike while leaving for Rohtak,"" said a crime branch official.

Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi (File Photo)

NEW DELHI: Congress Friday asked why FIRs had not been filed against BJP leaders like Kapil Mishra for alleged hate speeches , adding it will give a strong reply in the court over the plea seeking cases against Sonia Gandhi , Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra.

Responding to a query about a court notice on a plea seeking FIRs against Congress leaders , AICC spokesman Abhishek Singhvi said, “We will give a comprehensive reply to the court but let me tell you that the whole world is receiving FIRs but it does not include Kapil Mishra, Anurag Thakur, Pravesh Verma . There has not been an FIR against Giriraj Singh, Chinmayanand, Sangeet Som after months and years.”

“And when the division bench of the Delhi High Court asks questions, a judge is transferred under a remarkable order,” he lashed out.

“I would with the greatest of respect, but in equal firmness, caution the courts that they have to follow their own rules. Their own rules for PILs are to first and foremost see the threshold before proceeding to notice ... to satisfy themselves that a PIL stands for Public Interest Litigation, not Publicity Interest Litigation, Not Paisa Wasool Litigation, not Private Interest Litigation,” Singhvi said, adding, “Notice is not automatic and should never be automatic in PILs.”

Congress also slammed the ruling BJP for questioning Sonia Gandhi’s “raj dharma” barb over Delhi riots, saying leaders like Indira Gandhi and Manmohan Singh believed in harmony while Modi government possesses a “divisive mindset”.

About Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad’s allegation that Congress instigation over CAA-NPR-NRC triggered violence in Delhi, Singhvi said, “Arrest all of us because we are speaking peacefully in a democratic country against what we believe is a wrong move. I dare anyone to arrest me for saying that NRC is wrong.”

On Friday, Congress constituted a five-member fact-finding committee on Delhi riots. The panel has been asked to visit affected areas and to assess the situation after violence.

488,['29/02/2020'],"Mamata bargains for Bengal at EZC meeting, also raises Delhi violence","This story is from February 29, 2020

Bhubaneswar/Kolkata: The riots in Delhi and differences among states over CAA-NPR-NRC didn’t overshadow the Eastern Zonal Council (EZC) meeting presided over by Union home minister Amit Shah at Bhubaneswar on Friday. Instead, the EZC meet turned out to be a cornerstone of cooperative federalism where states jointly pressed for their dues from the Centre.

Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee made a passing reference to “what has happened in Delhi” and the consequent death toll at the very outset of the meeting. But her focus was primarily on state issues — from GST compensation to non-availability of central funds for relief and rehabilitation of victims of severe natural calamities, namely cyclones Bulbul and Fani. All of these added up to Rs 50,000 crores, Banerjee pointed out.

The Bengal CM also used the EZC platform to point to the delay in release of central funds to states. She held that this was putting pressure on the state’s finances.

“The Centre is an elected government, so are the state governments. No one should veer into the domain of others or try to play Big Brother. I told that the Centre is mopping up huge money from states in the railway sector and others. How much are the states getting?” she said after the meeting.

Banerjee told the media that EZC was not the platform to discuss issues like CAA, NPR and NRC. “It was not the subject also. Yet, I told about it at the very outset of the meeting when my turn came. I said we are deeply disturbed with what has happened in Delhi. So many people died, including an IB officer and a police constable. I said we want the government to stand by the families of the victims,” she added.

Banerjee had ‘raita’ for lunch along with the Union home minister and the chief ministers of Odisha, Bihar and Jharkhand. Odisha CM Naveen Patnaik played the host.

An adept politician, Banerjee could guess that the opposition in Bengal will try to use the “Shah-Mamata” meet to fan public sentiment against her ahead of the Union home minister’s Kolkata visit on Sunday. Banerjee has announced a rally against CAA-NPR-NRC in Kolkata on March 8 to send out the message that she has not given up on the cause.

Congress leader in Lok Sabha Adhir Chowdhury hit the streets in Kolkata on Friday against the “BJP-led violence” in Delhi while the CM was away in Bhubaneswar.

”There was no reason for the Bengal CM to stay put in Bhubaneswar for the last four days. She didn’t attend the opposition meeting in Delhi when Sonia Gandhi sent her an invite. But she found time to attend the meeting presided over by Amit Shah at a time when normalcy is yet to return in Delhi. I call this adjustment politics,” Chowdhury said.

Left legislature party leader Sujan Chakraborty spoke on similar lines. “The chief minister didn’t flag her dissent over CAA-NPR-NRC in the meeting with the Union home minister. She didn’t utter a word against the administrative failure to contain the communal conflagration in Delhi. After all, the Bengal CM and the Union home minister share mutual trust for each other,” Chakrabarty said.

489,['29/02/2020'],Calcutta HC eases foreign passport rule for Indian citizenship,"This story is from February 29, 2020

Representative image.

KOLKATA: The Calcutta high court has said production of original foreign passport is not mandatory for applying for Indian citizenship if the applicant has stayed in India for seven years and is married to an Indian citizen and has evidence of both.

The order followed a plea by Bismilla Khan, a Pakhtoon, who claimed to have migrated to India in 1973 as a nine-year-old refugee with his father. Khan now stays in Jadavpur , is married to an Indian and has several documents, like Aadhaar and PAN cards, driving licence and electricity bills, to prove he has been in India for nearly half-a-century.

“It cannot be held that under such circumstances... (that) producing a passport and its particulars is mandatory,” Justice Sabyasachi Bhattacharyya said in his order, adding: “There has to be a relaxation... in case the petitioner is able to satisfy the authorities the reasons for non-availability of (the original) passport.”

Khan told the court he was a “refugee in distress” when he came to India; part of the place where he stayed (Wanna village in tribal Waziristan) merged “partially with Afghanistan and partially with Pakistan”.

Khan also provided a “National Identity Card” issued in 1989 by the All-India Pakhtoon Jigra-E-Hind, an organisation working for Pakhtoons in India. Khan was permitted to stay in India on a “long-term basis” in 2002 and then married Hyderabad-based Indian citizen Gulnar Khanam. They now have a daughter, who studies in a reputable Kolkata school.

Persons with all other documents, indicating they had been living in India for a long time, and who were married to Indians would not be able to apply for citizenship “despite having lived their entire lives and contributing to the economy and diverse culture of this country”, Justice Sabyasachi Bhattacharyya said. This, he added, would be contradictory to the spirit of the Indian Constitution.

“His plea for Indian citizenship is under Section 5(1)(c) of the Citizenship Act (1955), which stipulates a person should be married to an Indian citizen and should have stayed in India for seven years before s/he can apply for Indian citizenship,” Khan’s advocate, Sharmistha Podder, said. “The state’s role ends with scrutiny of the application and forwarding it to the Centre. It was difficult to ascertain whether he was a foreign national because of the absence of the passport. This ambiguity, however, has ended with the order,” state counsel Srijib Chakraborty said.

The HC in July 2018 allowed Khan to file his application afresh and asked the government to decide on his plea in three months. But Khan said the original passport was a mandatory requirement for the online application (Form III); so he could not even file a fresh application. He then moved Calcutta HC a second time.

Justice Bhattacharya said “the requirement of having a passport has to be read as optional” in online applications and, till necessary changes were done in the software, people should be allowed to submit applications manually. But the application, the order said, would have to detail the reasons for non-availability of passport.

KOLKATA: The Calcutta high court has said production of original foreign passport is not mandatory for applying for Indian citizenship if the applicant has stayed in India for seven years and is married to an Indian citizen and has evidence of both.

The order followed a plea by Bismilla Khan, a Pakhtoon, who claimed to have migrated to India in 1973 as a nine-year-old refugee with his father. Khan now stays in Jadavpur , is married to an Indian and has several documents, like Aadhaar and PAN cards, driving licence and electricity bills, to prove he has been in India for nearly half-a-century.

“It cannot be held that under such circumstances... (that) producing a passport and its particulars is mandatory,” Justice Sabyasachi Bhattacharyya said in his order, adding: “There has to be a relaxation... in case the petitioner is able to satisfy the authorities the reasons for non-availability of (the original) passport.”

Khan told the court he was a “refugee in distress” when he came to India; part of the place where he stayed (Wanna village in tribal Waziristan) merged “partially with Afghanistan and partially with Pakistan”.

Khan also provided a “National Identity Card” issued in 1989 by the All-India Pakhtoon Jigra-E-Hind, an organisation working for Pakhtoons in India. Khan was permitted to stay in India on a “long-term basis” in 2002 and then married Hyderabad-based Indian citizen Gulnar Khanam. They now have a daughter, who studies in a reputable Kolkata school.

Persons with all other documents, indicating they had been living in India for a long time, and who were married to Indians would not be able to apply for citizenship “despite having lived their entire lives and contributing to the economy and diverse culture of this country”, Justice Sabyasachi Bhattacharyya said. This, he added, would be contradictory to the spirit of the Indian Constitution.

“His plea for Indian citizenship is under Section 5(1)(c) of the Citizenship Act (1955), which stipulates a person should be married to an Indian citizen and should have stayed in India for seven years before s/he can apply for Indian citizenship,” Khan’s advocate, Sharmistha Podder, said. “The state’s role ends with scrutiny of the application and forwarding it to the Centre. It was difficult to ascertain whether he was a foreign national because of the absence of the passport. This ambiguity, however, has ended with the order,” state counsel Srijib Chakraborty said.

The HC in July 2018 allowed Khan to file his application afresh and asked the government to decide on his plea in three months. But Khan said the original passport was a mandatory requirement for the online application (Form III); so he could not even file a fresh application. He then moved Calcutta HC a second time.

Theactor, a popular name among the Marathi audience, says he’s overwhelmed and happy about winning the title. In a quick chat, he shares his feelings and speaks about his journey in the industry. Excerpts:Honestly, I couldn’t believe I had won. It’s an overwhelming feeling. I remember Vaibhav Tatwawaadi and Pooja Sawant calling me desirable in their interviews. At the same time, over the last couple of years, a lot of friends and well-wishers have been telling me the same and that made me confident that I would win the title one day. It feels good to be on top of the list and I am looking forward to my family reading about this in the papers.I think my desirability comes from my humility and kindness. I feel that these qualities are rare to find in people today. Even when someone is rude to me, I reply with humility and I have seen people transform. I have never allowed fame and success take these qualities away from me.That doesn’t concern me at all. I have reached where I have, being what I am. I used to sell pamphlets on Pune’s MG Road to fund my portfolio shoot. From then to today, I believe I have come a long way. I also feel that if you are dedicated and disciplined, success is guaranteed.It helped me hone my craft. I always wanted to be an actor, not a hero. Even today, I keep myself busy with workshops and theatre to brush up my skills. It is a continuous process and theatre is an integral part of it.Reading, watching new shows and learning languages is what I love. I am interested in learning Indian languages. I know a little bit of Tamil, Gujarati, Bengali and Punjabi. There’s so much beauty in our languages. I would also love to act in other language films as much as I can.Yes, my debut Hindi film Anya , with Raima Sen , will release soon. I want to work in more Hindi films, but, at the same time, do something substantial. Besides Anya, there are Marathi projects like Ajinkya , with Prarthana Behere and Pallavi Patil, Lagna-Kallol with Siddharth Jadhav and Mayuri Deshmukh, and a yet-untitled film with Gauri Nalawade. So, this year’s going to be an exciting one and I am happy with what I am doing.(Laughs) I find Hrithik Roshan the most desirable. He has endearing qualities and is a brilliant actor as well. Among the women, I find Sushmita Sen desirable because she has been setting an example for women through her work and life.I have been working out since the last 10 years and was muscular for most part. For a web series, I had to lose five kgs and after that I have been sporting a leaner body. Yes, people ask me why I ditched my muscular look, but I tell them that I am at my fittest form right now.

Kolkata: The Calcutta High Court has debarred Trinamool Congress-turned-BJP MLA Manirul Islam from entering Labhpur , his home turf in Birbhum, following bribery complaints from villagers. However, the court refused to issue an arrest warrant against the accused for at least six weeks.

A host of Labhpur residents had complained to police in 2018, saying Manirul had minted money by luring poor villagers with permanent jobs in local schools. He had even entered into a contract in 2016 with two complainants (Kajal Roy and Biswajit Mandal). Police lodged an FIR based on these complaints in 2016.

“We can make out who is the culprit. But it is quite unfortunate that steps are taken only after the accused has changed his political loyalties,” Justice Joymalya Bagchi said.

495,['29/02/2020'],"What’s Up, Docs?","This story is from February 29, 2020

Souvik Adhikari | plastic surgeon

Passion | Acting

Most of Adhikari’s waking hours are spent at the ever-busy SSKM Hospital, coping with the daily patient load. From conducting limb replant surgeries on patients whose hands have been severed, to seeing patients in the OPD and teaching students, he is constantly on his toes. But his schedule has not kept him from pursuing his passion for acting.

In the just-released Bengali movie ‘Din Ratrir Golpo’, a suspense crime thriller, this plastic surgeon transforms into a Nasa agent, his first break in mainstream cinema.

“My role in the movie is not very big. But I am quite excited, as this is my first silver-screen outing. If everything clicks, maybe I’ll act in more films,” says the associate professor of plastic surgery at IPGMER.

An MCh in plastic surgery from IPGMER, his love for acting led him to Prosenjit Choudhury, his junior during his MBBS days at Medical College Kolkata, who is the director of the movie. In the past, Adhikari has been involved in making short films, donning the hats of actor and even script -writer.

“One day, Prosenjit called me up, asking whether I was open to acting in his film. I lapped up the offer. And it was a great experience, totally different from my profession,” he recalls.

Apart from acting, the doctor is also a fitness freak, regularly hitting the gym to unwind.

“It is all about time management,” he says. “And there’s nothing like indulging in things one loves, when not working”.

Prosenjit Choudhury | general surgeon

Passion | Film-making

He describes himself as a “freelance doctor” who has gone all out in order to make films. In order to pursue his first love, Choudhury even gave up the post of assistant professor at Medical College Hospital Kolkata.

“From my childhood, I wanted to make films. But, hailing from a middle-class family in a small town in Burdwan, my parents wanted me to become a doctor,” he says.

He was always good at studies, so when, as a teenager, he declared he wanted to study films, his family thought he had “gone insane”, and called an “emergency meeting”. At the meeting, he was told that he had to sit for the JEE. He cracked the test and bagged a seat at Medical College Kolkata. He subsequently also did a post-graduation in general surgery from IPGMER and worked as a surgeon at the emergency unit for three years.

“I was even selected to be an assistant professor. But I realised that taking up that job would leave me with no time for making movies, so I had to politely decline,” he recalls.

After his directorial debut psychological thriller, ‘Dakbasko’, in 2015, Choudhury’s latest venture is a suspense crime thriller, written and directed by himself.

“I conduct a limited number of surgeries in a private hospital so that I get time to pursue my first love. I will not give up my profession, but balance both,” he says.

Arnab Gupta | oncological surgeon

Passion | music

In a field of medicine where giving bad news to patients happens more often than not, day in and day out, Gupta believes in healing with a dose of his special medicine: music.

He often sings to his patients, especially to the children battling the deadly disease, managing to bring out a smile, even after a draining chemotherapy session. Also, he never hesitates to pick up the microphone whenever there’s a fundraising event.

“Though children battling cancer do not understand the implications of the disease, the chemotherapy and radiation therapy take a toll on their mind and body. Music has a role in the healing process. I am happy to make their battle a little less tough,” Gupta says.

The medical director at Saroj Gupta Cancer Centre and Research Institute, Thakurpukur, can be often seen crooning a peppy Kishore Kumar number or strumming a guitar at various events.

“My love for music is from childhood. It is a great stress-buster, and there’s nothing like singing for patients at my hospital,” he says.

Gupta can switch from belting out peppy Bollywood numbers to soulful Rabindrasangeet with the elan of a pro. From singing to a patient while operating on a lump in her breast to soother her nerves during surgery, to a vocal jugalbandi with a teenager who lost one leg to cancer, while she performed classical dance during a charity event, this doctor surely knows how to put his musical talent to best use.

Parthapratim Gupta | paediatric surgeon

Passion | painting

This paediatric surgeon is as adept at filling up canvases with his artistic vision as he is at wielding a scalpel to conduct the finest of surgeries on a child. A professor of surgery at Institute of Child Health Kolkata, Gupta has been keeping his passion for painting alive despite his profession taking away much of his time. He even exhibits his paintings to raise funds for underprivileged children.

“I would love to hold more exhibitions and contribute to charity. But my profession does not allow me to paint more often than I would have wanted,” says the general surgery gold-medallist.

His affair with painting began when he was in school, where he got an opportunity to be taught by none other than Kamal Kumar Majumdar. But once he got into medical education for his MBBS at NRS Medical College and subsequently his doctoral and post-doctoral studies, and then his job as a paediatric surgeon and a teacher, he was left with little time to splash colour on canvas. Despite this, he has held three exhibitions so far, the proceeds going to charity.

A keen golfer, aesthetics has always been of prime importance to the surgeon who has brought beautiful smiles back on the faces of hundreds of children by conducting correctional cleft-lip surgery. His theme-based paintings have been applauded by the likes of Jogen Chowdhury.

“Last time, it was ‘poetry on canvas’. I am planning a next series on paintings on the unrest around us,” he says.

Pratim Sengupta | nephrologist

Passion | Playing violin

Anyone who calls this doctor would be greeted by a soulful rendition of raga Marwa played on the violin, set as his caller tune. They would be perhaps surprised to know that the violinist playing the tune is the doctor himself. A die-hard classical music lover, playing the tabla nearly robbed him of his hands, making him switch over to the violin, taking lessons from the likes of Sisirkana Dhar Chowdhury. He has even performed in musical events, such as the prestigious annual Dover Lane concert, accompanying his Guruji.

“When I was doing my MBBS, I was diagnosed with writer’s cramp in my right hand. Doctors advised me to stop playing the tabla,” he says. “I was heartbroken, because music is my first love.”

It was at this point that he decided to take up the violin, as the main activity happens in the left hand. He found lots of encouragement from his family, especially his mother, a trained classical singer. Gradually, he fell in love with the instrument.

His engagement at two hospitals — Belle Vue Clinic and ILS Hospital Dum Dum — and his social activities through the Kidney Care Society and organ donation movement, keep him much occupied. But the doctor ensures he spends some time with his violin at the end of a long day.

“Music has the power to alleviate pain and suffering. That is why my dialysis rooms have soothing violin tracks played softly,” Sengupta says.

Despite having achieved a certain level of mastery in the instrument, he has not stopped taking lessons. Currently, he takes online lessons from noted violinist Kala Ramnath. Much in demand by friends and colleagues, Sengupta’s last performance was at the recently held reunion at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital.

496,['29/02/2020'],"Sabyasachi on BJP civic poll panel, not Sovan","This story is from February 29, 2020

Kolkata: Two former mayors with a common political past appear headed for different paths, as was evident from the 14-member election coordination committee the BJP announced in the run-up to civic polls on Friday. Sabyasachi Dutta has made it to the panel, but not Sovan Chatterjee.

Former Kolkata mayor Sovan and former Bidhannagar mayor Sabyasachi both had taken the political plunge with Trinamool and later joined BJP. On Friday, BJP’s election panel for the Kolkata Municipal Corporation poll, due in next two months, found space for Sabyasachi and former Trinamool Chhatra Parishad functionary Shankudeb Panda, among others.

As for Sovan, he is in two minds over making it to Union home minister Amit Shah’s rally at Shahid Minar on Sunday. Sources close to the former mayor hinted that he was very much in touch with Trinamool despite posters in south Kolkata, carrying his photo and the lotus symbol, urging the workaholic leader back into action.

Sovan’s joining BJP in New Delhi in August 2019 had come as a shot in the arm for the party’s Bengal unit that was all geared up to take on Trinamool in civic polls. BJP leaders had then hinted that the party might fight the polls with “experienced” Sovan at the helm.

Things, however, didn’t take the expected course. According to BJP, Sovan’s friend Baisakhi Banerjee came in the way of “smooth synergy”. A section of BJP leaders was ready to accept Sovan as leader but was unwilling to give the same status to his friend.

“It is unfortunate that BJP did not want to use Sovan Chatterjee’s skills as a two-time mayor of the city. He knows KMC like the back of his hand. However, such a decision was not entirely unexpected,” she said.

“National leaders of BJP are in touch with Sovan, but such decisions are taken at the local level. It seems they were not able to reach a consensus about including him in the committee,” she added.

Bengal BJP, however, isn’t yielding. The party’s leaders are busy working on the draft civic manifesto, focusing mainly on revamping primary health clinics and schools in each municipality. “Clogged sewers and water logging has become a reality for KMC. Garbage collection and disposal is faltering. The condition of roads is pathetic. These issues will surface during the municipal polls,” said Bengal BJP general secretary Sayantan Basu.

497,['29/02/2020'],"Students need not fear, being critical of government by itself not sedition: Ex HC Judge SC Dharmadhikari","This story is from February 29, 2020

MUMBAI: “A penal provision by its very existence does not take away your freedom, doesn’t take away your right to free speech,’’ said former Bombay high court Judge S C Dharmadhikari on Friday, speaking on free speech and offence of sedition under the Indian Penal Code (IPC). “The very heart of democracy is debate, discussion, deliberation and dissent,’’ said the ex-Judge who till less than two weeks was still on the bench.

While noting that freedom of speech does come with reasonable restrictions, the ex-judge said, “students need not fear. Students of law all the more need not fear.""

""The right to free speech is not affected by presence of such provisions of law and which make the acts punishable,’’ said Dharmadhikari.

“Section 124A of IPC itself protects everyone who disapproves government measures with a view to obtain their alteration by lawful means and without exciting or attempting to excite feeling of hatred or disaffection or disloyalty against the state,’’ he said. “You may express disapproval of the government…and so long as you protest against something by lawful means you are not committing an offence,’’ he clarified to an audience that largely comprised students at the Indian Merchants Chamber.

“You can be critical of the government, it is not an offence. It is not an offence so long as you are not exciting hatred, disaffection…your freedom speech should not amount to incite of an offence,’’ he said noting, “It is being confused with other offences affecting public tranquility.’’

He was delivering the fifth edition of Principal T K Tope memorial lecture on ‘free speech and sedition’ organized by the social service league of Government Law College. It was topical coming as it did just weeks following a case of sedition being registered in the city against a student filed for slogans she raised during a gathering of the Queer community .

“Any body who says your speech is seditious will have to prove all these ingredients, that either you are bringing or attempting to bring into hatred, the government established by law in India.’’

Observing the instance of the case where “some students who shouted slogans’’ and a case was lodged, he said, “Police can launch an investigation. But the court cannot take cognizance, unless there is a sanction. A sanction has to be granted on application of mind. It is only when that sanction is granted that the court can take cognizance.’’ And he cited the 1962 landmark SC Judgment in Kedar Nath where the SC while upholding the penal section on sedition clarified that it is not an offence unless it incites violence or public disorder. He mentioned the more recent Bombay high court ruling concerning the political cartoonist Aseem Trivedi The HC had in 2015 laid down guidelines requiring a legal opinion being sought before registering an offence.
