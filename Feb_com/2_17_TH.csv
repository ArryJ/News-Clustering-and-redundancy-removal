0,2020/02/17,Four-year ban for Haryana’s Amit Dahiya,"Penalised for sending a proxy for the dope test

In a “landmark” decision by the Anti-Doping Disciplinary Panel of the NADA, Haryana’s Amit Dahiya has been banned for four years for evading dope sample collection by sending a proxy during the National javelin open Championships last year.

Dahiya had finished third with a best throw of 68.21m in the event held at Sonepat on April 16, 2019. After the event, the 21-year-old Dahiya was asked by the National Anti-Doping officials to furnish his dope samples but he instead sent another person to the collection room.

During the verification process, the NADA Dope Collectors came to realise that the person who had come to provide the urine sample was not the bronze medallist. Realising that the plan failed, Dahiya’s proxy fled from the collection room.

Dahiya was handed provisional suspension on July 16 last year and the NADA presented the case to the ADDP on January 9. The ADDP has now passed an order to suspend him for four years from the date of his provisional suspension.

“In a landmark decision by the National Anti Doping Agency, javelin thrower Amit Dahiya has been penalised with intentionally evading sample collection and trying to cheat anti-doping officials during the 2nd National Javelin Throw Open Championship 2019 held at SAI Center, Sonipat,” the NADA said.

It said that this was the first time the NADA has taken cognisance of a case in which the athlete evaded sample collection and successfully proceeded against him under the prescribed provisions.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/four-year-ban-for-haryanas-amit-dahiya/article30845764.ece
1,2020/02/17,"Interested in athletics, but will focus only on kambala for a month, says jockey Srinivasa Gowda","Gowda was invited for trials by SAI after his sizzling run

Kambala jockey Srinivasa Gowda, who was invited for trials by the Sports Authority of India after rocketing to fame on the social media, visited the SAI South Centre here on Monday night.

The 28-year-old did not take part in any trials or assessments, however, having stated that he would like to focus on his kambala commitments for another month.

“After that, he has to go through a period of conditioning. He may not be in that kind of a condition where we can straightaway take him into the track,” said Capt. (Indian Navy) Ajay Kumar Bahl, Senior Director, SAI South Centre.

While admitting that success in kambala — a traditional sport in the south-western parts of Karnataka where competitors race buffaloes through paddy fields — did not automatically mean success in athletics, the Director stated that the SAI was ready to assess him and offer any support required.

“The dynamics of both are different. Here he is running barefoot, and there is a bull he needs to hold and run. Running on the track is a different ballgame. But all the facilities at SAI will be there to back him,” he said.

Possible

C. Harish, athletics coach at the SAI, felt Gowda’s athletic talent could not be dismissed out of hand. “Anand Shetty (former international sprinter) had also come from a kambala background. Many athletes have played different sports in their childhood before going on to succeed in something else. All sports are interlinked. We cannot say it’s not possible. It need not be 100m alone. He seems to have strength and endurance,” he pointed out.

It was a whirlwind day for Gowda who, in the afternoon, met the Karnataka Chief Minister at the Vidhana Soudha, where a cash prize of ₹3 lakh was announced.

“The credit does not belong to me; it belongs to the buffaloes and the owner of the buffaloes who took good care of them. That's why they could go so fast,” he told reporters.

Gowda was asked if he was interested in taking part in athletics. “I'm interested, but for a month I will be focusing only on kambala,” he said.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/1cii3n/article30845747.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH18GOWDA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/interested-in-athletics-but-will-focus-only-on-kambala-for-a-month-says-jockey-srinivasa-gowda/article30845748.ece
2,2020/02/17,"Winning Cairns Cup is a special feeling, says World rapid chess champion Koneru Humpy","Playing for the first time in the second edition of the Cairns Cup, said to be one of the toughest women’s events, World rapid chess champion Koneru Humpy re-asserted her supremacy winning the title with 6 points from nine rounds picking up the $45,000 winner’s purse in St. Louis on Monday.

“This is a really strong field with an average rating of ELO 2500+,” 32-year-old Humpy told The Hindu from the US. The tough field included two Americans and the top eight players including reigning World champion Ju Wenjun featuring in the round-robin format.

“Winning Cairns Cup is a special feeling for it reminds that the World championship title was no flash in the pan,” she said.

“The toughest match was against Alexandra Kousteniuk in the seventh round, which was a long battle and I could manage to keep my unbeaten record against her,” she said.

“It was a close race for the top spot as till the eighth round. Wenjun lost her game and I managed to draw my game giving me the slender half-a-point lead which eventually proved decisive,” Humpy said.

In the final round, Humpy drew with GM D. Harika, who finished sixth with 4.5 points.

“The best part of this victory is that I will be gaining crucial five ELO points and moving back to World No. 2 ranking and towards my goal being No.1 one day,” she said.

“The next big event is the Grand Prix in Italy this may and then I will be playing in the PSPB tournaments as part of my commitment to my employers,” the Chief Manager (HR) in ONGC said.

4,2020/02/17,Team LeBron outguns Team Giannis in 2020 NBA All-Star game,"Kawhi Leonard receives first Kobe Bryant MVP award

Kawhi Leonard stole the show on the floor and Hall of Famer Magic Johnson took centrestage in an emotional pre-game ceremony on a night the NBA paid tribute to the late Kobe Bryant.

Chicago’s favourite son Anthony Davis sank one of two free-throws to cap a thrilling fourth quarter and lift Team LeBron to a 157-155 win over Team Giannis in Sunday’s 2020 NBA All-Star game.

Honouring Bryant

Leonard finished with 30 points and seven rebounds and was awarded the new Kobe Bryant MVP award. The trophy was named after the former Los Angeles Laker, who perished along with his daughter Gigi and seven others in a horrific helicopter crash three weeks ago.

“I want to thank Kobe for everything he has done for me, all the long talks and workouts. Thank you,” said Leonard, who grew up in Riverside, California east of Los Angeles.

Giannis Antetokounmpo finished with 25 points and 11 rebounds to lead Team Giannis, which kept the game close right up until the nail-biting finish.

With the score 156-155, and new format dictating that the winner needed to be the first to get to 157 points, Davis went to the line for two shots after being fouled by Kyle Lowry.

“I told my teammates I was going to go to miss the first one and put more pressure on myself to knock down the second one,” said Davis, who grew up in Chicago.

That’s exactly what he did to put a perfect ending on the night which began with another Laker icon Johnson making an emotional speech honouring Bryant in front of a crowd of 20,900 at the United Center in Chicago.

“We’ll never see another basketball player quite like Kobe,” said Johnson, who also paid tribute to David Stern, the late NBA commissioner.

Records

James made his 16th All-Star start breaking a tie with Bryant for the most all-time. Bryant holds the record for most All-Star MVP awards with four. “His legacy is living on every single day with us,” said James of Bryant.

The league also honoured Bryant by having Team Giannis wear his No. 24 and Team LeBron wear his basketball-playing daughter’s No. 2.

Team LeBron earned $400,000 in prize money which it donated to the Chicagoland youth charity Chicago Scholars.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/ezszcd/article30845173.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH18NBA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/team-lebron-outguns-team-giannis-in-2020-nba-all-star-game/article30845174.ece
5,2020/02/17,Golf | Adam Scott wins Genesis Invitational,"Tournament host Tiger Woods stumbles in last

Adam Scott fired a one-under 70 to win the Genesis Invitational, and this time the Australian’s victory at Riviera Country Club is official.

On a challenging day that saw World No. 1 Rory McIlroy card a two-over 73 and tournament host Tiger Woods stumble to a six-over 77, Scott countered two bogeys and a double-bogey with five birdies to build an 11-under total of 273.

He finished two strokes in front of South Korea’s Kang Sung (69) and Americans Scott Brown (68) and Matt Kuchar (72) on Sunday.

“It’s incredibly satisfying to win a tournament of this stature on a golf course of this stature — even better to come out on top and have your game really tested. It was not easy,” Scott said.

McIlroy, who started the day tied for the lead with Scott and Kuchar and ended joint fifth, said: “Definitely the toughest day of the week. The wind was up, hole locations were sort of tricky spots, the course was firming up again. Everyone was finding it tough out there.”

Scott had come out on top in a play-off in 2005, but since the rain-soaked event was shortened to 36 holes he wasn’t credited with a USPGA Tour victory.

But this ‘W’ goes in the books as the 2013 Masters champion’s 14th US Tour title. That goes along with 14 international victories — most recently at the Australian PGA Championship in December, where Scott ended a near four-year title drought.

Bad to worse

Woods’ day could hardly have gone worse. Already 15 off the pace to start the day, the 15-time Major champion dropped five shots on his last six holes as he stumbled home with a six-over 77.

Overall Woods had seven bogeys and a double-bogey with one birdie and an eagle on the way to an 11-over 295 — 68th and last of the 68 players to make the cut.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/d36wph/article30844994.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH18SCOTT,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/golf-adam-scott-wins-genesis-invitational/article30844997.ece
6,2020/02/17,Khelo University Games anthem launched,"Speaking on the occasion, Union Sports Minister Kiren Rijiju reiterated the need to promote sports at the school and university level, with focus on progressing to excel at the international level.

The Khelo India University Games anthem was launched by Union Sports Minister Kiren Rijiju at a function held at his residence here on Monday. Sung, written and composed by former Haryana Ranji Trophy batsman Padamjeet Sehrawat, the peppy number exhorts the youth to participate in sports with an aim to shine and move ahead.

Speaking on the occasion, Rijiju reiterated the need to promote sports at the school and university level, with focus on progressing to excel at the international level.

“We have to have a structured format to improve Indian sport and the Khelo India University Games (starting February 22) is a step in that direction.

“We are aiming to make India a sports powerhouse,” he said.

Shooters Manu Bhaker, Anish Bhanwala and Sandeep Rajput were also present at the launch. “The KIUG is a great platform for budding talent. It is important to strengthen the university structure as more talent comes through the ranks. It will help us build super athletes,” said Bhaker.

Rijiju noted, “It is going to be an eventful year for Indian sports because universities will get such a huge platform to showcase their potential.

“It is going to help us set up a huge pool to identify and support sportsmen.”

The KIUG will have 17 disciplines with 3399 athletes from 159 universities slated to participate.

7,2020/02/17,No Chinese participation in Asian wrestling championships,"The 40-member contingent denied visas due to health concerns, explain WFI officials

China will not be present at the senior Asian wrestling championships starting here on Tuesday and the biggest gainers will be the Indian women.

Although there has been no official word from the government, the 40-member Chinese contingent had not been provided visas till late Monday evening with no further development on the issue. China has been facing an epidemic outbreak of the novel Coronavirus.

The WFI officials admitted that health concerns had led to the decision.

‘No risks’

“Several participating nations had asked for clarity on China’s participation and had even expressed reservations about coming in case the Chinese wrestlers were entered.

“It is a global concern right now and we cannot take any risks with the health of the wrestlers. Sports is, after all, meant for fitness,” a senior WFI official explained.

Asked whether this might lead to the United World Wrestling (UWW) taking exception, the official denied it.

“It would have been an issue if we had denied Pakistan, but that is sorted. This is a health concern not just for us but the entire world right now. It is an exceptional situation,” he said.

Rijiju clarifies

Sports Minister Kiren Rijiju insisted that it was purely a health concern.

“As part of the Olympic Charter, we cannot deny visas to anyone for a competition.

“But there are separate provisions for health or technical issues,” he clarified.

Pakistan, meanwhile, is expected to arrive on Tuesday with its four freestyle wrestlers and two officials.

Biggest attraction

The biggest attraction, however, will undoubtedly be the World No. 2 and India’s biggest Olympic hope Bajrang Punia in the 65kg freestyle competition.

Given that the event would be a ranking tournament for the upcoming Olympic Qualifier and would affect the seeding for the latter, a good performance here would help the defending champion get an easier outing.

The glamour boys of freestyle, however, will be in action over the weekend, the six-day event kicking off with the Greco-Roman competition the first two days followed by the women’s bouts at the K.D. Jadhav Stadium.

While India has traditionally been weak in the category, it managed three finalists and four medals, out of a total of 16, in 2019.

Sajan Bhanwal (77kg) and Harpreet Singh (82kg) will be the biggest hopes this time around.

India has four Olympic spots with Ravi Dahiya (57kg), Deepak Punia (86kg) and Vinesh Phogat (women’s, 53kg) being the other three.

Qualifier to be shifted?

Meanwhile, the Asian Olympic Qualifier, scheduled to be held in the Xi’an province of China from March 27 to 29, is also likely to be shifted with Mongolia and Kazakhstan in the fray to host the same along with India.

A final decision will be taken in the coming week.

“Obviously, we hope we get it but Kazakhstan had successfully hosted the World Championships last year. Let’s see,” said a WFI official.

Tuesday’s schedule:

Greco-Roman: 55kg, 63kg, 77kg, 87kg, 130kg.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/dpz6oc/article30844656.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH18BAJ,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/no-chinese-participation-in-asian-wrestling-championships/article30844657.ece

9,2020/02/17,Twin challenges for Indian basketball team,"Skipper Bhriguvanshi plays down the absence of key players

The Indian men’s basketball team will need to tackle the twin challenges of missing key personnel in Amjyot Singh Gill and Arshpreet Bhullar and a modified qualification procedure ahead of the first round of FIBA Asia Cup 2021 qualifiers starting this Friday.

Drawn alongside Bahrain, Iraq and Lebanon, India will begin its campaign by taking on Bahrain and Iraq in back-to-back away games without Amjyot and Arshpreet owing to the disciplinary proceedings initiated against the duo last December.

K. Govindaraj, President, Basketball Federation of India, stated that it will be a “couple of months” before they return.

Asia’s flagship event has also undergone a change. Biennial before, the Asia Cup will be held once in four years starting from the 2021 edition. Earlier, teams used to qualify through their respective regional championships; India, in 2017, secured the berth by winning the South Asian Championship.

New format

Under the new format, 24 teams from across Asia have been drawn into six groups. Each team will play a double round-robin format (home and away) across three windows spread over a year.

The top two teams in each group will advance to the FIBA Asia Cup 2021, while the six third-placed outfits will compete in a separate tournament to determine the last four members that will complete the 16-team roster.

“It’s tough preparation wise,” said skipper Vishesh Bhriguvanshi. “Now we will play two matches. The next matches are after eight months. What if something happens to some player? The Federation is trying to get us some tournaments, matches in between. But it is a big gap.”

But the 28-year-old played down the absence of key players. “There will be some effect. But we have practised, planned and trained for two months without them. So it doesn’t matter.”

Bhriguvanshi also stated that the aim was to recapture the golden form of 2015-16 when India made the quarterfinals of the 2015 Asia Cup and finished seventh in the 2016 FIBA Asia Challenge.

The team:

Vishesh Bhriguvanshi (Capt.), Muin Bek Hafeez, Joginder Singh, P.V. Sivakumar, Sahil, Jagdeep Singh, Prashant Rawat, Aravind Annadurai, Princepal Singh, Amritpal Singh, Amaan Sandhu, Arvind Arumugam. Head coach: Veselin Matic.

10,2020/02/17,Shooter Manu Bhaker undeterred by high expectations,"Says it means that people have faith in her and vows to do well in Tokyo

Manu Bhaker has a disarming smile, and honesty dances in her eyes. There is mischief and charm, when she is not training her eyes on the target with a pistol in hand.

And when she gets into the mood to have a conversation, the way she did the other evening, with Rushdee Warley, the CEO of the Inspire Institute of Sport in Vijayanagar, where the shooters had a training camp, Manu can really bring the roof down.

Quite overwhelmed by her spontaneous response and teasing sense of humour, the CEO had no hesitation in saying, “we would build one for you,” when Manu said that the place had everything except a shooting range.

Experience

“I want to see and experience it for myself first. Please don’t tell me anything about Tokyo,” said Manu, quite keen to retain the suspense about the atmosphere of her maiden Olympics.

Having dominated the world right from winning the Youth Olympics gold in 2018, to World Cup gold medals, apart from sweeping all the international mixed air pistol gold medals in 2019, Manu has every chance to compete in three events. But she shows great maturity when queried on the prospects.

“Whatever opportunity I get, I will do the best for my country. It may be three events, two or one. I love the sport and I love to compete. It is the federation that will decide,” said Manu, with admirable maturity and composure.

Counter

She takes one’s breath away by countering the projection about the possible pressure of expectations.

“The high expectations means that people have faith in you. They support you. They have seen us dominate the world. I like it. I will genuinely try my best,” she said, eyes twinkling with pride.

Interestingly, Manu had got into shooting only after the last Olympics in Rio in 2016.

“People think that I have just come up and started shooting great. I have trained hard, from 8 a.m. to 8 in the evening. Nothing comes easy. I know competing in the Olympics is a dream of every athlete. I have worked hard on a lot of things. There is no need to change at this stage. The 10-metre is the mother of all shooting. So, my 25-metre gets the support from it, especially the precision stage. I train duelling for about two hours’’, said Manu, as she summed up her preparations and approach to the Tokyo Games.

Guru Jaspal Rana

Manu owes a lot to guru Jaspal Rana, not just for her shooting, but for mentoring her personality.

“He is always there for me. I have the trust to ask him anything, not necessarily about my shooting. He has vast experience and knowledge. He is passing that to me. He maintains strict discipline,” Manu said.

It is Manu’s 18th birthday today. The first year student of Lady Shriram College in the Capital, has the skill and resolve to make the country proud in the Olympics.

Happy birthday Manu! It is just a new beginning to an inspirational journey.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/nd38z/article30843822.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th18Manu,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/manu-undeterred-by-high-expectations/article30843823.ece
11,2020/02/17,Determined to keep doing well at the highest level,"Carrom player Appoorwa reiterates that she still means business

She takes pride in setting a “reverse trend” in achieving big!

S. Appoorwa first became a two-time World carrom champion (2004 and 2016) and a World Cup winner (2018) before claiming the women’s singles title in the recent senior Nationals at Jalgaon.

Finally, the long wait has ended.

For Appoorwa, it has been a near two-decade long journey in the world of carrom, dotted with some of the best results for an Indian player.

She was the first World champion (seniors) from the City in any discipline, much before the other big names in more glamorous sports achieved similar feats.

“The general impression is that winning a World title is much more easier than winning the National championship given the fact that it is the Indians who generally dominate world carrom.

“In that context, I am glad I could fill in that gap in my achievements list,” said a smiling Appoorwa after the top brass of the LIC South Central Zone, headed by Zonal Manager Ms. Mini, felicitated her here on Monday.

“It is not that I was not serious in winning the Nationals. But, somehow, it didn’t happen because of a couple of long breaks from the game. The way I played in the last Nationals, and particularly beating eight-time champion Rashmi Kumari in the final, was truly memorable,” said the World champion.

The quiet performer reiterates that she still means business and is determined to keep doing well at the highest level. This may not sound good news to others for this 39-year-old champion is chasing another world title.

“The sport hasn’t changed a lot in terms of popularity. But, I sincerely wish the achievers in carrom do get decent jobs in public sector undertakings and Government institutions so that more and more youngsters take up the sport,” she said and thanked LIC, her family and Carrom Association of Telangana State officials for the continued support.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/determined-to-keep-doing-well-at-the-highest-level/article30843803.ece

17,2020/02/17,Ankita Raina is the top seed,"Ankita Raina will be the top seed and play her first round against Bojana Marinkovic of Serbia in the $25,000 ITF women’s tennis tournament at the Sardar Club in Ratanada from Tuesday.

While Ankita has been able to continue from where she left last year, by winning a double crown in a similar event already this season, the focus could be on the return of Karman Kaur Thandi.

In fact, there will be many Indian players in the event, some of whom have been able to assert their improvement in the qualifying event.

It will be a good chance for the Indian FedCup players to compete together in a tournament, before the competition in Dubai, as Rutuja Bhosale, Riya Bhatia and Sowjanya Bavisetti would also be playing in the tournament apart from Ankita and Karman.

Nidhi Chiliumula, Mihika Yadav, Jennifer Luikham, Vaidehi Chaudhari, Sri Vaishnavi Peddi Reddy, Zeel Desai, Humera Shaik, Sathwika Sama, Saumya Vig and Soha Sadiq will be the other Indian players in action, trying to move forward in the main event.

It is another rare opportunity for the Indian women to compete at home, and they would be keen to capitalise on the advantage.

The results: Qualifying singles (second and final round): Soha Sadiq bt Supapitch Kuearum (Tha) 6-2, 1-6, [10-5]; Nidhi Chilumula bt Sonashe Bhatnagar 6-0, 6-4; Ekaterina Nikiforova (Rus) bt Nidtra Rajmohan 6-2, 6-1; Vaidehi Chaudhari bt Ashmitha Easwaramurthi 4-6, 6-3, [10-4]; Sri Vaishnavi Peddi Reddy bt Prerna Bhambri 6-4, 1-6, [10-8]; Saumya Vig bt Muskan Mahajan (US) 6-4, 6-1; Humera Shaik bt Rashi Malviya 6-1, 6-2; Shria Atturu (US) bt Arthi Muniyan 3-6, 7-6(2), [10-4].

18,2020/02/17,Google to wind down free public WiFi service at rail stations,"However, users in India will be able to continue using the existing facilities at over 400 stations via RailTel.

Five years after it started the ‘Station’ programme to bring free public Wi-Fi to 400 busiest railway stations in India, Google has decided to gradually wind down the service globally as it believes that better data plans and improving mobile connectivity have made it “simpler and cheaper” for users to get online.

However, users in India will be able to continue using the existing facilities at the over 400 stations via RailTel, Google’s partner in India for the programme. The technology giant said that through the year 2020, it would be working with its partners to transition existing sites so that they could remain useful resources for the community.





Began in 2015

The programme was kick-started in India in 2015 as a partnership between Google, Indian Railways and RailTel to bring fast, free public WiFi to over 400 of the busiest railway stations by mid-2020. However, the company crossed that number by June 2018, following which more locations were added across the country in partnership with telecommunication companies, ISPs and local authorities.

Caesar Sengupta, Vice-President, Payments and Next Billion Users at Google, noted in a blog that over time, partners in other countries asked for ‘Station’ too and the company responded accordingly.

Mr. Sengupta reasoned that in the last five years, getting online has become much simpler and cheaper as mobile data plans have become more affordable and mobile connectivity is improving globally.

“The challenge of varying technical requirements and infrastructure among our partners across countries has also made it difficult for Station to scale and be sustainable, especially for our partners,” he said. “And when we evaluate where we can truly make an impact in the future, we see greater need and bigger opportunities in building products and features tailored to work better for the next billion user markets.”

Five-year contract

When contacted, RailTel spokesperson confirmed that the company will continue to service free Wi-Fi in all those railway stations. “We have roped in a number of partners along the journey and currently RailTel is providing free Wi-Fi at over 5,600 stations across the country. We entered into a five-year contract with Google for supporting us with setting up Wi-Fi at 415 stations only and the contract is going to expire soon. We sincerely value the support we received from Google in this journey.”",technology,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/86dj54/article26801778.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MH-RAILTELARTGA75N106V4jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/google-to-close-station-which-provides-free-public-wifi-in-railway-stations/article30841811.ece
19,2020/02/17,Coronavirus derails Intel event in U.S.,"Intel, on Monday, decided to postpone its Intel briefing sessions conference that was scheduled between March 13 here.

After Facebook, Coronavirus has derailed another significant-tech summit in the Silicon Valley, this time from global chip-maker Intel which on Monday decided to postpone its “Intel briefing sessions” that were scheduled on March 13 here.

The company said in a statement that the briefing sessions would not be organised as scheduled ""due to the coronavirus/COVID-19 impact on the ecosystem"".

“We are revisiting launch plans,” said the company.

Facebook last week cancelled ‘Global Marketing Summit’ in San Francisco that was scheduled from March 9-12. Over 5,000 participants were expected to attend the event.

“Out of an abundance of caution, we cancelled our Global Marketing Summit due to evolving public health risks related to coronavirus,” said a company spokesperson.

IBM said it cancelled its participation in the RSA cybersecurity conference here from February 24-28 due to concerns over China virus outbreak.

“The health of IBMers is our primary concern as we continue to monitor upcoming events and travel relative to Novel Coronavirus (COVID—19)”, the company tweeted.

San Francisco International Airport is among 11 locations through which all flights from China to the US are being funneled for coronavirus screening.

China’s National Health Commission on Monday reported 70,548 confirmed coronavirus cases and 1,770 deaths, with 10,844 people discharged from hospital.

21,2020/02/17,50% of all surgeries will be robot assisted by 2025: L&T,"“Training surgeons to become proficient in the use of robots is a major challenge in India. Innovative low-cost training systems such as the Endo-Training kit and new VR/AR based training simulators such as RoSS promises to address the needs of the fast-growing clinical robotic sector,” said Professor Kesh Kesavadas of the University of Illinois in the US.

Infrastructure and engineering conglomerate Larsen & Toubro (L&T) expects almost 50% of all surgeries to be robot-assisted by 2025, as Artificial Intelligence (AI) makes robots precise enough to facilitate complex surgeries, the company said on Monday.

The L&T Technology Services Limited (LTTS) organised an ‘Experience Walk-through’ as part of a symposium on advancement in robot-assisted surgery to enable participants to get hands-on experience with cutting-edge products and solutions in the medical and medical equipment field.

23,2020/02/17,How AI can predict heart attacks and stroke,"In the largest study of its kind, researchers took routine CMR scans from more than 1,000 patients and used a new automated artificial intelligence technique to analyse the images.

Researchers have used Artificial Intelligence (AI) for the first time to instantly and accurately measure blood flow.

The results were found to be able to predict chances of death, heart attack and stroke, and can be used by doctors to help recommend treatments which could improve a patient’s blood flow, according to the study, published in the journal Circulation.

“We have tried to measure blood flow manually before, but it is tedious and time-consuming, taking doctors away from where they are needed most, with their patients,” said study researcher James Moon from University College London in the UK.

Heart disease is the leading global cause of death and illness. Reduced blood flow, which is often treatable, is a common symptom of many heart conditions.

International guidelines therefore recommend a number of assessments to measure a patient’s blood flow, but many are invasive and carry a risk.

Non-invasive blood flow assessments are available, including Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (CMR) imaging, but up until now, the scan images have been incredibly difficult to analyse in a manner precise enough to deliver a prognosis or recommend treatment.

In the largest study of its kind, researchers took routine CMR scans from more than 1,000 patients and used a new automated artificial intelligence technique to analyse the images.

By doing this, the teams were able to precisely and instantaneously quantify the blood flow to the heart muscle and deliver the measurements to the medical teams treating the patients.

By comparing the AI-generated blood flow results with the health outcomes of each patient, the team found that the patients with reduced blood flow were more likely to have adverse health outcomes including death, heart attack, stroke and heart failure.

The AI technique was therefore shown for the first time to be able to predict which patients might die or suffer major adverse events, better than a doctor could on their own with traditional approaches.

“The predictive power and reliability of the AI was impressive and easy to implement within a patient’s routine care,” said study researcher Kristopher Knott.

“This study demonstrates the growing potential of artificial intelligence-assisted imaging technology to improve the detection of heart disease and may move clinicians closer to a precision medicine approach to optimize patient care,” said Peter Kellman, who developed the automated AI techniques to analyse the images that were used in the study.",technology,https://www.thehindu.com/business/hbcco/article30840530.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th06BUHEART,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/how-ai-can-predict-heart-attacks-and-stroke/article30840533.ece

29,2020/02/17,No let up in Taliban attacks as fresh orders awaited over deal,"‘Leadership hasn’t conveyed any message about a ceasefire’

Taliban fighters attacked Afghan government forces overnight, and militant commanders said on Monday insurgency operations would go-ahead until they receive fresh instructions based on a deal with the U.S. to reduce violence in the country.

Last week, a senior U.S. administration official said negotiations with Taliban representatives in Qatar had resulted in and agreement in principle for a week-long reduction of violence, but the seven-day period had not commenced. The official said the agreement covered all Afghan forces, and would be closely monitored.

Our leadership hasn’t conveyed any message about a ceasefire to us, said a Taliban commander in Helmand, a southern province that has seen some of the fiercest fighting.

Commanders in Paktika and Nangarhar — two other provinces regarded as strongholds for the Taliban also said they would continue their attacks as planned.

On Sunday night, Taliban fighters attacked Afghan government forces manning a checkpoint in the northern province of Kunduz. According to a statement by Taliban spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid, they killed 19 security personnel.

The Afghan Defence Ministry confirmed the attack in a statement but put the death toll at five. It also said retaliatory air strikes were conducted against the militants.

More than 300 Americans who had been stuck on a cruise ship affected by the coronavirus were back in the United States on Monday, flown to U.S. military bases for two more weeks of quarantine after spending the previous 14 days docked in Japan.

Among those repatriated on a pair of U.S.-chartered jets were 14 people who tested positive for the fast-spreading virus, seven on each plane. The Diamond Princess cruise ship held by far the largest cluster of cases outside China, with more than 400 people infected out of some 3,700 on board.

The coronavirus outbreak has killed 1,770 people in China and five elsewhere, with Chinese officials reporting another 2,048 cases on Monday, raising the total to 70,548.

Washington previously flew hundreds of Americans from China to military bases in the United States, and then arranged to bring back the 338 cruise ship passengers once their 14-day quarantines on board had expired.

Another 60 Americans remained in Japan for monitoring, State Department officials said.

A further 200 U.S. citizens were stuck in Cambodia, among them 92 still on board another cruise ship, the Westerdam, that was also affected by the virus.

The Diamond Princess was ordered to stay under quarantine at Yokohama port on Feb. 3 after an 80-year-old Hong Kong man, who was on board from Jan. 20 to Jan. 25, developed the virus.

U.S. officials previously pledged to keep infected Americans in Japan for treatment. But they said they were forced to change plans after the passengers disembarked and were on their way to the airport when Japanese officials informed them that 14 of those in transit had tested positive.

“It was only when they were loaded onto these buses that we were made aware these positive results had come back from the government of Japan,” Dr. William Walters, a senior medical official for the State Department, told a news briefing.

“They were then taken off the bus, moved into the aircraft and that dedicated isolation area, which was the safest place for them to get away from the rest of the passengers and give us time to make decisions,” Dr. Walters said.

The infected passengers were isolated in specialized containment areas aboard the two chartered jets. They were exposed to other passengers for about 40 minutes during the bus ride.

“We removed them from the buses as soon as those buses came to a stop on the tarmac and it was safe to do so,” Dr. Walters said.

One of those planes landed at Travis Air Force Base in California on Sunday night.

A few hours later, the other plane landed on Monday morning at Joint Base San Antonio in Texas, where news video showed a ground crew in anticontamination suits climbing the stairs to the plane in the predawn fog. Passengers later descended wearing surgical masks.

The 14 passengers who had tested positive were immediately moved to a separate facility in Omaha, Nebraska, officials said.

Like other repatriated Americans, the remaining passengers will be quarantined on the bases for 14 days.

Previously, more than 40 Americans on the Diamond Princess had tested positive, and U.S. health officials said they would remain in Japan for treatment.

31,2020/02/17,German far right arrests reveal ‘shocking’ mosque attack plot,"Officials said that investigations into 12 men detained in police raids across Germany on Friday had indicated they planned major attacks

Members of a German extreme right group arrested last week were believed to have been plotting “shocking” large-scale attacks on mosques similar to the ones carried out in New Zealand last year, a government spokesman said Monday.

Officials said that investigations into 12 men detained in police raids across Germany on Friday had indicated they planned major attacks, following media reports over the weekend the group aimed to launch several simultaneous mass-casualty assaults on Muslims during prayers.

“It’s shocking what has been revealed here, that there are cells here that appear to have become radicalised in such a short space of time,” Interior Ministry spokesperson Bjoern Gruenewaelder told reporters at a Berlin press conference.

“It is the task of the state, and of course of this government, to protect free practice of religion in this country, with no reference to what religion it might be,” Chancellor Angela Merkel’s spokesperson Steffen Seibert said.

“Anyone practising their religion in Germany within our legal order should be able to do so without being endangered or threatened”.

According to media reports, the group planned to use semi-automatic weapons to ape last March's attacks in Christchurch in New Zealand in which 51 people were killed at two mosques.

The alleged leader of the group, which was known to the authorities and whose meetings and chat activity had been under observation, had detailed his plans at a meeting organised with his accomplices last week.

Investigators learned about it from someone who had infiltrated the group, the reports said.

Prosecutors said on Friday they had launched early morning raids to determine whether the suspects already had weapons or other supplies that could be used in an attack.

German authorities have turned increased attention to the country's underground extreme right scene since the murder of conservative local politician Walter Luebcke last June and an October attack on a synagogue in eastern city Halle.

32,2020/02/17,"Afghan people need and deserve peace, prosperity: UN chief Antonio Guterres","The U.N. Secretary-General said the statement while addressing an international conference in Islamabad.

UN chief Antonio Guterres on Monday called on the global community to step up efforts to help bring peace in war-torn Afghanistan, saying the Afghan people need and deserve peace, prosperity and full respect of their human rights.

The UN Secretary-General said this while addressing an international conference titled ‘40 years of Afghan Refugees Presence in Pakistan: A New Partnership for Solidarity’ held in Islamabad.

Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, Ministers and senior officials from around 20 countries are participating in the conference.

Noting that the Afghan refugee crisis is the world’s largest protracted refugee situation in recorded history, Mr. Guterres said there is deep impact on the Afghani people due to the protracted nature of conflict, poverty and forced displacement, a report in the Dawn newspaper said.

Mr. Guterres emphasised that the Afghan people need and deserve peace and prosperity and full respect of their human rights.

“As we look to the challenges ahead, the global community should step up. As we have marked 40 unbroken years of solidarity, but we also despair at the 40 broken years of hostility,” he said.

According to a report in The Express Tribune, Mr. Guterres said that a renewed commitment to peace is required in Afghanistan for the successful repatriation of Afghan refugees.

We must be realistic and know big challenges lie ahead. But the message of this conference and the presence of so many senior government officials from all over the world is a testament of hope and commitment for a new partnership with solidarity and a better future for Afghanistan, Pakistan and the world, he said.

“Our ability to succeed would be a litmus test on the global impact on the refugees. It’s promise of greater responsibility sharing with countries that have shouldered the burden until now, Mr. Guterres said.

Mr. Guterres’ comments came amidst renewed Afghan peace talks between the U.S. negotiator on Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad and the Taliban.

U.S. President President Donald Trump abruptly called off the talks with the insurgents in September last year after a U.S. soldier was killed in a suicide attack in Afghanistan’s capital, Kabul.

Pakistan, which had facilitated the nine-month-long painstaking peace process in Doha, had pushed for the resumption of talks.

In October, Pakistan hosted the Afghan Taliban delegation led by Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar.

“For 40 years, the people of Afghanistan have faced many crises, for 40 years the people of Pakistan have responded with solidarity. This generosity now spans across decades and generations,” Mr. Guterres said.

“We must recognise that international support for Pakistan has been minimal compared to your own national efforts,” Mr. Guterres said.

Earlier, Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said Afghan refugees were seeking greater global commitment to the peace process, noting that Pakistan hosts three million registered and unregistered Afghan refugees.

“We know the solution lies in Afghanistan and I hope the signals of a possible passageway of peace will lead to a better future for the people of Afghanistan,” Mr. Guterres said.

“I see with the U.S. Ambassador Khalilzad and I want to strongly encourage to pursue the way for peace. The Afghan people can count on the United Nations to support the efforts for peace. We don’t seek protagonism, we are here only to serve,” he said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/1jkwbf/article30521729.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ANTONIOGUTERRES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/afghan-people-need-and-deserve-peace-prosperity-un-chief-antonio-guterres/article30842754.ece
33,2020/02/17,Gunmen kill 24 in attack near church in Burkina Faso,"The attack occurred in the town of Pansi in Yagha province, officials said

Gunmen killed 24 civilians, including a church pastor, and kidnapped three others on Sunday in Burkina Faso, an official said. It was the latest attack against a religious leader in the increasingly unstable West African nation.

The Mayor of Boundore commune, Sihanri Osangola Brigadie, said the attack occurred in the town of Pansi in Yagha province. The roughly 20 attackers separated men from women close to a Protestant church. At least 18 other people were injured.

“It hurt me when I saw the people,” Mr. Brigadie said after visiting some of the victims in the hospital in Dori town, 180 kilometres from the attack. The gunmen looted oil and rice from shops and forced the three youth they kidnapped to help transport it on their motorbikes, he said.

Both Christians and Muslims were killed before the church was set on fire, said a government security official in Dori who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorised to speak to the media.

Attacks have targeted religious leaders in the area in the past. Last week, also in Yagha province, a retired pastor was killed and another pastor was abducted by gunmen, according to an internal security report for aid workers.

Extremist violence has dramatically escalated in once-peaceful Burkina Faso.

Analysts are concerned that attacks against civilians, including against Christians, are increasing “at an alarming rate,” said Corinne Dufka, West Africa director for Human Rights Watch. “Perpetrators use victims’ links to government or their faith to justify the killings, while others appear to be reprisal killings for killings by the government security forces,” she said.

More than 1,300 civilians were killed in targeted attacks last year in Burkina Faso, more than seven times the previous year, according to Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project, which collects and analyses conflict information.

The insecurity has created a humanitarian crisis.

34,2020/02/17,Pakistan no longer a safe haven for terror groups: Imran Khan,"The Pakistan Prime Minister’s assertion came as the Financial Action Task Force, the global anti-money laundering watchdog, began a crucial meeting in Paris

There are no safe havens for terror groups in Pakistan right now, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said on Monday while acknowledging publicly that this was possibly not the case earlier. Addressing an international conference marking 40 years of hosting Afghan refugees in the country, he said Pakistan seeks peace in Afghanistan and instability in the war-torn neighbouring country was not in its interest.

Mr. Khan’s assertion on safe havens for terror groups came as the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the global anti-money laundering watchdog, began a crucial meeting in Paris where Pakistan is trying to wriggle out of being blacklisted for not doing enough to combat terror financing.

The United States, India and Afghanistan have long accused Pakistan of providing safe havens to terror groups like the Taliban, the Haqqani network, the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed. “I can tell you that there are no safe havens here,” Mr. Khan said at a conference here, also attended by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.

“Whatever the situation might have been in the past, right now, I can tell you... there is one thing we want: peace in Afghanistan,” Mr. Khan said.

He admitted that it was possible that such safe havens were operating in the country after 9/11 in the Afghan refugee camps, The News reported.

“How is the government capable of checking how militants operate from the camps,” Mr. Khan said, adding that it was not possible because the Afghan refugee camps in Pakistan have had a population of over 1,00,000.

The Prime Minister’s assertion came after Afghanistan’s second Vice President Sarwar Danish accused Pakistan of allowing the Taliban to recruit new fighters from Afghan refugee camps in Pakistan to launch attacks in his country.

While Pakistan cannot fully guarantee that no Taliban militants are hiding among the huge number of Afghans living in Pakistan, Mr. Khan said his government had done all it can to prevent attacks in Afghanistan, including building a border fence.

The whole country is on the same page on Afghanistan, he said, adding that previously it was said that the government and the country’s security forces were not on the same page. However, this was not the case now, he added.

He said Pakistan was not seeking peace in Afghanistan because it has been hosting 1.4 million Afghan refugees, but because the people of Afghanistan deserve peace.

Earlier, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, in his address, stated that the people of Pakistan for 40 years have responded with generosity with regard to hosting Afghan refugees.

“Even though major conflicts have erupted in other parts of the world, Pakistan is still the second largest refugee host. I am struck by its extraordinary solidarity and compassion,” he said.

At the same time, he urged the international community to step up support for Pakistan in tackling the problem of Afghan refugees. “The global community must step up,” Mr. Guterres said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/sggf63/article30480447.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH05-DESPATCH-MEHMAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pakistan-no-longer-a-safe-haven-for-terror-groups-imran-khan/article30842206.ece

India will send medical supplies on board a special relief plane to China’s Wuhan city, the epicentre of the novel coronavirus, this week and bring back Indians as well as citizens from all neighbouring countries who are still stuck there on the return flight, the Indian Embassy said on Monday.

Indian Ambassador to China Vikram Misri said that subject to capacity, the special flight to Wuhan can take nationals from “all our neighbouring countries”, besides Indians.

On its return, the flight will have limited capacity to take on board Indians wishing to return to India from Wuhan/Hubei.(1/3) @MEAIndia — India in China (@EOIBeijing) February 17, 2020

“Subject to capacity limitations and space availability on the incoming aircraft, #India is also willing to facilitate nationals from all our neighbours boarding it on its return journey to #NewDelhi. Those interested are requested to contact @EOIBeijing,” Misri tweeted.

China is grappling to contain the deadly disease as the death toll climbed to 1,770 after 105 more people died, mostly in the worst-hit Hubei province, officials said on Monday.

Of the new deaths, 100 were from Hubei, three in Henan, and two in Guangdong.

The Indian Embassy also announced that the Indian government will be sending a consignment of medical supplies on board a relief flight to Wuhan later this week to aid and assist China in its efforts against the COVID-19 epidemic.

On its return, the flight will have some limited capacity to take on board Indian nationals wishing to return to India from Wuhan/Hubei Province , it said, asking the Indian nationals to get in touch with it.

Indian officials said they are in touch with the Chinese authorities to grant necessary permissions to the flight to land and take the stranded Indians.

India operated two special Air India flights on February 1 and 2 and airlifted 647 Indian nationals, mostly students, and seven Maldivian nationals.

Many Indian nationals currently in Wuhan/Hubei Province and wishing to return to India have already been in touch with @EOIBeijing in the past two weeks, a tweet by the Indian Embassy said.

Indian officials said there are still 80 to 100 Indians still stuck in the worst-hit Wuhan and other areas of Hubei province and many of them have been making desperate pleas to the Indian government to airlift them.

This includes 10 Indians who could not board the two special flights due to high body temperatures. They were expected to make it in the third flight as they reported to have recovered.

Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bangladesh have airlifted their nationals, while 800 to 1,000 Pakistanis are still held in Hubei.

Those who are held up in the province were being taken care of by Chinese authorities with regular supplies for food and other essential materials.

The Indian officials said the operation to earlier airlift two batches of Indians was a logistical nightmare as both Wuhan and Hubai were locked down with a ban on public and private transport.

On Sunday, Misri said in a video message that India will do everything within its means to assist the people of China to combat the deadly coronavirus outbreak and would soon send a consignment of medical supplies.

Masks also have become scarce in China in view of the nationwide demand in the last three weeks.

Reeling under a major locust attack, Pakistan may allow a one-time exemption to import insecticides from India despite the trade ban which was imposed after New Delhi revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir in August last, according to a media report on Monday.

Importing insecticides from India will be discussed during the Pakistan federal Cabinet’s meeting on Tuesday, the Dawn News reported.

Pakistan is facing its worst locust attack in decades, after insects destroyed crops on a large scale in Punjab province, the country’s main region for agricultural production.

In a meeting earlier in the month, Prime Minister Imran Khan declared the locust attack a national emergency.

The meeting, which was attended by federal ministers and senior officials of the four provinces, also approved a National Action Plan that requires a sum of ₹7.3 billion to overcome the crisis.

Other topics to be discussed by the Cabinet on Tuesday include gas pricing and power bill mandates for getting the International Monetary Fund’s next tranche of funds of $450 million, the report said.

The Pakistan government considering the import of insecticides from India comes seven months after Islamabad on August 9 decided to suspend all trade ties with India following New Delhi’s decision to abrogate Article 370 on August 5, revoking the special status of Jammu and Kashmir.

China is considering a rare move to postpone its annual parliament session scheduled to be held in early March as the country grapples with the coronavirus outbreak that has claimed over 1,700 lives, official media reported on Monday.

The 13th National People’s Congress (NPC), the country’s top legislature, is due to hold its annual session in Beijing on March 5, according to an official announcement in December last year.

But amid the spread of the COVID-19, the NPC Standing Committee is to discuss postponing this year’s NPC plenary session, the state-run China Daily said in a brief report.

If the NPC, which is held every year along with the advisory body Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), is postponed, it will be regarded as an unprecedented move.

The ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) considers two sessions as significant political event to adopt its national agenda, including the annual budgets.

Together the NPC and CPPCC have over 5,000 delegates. China is discouraging large gathering to prevent the spread of the virus.

The postponement is reportedly being contemplated as the COVID-19 continued its virulent run, though officials say it is slowing down.

China reported 105 new deaths due to the COVID-19 on Monday, increasing the overall death toll to 1,770.

The source of the leak, which occurred on Sunday night, and the type of gas that had leaked were not immediately known. There was no suspicion of sabotage.

Authorities said they became aware of the incident when people in the Karachi neighborhood of Kamari, which is close to the main port where incoming ships anchor, suddenly started rushing to the area’s hospitals with severe breathing problems overnight, police chief Adil Malik told reporters.

Pakistan on February 17 launched a countrywide anti-polio campaign to vaccinate about 39.6 million children under the age of five in the country as the government appealed to the people for their support to eradicate the crippling disease.

Special Assistant to Prime Minister Imran Khan on Health Services Zafar Mirza said the government is committed to reach every child with the polio vaccine.

According to the World Health Organisation, Pakistan is one of the three countries, along with Afghanistan and Nigeria, where polio is still endemic.

We have critically reviewed our performance during last campaign and worked with provincial and district teams for an even better preparedness for this nationwide vaccination drive, he said. He appealed to the people to join hands with the government to eradicate the polio virus from the country.

Over 2,65,000 polio workers will go door-to-door to administer polio drops to about 39.6 million children, officials said. The initiative has come days after Pakistan confirmed 5 new polio cases, taking the number of those affected by the disease this year to 17. Last year, 144 polio cases were reported nationwide, far higher than 12 in 2018 and eight in 2017.

Prime Minister Khan had in December said that it was a “matter of shame” that Pakistan was among the countries where polio was still prevalent.

Attempts to eradicate the disease have been seriously hampered by deadly targeting of vaccination teams in recent years by militants, who oppose the drives, claiming the polio drops cause infertility.

A 32-year-old Indian man has died in the UAE after sustaining severe burn injuries in his bid to save his wife from a fire at their home in Abu Dhabi last week, according to a media report on Monday.

Anil Ninan, who hails from Kerala, sustained 90 per cent burn injuries in the fire on Monday last week, reported the Khaleej Times. His wife Neenu also suffered injuries in the incident, however her condition is said to be stable.

“This is a difficult time for us. His wife Neenu is still recovering at the hospital. She is safe. But, all of us are shocked at his death,” a close relative was quoted in the report.

It is suspected a short circuit caused the fire at Ninan’s home.

About 10,000 Japanese men clad only in loincloths braved freezing temperatures at the weekend to pack into a temple and scramble in the dark for lucky wooden talismans tossed into the crowd, in a ritual that dates back five centuries.

The highlight of the raucous day-long 'Hadaka Matsuri' festival came at 10 p.m. on Saturday, when the lights went out and a priest threw bundles of twigs and two lucky sticks, each about 20-cm (8-inch) -long, among the participants.

That set off a 30-minute tussle for the sticks, coveted as symbols of good fortune and prosperity, although most men escaped with just a few cuts and bruises, in contrast to past occasions, when some have been crushed to death.

“Once a year, at the coldest time in February, we wrap ourselves in just a loincloth to be a man,” said 55-year-old Yasuhiko Tokuyama, the president of a regional electronics firm.

“That's the significance of this event and why I continue to participate.”

Plenty of sake and beer is sold outside the temple to warm the revellers, but a purifying plunge into pools of cold water before the start of the festival was a shock to the system for most.

The annual celebration at the Saidaiji Kannonin Temple in the southern city of Okayama has its roots in a competition to grab paper talismans that dates back more than 500 years.

Holland America Line said it is working with governments and health experts to track passengers who disembarked from its Westerdam cruise ship docked in Cambodia after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia.

The cruise line, which is owned by cruise giant Carnival Corp, said none of the other 1,454 passengers and 802 crew have reported any symptoms.

“Guests who have already returned home will be contacted by their local health department and be provided further information,” a statement from the company said.

Passengers had been cleared to travel by Cambodian authorities after health checks when the cruise ship docked on Thursday. It had spent two weeks at sea after being turned away by Japan, Taiwan, Guam, the Philippines and Thailand.

But on Saturday, Malaysia said an American woman who arrived in Kuala Lumpur on Friday on a chartered flight had tested positive for the new coronavirus that has killed more than 1,700 people, the vast majority in China.

The woman's husband tested negative for the coronavirus.

About 137 of the 145 passengers on the chartered flight had already left for other countries as of Sunday after showing no signs of illness, Malaysian authorities said.

Dozens more of the Westerdam passengers had flown through Thailand and onward to other countries, Thai officials said.

At least 236 passengers and 747 crew remain aboard the vessel off the Cambodian port city of Sihanoukville, Holland America said. Others were in hotels in Phnom Penh, the capital.

Holland America said it is working with health officials in Malaysia and Cambodia and experts in the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO).

“These experts are working with the appropriate national health authorities to investigate and follow-up with individuals who may have come in contact with the guest,” said Dr. Grant Tarling, Chief Medical Officer for Holland America Line.

Several hundred other passengers who left the ship are still in Cambodia, according to passenger Holley Rauen, a public health nurse and midwife from Fort Myers, Florida. ”I believe there's 300 Americans here at this hotel plus a few hundred from other countries. We will all be tested for the coronavirus today and tomorrow by the Cambodian Ministry of Health,” Rauen told Reuters on Sunday.

Located halfway between Tokyo and Guam, it was regarded as a strategic outpost. Close to 7,000 U.S. Marines and nearly all of the 21,000 Japanese defenders of the island died during the 36-day battle.

This month marks the 75th anniversary of the start of the Battle of Iwo Jima, which saw some of the bloodiest fighting of World War Two take place on a small Japanese island 1,200 km south of Tokyo.

Iwo Jima was the first native Japanese soil to be invaded during the Allied advance. Located halfway between Tokyo and Guam, it was regarded as a strategic outpost. Close to 7,000 U.S. Marines and nearly all of the 21,000 Japanese defenders of the island died during the 36-day battle.

The Japanese troops held the heavily fortified island for more than a month, supported by a network of bunkers and tunnels and hidden artillery positions.

From Feb. 19, 1945, over 500 warships and 1,000 warplanes from the U.S. navy and army pounded Iwo Jima so heavily that the shelling and bombing changed the shape of the island's highest point, Mount Suribachi, located at its southern tip.

White phosphorus was used in the pre-invasion bombardment and U.S. troops wielded flame-throwers during the battle.

Mount Suribachi was captured on Feb. 23. A photograph of six U.S. marines raising a U.S. flag on the mountain, the second flag-raising that day, was taken by Associated Press photographer Joe Rosenthal and won the Pulitzer Prize for Photography that year. It later formed the subject for the Marine Corps War Memorial in Arlington, Virginia.

Iwo Jima reverted from U.S. to Japanese rule in 1968 and since then has housed about 400 Japanese navy and air force personnel who operate a landing strip. The runway is also used for night-landing practice by a Japan-based U.S. aircraft carrier.

Joint U.S.-Japan memorial services to mark the anniversary of the battle are held every year. In 1994, then Japanese Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko attended the service, the first time a Japanese emperor had visited the island.

The Palestinian Prime Minister lashed out Sunday at U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal to end the Mideast conflict, saying it would be “buried very soon.” Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, Mohammad Shtayyeh said the U.S. plan was “no more than a memo of understanding between (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu and Trump.”

Mr. Shtayyeh criticised the fact that the proposal would leave a future Palestinian state fragmented and with “no sovereignty,” allowing Israel to annex large parts of the West Bank.

He urged other countries to reject the Trump proposal while maintaining that Palestinians “are open to serious negotiations.”

Mr. Shtayyeh suggested the Palestinians would seek to increase pressure on Israel through international organisations, citing the recent release by the UN human rights office of a list of more than 100 companies allegedly complicit in violating Palestinian human rights by operating in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank.

Referring to the upcoming Israeli election, Mr. Shtayyeh said the difference between Israeli opposition leader Benny Gantz and Netanyahu was “not more than the difference between Coca-Cola and Pepsi Cola.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/h2e5hu/article30684540.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ISRAEL-PALESTINIANSPLAN-PROTESTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trumps-mideast-plan-will-be-buried-palestinian-pm/article30839433.ece

A massacre in an anglophone region of Cameroon left up to 22 villagers dead including 14 children, the UN said, with an opposition party blaming the killings on the army.

Armed men carried out the bloodshed on Friday in the village of Ntumbo in the Northwest region, James Nunan, a local official of humanitarian coordination agency OCHA, told AFP on Sunday.

“Up to 22 civilians were killed, including a pregnant woman and several children,” Mr. Nunan said, adding that 14 children under age 18 -- including nine under age five -- were among the dead.

Eleven of the children were girls, said Mr. Nunan, head of OCHA’s office for the Northwest and Southwest regions, which are home to the West African country’s large English-speaking minority.

Separatists in the regions have been fighting the central government for three years.

The Movement for the Rebirth of Cameroon, one of the country’s two main opposition parties, issued a statement saying: “The dictatorial regime (and) the supreme head of the security and defence forces are chiefly responsible for these crimes.” A key figure in the separatist movement, lawyer Agbor Mballa, in a Facebook post also accused “state defence forces” of carrying out the killings.

The three-year conflict between anglophone forces seeking to break away from French-speaking Cameroon has claimed more than 3,000 lives and forced more than 700,000 people to flee their homes.

The hacker group called OurMine, that last month defaced social media accounts of the National Football League (NFL) and 15 of its teams, hijacked accounts for both the Olympics and FC Barcelona teams on Saturday.

According to Engadget, Twitter confirmed the hacking, saying OurMine used a “third-party platform” to take control of the accounts.

Twitter locked down the affected accounts and was “working closely” with partners to restore them.

The International Olympic Committee said it was “investigating a potential breach” while FC Barcelona said it would run a “cybersecurity audit.”

OurMine is believed to be based in Saudi Arabia and defaced social media accounts of the NFL, the 49ers, Cardinals, Bears, Bills, Broncos, Browns, Bucs, Cowboys, Colts, Chiefs, Eagles, Giants, Packers, Texans, and Vikings last month.

Most of the tweets posted by the OurMine hackers came from Khoros — a web service used by digital marketing and PR departments to manage social media accounts, and is connected to a social media account as a third-party app.

OurMine has been involved in high-profile hacking in the past, including breaking into social media accounts of celebrities such as Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and Google CEO Sundar Pichai, to name a few.

The group has been active since 2016 and is believed to consist of several Saudi teenagers.

Earlier this month, the official Twitter accounts of Facebook and its messaging app Messenger were hacked by the same group of hackers

“Hi, we are O u r M i n e. Well, even Facebook is hackable but at least their security better than Twitter,” posted the hackers.

In a statement here, a Facebook spokesperson said: “Some of our corporate social accounts were briefly hacked but we have secured and restored access.”",internet,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/9mv37j/article30840012.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17NETTWITTERANDLOGO,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/twitter-accounts-of-olympics-fc-barcelona-hacked/article30840013.ece
49,2020/02/17,Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg calls for regulating harmful online content,"Speaking at the Munich Security Conference in Germany on Saturday, Mark Zuckerberg said that media companies need more guidance and regulation from governments

Calling for the regulation of harmful online content, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has pitched for a legal framework that encourages “democratic and open values” to control social media platforms.

Speaking at the Munich Security Conference in Germany on Saturday, he said that social media companies need more guidance and regulation from governments.

“I do think that there should be regulation on harmful content ... there’s a question about which framework you use for this,” Zuckerberg told the gathering.

“Even if I’m not going to agree with every regulation in the near term, I do think it’s going to be the thing that helps create trust and better governance of the internet and will benefit everyone, including us over the long term,” Zuckerberg added.

“In the absence of that kind of regulation, we will continue doing our best, we are going to build up the muscle to do it, to basically find stuff as pro-actively as possible”.

Facebook and its family of apps, including WhatsApp, are facing intense scrutiny from governments and regulators over the spread of false and misleading information.

Zuckerberg suggested a mix of existing rules for telecoms and media industries to regulate social media, reports Al Jazeera.

“Right now, there are two frameworks that I think people have for existing industries — there’s like newspapers and existing media, and then there’s the telco-type model, which is ‘the data just flows through you’, but you’re not going to hold a telco responsible if someone says something harmful on a phone line,” the Facebook CEO argued. “I actually think where we should be is somewhere in between.”

Several U.S. lawmakers and former Facebook employees have called for breaking-up the social networking giant with nearly 2.5 billion users to control it better.

Zuckerberg said Facebook has employed 35,000 people to review online content and implement security measures.

“Our budget is bigger today than the whole revenue of the company when we went public in 2012, when we had a billion users,” he said.

In a New Year message, Zuckerberg called for new ways for communities to govern themselves and legitimate regulation around elections, harmful content, privacy, and data portability in the new decade.

One of the big questions for the next decade is: how should we govern the large new digital communities that the internet has enabled?

“One way to address this is through regulation. As long as our governments are seen as legitimate, rules established through a democratic process could add more legitimacy and trust than rules defined by companies alone,” said Zuckerberg.",internet,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/723xhf/article30839923.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17NETMARKZUCKERBERG,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/facebook-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-calls-for-regulating-harmful-online-content/article30839924.ece
50,2020/02/17,Shankar Ehsaan Loy hold Chennai ‘Breathless’ at The Shakti Foundation’s annual concert,"Good-natured ribbing and stage-to-audience jugalbandis marked Shankar Ehsaan Loy’s return to The Shakti Foundation’s annual concert

There are a few fundamental truths we learn as we move along in life. One of them, as the audience at The Music Academy learnt over the weekend, is that you don’t attend a Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy concert sitting down.

Music composer trio Shankar Mahadevan, Ehsaan Noorani and Loy Mendonsa performed at The Shakti Foundation’s Gurucarana concert, which marked 30 years of the NGO’s work in catering to the medical needs of people with physical or financial challenges in the rural sector.

Every year in February, The Shakti Foundation holds a fundraiser concert with musical greats. For Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy, this association with the foundation is a long-standing one. Incidentally, this year is an important one for the trio too — this is its 25th year in the music industry.

At the Gurucarana concert, Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy played its crowd-favourites, starting with the piano solo of ‘Kal Ho Na Ho’.

Loy’s delicately wistful tune has become a pop culture staple, heard everywhere from toy cell phones and cars reversing to wedding receptions and amateur keyboard players playing with one index finger.

Thereon, the trio moved on to groovier numbers including ‘Rock On’, ‘Pretty Woman’, ‘Senorita’, ‘Mast Magan’ and of course, ‘Breathless’, prompting the audience to get up and dance. Enthused, an elderly lady got up as well, hobbled up to the front rows, and danced with her walker as a prop.

While the chemistry between the trio needs no description, it is the chemistry between Shankar and the audience that always stands out. Talented musicians can seem imposing, creating a divide of respect between the stage and the listeners. But Shankar Mahadevan is a performer through and through, making the 1,000-plus-seater hall of The Music Academy seem like an intimate house party.

He invited the audience to sing with him, creating a jugalbandi with them, challenging them to keep up with him as he unleashed harkat after harkat during his rendition of ‘Locha e Ulfat’. He responded in good humour to what would seem like heckles in more serious performances. In fact, he did not shy away from some good-natured ribbing from his side, either. “I find that the energy level of the audience is inversely proportional to the amount of money they have paid for the seats,” he remarked, teasing the VIP section of the audience to cheers from the back.

Well-meaning bonds

This stage presence is perhaps what makes them returning invitees at The Shakti Foundation, combined with their mutual passion for doing their bit for people in need of medical help.

“Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy have never said no to us,” said Vasanth Raghuvir, chairman of the foundation and organiser of this event. “When celebrities like them speak for us, it gives our cause a lot of credibility.”

The Shakti Foundation was established in 1992 by Vasanth’s son, Velan Raghuvir. After Velan lost his life to Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy in 1998, his parents decided to continue his work, raising awareness about the needs of people with conditions similar to Velan’s. From there, they moved on to helping the rural sector with medical challenges, identifying Adhiparasakthi Medical and Research Hospital as a means for this.

While Shankar is generally the mouthpiece for the trio, the reticent Loy, called upon to speak about their association, summed it up with an aptly pithy, “It is not what you say, it is what you do.”

The trio left the audience to a standing ovation, but not before performing Vishwaroopam’s ‘Unnai Kaanadhu’.

As Ehsaan had put it in an earlier interview to MetroPlus, “It is not possible for Shankar to come to Chennai and leave without performing his Tamil songs.”",entertainment,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/4nkxr8/article30842679.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SHANKAREHSAANLOY3,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/shankar-ehsaan-loy-at-the-shakti-foundations-annual-concert/article30842680.ece
51,2020/02/17,Chennai’s Kannagi Nagar becomes India’s fifth art district sporting murals by 16 artists,"St+art India makes a Chennai debut by transforming Kannagi Nagar, home to 80,000 people, into a public art destination

It is a bright, sunny Sunday. A boisterous group of children in Kannagi Nagar hops on a refurbished cycle cart, christened ‘Neelam’ —— painted only hours ago in shades of blue — and sets off on a celebratory ride.

The cart, filled with freshly opened cans of paint and brushes of all sizes, clatters with its noisy passengers to an abandoned concrete foundation with grey pillars. The little aspiring artists station themselves in front of each of the pillars, ready to go. Before long, quick, if admittedly amateur, strokes of red, yellow, blue and red fill the otherwise dull vertical facades — transforming them into a colourful collage.





For the past few weeks, Chennai’s Kannagi Nagar, home to 80,000 people, has been abuzz with activity. Large red cranes with umbrellas, cans of paint, artists in harnesses have occupied parallel roads, lined with identical multi-storied apartments. One of India’s largest resettlements, the area includes people rehabilitated from three river beds — Cooum, Adyar and the Buckingham Canal — as well as a few slums in the city.

By March, Kannagi Nagar will be India’s fifth art district, with 16 of its walls sporting large scale murals by national and international artists.

To actualise this, St+art India Foundation which is also behind the Lodhi art district in Delhi, has collaborated with Asian Paints, Greater Chennai Corporation and Chennai Smart City Limited, as well as foreign consulates, to bring art to these streets and engage with the community.

By converting the location into an open air museum, St+art aims to reimagine what a space for arts and culture could be like and later activate it by hosting events and festivals.

Karan Kaul, assistant curator, St+art India Foundation, says, “St+art came together in 2014 as a platform to promote street art in India, because alternate platforms for contemporary art did not exist. We wanted to take contemporary art out of the gallery spaces to the streets.” The team is currently functioning out of an abandoned police station in Kannagi Nagar.

After multiple site visits across the city, Kannagi Nagar was chosen for its diverse population, and detachment from the city’s urban fabric. “It has also been, let’s say, a very neglected place in the city. The idea is to energize the physical ecosystem of the space as well,” says Karan.

Hues of hope

At first, the mural that welcomes one into Kannagi Nagar titled The New Door, appears to be a medley of gradients. However, on walking closer, one realises that each block of colour has been patterned with a different motif. Spanish muralist Antonyo Marest’s quick strokes lent to only three days of work.

The mural is a burst of colour. Geometrical shapes filled with yellows, reds and blues are inspired by the colours of India, he says.

Opposite a new police station stand two mammoth walls, dotted by windows and corridors. Two smiles in monotone, awash with innocent joy, occupy one.

A-Kill, the creator, is lending it finishing touches — spraying grey strokes diagonally as he speaks. “I work with nothing but the environment around me, which is why the portraits.” A Chennai-based muralist, A-Kill uses a technique of doodling onto the wall, to understand the scale and superimposes his mural on the doodles. On this wall, the doodle included names of the children in the locality. “While I was doodling, a little girl came and asked us if we could include her name.” This helped A-Kill and his assisting artist Jayalakshmi, engage with the children. Not surprisingly, the subjects of his mural are also children; inspired from his street photography.

The second wall portrays a woman with a powerful gaze, the marine world within the grasp of her palm. In vibrant colours of green, orange and blue, its bold and defining strokes pay tribute to the fisherfolk of Chennai, especially the women, says its creator Delhi-based Osheen Shiva.

“The sea and the people of Chennai have a symbiotic relationship. Especially the women, who also look after the business side of the activity,” continues Osheen adding that the letters in Tamil, done by artist Raghupathy, translates to ‘providers and protectors’.

Adjacent to these, is Australian artist Bronte Naylor’s wall. As she stands atop the crane, under an umbrella, a woman from the apartment passes her tea from one of the windows. “I have also made friends with baby goats here,” she laughs.

Her mural-in-the-making is inspired by scenes from Koyambedu flower market. “What I witnessed there was a warm, community feeling. There are lots of microbusinesses and active purchasing, which translates to a rich, active culture,” says the artist, who will adapt a photograph she clicked at the market over the next few days.

A little away from this network of walls, stands the first completed work by Bengaluru-based Kashmira Sarode. Titled Harbouring Hope, Kashmira’s mural is dedicated to the inhabitants of the area who had to move after the devastating tsunami of 2004. She presents a mother-daughter duo, amidst waves, looking upwards, surrounded by iris flowers — emblematic of hope.

For the community

At any given point, a crowd of curious spectators surround the artists. The streets are lively in the evenings, when children come running after school to track the progress of each painting, and maybe even display some skills of their own.

But what does the art mean to them? Karan says, “Though environment is an overarching discussion in this, the onus is not just to do with the idea of keeping one’s surroundings clean, but also to get more intuitive and conscious of what you are surrounded by.”

One of the themes of the project is to understand the idea of migration, and what it really means to regenerate an identity and look at what the city is, as a collective unit.

Karan continues, “We are looking at this project to examine how urban art can regenerate a space completely by changing its mood. And most importantly, by changing the connotations that people from outside have about this neighbourhood.”",entertainment,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/ob9m1z/article30841760.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17MPARTPAINTING,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/chennais-kannagi-nagar-becomes-indias-fifth-art-district-sporting-murals-by-16-artists/article30841766.ece
52,2020/02/17,Keep checking your phone even when with others? You are guilty of phubbing,"Phubbing has become notoriously real, snatching away our ability to be in the present

A portmanteau, or mash-up in millennial-speak, of phone and snubbing: when you are on your phone while in the company of others, whether it is at a party or during a chat with your kids or spouse. But it is not just ruining relationships and causing disconnection, it’s also creating havoc with your own levels of concentration and communication.

The term was coined in May 2012 by linguists invited by Australia’s Macquarie Dictionary and the McCann advertising agency to discuss a phenomenon common in the times of smartphone usage. Between then and now, phubbing has become notoriously real, snatching away our ability to be present.

A ‘stop phubbing’ campaign that was launched soon after, failed to make an impact.

“Phubbing is like opium of the people now,” says Dr Kersi Chavda, Consultant Psychiatrist, Hinduja National Hospital, Mumbai. Why do we constantly scroll through our phones instead of talking to colleagues, friends and family? Many of us phub without even knowing it is both impolite and harmful. A 2016 study published in the Journal of Applied Social Psychology reported that 17% of mobile users in the US phub others at least four times a day and 32% felt they were being phubbed twice or thrice a day. A 2018 Indian study, published in the Journal of Family and Community Medicine, found that the prevalence of phubbing was 49.3%. The reasons, it said, were internet and smartphone addiction, the fear of missing out, and the lack of self-control.

Dr Rahul Bagle, a psychiatrist with Columbia Asia Hospital, Pune, talks about phubbing ruining the very core of belongingness, meaningful existence, self-esteem and control. “It is a sad situation that we are constantly checking our phones for updates and notifications at the cost of our inter-personal relationships. We are stalling conversations, losing productive work hours, getting lower marital satisfaction and slipping into depression,” he says. Inter-personal communication means eye contact and complete concentration on the conversation.

Chavda says phubbing becomes a vicious cycle, because people who are phubbed may get more aggressive taking out their own phones, in order to fill the void. While unlearning a behaviour is not easy, the first step is to acknowledge that a number of us do it and to understand the reason why.

53,2020/02/17,"From the soil, for the soil: Padma Shri awardee Chintala Venkat Reddy","Padma Shri awardee Chintala Venkat Reddy draws upon his experience to find indigenous solutions to soil problems and shares it zealously with farmers

It is sunny in Hyderabad. Yet the breeze on your skin feels a few degrees cooler than in other parts of the city. Standing in a grape farm in Keesara, all I could wish for was a hammock and some wine; nothing that would disturb the peace and silence. Chintala Venkat Reddy, the owner of the grape farm spread over several acres and a Padma Shri awardee this year for his natural innovation techniques in farming, says, “Come in March and pluck grapes; you will witness grape harvesting.”

Born into a farmer’s family in Alwal, Secunderabad, Chintala Venkat Reddy, or CVR as he is fondly addressed in the farmer community, always knew he would take up farming after completing his studies. Even as a child, he had been inquisitive about farming, he recollects.

He is thrilled to have received the honour of course, but his excitement knows no bounds when he gets an opportunity to discuss his theories on farming. “Padma Shri award has come now, but I get awards every day in the form of messages from farmers who share their success stories after using my ideas and methods of farming. I have close to 35 farmer groups from across the country where farmers discuss and share their queries with me,” he smiles.

His theories appeal to farmers because his premise is ‘the solution of the soil is from the soil’. The 69-year-old farmer elaborates. “Don’t we all know when there is a problem in a domestic set up, the solution lies in the family itself? Similarly, when the yield from the soil is not satisfactory, it is the soil that has a problem, so that has the solution as well. Over the years, farmers fell prey to the use and subsequent overuse of pesticides in the hope of increasing crop yield, reducing crop damage by pests etc. I always say ‘look for the solution within’. That is what I did, of course, after falling prey to modern methods and failing miserably. When we introduce foreign agents to our crop in the form of chemicals, we are not just harming the environment, eventually, we also consume all those chemicals.”

Chintala Venkat Reddy at his vineyard in Keesara, the wheat cultivation with

Though his followers fondly address him as a ‘scientist’ on Whatsapp, CVR insists he is only a farmer. “I am a farmer, so I must know the soil and learn from my surroundings. Have you ever wondered why we get the distinct fragrance of earth only during the first spell of rain? I believe it is because the soil takes nutrients from the sun and the environment, and the rainwater acts as the final ingredient to make the soil richer,” he smiles.

Methods and techniques

After successfully experimenting with his methods and technique by growing wheat, paddy, maize, sugarcane, vegetables, and other variety of seeds, CVR became the key contributor to the National Seed Corporation (NSC) for almost 10 years.

What makes CVR’s methods unique is the intelligent combination of modern and indigenous practices that were born from his own ideas and experiences.

Citing an example of one of his experiments, CVR says “Insects attack plants, fruits and flowers because they can prey on them. Have we ever heard of insects attacking roots? Rarely. Also consider this: as children we ate mud. Animals too lick soil, but all of it is excreted from the body. That means there is a mechanism in our body that takes care of soil/mud when ingested. That mechanism is the liver and lungs to expel dust that we may inhale. So I turned to Google on my smartphone to see whether insects have a liver. Turns out that they don’t! From then I experimented by spraying light muddy water (made by mixing subsoil with water) on my plants. In two days, the insects died and my grape plants showed considerable growth. After I was convinced about my finding, I used it on other crops with equally good results.”

HYDERABAD, 25/02/2008: Chintala Venkat Reddy, a commercial cultivator resting under his vineyard in Alwal. He created a record by allowing weeds to grow all over the cropped area to increase productivity. He resorted to the age old practice of crop diversification.

Apart from spraying the muddy water, the organic farmer also sets aside the topsoil to dry in sunlight, and gradually transferred to the soil of other crops periodically, to replenish it. “I was the one to introduce drip irrigation, organic practices in growing grapes, soil and leaf petiole analysis-based nutrition, late pruning techniques and weather-based disease and pest management in grapes production,” he adds.

Now, many grape growers follow his advice to tackle diseases, pest attacks and for better management of soil health, pruning, training young grape plants etc.

CVR has many patents under his name; he has now applied for a patent on a technology that can naturally boost Vitamin D in rice and wheat. Giving me a tour of his wheat farm, CVR shows the crops that are in the milk seed state. “These are all naturally enriched with Vitamin D. If farmers can adopt my technology imagine how the future generations will benefit, without depending on Vit D medicines and fortified foods. After I get the patent, I will make it free for all to use, like all my other methods. I believe in sharing to help the country and farmers benefit.”",society,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/9qa4ho/article30840872.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy17CVR2,https://www.thehindu.com/society/padma-shri-awardee-chintala-venkat-reddy-keesara/article30840873.ece
54,2020/02/17,Avani Rai’s photographs portray real stories of pain and conflict,"Heart-breaking frames

Avani Rai’s memories of the worst industrial disasters that struck Bhopal are through her father Raghu Rai’s images. She had been to the city but never photographed and in October 2019, she got an opportunity to visit the Chingari Trust (founded by Rashida Bee and Champa Devi Shukla, gas survivors and also recipient of the Goldman Environmental Prize in 2004) in Bhopal. Rashida and Champa have been working for the congenitally disabled children born in the same families affected by the tragedy and the subsequent water contamination. “It’s not about the victims who inhaled less gas and dying slow death, but the next generation of children being born with distorted limbs, damaged brains and incurable disabilities,” she says. Avani’s haunting and heart-breaking photographs from this week-long trip to Bhopal and from her Kashmir visits were on display at Goethe Zentrum.

The frames present a heart-rending stories of how the children have been affected by the aftermath of the deadly site. Avani reveals the affected families are paid between ₹600 and ₹1200 (maximum a family can get). “We never want to go back in the past and introspect. These children cannot look into your eyes, cannot talk, eat on their own or cannot sit up because their spinal cord is damaged; They are almost vegetables. These families are very poor and ₹600 is not a compensation that one can give. The mothers cannot work or do anything else except take care of the child.”

Her trip to Bhopal was part of an assignment to photograph the Chingari rehabilitation centre. Everyday she would visit the factories to know the cityscape of Bhopal and the gas leaks and also bastis to visit the families. “I wanted to go to homes to understand the kind of spaces they were living in and their economic background and the kind of families they belong to . I also went to Sambhavna Clinic started by one of the victims. These real stories of Bhopal will shock the world and there are people who are alive to tell the facts.”

Avani was in Delhi photographing the protests, election and the results.

Referring to the protests, she says “We are seeing something like this for the first time. It is inspiring to see how people have come together to stand for what they believed.” She was in Shaheen Bagh on Day 2 of the protest with a couple of friends from Reuters and New York Times. “I was there even when there was no shamiana.”

Finally, is there any pressure of being Raghu Rai’s daughter? Admitting she initially was nervous, she says “There is no pressure anymore. I have a brain and agar pressure hota toh stupid photo keenchungi. I am happy without the pressure and he (Raghu Rai) is also proud that I am going to shoot. He doesn’t say ‘Wow you have arrived’ but speaks of an image and an experience.”",society,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/4su8cr/article30840719.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hym14photo,https://www.thehindu.com/society/avani-rais-photographs-on-bhopal-and-kashmir-portray-the-real-stories-of-pain-and-conflict/article30840720.ece

The fiscal deficit mentioned in the budget proposal 2020-21 was ‘absolutely realistic’ in terms of the scope of revenue generation, scope of investments and projection for economic growth and consumption, said Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.

Addressing a media conference here on Friday, the Minister said, “We have been absolutely realistic with all the figures, that we can spend or borrow, presented in the budget. A fiscal deficit target of 3.5% for next fiscal is the real picture.”

On inflation, she said the government was hopeful. She cited the case of seasonal, perishable commodities which make up a significant size in the basket; except for seasonal fluctuation, prices of most goods, particularly food products, have been kept well within acceptable norms, she said.

Responding to a query on relief for telecom companies, Ms Sitharaman said the Telecom Ministry would decide on the payment of adjusted gross revenue (AGR) arrears by defaulting telecom firms, as recently directed by the Supreme Court. “The concerned Ministry has been engaging with telecom players since the court's ruling. I will wait to hear the Telecom Ministry’s decision.”

It may be recalled that Justice Arun Mishra-led bench on February 14 ordered Airtel and Vodafone Idea to pay their AGR dues immediately to avoid contempt of court.

The Shapoorji Pallonji Mistry Group (SP Group), which owns 18.32% in Tata Sons Ltd., has filed a limited cross appeal in the Supreme Court arguing that it deserved a more incisive and relevant relief from the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) order, including a proportionate representation on the board of Tata Sons.

An SP Group spokesperson confirmed the development, but refused to divulge further details. A copy of the appeals reviewed by The Hindu essentially argues that the NCLAT had arrived at a clear and unequivocal finding of prejudicial conduct by the majority shareholders of Tata Sons, but failed to provide certain important reliefs that would have put an end to the oppressive conduct of the majority.

The appeals seek proportionate representation on the Board of Tata Sons to ensure that its interests and investments, now worth over ₹1 lakh crore, were protected in future. The prime driver of the appeals is to secure deletion of certain specific provisions in the Articles of Association of Tata Sons.

The SP Group also prayed ‘to delete the necessity of affirmative vote in the hands of select directors under Article 121 that enables them to override the views of the entire board of directors or alternatively the requirement of an affirmative vote conferred on directors nominated under Article 104B should be restricted to matters covered by Article 121A and such rights be extended to the majority directors of the appellants group as appointed under (i) above.”

A Tata Sons spokesperson declined to offer any comment. The appellants argued that while the manifest abuse of power and conduct lacking in probity had been explicitly found by the NCLAT in the manner of the removal of Cyrus Mistry, reinstatement in office was not sought.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/se1790/article30845202.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH18BUCYRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/business/sp-group-wants-presence-in-tata-board/article30845203.ece

The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal on Monday allowed JSW Steel to acquire of Bhushan Power & Steel Ltd for ₹19,700 crore by providing it immunity from prosecution by Enforcement Directorate.

A two-member bench headed by Chairman Justice S.J. Mukhopadhaya, said that JSW Steel will be immune from the acts done by the former promoters of Bhushan Power & Steel Ltd (BPSL).

However, it also said that prosecution against the former promoters under the money laundering act by the Enforcement Directorate can continue.

It has also rejected the petitions filed by operational creditors, seeking higher claims.

The Bench said that the EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) earned by BPSL during its Corporate Insolvency resolution period will be given to JSW Steel.

On October 10, the ED had attached assets worth over ₹4,025 crore of debt-ridden BPSL in connection with its money laundering probe linked to an alleged bank loan fraud by its former promoters.

JSW Steel, which emerged as the successful resolution applicant with its ₹19,700 crore bid for BPSL, filed an appeal against the ED’s move before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT).

The appellate tribunal had on October 14 directed the ED to immediately release the confiscated assets of BPSL in favour of the resolution professional of the debt-ridden firm.

While the ED was of the opinion that it can attach the property of BPSL under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), the ministry of corporate affairs has been maintaining that the ED cannot do so as the proceedings under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code was going on.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/i3cqrt/article30840607.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/GAVEL,https://www.thehindu.com/business/nclat-allows-jsw-steel-to-acquire-bhushan-power/article30840608.ece
61,2020/02/17,"General Motors to wind down Australia, NZ operations, sell Thai plant to Great Wall","With the proposed sale of its Thailand plant to Great Wall, GM is giving up an opening to expand its operations in Southeast Asia.

General Motors Co is retreating from more markets outside of the United States and China, saying on Sunday that it will wind down sales, design and engineering operations in Australia and New Zealand and retire the Holden brand by 2021.

It also said China's Great Wall Motor Co Ltd had agreed to buy GM's Thailand car manufacturing plant and an engine factory, a transaction expected to be completed by the end of 2020.

In rearranging its global operations, GM is accelerating its retreat from unprofitable markets, becoming more dependent on the United States, China, Latin America and South Korea.

GM Chief Financial Officer Dhivya Suryadevara told analysts during a Feb. 5 presentation that restructuring GM's international operations outside of China so they produce profit margins in the mid-single digits “does represent a $2 billion improvement” compared with 2018's.

Ahead of that presentation, GM forecast flat profit for 2020 and reported a better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings in the face of a $3.6 billion hit from a 40-day United Auto Workers strike.

With the proposed sale of its Thailand plant to Great Wall, GM is giving up an opening to expand its operations in Southeast Asia.

GM is “focusing on markets where we have the right strategies to drive robust returns, and prioritizing global investments that will drive growth in the future of mobility,” especially in electric and autonomous vehicles, GM Chair and CEO Mary Barra said in a statement.

The changes will lead to cash and non-cash charges of $1.1 billion, as well as the loss of 1,500 jobs in Thailand and 828 in Australia and New Zealand, GM said.

Barra has prioritized profit margins over sales volume and global presence since taking over in 2014.

In 2017, Barra sold GM's European Opel and Vauxhall businesses to Peugeot SA and exited South Africa and other African markets.

Since then, Barra has decided to pull GM out of Vietnam, Indonesia and India. Great Wall agreed in January to buy a GM vehicle plant in India, a transaction expected to be completed by the second half of 2020.

Like Britain, Australia and New Zealand are right-hand drive markets. With sales of GM's Australian Holden brand plummeting, the company could not justify the investment to continue building right-hand drive vehicles, GM President Mark Reuss said in Sunday's statement.

GREAT WALL GOING ABROAD

Great Wall, one of China's biggest sport-utility vehicle makers, said it will sell cars from the Thai manufacturing plant in Thailand, other ASEAN bloc countries and Australia as it seeks global expansion amid a slowing domestic market.

“Such an acquisition could give Great Wall quick access to the ASEAN market, and Thailand is a good choice for its production base amid the country's established supply chain in the automotive industry,” Shi Ji, analyst at Haitong Internation told Reuters.

The firm, which is building a car plant with BMW, sold 1.06 million cars last year, including 65,175 units for export.

“There is no choice, if we don't go global, we will not survive,” Wei Jianjun, chairman of the Baoding-based automaker, said last year when Great Wall opened its first full assembly plant in Russia.

In January, Great Wall signed an agreement to buy GM's car plant in India. The companies said they expected the transaction would be completed by the second half of 2020.

Great Wall rival Geely is also looking to to expand its car sales across the ASEAN region with Malaysia-based brand Proton.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/uak5km/article24160822.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/GENERALMOTORS,https://www.thehindu.com/business/general-motors-to-wind-down-australia-nz-operations-sell-thai-plant-to-great-wall/article30840047.ece

Telecom services providers including Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and Tata Group on Monday cumulatively deposited ₹14,697 crore as part payment of their adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues with the Department of Telecommunications (DoT). While Bharti Airtel paid ₹10,000 crore, Vodafone Idea remitted ₹2,500 crore and the Tata Group deposited ₹2,197 crore.

Also read | A royal mess: on the turmoil in telecom industry

Additionally, Vodafone Idea committed to pay another ₹1,000 crore by the end of this week.

The payments follow last week’s Supreme Court order that asked the managing directors and directors of the companies to show cause why contempt proceedings should not be initiated against them for failing to pay even a “single penny” to the government despite an October 2019 court judgement.

Bharti Airtel, in a letter to the DoT, said that the ₹10,000 crore had been paid on behalf of Bharti Airtel Limited, Bharti Hexacom Limited and Telenor.

The company added that it was in the process of completing a self assessment exercise expeditiously and would make the balance payment upon completion of the same, before the next date of hearing in the Supreme Court.

The next hearing is slated for March 17, 2020.

In a filing to the stock exchanges, Vodafone Idea said its Board had met on Monday to take stock of the assessment made by the company on the amount that could be paid immediately towards compliance with the Supreme Court order.

“Based on the overall review of the position, the Board has authorised the Company to immediately pay to DoT a portion of the dues calculated based on AGR, aggregating to a sum of ₹2,500 crore today and a further ₹1,000 crore before the end of the week,” the company said.

The Board would take further stock of the situation to see how additional payments could be made, Vodafone Idea said.

“An urgent oral application made this morning before the Hon’ble Supreme Court for directions to be issued to the DoT to not take any coercive steps for recovery of AGR dues was not entertained by the Hon’ble Court,” it added.

Tata payment

Meanwhile, in a statement, Tata Teleservices said, “Tata Teleservices Limited (TTSL) and Tata Teleservices (Maharashtra) Limited (TTML) have made a payment of ₹2,197 crore... to the DoT towards License Fees and Spectrum Usage Charges.”

It added that TTSL and TTML had also submitted to DoT the details of calculations in support of the payment.

As per the DoT’s assessment, Bharti Airtel’s liabilities for licence fee and spectrum usage charge stand at about ₹35,586 crore, while that of Vodafone Idea and Tata Teleservices are about ₹53,000 crore and ₹13,823 crore, respectively.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/w89rbi/article30846122.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-TELECOM-AIRTEL-REUTERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/after-scs-rap-telcos-pay-14697-crore-to-dot/article30845839.ece
64,2020/02/17,Supreme Court begins hearing on religious rights,"‘Law can regulate offerings at religious places if used for terrorism, casinos’

A nine-judge Bench of the Supreme Court on Monday observed that making offerings at places of worship may be a religious practice, but the law can regulate the money donated at such places if it is used for “terrorism” or “running casinos.”

The top court said the old practices of “human sacrifices” and ‘sati’ amounted to murder under law and could not be saved on ground of “essential religious practice.”

The Constitution Bench, headed by Chief Justice S.A. Bobde, made these observations as it commenced hearing to deliberate upon the issues pertaining to the scope of freedom of religion as also of judicial scrutiny into “essential religious practices” of separate “religious denominations.”

The Bench is also examining the issue whether a person, who does not belong to a particular faith, can file a PIL petition questioning the religious practice of another religion or sect of a religion.

The questions have arisen out of a judgment in the Sabarimala case.

“The IPC can be read as the guard against the practice of human sacrifices, because it is murder under the IPC. Likewise ‘sati’ also amounted to murder ... Even a religious aspect can be the subject matter of reform,” said the Bench, which also included Justices R. Banumathi, Ashok Bhushan, L. Nageswara Rao, M.M. Shantanagoudar, S.A. Nazeer, R. Subhash Reddy, B.R. Gavai and Surya Kant.

Examining the scope of judicial power in religious matters, it gave illustration of practice of giving offerings or money in temples and said they were part of religious practices.

“But if money is being used for terrorism or for running a casino etc. then this is secular part of the religion and can be regulated by the law,” it said. It also said financial activities of a religious trust pertaining to “donations, hygiene and health” can be regulated by laws.

“Even if there is an essential religious practice, it can be regulated if it affects the three grounds [public order, morality and health] in Article 26,” Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said while initiating submissions on behalf of the Centre.

“This is the hallmark of our Constitution,” the Bench said, while giving examples of practices of “human sacrifices” and ‘sati’ being held illegal.

Mr. Mehta referred to Articles 25 and 26 and said all persons have freedom of religion “subject to public order, morality and health” and every “religious denomination” shall have the right to establish, own, maintain and manage religious institutions.

“Defining ‘religious denomination’ would be the most crucial part during the course of this hearing,”, he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/823wrv/article30845661.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18TH-SABARI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/court-begins-hearing-on-religious-rights/article30845662.ece

The Supreme Court on Monday asked the government why it was “holding back” recommendations for appointments to various High Courts even after reiteration by the Collegium.

“Once the Supreme Court Collegium reiterates the name of a candidate for appointment, then you [government] cannot hold back... Why are you keeping these recommendations pending? Why don’t you accept them? It is the law,” Justice K.M. Joseph told Attorney General K.K. Venugopal, for the Centre.

Also Read Former Supreme Court judge Kurian Joseph regrets his decision quashing National Judicial Appointments Commission

The Bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Justice Joseph was conveying its alarm at the rising number of vacancies in various High Courts. Some of these courts are functioning only with half their sanctioned judicial strength. On an average, they suffer at least 40% vacancies.

Mr. Venugopal defended saying the collegium delays the appointment process quite as the government. The government’s delay is largely because it thoroughly combs the antecedents of the candidate, leaving no room for error. The process, on an average, takes at least 127 days.

On the other hand, the judiciary takes 119 days on an average merely to forward the file to the government. Mr. Venugopal challenged the Bench to issue formal notice to the various High Courts to explain the delay. He said some courts like Allahabad and Andhra take over 45 and 50 months to even report a vacancy. The appointment of Justice P.V. Kunhikrishnan of the Kerala High Court took two years to come through.

Mr. Venugopal referred to how the Collegium system was put to an end through the National Judicial Appointments Commission to make the appointments process transparent and participatory, only to be thrust out by the Supreme Court.

“We had brought a perfectly fine Constitutional Amendment [NJAC]... We can perhaps bring another amendment,” Mr. Venugopal told the court.

Justice Joseph replied that “You or I cannot re-open that [NJAC] issue.”

Noting that there are a 199 vacancies in the High Courts, Justice Kaul said the efforts should be made to kick-start the appointments process to the courts early.

“Now it is six months before a judge, it should be made even a year before the retirement. Some internal arrangement should be devised... Appointment process should be continuous. Now it is like by the time one set of vacancies is filled, another lot arises and neutralises the process,” Justice Kaul observed.

“Have the Law Commission of India to conduct an elaborate study and suggest solutions,” Mr. Venugopal submitted.

“But the post of the Chairman of the Law Commission is itself lying vacant, is it not?” Justice Kaul asked Mr. Venugopal.

The court ordered the Registrar Generals of all the High Courts to submit reports of the pending judicial vacancies and likely ones in the future within four weeks.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/5vs2im/article30845599.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18TH-COURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/why-delay-appointments-asks-supreme-court/article30845600.ece
66,2020/02/17,"Permanent commission to women officers: BJP, Congress argue over affidavit","They blame each other for filing affidavit in Supreme Court against permanent commission

The Supreme Court order on permanent commission to all women officers on Monday triggered a political war of words between the Congress and the BJP, with former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi accusing the Centre of disrespecting women by arguing against permanent commission for women.

In a tweet, Mr. Gandhi said, “The government disrespected every Indian woman by arguing in the SC that women Army officers didn’t deserve command posts or permanent service because they were inferior to men. I congratulate the women for standing up and proving the BJP government wrong.”

BJP MP Meenakshi Lekhi, who was the advocate for the women officers, strongly rebutted Mr. Gandhi’s claim and pointed out that it was the Congress-led UPA government in July 2010 that had gone in appeal to the Supreme Court against a High Court order that had favoured permanent commission for women.

“In July 2012, they [the Union government] had filed an additional affidavit, citing various reasons and grounds, why the order be declined...I want to tell Mr. Rahul Gandhi that he better be aware what exactly has transpired,” said Ms. Lekhi.

Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, in a series of tweets, put out the the Modi government’s record in inducting women in the armed forces.

“As of June 2019, women were inducted in all branches of the IAF, with terms and conditions for women officers being issued from time to time. GoI is working to strengthen the ‘Stree Shakti’ in our Armed Forces and we stand committed to move forward in this direction,” he said on twitter.

“Before 2016, women made up just 2.5% of the armed forces, working in mainly non-combat roles. As of Jan 2019, 3.89% of the army personnel comprised women, while 6.7% of the Navy and 13.28% of the Air Force personnel were women as of June 2019,” he said.

Welcoming the judgment, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra described it as ‘historic’ and one that gave new flight to women.

“Women are capable — in the Army, in valour, in water, land and sky. This is a befitting reply to the prejudiced Modi government, which is opposed to women’s power,” she tweeted in Hindi.

CPI(M) politburo member Brinda Karat said, “We really welcome the judgment. For so many years, women in the defence forces have been fighting for their constitutional right to equality. Now the Supreme Court has upheld that right.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bjp-congress-argue-over-affidavit/article30845552.ece
67,2020/02/17,"SC verdict on permanent commission to women officers: A blow to stereotypical mindset, says lawyer","SC verdict ensures greater roles commensurate with individual merit and aptitude of women officers, she says.

The Supreme Court verdict on Monday granting permanent commission (PC) and command positions for women officers is a watershed moment and success “against stereotypical mindset and attitude,” said Aishwarya Bhati, senior advocate and a counsel representing the officers.

Defence sources said PC had already been granted to women officers in many areas and the verdict was for those who joined the service before it was given. “We respect the court ruling,” a senior defence source said.

Also read: Women-at-arms | on SC order on permanent commission to women officers

“Women have been in the Army since 1992, so to deny PC to existing officers and command positions to all of them betrays the constitutional guarantee and also contrary to their demonstrable impeccable service record for the last 27-28 years,” Ms. Bhati said.

Terming it an important milestone in the evolution of women in the armed forces, Ms. Bhati said one interesting observation by the apex court was “they junked the argument of domestic duties, motherhood, biological requirements of women and will ensure greater gender justice and gender dignity in all walks of life”.

Women are already performing combat roles in the IAF, Ms. Bhati said and added this verdict “will ensure greater roles commensurate with their individual merit and aptitude”.

One officer part of the case but did not wish to be identified as she was serving welcomed the judgment but said they were yet to study the details. “We hope it is implemented quickly,” she said.

Army officials declined to comment saying they were yet to study it. A defence source said it’s a misnomer to call command positions in general as there were criteria and non-criteria appointments in all arms and services. Also some criteria appointments were in the field and some were not.

“It is a non-issue. To get criteria appointments we first had to get PC. That is now settled,” the official said adding now women officers would get criteria appointments if they meet the requirements. There are four factors considered while choosing officers for criteria appointments — leadership, performance, qualification and medical fitness, the official said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/2h2xn9/article30845460.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH18Aishwarya-Bhati,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/supreme-court-verdict-on-women-in-armed-forces-a-blow-to-stereotypical-mindset-says-lawyer/article30845462.ece
68,2020/02/17,FATF to review Pakistan status today,"Officials and diplomats say the task force is likely to retain the grey list status with a ‘stern warning’

As officials from the International Cooperation Review Group (ICRG) of the 39-member Financial Action Task Force (FATF) meet in Paris on Tuesday to discuss the risk rating for Pakistan and Iran, India plans to raise the repeated “politicisation” of the process by Pakistan, which is aiming to avoid being “blacklisted” by the group for its actions on countering terrorism.

In particular, Indian officials are expected to point to statements by the leaders of Turkey and Malaysia, who have gone public on their plans to back Pakistan, instead of going by the regulations of the FATF that evaluates countries on the basis of technical parameters and maintains confidential proceedings.

Also read: India ticks off Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for his remarks on Kashmir

In the past two weeks, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammad and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan have issued statements promising to support Pakistan at the FATF, as well as on Kashmir.

The External Affairs Ministry issued sharp responses to both statements, in addition to issuing the Turkish Ambassador to India a “strong demarche” on Monday over the references to India’s “internal affairs”.

Asked about India’s plans to raise the issue at the FATF, however, the Ministry declined to comment. “It is for the FATF to decide,” said an official, adding that the government “would not like to comment on FATF deliberations”.

Black and grey: On terror funding and Pakistan

In the past, the FATF had taken strong exception to public statements and “politicisation” of its processes.

Decision on Friday

The decision of the FATF’s plenary session (February 16-21) on whether to retain Pakistan on its “greylist” of countries of concern, downgrade it to its ‘blacklist’ for non-compliance, or let it off for progress shown, will be finalised on Friday at the end of the session.

At the last meeting of the Asia Pacific Group in Beijing last November, Pakistan had been judged as having cleared 14 of the 27-point action plan checklist it was given by the group on countering terror financing and black money laundering.

India hopes to highlight the unfinished items on Pakistan’s agenda, as well as the government’s claimed inability to track UN Security Council-designated terrorists like Jaish e Mohammad chief Masood Azhar and 26/11 LeT operations chief Zaki Ur Rahman Lakhvi as India seeks to push for more stringent action against Pakistan.

However, officials and diplomats aware of the process said it was more likely that Pakistan would be retained on the “greylist” for the moment with a “stern warning” rather than being moved to the blacklist during this round at the FATF, for a number of reasons.

To begin with, there is a general perception that, albeit on paper, Pakistan does appear to have made some positive moves on the FATF’s demands, including amending its laws and a crackdown on bank accounts and premises of terror groups such as the LeT/JuD and JeM.

After a visit to Islamabad in January, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia Alice Wells said the U.S. had “been pleased to see progress by Pakistan towards fulfilling FATF obligations”.

Saeed issue

Pakistan will seek to highlight the Pakistani court’s recent conviction and sentencing of LeT chief Hafiz Saeed for terror financing, although the appeals process will continue. As the U.S. and allies inch closer to a peace deal with the Taliban at the end of the month, they are likely to depend on Pakistan to help guarantee the deal, and may hold off pushing Pakistan to the blacklist.

Finally, say officials, the FATF works on a system of “consensus” and three countries, China, Turkey and Malaysia, are expected to veto an attempt to blacklist Pakistan at this juncture.

New Delhi’s own tensions with Turkey and Malaysia over their statements on Kashmir post-Article 370 have made that task more challenging, the officials conceded.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/xmovnm/article30845258.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH18HAFIZSAEED,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/fatf-to-review-pakistan-status-today/article30845259.ece

Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat on Monday said that on occasions when Mahatma Gandhi’s experiments with protests and agitations went wrong, he used to “take responsibilty and make amends”, unlike in present times when no one stepped forward to do so.

In what is being seen as an oblique reference to protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the violence, Mr. Bhagwat said “people are beaten, get bullets and go to court but who comes forward and takes responsibility for such an agitation today?”

Mr. Bhagwat was speaking at the launch of book Gandhiji Ko Samajhney Ka Sahi Samay by former National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) chief J S Rajput at Gandhi Smriti in New Delhi.

Therefore, he stuck to his faith and advocated respect for other faiths as well”.

Mr. Bhagwat stated that 20 years ago he used to say that the India of Gandhi’s dreams was yet to be formed but expressed “full faith in the youth of today to realise the dream of Gandhi’s India.” Development and its conception should be humanitarian and calculated to benefit the last man in the line. “Gandhiji always looked at India from an Indian perspective”.

The Congress on Monday welcomed the Supreme Court verdict on leadership roles for women in the armed forces, with Rahul Gandhi alleging that the BJP government disrespected Indian women by arguing in court that they did not deserve command posts as they were inferior to men.

It termed the verdict a “victory” for every citizen who believes in equality bereft of sexes and a “defeat and rejection” of the Narendra Modi government and its “myopic thinking and thought process dating back to the 17th century”.

While Mr. Gandhi lauded the women for standing up and proving the government wrong, Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said the verdict has opened new vistas and new doors to India’s daughters and urged Prime Minister Modi to not wait for three months and implement it immediately.

Their attack on the BJP government came after the Supreme Court opened the way for women in command positions in the Army and directed the Centre to grant permanent commission to all women officers within three months, while calling for an end to gender bias in the armed forces.

“The government disrespected every Indian woman, by arguing in the SC that women Army officers didn’t deserve command posts or permanent service because they were inferior to men,” Mr. Gandhi said on Twitter. He also attached to his tweet a news report of the apex court’s judgment in the matter.

At a press conference, Mr. Surjewala said, “The Congress welcomes the path-breaking and the historic judgment of the Supreme Court of India today ensuring complete equality giving permanent commission, combat role and a right to lead men and women in the Army to India’s daughters.”

“This is a victory for every citizen of this country who believes in equality bereft of sexes. This is a defeat of the Modi government and its myopic thinking and thought process whereby it argued before the Supreme Court that men and women cannot be equal for combat roles, saying women are physically inferior,” he said.

Mr. Surjewala said the government’s argument that women have to cater to their household duties and which is why they are not fit for command and combat roles in the Army and that male sepoys and jawans will never accept leadership of women in the Army and armed forces are “myopic, backward 17th century arguments of BJP that were rejected”.

Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also tweeted saying the “landmark” judgment of the Supreme Court has given new wings of flight to women of the country.

“Women are capable – in the Army, in valour and in water, land and the sky. This is befitting reply to the Modi government which is prejudiced against and opposed to the women power in the country,” she tweeted in Hindi.

Mr. Surjewala said the historic verdict has opened the doors for the country’s daughters to one more field in serving Mother India, and playing equal role in the armed forces.

“It [SC judment] is a defeat for every such political or other force which seeks to distinguish between men and women presuming that women are inferior to men or have a second class status to men as was being argued by the Modi government in the court,” he said.

The Congress leader said though the Supreme Court has given three months to the Centre to implement the verdict, “we urge upon the Prime Minister to not wait for three months and immediately implement this verdict”.

A Bench headed by Justice D.Y. Chandrachud termed “disturbing” the government’s argument of physiological limitations and social norms for denying women officers command posts and said they had brought laurels to the country in the past.

Marking a milestone on the road to gender parity in the Army, the apex court Bench called for a change of mindset on the part of the government to put an end to gender bias in the armed forces and said there will be no absolute bar on giving women command postings.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/isb60n/article30843921.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/armywomen,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bjp-disrespected-women-by-arguing-they-dont-deserve-command-posts-in-army-rahul-gandhi/article30843835.ece

Sibashis Nayak, a young software engineer hailing from Odisha’s Berhampur, is stranded on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, now quarantined off Yokohoma along the coast of Japan due to the threat of infection from the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus outbreak.

Mr. Nayak has been in touch with his family and friends in Berhampur on social media, sharing his harrowing experience over the past weeks. Has has been requesting the Indian government to take steps to evacuate Indians to their home country, as the United States has done.

Living with fear

According to Mr. Nayak, a routine check has proved that he has not been infected by the virus till now. He is living in fear that, with time, all the people on board the ship may become infected.

Over WhatsApp messages to this reporter, Mr. Nayak said that, from Tuesday onward, all the passengers and crew members of the cruise liner will be again tested for SARS-CoV-2 by Japanese health authorities.

There are 138 Indians on board the ship, including six passengers and 131 crew members.

Mr. Nayak said five of his colleagues are also on board the ship. They are employees of a software firm in the Gurgaon area in New Delhi.

On January 10, Mr. Nayak and his colleagues travelled to Malaysia by plane on official work for their company. From there, they travelled to Vietnam and boarded the Diamond Princess from Vietnam’s ChinMay Bay.

The cruise ship was quarantined after one person who disembarked in Hong Kong on January 25 tested positive for COVID-19.

Remains confined

For the past three weeks, Mr. Nayak has remained confined to his cabin. His colleagues also prefer isolation. Food has been a major problem for Indian passengers as mostly non-vegetarian food was being served. Mr. Nayak alleged that plates were often not being washed properly, due to which he has stopped taking normal meals. Added to it, he fears that the virus may be contracted through the consumption of meat.

“I only prefer to eat hot noodles or fruits as precaution,” he said. He buys his noodles and fruits from a shop on cruise liner, when he comes out of his room for few minutes everyday, also to spend 10-20 minutes on the open deck.

According to Mr. Nayak, close contact with other persons has been discouraged.

The Indian Embassy in Japan has reported that four of the Indian crew members had tested positive for the COVID-19 coronavirus, and are responding well to medical attention onshore. In the last two days, 137 new cases of COVID-19 infection have been found on the ship.

73,2020/02/17,"Over 3,000 trains cancelled in 2019 due to maintenance work on railway network: RTI reply","This indicates that the Railways has undertaken large-scale repair and development projects, officials said

Over 3,000 trains were cancelled last year due to maintenance work on the Indian Railways network, the highest since 2014, the national transporter said in response to an RTI query.

“This indicates that the Railways has undertaken large-scale repair and development projects, which when completed will make the network more modern and safe,” a Railway official said.

In 2014, 101 trains were cancelled due to maintenance work. The number increased to 829 in 2017 and 2,867 in 2018. In 2019, 3,146 trains were cancelled because of maintenance work, the Railways stated in its reply.

The RTI was filed by Chandra Shekhar Gaur from Madhya Pradesh.

Between January 1 and September 30 last year, 2,251 trains were cancelled and from October 1 to December 31 last year, 895 trains were cancelled due to maintenance works, as per the reply.

In 2019, the Railways completed seven of the 58 super-critical projects underway on congested routes. One of these projects was finished in 2018, officials said. The remaining 50 will be completed by March 2022, they said.

“The ongoing large-scale works on the railway network has resulted in cancellations and a delay of trains. But these are essential works which have been pending for a long time. Though it may be inconvenient for passengers, this is a burden we all have to bear if track renewal and other maintenance work has to be done,” an official said.

The official said the Railways has planned to complete electrification of its network by December 2023. It has also set a target to complete all the sanctioned works for gauge conversion by December 2023 and the doubling of routes by March 2024, they said.

Maintenance include the upgrading of of platforms, yard lines and tracks. Poor maintenance of tracks and pending track works are the major reasons for train accidents.

Over 50% of the accidents in the last five years were due to derailments. The Railways is in the process of expanding capacity and modernising infrastructure, officials said.

The budget has allocated ₹12,000 crore to build new rail tracks in 2020-21, up from ₹7,881 crore in FY20. As much as ₹8,461 crore was spent for track renewals this fiscal, which will rise to ₹10,599 crore in 2020-21.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/iynj16/article30774246.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08bg-mys-pit-liG8P73E2SA3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/over-3000-trains-cancelled-in-2019-due-to-maintenance-work-on-railway-network-rti-reply/article30843500.ece
74,2020/02/17,Digital process fulfills “Haj dream” of Indian Muslims: Abbas Naqvi,"The Union Minister for Minority Affairs said that India has become the first country to make the entire Haj process 100% digital.

The digital/online Haj process has fulfilled the dream of “Ease of doing Haj” for the Indian Muslims, Union Minister for Minority Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said in Mumbai on Monday.

Addressing a training programme of Haj 2020 trainers at Haj House in south Mumbai, Mr. Naqvi said the unprecedented reforms undertaken by the Modi government ensured that the entire Haj process has been made digital and transparent and the Haj pilgrimage has become affordable.

Making the Haj process 100% digital/online has removed middlemen, ensuring that Haj pilgrimage becomes affordable in comparison to the cost incurred in the past several decades, he said.

Even after removal of Haj subsidy, no additional financial burden has been put on the pilgrims, Mr. Naqvi said.

India has become the first country to make the entire Haj 2020 process 100% digital, he said.

Online application, e-visa, Haj mobile app, E-MASIHA health facility, E-luggage pre-tagging, providing information in India itself regarding accommodation/transportation in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina have been provided to Indian Muslims going for Haj, he said.

For the first time, facilities have been provided for digital pre-tagging of baggages of Haj pilgrims, he said.

Linking SIM card to the mobile app ensures Haj pilgrims immediately get the latest information regarding Haj in Mecca-Medina on their mobile phone, he said.

Haj Group Organisers (HGOs) have also been connected with the 100% digital system which has ensured transparency in their functioning and this has also led to better facilities to Indian Haj pilgrims.

A portal (http://haj.nic.in/pto) for Haj Group Organisers has been developed. It contains details of HGOs and their packages, he said.

India in coordination with Saudi Arabia is working to ensure safety and better medical facilities for the pilgrims during Haj 2020, he said. This year, a total of two lakh Indian Muslims will perform Haj, that too without any subsidy, he said.

About 1.23 lakh Muslims will go through Haj Committee of India and remaining through Haj Group Organisers, he said. This year over 2,100 Muslim women will go to Haj without Mehram (male companion), he said.

A total of 650 trainers participated in the training programme. They will train Haj pilgrims in their respective States regarding the pilgrimage, accommodation in Mecca and Medina, transport, health facilities and safety measures.

The trainers include a large number of women trainers.

Police on Monday arrested four persons, including the principal of a Gujarat college where authorities allegedly forced over 60 girls to remove their undergarments to check if they were menstruating a week ago, an official said.

The arrests were made after the Bhuj police filed an FIR against them for the February 11 incident at Shree Sahajanand Girls Institute (SSGI) which caused public outrage.

Principal Rita Raninga, girls’ hostel rector Ramilaben Hirani, college peon Naina Gorasiya and one Anita Chauhan were arrested. “We on Monday arrested all the four accused named in the FIR,” Inspector P.H. Langdhirka said.

All convicts “to be hanged by the neck until they are dead on March 3, at 6 a.m.,” it said.

The order was passed by Additional Sessions Judge Dharmender Rana pursuant to pleas by Tihar Jail and the victim’s parents, seeking issuance of a fresh date to hang them.

This is the third time the court is issuing death warrants against Mukesh Kumar Singh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Vinay Kumar Sharma (26) and Akshay Kumar (31). The trial court had issued the first death warrants for January 22, which was later postponed to February 1.

During the hearing on Monday, the court discharged advocate Vrinda Grover as counsel for Mukesh after he asked for a change of his advocate. It then appointed legal aid counsel advocate Ravi Qazi to represent him.

Mr. Qazi, who is already representing Pawan, said Pawan wanted to move curative and mercy petitions.

The court was also informed by convict Akshay’s counsel that in his earlier mercy petition, due to poverty and ignorance, the complete facts could not be brought before the President of India.

Counsel informed that convict Akshay had prepared a fresh mercy petition and the same would be moved before the President soon.

The victim’s parents and Tihar Jail moved the application after the Supreme Court granted liberty to the authorities to approach the trial court for issuance of a fresh date for the convicts' execution.

Except Pawan, all others had exhausted the legal remedies available to file a curative petition before the Supreme Court. The President has also rejected the mercy pleas of Singh, Kumar and Sharma.

78,2020/02/17,"Protest, but don't block roads, SC tells Shaheen Bagh protesters","Bench appoints senior advocate Sanjay Hegde as an interlocutor to convey court’s apprehension to the protesters

The Supreme Court on Monday upheld the fundamental right of mothers, children and ordinary people of Shaheen Bagh and Delhi to protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) even as it expressed concern over their blocking public areas like roads to voice their discontent.

“Democracy works on different views. We have no quibble on that. You want to protest, no problem. You don't want to wait for our judgment on the validity of CAA but want to have a social build-up against the legislation, we have no problem... We do not mind if a 1000 sites are created, but our limited concern is whether you could protest without blocking roads and entering public areas... With every right there comes a responsibility too,"" Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul observed.

The court appointed senior advocate Sanjay Hegde to act as an interlocutor along with advocate Sadhana Ramachandran to convey the court's apprehension to the protestors and suggest them to move to an area where they could continue with the protests but not inconvenience public movement. The court left it to Mr. Hegde to approach former bureaucrat Wajahat Habibullah to join them in the talks.

“My colleague Sadhana Ramachandran and I accept the responsibility laced upon us by the Supreme Court. We will be meeting all parties with a view to assisting them to resolve their issues in a manner that respects and safeguards both the right to protest and requirements of orderly civic life,” Mr. Hegde later said in a statement to the media.

During the hearing, Justice K.M. Joseph, on the Bench, stressed that the “right to protest is recognised all over the world. We have a fundamental right to assemble. The right is only subject to security and public order"".

Justice Joseph was responding to submissions mad by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Delhi Police, that children and women are used as a “shield” by the protestors.

The court made it clear that it was not going to interfere or curtail the right to protest of ordinary people. It said it was only worried whether “tomorrow someone else may try to emulate the Shaheen Bagh protesters and block another portion of an already congested Delhi”.

“You [Shaheen Bagh protesters] may have genuine concerns, but if everybody starts blocking roads and entering public areas... where will it end? It may create a chaotic situation,” Justice Kaul said

He also spoke of the possibility of another section of people “who may be not on the same page as you may get an idea to start a protest somewhere else... Then where do we end?”

Alternative sites

The court asked Mr. Mehta to suggest alternative sites for the protesters. But Mr. Mehta objected, saying that it was for the protesters to find an alternative spot.

“But the right to protest in a democracy is a fundamental right...” Justice Joseph reiterated.

Referring to the appointment of an interlocutor and future talks with protesters, Mr. Mehta said these efforts from the court should not be seen by the protesters as “every institution kneeling” to them.

“We have taken it upon ourselves to dissolve this issue now. Why did you not meet them for the past 68 days of their protest then” Justice Joseph asked Mr. Mehta.

The law officer said efforts were made through local residents, religious leaders, etc, but to no avail.

“I always believe that the inner strength of the people will see help them see reason. For now, we have expressed our opinion. If nothing works out, then we will leave it to the authorities...”, Justice Kaul said.

The case was posted for further hearing on February 24.

The hearing is based on a petition filed by advocate Amit Sahni, seeking a direction to forcibly remove the peaceful protesters. Mr. Sahni said the protest hampered the lives of ordinary commuters.

The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has seized gold bars and jewellery weighing 26.97 kg, 12.22 kg of silver and ₹3.75 crore in foreign and Indian currency from Jaipur, Kolkata and Chennai.

The operation was carried out under the Foreign Exchange Management Act.

The searches were based on an input that Maharaja Jewellers, Bhagwati Jewellers and Ladiwala Associates of Jaipur were purchasing smuggled gold bars from Harsh Bothra of Chennai and Banka Bullions Private Limited, said the agency.

Maharaja Jewellers’ proprietor is Tara Chand Soni, Bhagwati Jewellers is owned by Ram Gopal Soni and Ladiwala Associates by Honey Ladiwala, it said.

As it turned out, various individuals were involved in smuggling of high-purity gold bars and, after passing through various entities, they were being sent to Jaipur mainly via Kolkata.

The smugglers would remove engraving/embossing of foreign manufacturers on gold bars before bringing them to India using various modes of transportation. Jewellery made using the smuggled gold and proceeds generated through its sale would never be accounted for.

The funds for gold smuggling were transferred through the “hawala” agents.

A total of 68 Air India crew members, who were part of the two special flights that evacuated 647 Indians and seven Maldivians from coronavirus-hit Chinese city of Wuhan, were handed over letters of appreciation signed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday. Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri handed over the letters of appreciation to each crew member in a ceremony held here.

Air India conducted its first special flight to Wuhan on January 31 using jumbo B747 plane, evacuating 324 Indians.

In its second special flight on February 1, the national carrier used another B747 plane, evacuating 323 Indians and seven Maldivians from Wuhan in China.

“Today’s gathering is unique in many respects. At the least, it represents a template and a new high in professionalism. It presents a very good standard for entities that are commercial in nature but are dedicated to the country.

“Air India has always been a first class asset. Today, it is an airline which goes 42 international destinations and 82 domestic destinations...but more important than that, Air India represents quality and excellence,” Puri said.

The Centre has initiated the process to sell-off Air India, which incurred a loss of over ₹8,000 crore in 2018-19.

Why is it that the ones who run the airlines find it difficult to make money, he asked, adding that airlines all over the world have a greater propensity to run into financial problems.

Rajeev Bansal, Chairman and Managing Director, Air India, said,”Air India is a national carrier and serving for the national cause is not something new for it. It is in its DNA.”

“It was a commendable job. I would obviously commend Captain Amitabh Singh who is in charge of operations at Air India,” he added.

He said while 68 persons have received letters of appreciation from the Prime Minister, there were many others who contributed to the Wuhan evacuation.

Ashwani Lohani, who retired as Air India CMD last Friday, said when the names of crew members were shortlisted, not even one of them came forward and say that we would not go.

81,2020/02/17,Turkey making repeated bids to justify Pakistan’s cross-border terror: India,"Monday’s statement is unusually strong and comes a day after the MEA urged Turkey to avoid interfering in domestic affairs of India.

Turkey is trying to justify Pakistan's cross-border terrorism in Kashmir, India said on Monday.

Official spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) Raveesh Kumar issued a scathing comment saying President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's latest statement on the Indian territory during his trip to Pakistan reflected a narrow-minded view that would have “strong implications” for India-Turkey ties.

“This recent episode is but one more example of a pattern of Turkey interfering in the internal affairs of other countries. India finds that completely unacceptable. We particularly reject the repeated attempts by Turkey to justify the cross-border terrorism practised so blatantly by Pakistan”, Mr. Kumar said. He announced that a “strong demarche” on the matter was made to the Ambassador of Turkey earlier on Monday by Secretary in charge of Western affairs Vikas Swarup.

President Erdogan had described the situation in Kashmir as an outcome of “unilateral” actions by India. He also expressed support for the Kashmiri people and expressed solidarity with Pakistan's position on the issue.

The MEA's Monday statement is unusually strong and comes a day after it urged Turkey to avoid interfering in domestic affairs of India.

“These remarks reflect neither an understanding of history nor of the conduct of diplomacy. They distort events of the past to advance a narrow minded view of the present”, said Mr. Kumar. He reiterated India's rejection of President Erdogan's comments on Kashmir and warned, “These developments have strong implications for our bilateral relationship”.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/59jfc0/article30693019.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RAVEESHKUMAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/turkey-making-repeated-bids-to-justify-pakistans-cross-border-terror-india/article30841325.ece
82,2020/02/17,British MP who leads parliamentary group on Kashmir denied entry to India,"Labour MP says she was ‘treated like criminal’

A Labour MP from the United Kingdom was deported to Dubai as she was found not in possession of a valid Indian visa, sources said on Monday.

Debbie Abrahams, leader of the U.K. Parliament’s All Party Parliamentary Group for Kashmir, said she was “treated like a criminal” at the airport here before being placed on a flight out of India.

Explanation sought

“Along with everyone else, I presented myself at the immigration desk, with my documents, including my e-visa, had my photograph taken and then the official looked at his screen and started shaking his head. Then he told me my visa was rejected,” said Ms. Abrahams, who sought an explanation from the Indian immigration authorities for revocation of her Indian visa that was issued in October 2019 and was valid for one year. “Why did the Indian government revoke my visa after it was granted?” asked Ms. Abrahams.

Commenting on social media, the British MP wanted to know why Indian officials did not issue a “visa on arrival” if the immigration authorities found the issued visa was invalid. “Is it because I have been critical of the Indian government on Kashmir human rights issues?” she asked.

An official source, however, maintained that Ms. Abrahams was “not in possession of a valid visa to visit India” and therefore was denied entry.

It is understood that the U.K. High Commission here reached out to the MP during her few hours stay at the Indira Gandhi International Airport and has taken up the matter at the bilateral level.

Reason not clear

“We are in contact with the Indian authorities to understand why Deborah Abrahams, MP, was denied entry to India. We provided consular assistance to her while she was in New Delhi airport,” said a British High Commission spokesperson. It is still not clear why the Labour MP’s visa was revoked.

As the chairperson of the All Party Parliamentary Group for Kashmir, Ms. Abraham convened meetings on the human rights situation in Jammu and Kashmir as well as on the India-Pakistan conflict.

She has been consistent in demanding direct access to the ground realities in Jammu and Kashmir and in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. She has been a critic of the Narendra Modi government’s decision to end the special status of Jammu and Kashmir.

83,2020/02/17,"Peninsular command by next year end, theatre commands by 2022: Gen. Rawat","Jammu and Kashmir will be a separate theatre command, says Chief of Defence Staff

Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat on Monday spelled out a road map for restructuring the Armed Forces that would holistically counter threats along the borders with China and Pakistan as waell as in the Indian Ocean, backed by logistical agreements with other countries.

General Rawat said that an Indian Ocean-centered Peninsular Command, possibly formed by merging the Eastern and Western Naval Commands, should start shaping up by the end of next year.

“Security of peninsular India should be the responsibility of one Commander. Can we integrate the Eastern and Western Naval Commands and call it Peninsular Command? We will be issuing study directives for the Peninsular Command by March 31,” Gen. Rawat said in an interaction with mediapersons here on Monday.

The study will look at earmarking some assets of the Army and the Indian Air Force (IAF) for deployment under the Peninsular Command. Currently, the Western Naval Command, based in Mumbai, focuses on the western seaboard, while the Eastern Command keeps vigil over the Bay of Bengal zone till the Malacca Straits.

Gen. Rawat pointed out that the Chief of Naval Staff must look at the “big picture”, and stressed that the “Indian Ocean region is one entity”. He added that military diplomacy also must be prioritised — an observation that coincided with the departure of the Naval Chief, Admiral Karambir Singh, to Myanmar on Monday.

Gen. Rawat said India has signed several logistics agreements with a number of countries, which should be leveraged for operational turnaround. “We will work with other Navies to see how we can work with them...for logistical support,” he observed.

Beginning with the logistics agreement with the U.S. in 2016, India has signed several such pacts, which are administrative arrangements for fuel and supplies, including with France, Oman and South Korea among others, and several more are under discussion.

The CDS also spotlighted the importance of upgrading airstrips on the islands in the Andaman and Nicobar chain as static bases. Elaborating on tri-service theatre commands, General Rawat said that one or two theatre commands will man the border with China. With Pakistan as the focus on the western front, Gen. Rawat said, “Jammu and Kashmir should be a separate theatre, including the IB (International Boundary) part. Balance of Western theatre is another command.”

Referring to timelines for the formation of the theatre commands, the Air Defence Command (ADC) would be the first off the block. It is likely to be formed next year, based an on-going study by by the Vice Chief of the IAF, which would be competed by March 31.

By the year-end, instructions would be issued for a three-month study of other theatre commands. “By 2021, complete the study and start giving directives. Hope to start theatrisation by 2022,” Gen. Rawat stated.

The CDS clarified that the Navy should focus on submarines, and a third aircraft carrier was not an immediate priority. In response to a question on the IAF’s tender for 114 fighter jets, Gen. Rawat said, “It has to be staggered.”

He added that the government was not inclined to look at single big-ticket purchases. “I feel you should never go in for large numbers in one go,” Gen. Rawat said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/wiwz1c/article30638777.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy24gretaMPGAGNV7114O73jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/peninsular-command-by-next-year-end-theatre-commands-by-2022-gen-rawat/article30840974.ece
84,2020/02/17,Two killed as under-construction bridge collapses at Farakka barrage in West Bengal,"A girder being installed between two pillars came down while seven persons were working at the site

Two persons were killed and three injured when an under-construction bridge on Farakka barrage collapsed in Baishnabnagar area of West Bengal’s Malda district on Sunday night.

Seven persons were working at the site when a girder which was being installed between two pillars came down.

National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) has given contracts to some agencies for the construction of the 1.5 km bridge on the Ganga, parallel to National Highway 34. Work for construction of the bridge, aimed at decongesting the national highway, started in January 2019 and was likely to be completed by the year end.

The deceased were identified as engineer Srinivas Rao, a resident of Andhra Pradesh, and Sachin Pratap, a construction worker from Delhi. The injured has been admitted to Malda Medical College and Hospital. One construction worker is critical and has been put on life support. Superintendent of Police, Malda, Alok Rajoria said that two persons had died and three were injured in the incident. He said that parallel investigations would be carried out by the NHAI authorities and the police.

Centre blamed

The incident has sparked a political war of words with the Trinamool Congress and Congress targeting the Centre and the agencies responsible for construction of the bridge.

Trinamool Congress leader from Malda Krishnendu Narayan Chowdhury alleged irregularities in the bridge construction by the agencies and said “cut money” was changing hands. Leader of the Congress in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury demanded a probe and suitable compensation for the families of the dead.

Malda BJP MP Khagen Murmu said that those found responsible for the lapse would not be spared.

Bengal BJP chief Dilip Ghosh said the Centre should look into the accident and take action against the construction agency.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/uydime/article30840654.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/samplefullview,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/two-killed-as-under-construction-bridge-collapses-at-farakka-barrage-in-west-bengal/article30840655.ece
85,2020/02/17,Zojila tunnel may undergo design changes: Gadkari,"PM Modi had in May 2018 laid the foundation stone for the ₹6,800 crore project, billed as the Asia’s longest bi-directional tunnel, in Jammu and Kashmir

The strategic Zojila tunnel for all-year connectivity between Leh and Srinagar may undergo some design changes to prevent cost escalation as the government plans to complete the project at the earlier estimated cost of about ₹6,800 crore, Union minister Nitin Gadkari said.

The tunnel project, stalled for about six years, holds strategic significance as Zojila Pass is situated at an altitude of 11,578 feet on the Srinagar-Kargil-Leh National highway and remains closed during winters due to heavy snowfall, cutting off Ladakh region from Kashmir.

“We are planning to make some design changes that may include doing away with escape tunnel and instead (have) alternative tunnels to cross from one side to the other as it will be my endeavour to prevent cost escalation and build it at the previous estimated cost of ₹6,800 crore,” Road Transport and Highways Minister Gadkari told PTI.

Though the revised project cost estimate of a little over ₹8,000 crore has been sent to the Cabinet, “we are deliberating on minor design changes to prevent cost escalation,” the minister said.

“Besides the escape tunnel, we can do away with vertical shafts not compromising with safety,” he said, adding that rebidding for the project was expected in a month or two.

Financial problems

Prime Minister Narendra Modi had in May 2018 laid the foundation stone for the ₹6,800 crore project, billed as the Asia’s longest bi-directional tunnel, in Jammu and Kashmir.

However, barely months after the foundation, the National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd (NHIDCL) on January 15, 2019 terminated the contract awarded to troubled IL&FS group company IL&FS Transportation after it abandoned the project citing financial problems.

“The project which was earlier constructed on hybrid annuity mode will now be converted into EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) mode,” Gadkari said.

The cancellation of the award in January last year was the second time NHIDCL had scrapped the contract for the 14.15-km tunnel project which would cut down the 3.5-hour long drive through the mountainous Zojila Pass to just 15 minutes. The corporation had earlier cancelled the bid of IRB Infrastructure. IL&FS Transportation in 2017 emerged as the lowest bidder in the rebidding process.

Unveiling a plaque for commencement of work for the tunnel, Modi had said, “Zojila tunnel is not a mere tunnel but a modern day marvel.”

The Cabinet on January 3, 2018 had approved the Zojila tunnel project with Parallel Escape (Egress) tunnel between Baltal and Minamarg on the Srinagar-Leh section of NH-1A at a total cost of ₹6,800 crore. The project was expected to be completed in seven years.

On March 1, 2016, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways had ordered “re-bidding” for the project, which had been awarded to IRB Infrastructure. The decision was taken at a high-level meeting, chaired by Gadkari, after Congress leader Digvijay Singh had alleged that guidelines were violated while awarding the contract. The original plans of the tunnel included fully transverse ventilation system, uninterrupted power supply (UPS), tunnel emergency lighting, CCTV monitoring, variable message signs (VMS), traffic logging equipment, overheight vehicle detection and tunnel radio system.

Besides, it included pedestrian cross passages at every 250 metres and motorable cross passages and lay-bys at every 750 metres, as well as emergency telephones and fire-fighting cabinets at every 125 metres.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/vekqa/article30840485.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PTI5192018000144B,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/zojila-tunnel-may-undergo-design-changes-gadkari/article30840486.ece
86,2020/02/17,India among countries whose actions compliant with Paris Agreement goal: PM,"He said the number of protected areas increased from 714 in 2014 to 870 in 2019.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday asserted that his government firmly believes in the path of sustainable development and said it is ensuring that development happens without harming the environment.

He also said that India is one of the few countries whose actions are compliant with the Paris Agreement goal of keeping rise in temperature to below two degrees Celsius.

Addressing the 13th Conference of Parties (COP) of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) at Gandhinagar via video, he said India has been championing climate action based on values of conservation, sustainable lifestyle and green development model.

“My government firmly believes in the path of sustainable development. We are ensuring that development happens without harming the environment,” Modi said. He added that India has been traditionally practising the mantra of Athithi Devo Bhava .

“This has been reflected in the slogan theme for the CMS COP 13 — ‘Migratory species connect the planet and together we welcome them home’,” he said.

India proposes to strengthen its association with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and East Asia Summit countries. This would be in sync with the Indo Pacific Ocean Initiative (IPOI), wherein New Delhi will be playing a leadership role, PM Modi said.

He also said that India will hold presidency of the Convention for coming three years and has prepared national action plan to conserve migratory birds along the ‘Central Asian Flyway.’ Several protected areas in country share common boundaries with other nations, he pointed out pitching for cooperation in conservation of wildlife would lead to positive outcomes.

The number of protected areas increased from 714 in 2014 to 870 in 2019, PM Modi said, adding the range of “our initiatives include ambitious target of 450 MW renewable energy, smart cities and conservation of water.”

“For ages, conservation of wildlife and habitats has been a part of the cultural ethos of India, which encourages compassion and co-existence ...India is one of the most diverse countries of the world. With 2.4 % of world’s land area, it contributes about 8% of the known global biodiversity,” PM Modi noted.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/6r859i/article30840326.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MODIK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-among-countries-whose-actions-compliant-with-paris-agreement-goal-pm/article30840325.ece
87,2020/02/17,"Women Army officers eligible for permanent commission, rules SC","Justice Chandrachud dismisses as a ‘stereotype’ government’s view that women are physiologically weaker than men.

The Supreme Court on Monday dismissed the Union government’s submissions that women are physiologically weaker than men as a “sex stereotype” and declared that Short Service Commission (SSC) women officers are eligible for permanent commission and command posts in the Army irrespective of their years of service.

“Women officers of the Indian Army have brought laurels to the force… Their track record of service to the nation is beyond reproach. To cast aspersion on their abilities on the ground of gender is an affront not only to their dignity as women but to the dignity of the members of the Indian Army – men and women – who serve as equal citizens in a common mission. The time has come for a realisation that women officers in the Army are not adjuncts to a male dominated establishment whose presence must be ‘tolerated’ within narrow confines,” a Bench of Justices D.Y. Chandrachud and Hemant Gupta observed in a 54-page judgment.

The verdict came on a nearly 10-year-old appeal filed by the government against a March 12, 2010 decision of the Delhi High Court to grant SSC women officers permanent commission. The Supreme Court ordered the government to implement its judgment in three months.

The order castigated the government for submitting a note containing written submissions portraying women as physiologically unfit for answering the “call beyond duty” of the Army. The note had shown women officers in a poor light, saying isolation and hardships would eat into their resolve and that they would have to heed to the call of pregnancy, childbirth and family. The note had mentioned that women ran the risk of capture by enemy and taken prisoner of war.

Justice Chandrachud, who wrote the judgment, countered that 30% of women officers were deputed in conflict zones. He said the note screamed of the age-old patriarchal notion that domestic obligations rested only with women.

‘Remarks discriminatory’

The court found the remarks in the note not only constitutionally invalid but discriminatory, affecting the dignity of women officers.

Also Read Should women be given command posts in the Army?

However, on the other hand, the court favourably saw a policy statement filed separately by the government as a letter on February 25, 2019. It noted that the government’s note and the February 2019 policy statement clashed with each other. It wondered how the government had managed to present diametrically opposite positions in court.

The judgment recorded that the policy statement had endorsed permanent commission for SSC women officers in 10 streams of the ‘Combat Support Arms’ and ‘Services’ sections. These are Signals, Engineers, Army Aviation, Army Air Defence, Electronics and Mechanical Engineers (EME), Army Service Corps, Army Ordinance Corps and Intelligence in addition to the existing two streams of Judge Advocate General (JAG) and Army Education Corps.

“The policy decision of the Union government is a recognition of the right of women officers to equality of opportunity,” the court noted.

SSC for women is available only in ‘Combat Support Arms’ and ‘Services’ wings of the Army.

Also Read Women to get permanent commission in the Navy

The exclusion of women from combat operations was not examined by the court as it was not the contested in the appeal.

The court dismissed the government's stand that only women officers with less than 14 years of service ought to be considered for permanent commission, and those with over 20 years service should be pensioned immediately. Applying the judgment retrospectively, the court declared that all serving women officers would be eligible for permanent commission.

The court held that a blanket ban of women SSC officers from command posts cannot be sustained by law. “An absolute prohibition of women SSC officers to obtain anything but staff appointments does not fulfil the purpose of granting permanent commissions as a means of career advancement in the Army,” Justice Chandrachud wrote.

The court held that since command appointments were not automatic for men officers, so would it be for women. It was left to the Army to take a call on a case to case basis.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/9h7mo5/article30840322.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/armywomen,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/women-officers-can-be-given-permanent-commission-sc/article30840323.ece
88,2020/02/17,Trump’s India visit preparations show ‘slave mentality’: Shiv Sena,"Trump’s India trip is like the visit of a “Badshah” (emperor), an editorial in Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana’ said.

The Shiv Sena on Monday said the ongoing preparation for the visit of U.S. President Donald Trump is a reflection of the “slave mentality” of Indians.

Trump’s India trip is like the visit of a “Badshah” (emperor), an editorial in Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana’ said.

Also read: 1.25 lakh to attend ‘Kem chho Trump’ show in Ahmedabad

Taking a dig at the construction of a wall on a plot having several slum structures in Ahmedabad ahead of Trump’s visit there, the Sena said the US president’s trip would neither stop the fall of rupee’s value in Forex market nor offer betterment to those (slum dwellers) behind the wall.

“Before Independence, British King or Queen used to visit one of their slave nations like India. The kind of preparations going on from taxpayers’ money for the arrival of Trump is similar to it. This reflects the slave mentality of Indians,” it said.

The Sena also took a swipe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation’s (AMC) move to build wall on a plot to “hide the slums” on the route through which Trump’s convoy would pass.

“Former prime minister Indira Gandhi had once given the slogan ‘Garibi Hatao’, which was ridiculed for a long time. It seems now Modi’s plan is ‘Garibi chupao’ (hide poverty),” the Marathi publication said.

“Is there any financial allocation for such a wall being built in Ahmedabad? Is the US going to offer loan to India to build such walls across the country?” it wondered.

“We have heard Trump is going to be in Ahmedabad for only three hours but the wall construction is costing almost ₹100 crore to the state exchequer,” it said.

It is basically a political arrangement between Prime Minister Modi and U.S. President Trump, the Sena claimed.

Last year, ‘Howdy, Modi!’ (a mega event jointly addressed by the Indian prime minister and Mr. Trump) was organised in the U.S., it noted.

A similar programme, “Kem Chho Trump” (Gujarati expression for how are you Trump), has been now organised (in Ahmedabad) ahead of the US elections, chiefly because of a sizable number of Gujarati people living in America, the Shiv Sena claimed.

“But this visit of President Trump is neither going to stop further fall of rupee in the forex market nor offer betterment to those behind the wall (being built in front of slums in Ahmedabad),” it said.

The Sena said Trump is “not someone very wise or a statesman or someone who cares for the whole world”, but he has to be treated with respect as he represents the mighty US.

“Sometimes you have to treat someone with respect to get your things done,” it quipped.

The AMC on Friday said the construction of the wall, around four feet in height, was approved much before Trump’s Gujarat visit was finalised.

Mr. Trump is scheduled to visit Modi’s home state Gujarat on February 24.

He will visit the famous Sabarmati Ashram in Ahmedabad and take part in a roadshow with Modi. After that, the two leaders will inaugurate a new cricket stadium in Motera and address a gathering there, with an expected audience of over a lakh people.

While it was earlier speculated that the programme would be called ‘Kem Chho Trump’, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation on Sunday tweeted a series of posters confirming that the event is now christened as ‘Namaste Trump’, apparently to give it a pan-India appeal.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/2es8ki/article30812442.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/INDIA-USATRUMP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/trumps-india-visit-preparations-show-slave-mentality-shiv-sena/article30839894.ece
89,2020/02/17,"Flagged off by PM Modi, Kashi Mahakal Express left Varanasi with a seat reserved for Lord Shiva","Seat number 64 in coach B5 was reserved and left vacant for the deity, a Northern Railway spokesperson said

The Kashi Mahakal Express that links three Jyotirlingas in two States, flagged off by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday from Varanasi, had a seat reserved for Lord Shiva.

The Railways authorities are further mulling if they should make a reserved seat for the “Bhole Baba” a permanent feature of the train, which will connect three Jyotirlingas — Omkareshwar near Indore, Mahakaleshwar in Ujjain and Kashi Vishwanath in Varanasi.

Seat number 64 in coach B5 was reserved and left vacant for the deity, Northern Railway spokesperson Deepak Kumar told PTI.

The national transporter launched its third IRCTC-operated service, the PSU’s third corporate train, from Uttar Pradesh’s Varanasi to Indore in Madhya Pradesh and has named it Kashi Mahakal Express.







“It’s for the first time that a seat has been reserved and left vacant for the deity Lord Shiva.

“Even a temple has been drawn on the seat to make people aware that the seat is reserved for the Lord Mahakal in Madhya Pradesh’s Ujjain,” Mr. Kumar said.

He said a decision whether to make this a permanent fixture of the train is yet to be taken.

Light devotional music, two dedicated private guards in every coach and only vegetarian meals will be some of the new features of the fully 3-AC service that will run thrice a week between Varanasi and Indore.

The train will cover 1,131 km between Varanasi and Indore via Lucknow and a distance of 1,102 km between Varanasi and Indore via Prayagraj (Allahabad) in approximately 19 hours.

Owaisi questions the decision

AIMIM president Asaduddin Owaisi questioned the move and tweeted a photo of the Preamble of the Constitution, tagging the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO).

Seat for God “one-time affair”

The IRCTC on Monday said a seat was reserved for Lord Shiva in the Kashi Mahakal Express during its inaugural run as a “one-time affair” to seek “blessings” for the success of the new project.

“The staff of the new Kashi-Mahakal Express train temporarily put the photos of Shri Mahakaal on an upper berth so as to do pooja to seek blessings for the success of the new project (new train and new rake). It is meant only for the inaugural run as a one-time affair.

“The inaugural run was also not open to passengers. There is going to be no such reserved or dedicated berth for this purpose in the commercial run of the train which is starting from February 20, 2020 onwards,” the IRCTC said in the statement.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/gfngk2/article30840261.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Kashi-Mahakal-Express,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/flagged-off-by-pm-modi-kashi-mahakal-express-left-varanasi-with-a-seat-reserved-for-lord-shiva/article30839770.ece
90,2020/02/17,14 MoUs for military spares and support signed with Russian firms,"They range from modern T-90 tanks to legacy Pechora air defence systems

In a step forward towards addressing the issue of regular spares and support for Russian military equipment with the armed forces, 14 MoUs were signed between Indian and Russian companies for setting up joint ventures covering a range of equipment from modern T-90 tanks to legacy Pechora air defence systems.

The MoUs were signed during the 5th India Russia military industry conference held during the Defexpo 2020 in Lucknow. They come under the Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) on joint manufacturing of spares in India signed last September for mutual cooperation in manufacturing of spares, components, aggregates and other material related to Russian or Soviet-origin arms and defence equipment.

“The first ‘Request for Proposal’ for manufacturing of parts in India under the provision of IGA was also handed over by the Navy to the identified Indian industry,” the Defence Ministry said in a statement. The conference was co-chaired by Dr. Ajay Kumar, Defence Secretary and Oleg Ryazantsev, Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade of Russia.

One MoU was signed between the Spetz-Radio Corporation of Russia and the Ananth Technologies based in Hyderabad for the “development, production and manufacture of small spacecraft for remote sensing”. “Joint creation and commercial use [providing a radio frequency resource] of a network of ground control stations for small spacecraft and a network of ground stations for the reception and processing of earth remote sensing data,” a list of the agreements concluded said.

One important MoU was signed between the Bharat Dynamics Limited (BDL) and the Almaz Antey of Russia for exploring the feasibility of establishing a joint venture in India for the production of various sub systems of “air defence missile systems like Tunguska, Kavadrat, the OSA-AKA, Pechora air defence system as well as the Shilka self-propelled air defence gun system”. The MoU also covered refurbishment and life extension of the missiles. Most of these air defence systems are now in the process of being phased out and replaced with new ones.

Saying India has taken a number of steps to expedite the collaboration with Russian companies, Dr. Kumar called for expeditious implementation from the Russian side as well which has some procedural issues to sort out. There are also agreements on emerging technologies — Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, blockchain and robotics based on Russian technologies under the proposed Indo-Russian Joint Venture ICT Center of Excellence.

Lack of timely spares and support has been a constant issue faced by the military a major part of which consists of Russian defence hardware. Several such support agreements are in the pipeline and expected to be concluded soon, officials said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nhs0lt/article30836126.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH17T90TANK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/14-mous-for-military-spares-and-support-signed-with-russian-firms/article30836127.ece
91,2020/02/17,Mani Shanker Aiyar slams envoys who claimed to have seen signs of normalcy in J&K,"Congress leader Mani Shanker Aiyar, who was restricted to a Srinagar hotel and prevented from participating in a conference here, termed the Kashmir situation far from normal and criticised the foreign diplomats who claimed to see signs of normalcy during their recent visit.“Any foreign Ambassdor who went to Srinagar just two days before I did and claimed that he has seen signs of normalcy should never have been promoted to above third secretary status. I say this as an Indian foreign service officer,” Mr. Aiyar told The Hindu.

Mr. Aiyar and O.P. Shah, who heads the Centre for Peace and Progress, had planned a meet and invited civil society groups.

”The hotel where we were staying had just three rooms booked. It was me, Mr. Shah and an armed policeman who monitored movement of all those who visited us. Hours before the conference was to start, the police barricaded the hotel. We were also restricted to its premises,” Mr. Aiyar said.

”If the foreign envoys could visit and meet the groups of delegations recently despite Section 144, why can’t we meet groups inside a hotel? It’s clear there is no normalcy. If Amit Shah regards disallowing this kind of meeting as normalcy I would like him to explain what is normalcy,” he said.

“I decided to visit J&K because the Prime Minister said opposition leaders should go there and see for themselves. Besides, Mr. Amit Shah said he is not placing any restrictions on people going or coming. In effect, if one goes to endorse their normalcy, you are allowed to go. If you want to listen to people and see what is boiling in their hearts, it's not allowed,” said Mr. Aiyar.

He said during his stay in Kashmir he just witnessed empty hotels, shikara-walas (boat owners) waiting to host a tourist and armed security personnel manning the streets.

“It’s clear there is no normalcy. If Mr. Amit Shah regards disallowing this kind of meeting as normalcy I would like him to explain what is normalcy. What are they afraid of if normalcy has returned? Why are they continuing with restrictions on the people of Kashmir. There is fear and apprehension everywhere that the lid on the steam kettle will blow off by the internal pressure. Though nobody is able to say when and what will be the trigger. Many here fear ailing Hurriyat chairman Syed Ali Geelani's death could provide that trigger,” he added.

This kind of behaviour, he said, showed that the situation in Kashmir is not under control of the Government of India. “The huge military presence seems an attempt at dominating the local population,” he added.

The Congress leader said there were bogus attempts at creating some kind of alternative to the genuine leadership, which is in the prison. “I realised that the entire Sheikh family is in now detention of one kind or other without recognition to the fact that this is the family that acceded with India and upheld the flag of India for 70 years in every corner of Kashmir,” he added.

He lamented that there was no attempt to reach out to the people. “It’s believed that by intimidation and by cultivating quislings, the Centre will be able to sell development discourse. J&K is far ahead on most of the development indices because of Article 370. In fact, there is plummeting of J&K’s GDP since August 5. The Kashmir problem is far from over but got aggravated instead,” he warned.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/y8ckqj/article27124636.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH07-SOBHANA-MaG2H30IGOF3,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/congress-leader-mani-shanker-aiyar-slams-envoys/article30837856.ece

The government has rejected the latest offer by U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to mediate between India and Pakistan on the Kashmir issue, saying that it would only discuss the matter bilaterally.

Speaking in Islamabad at the beginning of a four-day visit to Pakistan, Mr. Guterres had said he had offered his offices and was “ready to help if both countries agree for mediation.”

In a response late on Sunday evening, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) official spokesperson said, “The issue of [Jammu and Kashmir] that needs to be addressed is that of vacation of the territories illegally and forcibly occupied by Pakistan. Further issues, if any, would be discussed bilaterally. There is no role or scope for third party mediation.”

The spokesperson added that India hopes the U.N. Secretary-General would “emphasise on the imperative for Pakistan to take credible, sustained and irreversible action to put an end to cross-border terrorism against India.”

Mr. Guterres was speaking to journalists in Islamabad ahead of a conference on Afghan refugees hosted by the U.N.HCR and the Pakistan government, which will be inaugurated by Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on Monday.

Kartarpur visit

Mr. Guterres will also travel to the Kartarpur gurudwara and see the pilgrim corridor with India, which he described as a “unique experiment in cross-border ties”.

Asked about the situation in J&K, he said he was “deeply concerned” and called on India and Pakistan to “de-escalate, both militarily and verbally”.

The U.N. Secretary-General has offered several times to mediate on the issue, and had repeated the offer last September after India-Pakistan tensions flared over the government’s decision to amend Article 370 and impose restrictions in Jammu and Kashmir.

U.N.-designated terrorist and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) chief Masood Azhar has been kept out of public view by Pakistan to evade further sanctions of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). However, the outfit continues to raise funds and indulge in terror activities, according to enforcement agencies.

On January 31, three alleged Jaish terrorists were killed in a police encounter on the Jammu-Srinagar highway. Three more, including one Qari Yasir — said to be involved in the Pulwama attack— were gunned down by security forces on January 25.

Movements restricted

After the Pulwama attack in February 2019, Azhar’s movements were restricted. “He currently stays in Rawalpindi and Islamabad safe-houses and has been meeting Taliban and Haqqani network functionaries,” said a senior official. The outfit is raising funds and operating under the direct command of his family members.

Ahead of the FATF review meet (February 16-21), Lashkar-e-Taiba head Hafiz Saeed was sentenced to 11 years’ imprisonment in Pakistan. “However, Azhar remains at large. The 70-year-old Saeed, who has political ambitions, was designated a global terrorist in December 2008. Azhar, now 51, was included in the list last year,” the official said.

Text messages

Azhar has been interacting with his followers through text messages. The latest one attributed to him was released on January 30 and circulated among JeM cadres. It targeted the Indian government for counter-terror operations in Kashmir over the past 30 years.

Another message had surfaced hours after the special status of the erstwhile State of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 was revoked in August last year. The statement was spread via a mobile chat application.

Book release

The agencies claim to have recorded the recent activities of the outfit. On January 15, its prominent functionaries attended an event in Markaz Sanan Bil Salma in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Peshawar. The next day, Azhar’s younger brother Talha Saif was present at the release of a book titled “Saifullahi Nisbat,” authored by the outfit’s chief.

Saif addressed the gathering, during which he targeted the “superpowers of the world” for attempts to eliminate the outfit and its chief. He said the JeM Amir (Azhar) had “sacrificed his freedom” for the cause.

In the run-up to the FATF meet, among those arrested by the Pakistani authorities in January was Azhar’s another younger brother Abdul Rauf Asghar, who is the JeM’s operations chief. However, as alleged, he was released later along with some others.

Among those also let off were Masood Ilyas Qasimi, who heads the outfit’s preaching wing, Abdur Rauf (JeM head in Rajanpur), Abu Jundal Shafique (JeM head in Pakistan’s South Punjab), Abdul Mallik Mochi, Qari Zahoor Ahmed and Imdadullah Haidri.

Students roped in

“The cadres have been cautioned against photographing or publicising fund-raising activities on the social media. The JeM’s student wing ‘Al Murabitoon Shoba’ has been roped in to interact with students of various schools and colleges for indoctrination in a clandestine manner,” the official said.

Indian agencies have also shared details with key allies on the Balakot camp that, as confirmed by the then Army chief Bipin Rawat in September 2019, was reactivated just months after the post-Pulwama attack “air strike”. It is headed by Azhar’s brother-in-law Yusuf Azhar, it is alleged.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ed7n6b/article30836630.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16TH-THGRP-PUL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/jaish-e-mohammed-has-a-free-run-in-pakistan-say-officials/article30836280.ece

98,2020/02/17,Bird census explores Coringa’s fauna diversity,"Over 26,000 birds, including 47 migratory species, recorded in Godavari estuary

The Census has recorded 26,734 birds of 96 species, including 47 migratory species such as Great Knot and Indian Skimmer, in the diverse ecosystem of mudflats, mangrove cover, marshy and wetland.

The Asian Waterfowl Census-2020 has documented the diversity of fauna in the Coringa Wildlife Sanctuary and its surroundings in the Godavari estuary recording a whopping 26,734 birds of 96 species belonging to 13 families.

A team of 40 birdwatchers led by K. Mrutyunjaya Rao, Andhra Pradesh co-ordinator, Indian Bird Conservation Network, has carried out the census on January 11 and 12 in the Godavari estuary.

“Of the 96 species which were recorded through the direct sighting method, 47 species have been found to have arrived at the Coringa and surroundings for the annual sojourn for breeding and earning prey,” Mr. Mrutyunjaya Rao told The Hindu.

Map of sightings

The Department of Forest which has roped in the birdwatchers and experts for the survey is preparing a map of the locations in which the respective species of birds have been sighted. The experts have also recorded wetland-dependent birds, kingfisher species and swallows.

The lone Water Cock and Common Snipe have created a curiosity among the enumerators. “It’s a fascinating sighting of Indian Skimmer (migrates from Chambal in India), Great Knot (Central Siberia) and Sanderling during the census,” remarked birdwatchers D. Mahesh and Kumpatla Balaji.

The highest number of Pacific Golden Plover (1,783) and 163 Indian Skimmer were sighted. As many as 446 Great Knot birds have been recorded in the mudflats of Etimoga near the Coringa sanctuary. In winter, the Great Knot visits the Coringa mangrove cover from Russia and China.

Divisional Forest Officer (Wildlife - Rajamahendravaram) Anant Shankar told The Hindu, “This year, the birdwatchers associated with the census have been asked to bring out a map on the birds sighted during the census. Such documentation is key to preparing a conservation plan.”

Sacramento Island, Chollangi marshy land, Etimoga mudflats and Coringa mangrove cover have been found as the prime habitats of migratory birds. “The Godavari estuary continues to be a safe habitat supporting breeding of numerous migratory birds. However, a stringent conservation plan still needs to be executed,” opined Mr. Mrutyunajaya Rao.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/efa6fq/article30845605.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18VJPAGESANDERLINGS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/bird-census-explores-coringas-fauna-diversity/article30845606.ece

101,2020/02/17,Officials beef up security inforested areas ahead of Sivaratri,"Personnel deployed in strength at Ubbalamadugu and Bhupateswara Kona, says FRO

With only three days left for Maha Sivaratri festival, the forest department is getting ready for making security arrangements at some of the forested areas, where the temples of Lord Siva are located amidst waterfalls.

Hot destinations

Satyavedu forest range has two Siva temples, Siddeswara temple at Ubbalamadugu and Bhupateswara Swamy temple at Bhupateswara Kona. On Maha Sivaratri day, the places become hot destination for thousands of devotees from Nellore and Chittoor districts and Chennai.

But both these spots have come to be known for tragic incidents in the last few years. Located deep inside the forest, these places are known to be a major attraction for adventure junkies, most of whom come from Tamil Nadu. This time too, a good turnout of visitors is expected as, thanks to good rainfall in 2019, the place is now brimming with cascading waterfalls and ponds.

Talking about the measures being taken by them, Forest Range Officer(FRO) (Satyavedu) J. Prasada Rao told The Hindu that the staff had already been posted at Ubbalamadugu and Bhupateswara Kona to prevent adventure lovers from entering deep into forests.

“Though the waterfalls are closed for the visitors by 4 p.m., the timings are made flexible during the festive season. The members of the temple management committees are sought to strictly monitor the cleanliness in the surroundings and report to the forest and police personnel the cases of people moving deep inside the forests or carrying liquor, cigarettes and match boxes,” he said.

In spite of the regular checks, some youth manage to get into the forests with liquor bottles. Police personnel are deployed at the borders and also near the picnic spots to check the menace, the FRO said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ktfotb/article30845273.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18VJPAGESIVARATRIPREPARATIONS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/officials-beef-up-security-inforested-areas-ahead-of-sivaratri/article30845274.ece

E-auctions across six auction platforms in the traditional tobacco-growing areas in Prakasam and SPSR Nellore districts began on a positive note on Monday.

A price of ₹171 per kg was offered by traders during the e-auctions in the Ongole I, Velampalli and Kondepi auction platforms as the farmers sold 6,239 kg of bright grade tobacco.

The average price realised in the three Southern Black Soil (SBS) auction platforms was ₹169.87 per kg, said SBS Regional Manager G. Umamaheswara Rao while overseeing the auctions.

The price offered by the trade was ₹5 more per kg when compared with last year. It is expected to go northwards as exporters enter the market.

A graduate, who made a failed attempt at becoming a Sub-Inspector, posed as an Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) officer and extorted ₹27.76 lakh from allegedly corrupt government officers from several districts of the State in Road Transport Authority, Panchayat Raj, Revenue R&B and Rural Water Supply.

Superintendent of Police B. Satya Yesu Babu on Monday told reporters that the kingpin of the extorting gang Nooteti Jayakrishna, hailing from Vidapanakal in Anantapur district, was arrested following a complaint from a Motor Vehicle Inspector of Anantapur. The police could so far detect at least 16 cases of extortion in which he had amassed ₹27.76 lakh from 2016 to 2019 and Jayakrishna along with Ramachandra and Raghavendra used to plan different easy methods to earn money.

They first allegedly learnt chain snatching methods from tutorials on YouTube and resorted to many snatchings along with another person Srinath of Karnataka by targeting several lone women. These four were arrested by the Anantapur police on September 25, 2019 in chain snatching cases and was remanded to judicial custody, but came out in November.

After coming out of the jail, Jayakrishna started getting details of the government officials from the Internet and threatened them with conducting raids posing as an ACB officer if they failed to pay him some money. While some officers did not bother, others, who feared exposure, paid him money and he would get it deposited in a friend’s bank account saying they were from government departments, where he was doing some contracts. He used to withdraw the amount immediately and spend it for his vices and luxury, the SP said.

The police are also providing the information of the officials to the ACB sleuths so that they could lay hands on government officials, who could pay such large amounts as extortion money. The conduct of the government officers would also be examined now to find out if they were really involved in ‘corrupt’ practices and amassed wealth.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/e1oc7w/article30844102.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18-VJ-SP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/man-poses-as-acb-officer-extorts-27-lakh-from-16-corrupt-officials/article30844105.ece

113,2020/02/17,‘Young stars’ shine at national astronomy meet in Tirupati,"For the duo, giving name for an exoplanet was a high point

Star gazing is common for astronomers, but this time, their attention was caught by two ‘young stars’, at the 38th meeting of the Astronomical Society of India (ASI) that is currently under way at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) campus in Tirupati.

Vidyasagar Daud, a VIII standard student from Pune who shot to limelight for naming an Exoplanet as ‘Santamasa’ under a global competition ‘NameExoWorlds’, is the youngest delegate at the meet. The naming event was conducted last July to commemorate the centenary of International Astronomical Union (IAU), when young science aspirants were encouraged to suggest names for new celestial bodies.

Vidyasagar, a student of Sanskrit, named the exoplanet as ‘Santamasa’, which in Sanskrit roughly means ‘dark and cloudy’, which resembles the space. Similarly, Ananyo Bhattacharya, pursuing mechanical engineering in Surat, named a parent star as ‘Bibha’, which means a beam of light. ASI chose the two as official entries.

Beaming with pride on being felicitated, the duo called it an unforgettable moment.

“I thought of something close to darkness and then struck Santamasa,” Daud told The Hindu. Mr. Bhattacharya said Bibha is also an ode to the country’s first woman researcher Bibha Chowdhuri.

A sizeable chunk of the delegates are young. 53% of the 322 delegates are students and 23% are post-doctoral fellows and researchers.

According to ASI president G.C. Anupama, the country’s largest gathering would discuss the most happening areas of astronomy. Secretary Divya Oberai said the morning sessions are allotted for scientific deliberations and the afternoon for discussing the progress achieved by the participants in their respective areas.

A total of 113 of the 322 delegates are female participants, according to ASI’s Working Group on Gender Equity (WGGE) member Harvinder Kaur.

An extended four-day Teachers Training Camp from February 18 will provide exposure to teachers in astronomy, which is organised by ASI’s Public Outreach Education Committee (POEC), said its nominee Preeti Kharb.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/young-stars-shine-at-national-astronomy-meet-in-tirupati/article30837722.ece
114,2020/02/17,"Govt. plans port-led growth with focus on Masula, Ramayapatnam","Food processing units, textile and marine clusters to get a boost

The Andhra Pradesh (A.P.) government is drawing up fresh plans for port-led development with focus on Machilipatnam and Ramayapatnam areas to ensure that this stretch of the central coastal hinterland realises its potential. Emphasis is being laid on promoting food processing units, textile and marine clusters and so on. The Department of Industries and Commerce is working out the modalities for them.

Special Chief Secretary Rajat Bhargava told The Hindu that Machilipatnam and Ramayapatnam areas would have clusters and an integrated development was being planned for Visakhapatnam - Chennai Industrial Corridor, the National Investment and Manufacturing Zone (NIMZ) in Prakasam district and the logistics parks conceived by the State.

Machilipatnam is one of the two places in central A.P. (Vodarevu is the other) identified by the Ministry of Shipping (MoS) as suitable locations for setting up cement and marine clusters, power complexes, food processing units and textile parks.

Cement clusters

In its perspective plan for port-led industrial development of coastal economic zones, the MoS had stated that cement clinkerization clusters could be developed in central A.P. with grinding units located at ports to tap the huge limestone reserves that are expected to last for more than a century (A.P., Karnataka and Gujarat are the only limestone-surplus maritime States).

Food processing was rated as having the potential to be developed as a discrete manufacturing cluster in the central coastal districts of A.P. and the textile sector in Guntur district.

Power complex

The MoS said Machilipatnam or Vodarevu could also be considered for the establishment of a power complex that would meet the power demand of the State, pointing out that coastal power complexes could leverage the shipping of thermal coal from Mahanadi Coalfields to significantly reduce the logistics cost (the cost of last-mile transportation will be minimal) and they had the natural advantage of access to water.

It also suggested a freight-friendly corridor (road) from Hyderabad to Vodarevu. The renewed thrust on the development of the long-pending port at Machilipatnam is a silver-lining.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/govt-plans-port-led-growth-with-focus-on-masula-ramayapatnam/article30837462.ece
115,2020/02/17,Andhra Pradesh ranks low in e-governance delivery,"Stands 13th and 17th in two categories among 17 and 18 States respectively

The State has scored poorly and is lagging behind most of the States in the National e-Governance Service Delivery Assessment (NeSDA) 2019, the report of which was recently released by the Union government.

After assessing ‘portals’ and ‘service portals’ by the Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances as per the framework developed in 2019, in a year-long process, the first-ever report ranking the States, Union Territories and the northeast States and hill States separately was published.

The assessment was aimed at improving the overall e-Government development by evaluating the efficiency of service delivery mechanism from a citizen’s perspective.

In the portals category, the State scored only 0.48 on a scale of ‘one’ standing 13th among all the 17 States assessed. This is despite A.P. delivering over 51,000 e-services, the highest in the country, as per the report.

Kerala tops list

While Kerala topped the list with 0.83 score, Tamil Nadu scored only 0.13 and settled at the last position.

In the service portals category, the State fell further down to the 17th place in a list of 18 States assessed with just 0.16 score.

As per the framework, seven key parameters, including accessibility, content availability, ease of use, information security and privacy, end-service delivery, integrated service delivery and status & request tracking were primarily assessed. The portals related to the finance, labour & employment, education, local government & utilities, social welfare (agriculture and health) and environment (fire) departments were evaluated.

Scores

In accessibility A.P. scored 0.36, content availability 0.56, ease of use 0.54 and security and privacy 0.44. The State was also behind six northeastern States.

The assessment was carried out basing on the data provided by the respective States and citizen feedback survey thrice in May last year, after which scores were calculated based on the data available as of May 31, 2019.

117,2020/02/17,Tibetan schools seek exemption from teaching Kannada,"Tibetan and English are being taught as first language, second language respectively

Several Tibetan schools located in Karnataka are seeking exemption from teaching Kannada as the first or second language, which is mandatory for all schools in the State.

As per the Kannada Language Learning Act, all schools have to teach Kannada in a phase-wise manner. This came into effect from the 2017-2018 academic year. Currently, there are over 12 Tibetan schools in Karnataka, mostly located near Madikeri and are affiliated to Central Board for Secondary Education (CBSE).

Meeting with Minister

Education Minister of Tibet Pema Yangchen met Minister for Primary and Secondary Education S. Suresh Kumar earlier this month and requested exemption from the Act. The department now is mulling over the possibility of giving them the exemption.

According to officials of the department who were present at the meeting, Mr. Kumar assured them of some relief and they are looking at various provisions of the Act. “At the meeting, representatives from Tibetan schools in Karnataka and the Education Minister of Tibet pointed out that that it would be difficult for them to implement the Act, because they have to teach Tibetan as the first language,” an official said.

“The schools are currently teaching Tibetan as first language, while English is second language. Teaching Kannada will be difficult for them as they need to teach students Tibetan and English, in case they have to return to Tibet in future or for higher studies,” an official said.

From class six

An official in the department said that the Tibetan schools have, however, informed the Minister that they are not averse to teaching Kannada from class six. A representative of the Tibetan schools said they hoped that the government would consider this as a special case and exempt them. “Even for international schools in the State, we have made Kannada mandatory. It is a decision that needs to be taken by the government and we will follow their order,” said a senior official of the department.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/u019sk/article30844652.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18BGSCHOOL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/tibetan-schools-seek-exemption-from-teaching-kannada/article30844653.ece
118,2020/02/17,COVID-19: Demand for chicken dips,"The demand for chicken has witnessed a slump in the State in the wake of scare over outbreak of COVID-19.

Though the government authorities had clarified that there were no reports confirming the involvement of poultry in the outbreak or spread of the virus, the consumption of poultry products, particularly chicken, has declined.

Fuelling the anxiety among chicken consumers was a series of “false and misleading” social media posts about the relationship between the virus and poultry products.

Coming down heavily on the “fake news”, the Karnataka Poultry Farmers and Breeders Association (KPFBA) said the sale of chicken went down by 20% to 30% about a fortnight ago. But, the demand appears to be picking up now.

Manjesh Kumar, who heads the broiler coordination committee of KPFBA, told The Hindu that the weekly average demand for chicken fell from 1.6 crore kg–1.7 crore kg to 1.2 crore kg–1.3 crore kg two weeks ago.

However, thanks to the reassurance given to the consumers by Union and State governments, the demand is improving. “Now, the weekly demand is inching towards 1.5 crore kg a week now, but is yet to return to normal levels,” he said.

The poultry industry is glad that the Union Ministry of Animal Husbandry has clarified that chicken was safe for consumption. Echoing the Centre, the Secretary to the Government of Karnataka’s Department of Animal Husbandry and Fisheries A.B. Ibrahim said COVID-19 spreads only from contact with infected persons and not through poultry.

KPFBA president Sushanth Rai said that “vested interests” were harming the poultry sector by spreading “fake news”. “Such misinformation is like a double-edged sword. On the one hand, fear is created among consumers thus depriving them of protein-rich and healthy food, and on the other, the farmer is economically affected,” he said.

“When the demand for chicken fell, the farmers were unable to stock the perishable commodity. The farm listing price of chicken fell from ₹90 per kg a month ago to just ₹55 a kg a fortnight ago. It has now marginally recovered to ₹60 a kg,” said Mr. Kumar.

Meanwhile, the Animal Husbandry and Fisheries Department has urged people not to believe the rumours and false information spread on social media.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/yeysge/article30844646.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18BGCHICKEN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/covid-19-demand-for-chicken-dips/article30844647.ece
119,2020/02/17,CII meet on economic downturn,"Industry experts to deliberate on navigating in the Volatile, Uncertain, Complex and Ambiguous (VUCA) world

The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Mysuru, is organising its annual manufacturing conference on Tuesday and the theme of this year’s meet is “Navigating in the VUCA world and the manufacturing industry”.

The theme has derived from the current economic downturn and the manufacturing industry has been the worst affected. And it is the need of the hour to discuss various remedial steps to sail through the difficult phase, the organisers said.

CII Mysuru Manufacturing and Technology Panel is a group of senior professionals from the manufacturing industry in Mysuru who meet periodically to discuss and understand various concerns of the industry and organises training, workshops, seminars and conferences to find solutions and to improve the quality, productivity and profitability in their respective industries. The current economic scenario is such a situation where industries are seeking solutions to overcome and sustain in the business, a release said here on Monday.

‘VUCA situation’

VUCA is an acronym for Volatile, Uncertain, Complex and Ambiguous. Today, the entire business world is under the grip of VUCA. This has necessitated business leaders to rethink radically and reinvent the way to do businesses - to be competitive, sustainable and create value to all the stakeholders, the release stated.

The conference will be a platform for experts to discuss the changes happening in the economy, their impact on the manufacturing sector and the way forward.

Topics

The conference will deliberate on: “Economic Scenario: Is Manufacturing Industry taking the right steps to counter VUCA?”; “How Digitisation would help during volatility?”; “Are Futuristic Technologies/Smart Manufacturing/Renewable Energy the right step? ” and a panel discussion on “How to Counter VUCA”.

Shekar Viswanathan, Vice-Chairman, Toyota Kirloskar Motors (also Past Chairman, CII Karnataka), is the keynote speaker.

120,2020/02/17,Wildlife quarantine station coming up at Koorgalli,"It will be built at Chamundi animal rescue centre maintained by the Mysore zoo

A quarantine station for rescued wild animals will soon come up at the Chamundi Animal Conservation, Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre at Koorgalli, an independent facility developed by the Mysuru zoo on the outskirts of Mysuru.

The holding facility will comply with the recommended quarantine procedures followed globally by zoological gardens.

The work on the construction of the station is expected to start soon as the tender process had been under progress.

The zoo was using its own funds for developing the facility for multiple animal species to ensure that no infections from the wild animals were spread to the healthy animals already in captivity since many years.

“As of now, animals rescued and brought to our centre are housed in the same facility where rehabilitated animals are given shelter. There are possibilities of infections from the wild animals spreading to the healthy animals. This can be avoided if they are quarantined on independent premises,” said zoo Executive Director Ajit Kulkarni.

Usually, the rescued wild animals suffer from tick-borne illnesses that are transmittable. Most often, the rescued animals are brought here with injuries as well.

The best way would be to house them at a distance for 15-20 days on a separate campus with facilities for their care. “The need was felt in the interest of wildlife and the process has taken off,” Mr. Kulkarni said.

It’s going to be a full-fledged quarantine care with three to four holding rooms with separate room for the keepers and caretakers.

Only ailing or disabled animals, or those that cannot be displayed at the zoo for certain reasons, can be shifted to the rescue centre. Rescued and injured animals from the forests are often brought for treatment and they mostly include tigers and leopards, with two national parks – Bandipur and Nagarahole – located in less than 100 km distance.

The country’s biggest Gaur (Indian bison) conservation breeding centre is also located at the Chamundi centre. Besides holding rooms, each block at the centre has day-crawl facilities for free movement of animals. The centre already has eight holding rooms where tigers, cheetah and leopards are housed. Some elephants have also been shifted to the rescue centre.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/6c5rvv/article30844524.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17MYSZOO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/wildlife-quarantine-station-coming-up-at-koorgalli/article30844525.ece
121,2020/02/17,Electricity consumers oppose move to hike power tariff,"‘It has become an annual ritual for power supply companies to seek a rise in rates and KERC to allow it based on self-attested audit report’

Electricity consumers have raised their voices against the proposal by the Hubli Electricity Supply Company (HESCOM) to hike power tariff by 45 paise per unit at the Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission (KERC) public hearing here on Monday.

KERC Chairman Shambu Dayal Meena chaired the meeting and KERC members M.D. Ravi and H.M. Manjunath were present.

Consumers representatives said that HESCOM has proposed a hike in power tariff without complying to the directions of the KERC of reducing power transmission and distribution loss. Therefore, it has no morality to appeal for revision of power tariff, they said.

KCCI representative A.S. Kulkarni and others said that it has become an annual ritual for HESCOM to seek revision in tariff and KERC to allow tariff to be increased going by self-attested audit report of the electricity supply companies.

Revision of power tariff is based on supply and demand. However, the State has become self-sufficient in energy production and there is surplus energy with electricity supply companies. Hence, the question of increasing power tariff will not arise, they said. More than 800 MW of surplus energy is being generated.

There is no progress in prepaid meters nor measures taken by HESCOM to contain power theft and energy loss. The UDAYS scheme of the Union government is not implemented and power supplied to irrigation pumpsets is being shifted to genuine consumers, they added.

Mr. Kulkarni said that HESCOM was set up in 2002 and power tariff revision started in 2004. Every year, 55 to 60 objections were being filed by consumers before KERC opposing tariff hike but this year it has reduced to just nine. People are under the impression that there is no meaning in filing objections as KERC is in favour of the electricity supply companies. KERC should take to task HESCOM for not following its directions in power saving and other issues. HESCOM can go to KERC seeking revision only if it adheres to at least 50 % of the directions given by the commission, he said.

Veeranna, a representative of Bharathiya Kisan Sangha from Gadag, said that HESCOM could reduce power tariff if its vigilance wing was activated and power leakage was prevented. The urban local bodies and town panchayats owe huge bills and HESCOM, which has failed to recover dues, is punishing consumers by increasing electricity tariff, he said.

Madhav Hegde from Karwar displaying some documents on power leakage said that as per government documents, electricity supply companies are incurring 27 % energy loss due to leakages. The BDA alone has defaulted ₹ 300 crore. All the shortcomings of HESCOM cannot be shifted to the consumers.

The quality of transformers is not up to the mark and corruption charges against officials showed HESCOM in poor light, he said. Unless HESCOM brings in transparency in administration and makes its office corruption-free, it cannot go to consumers asking them to pay more, he added.

R.G. Joshi from Uttar Kannada said that he was paying power bill of ₹ 250 four years ago and today, he is getting a bill of ₹ 800, though he is not using additional electricity gadgets or appliances. As KERC is allowing HESCOM to increase power tariff, the poor consumer is forced to spend extra money, he said.

Mallangoudar Patil from Dharwad taluk said that HESCOM is facing severe staff shortage and hence, services have been affected. There are no linemen in rural areas and for a transformer change, it takes a minimum of one month. KERC should not allow HESCOM to increase tariff till services given becomes satisfactory.

Revision proposal

HESCOM Managing Director Sundaresh Babu submitted before the KERC that the annual revenue target is pegged at ₹ 9,954 crore. Hence, it has become inevitable to increase power tariff by 45 paise per unit.

The revenue target has sailed northward and going by the present tariff, HESCOM will earn a revenue of ₹ 9,270 crore and the deficit amount will be ₹ 683.95 crore. HESCOM is supplying 8,953 million units to 52 lakh consumers of which 411 million units are given for commercial use, 265 million units for industrial use, 1,297 million units for domestic use and the maximum 4,727 million units for irrigation pumpsets.

For 2020-21, HESCOM is expected to spend ₹ 7,405 crore for power purchase at ₹ 4.49 paise per unit, ₹ 1,180 crore for maintenance and distribution, ₹ 280 crore, interest and other financial expenditure pegged at ₹ 654 crore, ₹ 50 lakh for consumer awareness programmes taking the total amount to ₹ 9,521 crore. Last year’s deficit is ₹ 759 crore and other income deducted is ₹ 326 crore. Hence, the total revenue target for this year is ₹ 9,954 crore. Transmission loss was as high as 25.06 % in 2008 and due to the effective measures taken, HESCOM has brought down transmission loss to 14.40 % which is well within the limits of the direction given by KERC.

122,2020/02/17,Congress threatens more protests over reservation,"The Congress has threatened the Union government of launching more agitations against its effort to remove reservation.

Staging a protest here on Monday, B.V. Naik, president of the district congress committee (DCC), who led the party workers, said that BJP has a hidden agenda against reservation that was accorded to people belonging to the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and other backward communities. “If such attempts were not dropped immediately, the Congress will hold more agitations in the coming days,” he added.

The BJP-ruled Uttarakhand government has failed to convince the court on why reservation in government recruitments and promotions were needed. Therefore, the court has said that reservation was not the constitutional right in getting government jobs and promotions. This was an example to show how the BJP has been neglecting the Dalits and other backward communities, he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/congress-threatens-more-protests-over-reservation/article30844493.ece

“As many as 500 people and about 400 people could not get to see Mukhyamantri and Manteswamy Kathaprasanga plays, respectively, as the auditoriums were packed. Many watched the plays standing at the corners,” said Addanda C. Cariappa, Director, Rangayana, Mysuru.

People were heard asking the organisers whether Mukhyamantri can be staged once again in Bahuroopi. The epic play saw its 701st show here on Sunday. It is inching towards creating a new record.

Other events

Not just plays, all other events – Janapada Utsava and exhibitions – are witnessing a huge response. Every visitor has something catering to his or her interests at the festival, he said, adding that all venues are witnessing packed shows and are unable to meet the demand for more seats.

The handicrafts and book expo has some special displays with the aim of offering something new and fresh to the visitors. A stall has exhibited Ilkal saris, weaved in the distant Ilkal in North Karnataka, that has wide acceptance because of its fabric, design and heritage.

Manjula Hosapete, the exhibitor, has brought all types of Ilkal saris so that everyone gets their picking. “The sari has many admirers in Mysuru and therefore we have come here with good stock,” she adds.

Likewise, there are paintings, organic products, khadi items and much more at the expo.

The employees of Sahakara Sarige (Transport Cooperative Society) continued their strike for the second day on Monday, stopping all their services in Chikkamagaluru, Shivamogga, and Udupi districts. The cooperative society, facing loss, has demanded that the government come to its rescue.

Chikkamagaluru Deputy Commissioner had sent his representative to meet the protesters and listen to their demands.

Transport Minister Laxman Savadi spoke to former MLA D.N. Jeevaraj on this issue over phone. Mr. Jeevaraj assured the protesters that he will speak to Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa. Minister for Cooperation S.T. Somashekhar held a meeting with officers of his department on the same.

E.S. Dharmappa, president of the society, told The Hindu that the Chief Minister had assured the society that the government would treat it on a par with KSRTC and BMTC. “We offer student passes on our route. The society has urged the State government to reimburse the subsidised amount as it does for KSRTC and BMTC. The last year’s due is ₹6.6 crore. If the government releases the amount, we can start our operations,” he said.

The society started in 1991 and runs buses on 76 routes. Around 12,000 students depend on the services every day. This is the only transport firm running on a cooperative model. Here, employees are elected to the executive body.

126,2020/02/17,Teenager accuses officials of mental harassment,"A 16-year-old girl, who was recently rescued from child marriage in Pandavapura, has levelled allegations of mental harassment against personnel at the State-run home for girls.

In a letter to her mother, she accused the officials of not providing her basic hygiene needs, besides mentally harassing her. She pleaded with her mother to take her away from the home. A PU student, the girl is said to have written the letter on the back of the economics question paper and sent it to her mother through a friend.

The girl, a resident of Deshavalli near Pandavapura, was rescued on February 6 when her parents were allegedly planning to get her engaged.

Acknowledging lapses, Rajamurthy, Deputy Director, Department of Women and Child Welfare, Mandya, told The Hindu that he would conduct an inquiry into the issue. “The Child Welfare Committee personnel, who rescued the girl, have not brought the incident to my notice. Moreover, they had not filed the case till February 13. It is a gross violation on their part.”

The officer added that he would submit a report to the State government on the “procedural lapses”. There is a provision to release the girl immediately after completing the mandatory procedures such as recording statements, he added.

127,2020/02/17,HC upholds process of appointing B.S. Patil as Upalokayukta,"The High Court of Karnataka on Monday upheld the process adopted by the State government to appoint B.S. Patil, former judge of the High Court, as Upalokayukta.

A Division Bench comprising Justice Ravi Malimath and Justice M.I. Arun passed the order while dismissing a PIL petition filed by Samaja Parivathana Samudaya, a non-government organisation.

The Bench rejected the petitioner’s contention that there was no consultation let alone effective consultation amongst the constitutional authorities in selection of Mr. Patil to the post as per Section 3(2)(b) of the Karnataka Lokayukta Act as there was “no consultation” with the Chief Justice of the High Court.

The Bench noted that Chief Minister B.S. Yeddiyurappa had in November 2019 written to Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka of the Karnataka High Court that the name of Mr. Patil was recommended by chairman of Legislative Council, Speaker of Legislative Assembly, Leader of the Opposition in Legislative Council, and the Leader of the Opposition in Legislative Assembly.

Though the Chief Justice replied to the Chief Minister stating that there was no material placed before him to change his earlier recommendation of A.N. Venugopala Gowda, another former judge of the High Court, to the post, the Bench said there was “effective consultation” amongst all constitutional authorities.

The Chief Justice was not kept in the dark on the recommendation of Mr. Patil to the post made by the other constitutional authorities even though the Chief Justice did not concur with their recommendation and the consultation was “effective” in terms of the law laid down by the apex court, the Bench said while accepting the contention of the State government.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/hc-upholds-process-of-appointing-bs-patil-as-upalokayukta/article30843875.ece
128,2020/02/17,Rape case against Nithyananda: HC deprecates conduct of complainant Lenin,"It declines to transfer trial from Ramanagaram court; directs expediting trial by following SC guidelines

The High Court of Karnataka on Monday rejected the plea for transfer of the rape case against Nithyananda Swami of Nithyananda Dhyana Peeta from Ramanagaram district court and pulled up complainant K. Lenin for “having acted on his own way leading the court instead of the court controlling the case and proceeding with the matter”.

Observing that the trial was pending for he last decade without much progress, the court directed the Ramanagaram district court to expedite the trial by adhering to the guidelines issued by the apex court in the case of Akil alias Javed Vs NCT of Delhi to ensure speedy trial of a case and to rule out the possibility of manoeuvring taking place by granting undue long adjournments on mere asking by the parties in a case.

Justice B.A. Patil passed the order while dismissing Mr. Lenin’s petition for transfer of trial from Ramanagaram court and to continue recording his evidence as a continuation of his earlier recorded evidence in August 2018 and set aside freshly recorded evidence in August 2019.

“... the records indicate that even though he [Lenin] was present before the [trial] court, he did not step into the witness box to give evidence. The said attitude of the complainant is deprecated. If he really wants to do justice, then under such circumstances, he must come forward and give evidence as contemplated under the law,” the court observed.

The trial court as well as the parties appearing in the case have not adhered to the proposition of law laid down by the apex court in Akil’s case so as to make a progress and to ascertain the truth in the case, the High Court said, while holding that the petitioner had not established any cause for transfer of trial from Ramanagaram to Bengaluru.

If the accused persons as well as the witnesses fail to cooperate with the trial, the trial court shall keep in mind the guidelines issued by the apex court and expedite the trial, the High Court said observing that “slow progress of a case is considered to be an evil to society”.

The High Court also said that bailable and non-bailable warrants issued against Mr. Lenin for not appearing before the court for recording evidence with an intention to expedite the trial cannot be considered to be an illegal act that will bias the petitioner.

Pointing out that the evidence of Mr. Lenin recorded in August 2018 had to be left out as it was declared as illegal by the High Court and the apex court as it was recorded with the help of a translator, who himself is a witness named in the charge sheet in the case, and hence the trial court had to re-record his evidence as per law, and process of fresh recording of evidence will not prejudice the complainant, the High Court said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/rape-case-against-nithyananda-hc-deprecates-conduct-of-complainant-lenin/article30843868.ece
129,2020/02/17,"Vijayapura-New Delhi trains ina couple of months, says MP","Ramesh Jigajinagi flags off Vijayapura-Hubballi Inter-city Express

Member of Parliament Ramesh Jigajinagi has promised to get trains operated between Vijayapura and New Delhi within a couple of months.

Addressing a gathering before flagging off the Vijayapura-Hubballi Inter-city Express here on Monday, he said that it is a long-pending demand of the people here to have trains starting from Vijayapura to reach the national capital.

“I am trying to get two trains reaching Delhi — one via Hubballi for three days and the other via Solapur for three days in a week,” he said.

Expressing unhappiness over the Railway Ministry not meeting the demand for laying a railway line between Almatti and Chitradurga which will provide train connectivity to Bengaluru from Vijayapura, Mr. Jigajinagi hoped that the demand would be met soon.

Referring to the ongoing work on the railway overbridges in different places in the district, he said that while work at Vajrahanuman Nagar is expected to be completed within a couple of months, work at Ibrahimpur is under way.

“The railway overbridge work in Aliabad will start soon as funds have been granted by the government,” he said.

He said that ₹ 14 crore has been allocated by the Railway Ministry for the construction of new quarters for employees as the existing ones have become too old and are not in good condition.

About the Vijayapura-Hubballi Inter-city Express, he said that the train would start from Vijayapura at 5.30 a.m. and reach Hubballi at 11.05 a.m. From Hubballi, the train will start at 4.45 p.m. and reach Vijayapura at 10.40 p.m.

“This is tentative timing; however, based on the demand of the people, we will reschedule the train operations,” he said.

Bagalkot MP P.C. Gaddigoudar said that the new train would help hundreds of passengers of Vijayapura and Bagalkot districts.

Stating that the line doubling and upgradation of railway station work was under way, he said that it would help in adding more trains and improving facilities for passengers.

Addressing presspersons in Kalaburagi on Monday, Mr. Muthalik asked what was the pressure on the police to release those students. The charge against them was serious and the government should not politicise such issues, he added.

He urged the Hubballi-Dharwad Police Commissioner to reveal the forces behind the release of the three students. Mr. Muthalik also demanded that Police Commissioner R. Dileep be suspended.

Mr. Muthalik accused the police authorities in Kalaburagi for allowing a group to organise a rally and take out protest march against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act last month, though Section 144 had been imposed. He demanded that the police take action against the organisers of the rally.

He said that the governments in the State have neglected implementing the Jagannath Shetty report. It was possible to curtail terrorist activities in the State by implementing preventive measures recommended in the report, Mr. Muthalik added.

Referring to the Bidar sedition case against a teacher and parent for a school play in which students expressed dissent against the Prime Minister, Mr. Muthalik criticised the police for filing the sedition case. The Department of Public Instructions should have issued a notice to the school management.

134,2020/02/17,‘Special children need special educators’,"AIISH Director says 18 per cent of the country’s population suffer from some kind of communication disorder

For the benefit of special children, the Government of India has said that all Kendriya Vidyalayas (KVs) should have special educators, said M. Pushpavathi, Director, All India Institute of Speech and Hearing (AIISH), Mysuru.

Presiding over the two-day national seminar on ‘Paradigm shift in early childhood education for children with communication disorders’ organised by the Department of Special Education, AIISH, here on Monday, she said, “These children can get better training as special educators teach them in simple methods. Schools in most Western countries are equipped with speech pathologists, special educators, physiotherapists and application therapists”.

“Early childhood is a crucial phase of growth and development. Knowledge acquired during early childhood can shape an individual’s life. Education in this period is fundamental to the development of a child and can significantly shape the later years of his or her life. He or she may not understand or make the sounds of speech. The child may also struggle with word choice, word order, or sentence structure. Therefore, for children with communication disorders, it is important to ensure access to interventions which can help them to reach their full potential,” she explained.

The AIISH Director said 18 per cent of the people in India were suffering from communication disorders and therefore a paradigm shift was required right now to bring the special children from machine to human interaction.

The seminar has been organised to orient students/ researchers, professionals, mainstream teachers, NGOs and special educators on early childhood education for children with communication disorders.

Earlier, Himangshu Das, Director, NIPMED, Chennai, inaugurated the seminar. The inaugural function was followed by lectures by professionals in the field of special education including a talk by Hikari Nishizawa, senior special education teacher from Japan, and paper presentations by professional and students.

138,2020/02/17,Purchase of private land for rehabilitation proposed,"Govt. land is not available as the majority of land is either reserved or deemed forest

The Chikkamagaluru district administration has sent a proposal to the State government to purchase private land to rehabilitate the flood-hit people in Mudigere taluk due to non-availability of government land.

A majority of the land here is either reserved forest or deemed forest.

Earlier, the district administration had identified around 300 acres of land to be distributed among those who had suffered in the floods. As the land is under the custody of the Forest Department, the administration could not proceed. “We have no other way but to purchase private land and allot the same. However, the costs are high. The State government will decide on this,” said Kumara, Additional Deputy Commissioner.

Many parts of the district witnessed damage and devastation during the rains in August 2019. Hundreds of people stayed in rehabilitation centres for months. The State government identified 464 families that had lost homes in the floods. They all got the first instalment of ₹1 lakh to build the houses. “Among those who got the first instalment, only 110 have completed the foundation and received the second instalment of another ₹1 lakh. Many have not yet begun construction,” said the officer.

Forest cover has been the problem with many developments works in the district. Around 38.6% of the total geographical area in the district, that is 3.49 lakh ha, is forest cover. Besides that, there is a vast deemed forest area of 1.24 lakh hectares, including 52,902 ha for deemed forest tag.

The construction of Kendriya Vidyalaya had been delayed in Chikkamagaluru town following objections from the Forest Department. The 10-acre land was identified for the school, but the construction did not begin though the funds were available. Following this, the administration had to identify an alternative land at Kadrimidri.

Residents of Sringeri, on Friday, took out a protest under the leadership of MLA T.D. Raje Gowda alleging that the Forest Department was obstructing the rehabilitation of people within the Kudremukh National Park area. Hundreds of applications seeking sites for houses and grant of land have been pending.

Residents of Haleganguru in Tarikere taluk alleged that officers were pressurizing them to leave the place they had been staying in for the last 50 years.

Personnel from the Police, Fire and Emergency Services, Revenue Department and local people were involved in the rescue operation.

According to Gangolli Police, Rohit Kharvi (35) and another local resident got trapped when the earth suddenly caved in while they were drilling the borewell at about 9.30 a.m.

While one of them managed to come out using a rope extended by the rescue team, Kharvi could not move as his body from neck down was trapped in soil. The rescue personnel using a crane offered him a rope and he was asked to hold on to it with his teeth. They tried to pull him out but in vain.

Later, the team carefully dug two pits nearby and sent a man down using a rope and reach Kharvi. Ropes were tied to Kharvi’s shoulders and he was pulled out of the pit at around 3.30 p.m. with the help of a crane. Soon Kharvi was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment where his condition is stable, the police said.

The police said that two ambulances had been kept ready at the spot after the incident was reported. Kharvi was given oxygen and ORS.

The borewell was being dug about 300 m away from the Marvante beach.

140,2020/02/17,"Gujjarakere rejuvenation under Smart City Mission will begin within a week, says MSCL","Work to rejuvenate Gujjarakere, a large water body spread over three acres at Jeppu in the city, under the Smart City Mission, will begin within a week from now, according to Mohammed Nazir, Managing Director, Mangaluru Smart City Ltd. (MSCL).

The work order for taking up the civil works and create recreation facilities on the banks of the lake has been issued to the contractor. The project will cost about ₹ 4 crore, he said.

The rejuvenation proposal covered dredging the lake to about two metres deep. The other facilities to be created are building a walking track around the lake, constructing a children’s play area and a public toilet and an open gym. There would be railings around the lake and the surroundings would be beautified with landscape works. The open gym would be like the one created at Kadri Park.

The rejuvenation project also included construction of a “kund” in the lake, he said.

MSCL is in the process of taking up the works as Mangaluru City Corporation plugged underground sewage seepage into the lake about a year ago. The corporation has replaced the old problematic sewage network in the area.

The Gujjarakere Theertha Samrakshana Samithi has been fighting to save and rejuvenate it since past a decade.

According to Nemu Kottari, secretary of the samithi, the government earlier spent over ₹ 5 crore for the development of the lake. Work already done covered dredging, building an embankment and retaining walls and laying a new sewer network in the area to prevent flow of sewage into the lake.

Other projects

Mr. Nazir said that of the 47 projects proposed under the Smart City Mission in the city, four have been completed.

They are constructing 14 bus shelters, replacing conventional lights in 23 government buildings with LED lights and completing footpath and drain works on one side of the road between A.B. Shetty Circle and the Clock Tower.

Of the total works proposed, detailed project reports are being prepared for 11 works. Works on other projects are in different stages.

141,2020/02/17,Kodagu flood victims stage protest for relief,"More than 222 families lost their homes in the disaster

The ongoing agitation by the flood victims at Siddapura in Virajpet taluk seeking immediate allotment of land for the construction of houses has put the Kodagu district administration in a spot.

More than 222 families from Karadigodu and Guhya villages in Siddapura Gram Panchayat had lost their homes in the floods resulting from the swollen Cauvery after heavy rains lashed the region in August last year.

Citing alleged delay in identifying land, the victims launched the day and night agitation in front of Siddapura GP on February 10.

Efforts to placate the protesters have been in vain. They are unrelenting and have threatened to intensify the protest until their demands were met. MLA K.G. Bopaiah made a futile bid to soothe them.

Yamuna M.A., former president, Siddapura GP, and convener of Flood Victims’ Association, said the affected families had staged a massive protest on the same issue at Siddapura on September 30 last year and Deputy Commissioner Annies Kanmani Joy, who visited the protest site, had promised to address their concerns within three months. There is no solution in sight to their problem even today. The affected families were living in miserable conditions in temporary structures at the same site where their houses existed before floods close to the bank, she said.

Assistant Commissioner Jaware Gowda, however, denied any delay in identifying land as he claimed that serious efforts were being made but they were unable to get suitable government land to build houses. Some are facing encroachments, he added. Those who had lost houses will get new ones built at cost of ₹5 lakh each. Moreover, the government has approved house rent for the affected families and steps have been taken to credit five months rent to their accounts, Mr. Gowda said.

“Houses will be constructed in ten months once we get the land. The families are insisting on land in Virajpet taluk since land was available outside the taluk. We shall look for private land if necessary,” he said.

Locals claim that some affected families’ names had not been included in the list of those who lost homes in the floods (based on the extent of damages to houses). The total number of affected families including those from Guhya, Siddapura and Karadigodu is 387, with highest number of affected from Karadigodu and Guhya.

The list had been made based on damage to houses. Over 66 houses were destroyed completely in the floods. Some had suffered 75-80% damage and others, lesser. But all of them had been identified for relocation since the threat of floods loomed large if they continued to stay near the river bank.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/shh4lz/article30837671.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16BGKODAGUFLOODVICTIMS2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/kodagu-flood-victims-stage-protest-for-relief/article30837672.ece
142,2020/02/17,"Belagavi, Hubballi-Dharwad to be developed as triple cities","They will be pivotal points of an industrial corridor, says Shettar

Belagavi, Hubballi and Dharwad would be developed as triple cities, Minister for Heavy Industry and district in-charge Jagadish Shettar said in Belagavi on Sunday.

He was responding to allegations that he was focusing on developing Hubballi as an industrial hub and discriminating against Belagavi. He denied the allegations and said that the government was committed to developing the three cities as pivotal points of an industrial corridor that would stretch across North Karnataka.

“The State government will work with the Union government to connect the three cities via a shorter railway line to ensure faster movement of goods and people,” he said.

He said that the recently-concluded Invest Karnataka expo in Hubballi was not meant for Hubballi-Dharwad alone. It was meant for the whole State, with a special focus on North Karnataka. “Belagavi is set to get investments of around ₹ 1,000 crore,” he said.

He launched a website, belagaviudyogamela.in, dedicated to a job fair to be held at the S.G. Balekundri Engineering College in Shivabasava Nagar here on February 28 and 29.

“This is a joint venture between the Union and State governments to help all youth who are educated and willing to work. They will be offered jobs based on their qualification and aptitude,” he said.

This will be the biggest job fair outside of Bengaluru. Over 150 companies and around 16,000 job-seekers are expected to participate in the fair. All such steps by the State government are aimed at creating an investment-friendly environment in North Karnataka, he said.

Deputy Commissioner S.B. Bommanahalli said that the Department of Skill Development and the district administration were jointly organising the fair.

Officers have held talks with the Chambers of Commerce in Dharwad and Belagavi. Several industries and business houses have shown interest in participation, he said.

143,2020/02/17,Hospet accident: Probe likely to be over in a week,"Considering the uproar around the Hospet accident that resulted in the death of two people last Monday, the Ballari police seem to have fast tracked the investigation into the case.

It was widely alleged, on social media and certain sections of mainstream media, that Revenue Minister R. Ashok’s son, Sharath, was driving the car when the vehicle met with an accident near Hospet, killing a pedestrian and one of the five people in the car.

Speaking to The Hindu on Sunday, Superintendent of Police C.K. Baba said they had arrested Rahul, who was driving the car when it met with the accident as per the complaint, on Saturday and produced him before the jurisdictional magistrate. It is learnt that the accused was granted bail on the same day. “It was not a murder, but an act that caused death by negligence. In such cases, bail is normally granted at the station itself. Yet, we have produced the accused before the magistrate as it was likely that granting bail at the station would have been termed as a favour to the accused,” Mr. Baba said.

When asked about the status of the investigation and any clue of Mr. Sharath’s involvement, the officer maintained that no Minister’s son was involved in the accident.

“The investigation is under way and is likely to be completed within a week. The FIR was registered based on the written complaint of Laxma Naik, the uncle of Ravi Naik, the pedestrian who was killed in the accident. The complainant had clearly mentioned that the car was driven by Rahul at the time. The FIR was registered accordingly. So, for we have not found the involvement of any Minister’s son in the case,” he said.

To a question on the allegations that the police were under pressure from some political leaders, Mr. Baba said that he and his officers were absolutely free from any pressure and were working as per the law. “We cannot work as per our whims and fancies. We are doing our work as per the law. Everything is on record,” he said.

The car in question was part of the accident on NH 50 killing two people – Ravi Naik, a pedestrian and Sachin, one who was in the car. Based on the complaint lodged by Laxma Naik, the relative of deceased Ravi Naik, a case was registered at Marriyammanahalli police under Sections 279 (rash driving/riding on a public way), 337 (causing hurt by an act endangering life or personal safety of others) and 304A (causing death by negligence) of Indian Penal Code. Apart from the two dead, the FIR listed three more persons as victims – Shivakumar, Rakesha and Varun – who sustained injuries.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/hospet-accident-probe-likely-to-be-over-in-a-week/article30837614.ece
144,2020/02/17,ISRO making preparations to launch GISAT-1 in March first week,"Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is preparing to launch GISAT-1, a new earth observation satellite, in the first week of March.

GISAT-1 — Geo Imaging Satellite — will be the first of two planned Indian EO spacecraft to be placed in a geostationary orbit of around 36,000 km. It will apparently be in a fixed spot looking over the Indian continent at all times.

All Indian EOs have been placed so far in a 600-odd-km orbits and circle the earth pole to pole. GISAT-1 will be launched from Sriharikota satellite launch centre. “With this satellite, which has high-resolution cameras, we can keep a constant watch on our borders, monitor any changes in the geographical condition of the country, etc.,” said Alok Kumar Srivastav, Senior ISRO scientist and Deputy Director, U R. Rao Satellite Centre, Bengaluru.

About the ambitious Chandrayaan-2 project, he said that after the failed lunar landing of the project owing to technical reasons, ISRO has planned to repeat the project. “The government has already approved the [Chandrayaan-3] project. We are working on it. We are planning to re-launch the project within a year. I am hopeful that this time we will be successful in our endeavour to land our rover near the lunar southern where no rover has landed so far,” he said.

ISRO is expected to develop its own space station within a decade. “ISRO scientists are making every effort to develop our own space station. Hopefully, in the next ten years, India will have its own space station like the U.S. and China,” Dr. Srivastav said. To achieve this gigantic target, preparations are already under way at ISRO. He said ISRO has planned to first send two unmanned spacecraft within a couple of years, and later a crewed mission in the third phase.

“Our astronauts are already undergoing training in Russia. After the completion of their training, they will be part of the first manned mission. The success of the mission will open new avenues for the setting up of our own space station, which will be possible within a decade from now,” he said.

On whether life exists anywhere else in the universe besides on earth, Dr. Srivastav said that as a space scientist, he was enormously hopeful that life existed in some or the other form somewhere in the galaxy. “We are searching for them, and possibly they are searching for us, and hopefully some day we will meet.”",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ch23ff/article30840004.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Alok-Kumarcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/isro-making-preparations-to-launch-gisat-1-in-march-first-week/article30837601.ece

Many tourist sites and roads connecting them had been damaged. The department had proposed new attractions and rebuilding activities.

“Some works are in various stages and proposals for a few are awaiting approval. Kodagu got an allocation of ₹21 crore for the works,” said Tourism Assistant Director Raghavendra.

A project had been launched along the concept of developing a typical Kodagu village near Raja Seat in Madikeri that signifies thelocal culture and traditions besides making available the crafts, spices and other commodities popular from here. This village will have about 10 rooms for tourists’ stay. This project had been taken up at a cost of ₹98.5 lakh.

All roads in the city lead to Rangayana where the ongoing national theatre festival, Bahuroopi, has a slew of events for the public. Apart from plays, it also has a photography exhibition [with over 100 photographs depicting the life and times of Mahatma Gandhi], besides stalls exhibiting and selling handicrafts and handloom items, and art works.

As this year’s event coincides with the 150th birth anniversary of the Mahatma, the focus of the festival is to highlight the relevance of Gandhian ideals and values.

Given his association with the charkha, there is a pavilion dedicated to the spinning wheel and the products brought out by the handloom unit from T. Narsipur.

At the pavilion is a loom operated manually and visitors can get to know of the spinning and weaving mechanism.

Muthuraj of Malai Mahadeshwara Kaimagga Sahakara Sangha of T. Narsipur, who is in charge of the pavilion, said the public response was good and there was a small but dedicated crowd that tend to patronise khadi and handloom.

“People generally find the khadi products expensive compared to the mass produced products but fail to recognise the underlying economics and its impact on the rural poor,” said Mr. Muthuraj.

However, he said that there were Gandhians who preferred khadi and the sector was expected to remain afloat as there would always be people who cherish the Mahatma’s values. Though the sector is facing hard times, there is encouragement by the government which tends to subsidise khadi and handloom by providing financial assistance to procure the raw material cotton.

In addition, there is marketing support which keeps the cooperative units floating, said Mr. Muthuraj. By evening, the rush is towards the plays which unfold to a capacity crowd.

Theatre buffs were treated to the 701st performance of Mukhaymantri on Saturday evening. On Monday evening, Sangeet Brari, a Marathi production, will be staged at Bhoomigeetha from 6.30 p.m., while Vanaranga will host a Yakshagana programme, and Gubbu conpany’s popular play Subhadra Kalyana will unfold at Kalamandira from 7.30 p.m.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/gkoft7/article30837509.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17BGBAHUROOPI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/all-roads-lead-to-rangayana/article30837510.ece
147,2020/02/17,Sabarimala sanitation workers yet to get wages,"900 from T.N. engaged during pilgrim season

The 900 sanitation workers of the Sabarimala Sanitation Society (SSS) who were employed at Sabarimala and its base camps during the Mandalam-Makaravilakku pilgrimage season have not yet received their remuneration. The Pathanamthitta Collectorate authorities were supposed to disburse the wages of these workers from Tamil as soon as the pilgrim season ended on January 23.

Ramalingam, a worker from Madurai, told The Hindu that all the 900 workers were recruited by the SSS chaired by the Pathanamthita Collector with the help of the Akhila Bharatha Ayyappa Seva Sanghom from Madurai, Theni, Salem and Kalladaikurichi in Tamil Nadu.

The SSS reportedly decided to raise the daily wage of these workers to ₹425, an increase of ₹25 from the previous year.

Kept clean

The SSS workers had kept the pilgrim centre clean throughout the season. They had also done a two-day intensive post-season cleaning drive on the directions of the Special Commissioner appointed by the Kerala High Court. The SSS made arrangements for their return journey to their villages on January 23 afternoon.

However, these workers are yet to get their remuneration dues of ₹26,175.

Adoor Revenue Divisional Officer P.T. Abrahm, who is also the SSS ex officio member secretary, said he had sent the final bill to the collectorate two weeks ago.

The delay was said to have been caused by certain objections raised by the finance wing at the collectorate over the biometric punching of certain workers.

District Collector P.B. Noohu was not available for further clarification.

148,2020/02/17,Kerala to have one more wildlife sanctuary,"Bhavani, comprising buffer zone of Silent Valley, to become 25th protected area in Kerala

The State government is set to declare the 148-sq-km buffer zone of the Silent Valley National Park as Bhavani wildlife sanctuary. Encompassing parts of the Mannarkkad and Nilambur (South) forest divisions, the region will become the 25th protected area in the State.

The State Board of Wildlife, chaired by the Chief Minister, decided to recommend the notification of the region as a wildlife sanctuary in its recent meeting.

The decision is expected to enhance the conservation activities in the biodiversity hotspot.

Proposal in 2010

The move has been in the pipeline since November 2010 when the board endorsed the idea, following which the proposal was submitted to the government. Subsequently, a consultative meeting of stakeholders, including tribal leaders and representatives of 20 grama panchayats in the region, backed the move. Inexplicably, the proposal had been kept in cold storage until the government referred the matter to the board once again after five years.

560 tribal families

Around 560 families reside in the six tribal settlements in the region that comprises vested and reserved forests.

The Forests and Wildlife Department maintains that the traditional rights of the tribespeople will not be affected when it is made a wildlife sanctuary as the provisions of the Scheduled Tribes and other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 are applicable to both reserved forests and wildlife sanctuary areas.

“In fact, the local community is expected to benefit from the increased surveillance. Besides, they also stand to receive more livelihood opportunities with some expected to be roped in as protection watchers,” a senior official said.

Rich biodiversity

Home to abundant faunal and floral wealth, the Bhavani wildlife sanctuary is also known to be an emerging haven of dragonflies and damselflies.

A recent faunal survey revealed the presence of several rare species of odonates there.

There are currently five national parks, 18 wildlife sanctuaries, including two tiger reserves at Parambikulam and Periyar, and one community reserve in the State.

149,2020/02/17,"₹1 cr. for accommodation, food of LKS","Assembly answer reveals ₹2,000 per plate lunches for delegates

A recent revelation in the Assembly that the government had offered ₹2,000 per plate lunches to delegates of the Lok Kerala Sabha (LKS) caused the Opposition to cry foul on Monday.

Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee president Mullappally Ramachandran said the extravagance with public funds was shocking. The government had spent ₹1 crore for accommodation and food alone when the State was reeling under a severe financial crisis. The government had contracted a super expensive multi-star hotel to cater to the delegates. The LKS participants were mostly wealthy people and it had no ordinary non-resident Keralite (NoRKs) as invitee.

The Opposition had boycotted the LKS in January on the ground that the flagship programme of the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government, aimed at harnessing the wealth and expertise of NoRKs for the State’s development, was a futile spectacle.

‘White elephant’

It had alleged that the LKS was a white elephant. The cash-strapped government had splurged crores to refurbish the Sankara Narayanan Thampi Hall in the Assembly complex to host the second meeting of the nominated body. The Opposition had earlier charged that the LKS had not met any of its stated aims. After its inception in 2018, at least two NoRK investors had committed suicide after they sunk their life’s savings into projects hobbled by administrative red tape and high-handedness and corruption of Left party office-bearers.

Seeks probe

Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said the government had splurged on the spectacle when the State faced an unprecedented fiscal crisis. The government had squeezed the payment of bills to government contractors and beneficiaries of welfare schemes. However, the LKS appeared well-funded. He sought an inquiry into the corruption and profligacy.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/1-cr-for-accommodation-food-of-lks/article30845763.ece

The wildfire near Desamangalam has been brought under control, according to official sources.

The three forest staff who lost their lives while trying to douse it were part of a group of officials who went to control the forest fire in the Illikundau range.

While tribal watcher K.U. Divakaran, 43, of Vazhachal and temporary watcher Velayudan, 54, of Kodumbu were charred to death in the forest itself, Sankaran, 55, of Kodumbu, another temporary watcher, sustained 90% burns and died at Jubilee Mission Hospital here by 11.30 p.m. on Sunday.

All the three were attached to the Poongode forest station, under which the Illikkundu forest range falls.

According to local people, fire has been raging in the forest area for the past three days.

Frequent fire incidents have been reported from this area.

Compensation

Forest Minister K. Raju has announced an interim compensation of ₹7.5 lakh each to the families of the dead.

Of the financial aid, the government will give ₹5 lakh.

The Minister directed the Periyar Tiger Foundation to give ₹2.5 lakh.

A decision on providing job to a dependant of the deceased would be taken after discussions at the government level.

151,2020/02/17,Officials suspect Kottambathur wildfire to be man-made,"Preliminary indications are that the fire that killed three forest guards on Sunday might have spread from the fringes of acacia plantation

The forest fire that killed three forest guards at Kottambathur, near Desamangalam, on Sunday might have spread from the fringes of an acacia plantation to the forest area, suspect forest officials.

Primary indications are that the fire began on the fringes and later spread to the upper reaches. There is no probability of the fire reaching the area from from the forest stretches. A probe is on and a case has been booked by invoking the provisions of the Kerala Forest Act, said P. K. Kesavan, Head of Forest Force, who visited the accident site on Monday.

It was the dry wild grass in the nearly 100-hectare acacia plantation, leased out to the Hindustan Newsprint Limited, that caught fire. Though the department had been sending regular notice to the company for the upkeep of the plantation, it had not responded. The notice for initiating fire control measures in the past few years had gone unattended, leading to the wild growth of grass. The lease period of the plantation will expire shortly and the legal process for taking back the plantation is on, he said.

Trapped in inferno

The guards, engaged in fire control measures, might have got trapped in the inferno.

At some stage, the blaze might have gone wild in the strong winds that struck the area.

They might have ventured into the forest with the confidence that the fire could be controlled. Unfortunately, self-protection measures might have been ignored, leading to the loss of life, he said. Several families stay in the periphery of the plantation. The holding has been covered by the overgrown wild grass and a large extent has dried up, posing fire risk.

Regulated burning

A large extent of the acacia tress were cut down four years ago. The department has initiated steps for cutting and regulated burning of the grass will begin on Wednesday, he said.

The guards were equipped with fire beaters and blowers that are used to blow off the dry leaves before controlled fire. One cannot carry water and other equipment to the inaccessible forest terrains, Mr. Kesavan said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/6utua1/article30845758.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18tvtrforestfire,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/officials-suspect-kottambathur-wildfire-to-be-man-made/article30845759.ece
152,2020/02/17,Glaxion benami player: Chennithala,"A slew of new corruption charges against police

The Opposition on Monday brought up a slew of new charges of corruption against the police.

Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said in Kottayam that benamis of ‘higher-ups in the government’ owned Galaxion, the firm contracted by Keltron to execute the Central Intrusion Monitoring System (CIMS).

Mr. Chennithala said he would reveal more about the firm’s political connections soon. He described the CIMS as a bid by the government to privatise police functioning. Only well-heeled persons could rig their homes and offices to the automated intrusion response system by making a down payment of ₹80,000. The police charged subscribers with a monthly fee of ₹5,000.

Charge against SPC

He alleged that State Police Chief Loknath Behera had transferred the task of marketing the CIMS scheme from Keltron to District Police Chiefs (DPC). Mr. Behera had ‘directed’ the DPCs to enlist at least 1,000 people in their respective jurisdictions into the project. The resulting cash flow would have benefited Glaxion hugely with scant benefit for Keltron or the police, he said.

The company was registered in 2016 with a paid-up capital of ₹10 lakhs. It had no previous expertise handling a project on the scale of CIMS. The Union Ministry of Corporate Affairs had blacklisted two directors of the firm, Mr. Chennithala alleged.

He said that the police had benefited a car maker by acquiring 200 ‘outdated’ vans having an outdated emission standard. By some accounts, the latest fleet of vehicles flagged off by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan recently included those that had remained submerged for days in the previous year’s floods. The outmoded vans were languishing in parking lots with no takers when the police helped the vendor by buying them up in bulk using public funds.

Mr. Chennithala alleged corruption in the procurement of security equipment for Sabarimala. The CAG had flagged corruption in the utilisation of modernisation funds amounting to ₹151 crore. He dared the government to order an inquiry.

CBI probe sought

Special Correspondent writes from Kochi:

A social activist has moved the Kerala High Court seeking a CBI probe into the findings of the CAG that 12,061 live cartridges ad 25 rifles were missing from the Special Armed Forces Battalion. George Vattukulam, president of the Malayala Vedi, submitted that the loss of arms and ammunition was a serious issue and the police were trying to cover it up.

154,2020/02/17,Chennithala seeks probe by Central agency,"‘CAG report reveals scam of unparalleled magnitude in State police’

Scaling up his attack on the State government over the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) report, Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala here on Monday demanded a comprehensive probe by any Central agencies or a judicial commission into the alleged missing of ammunition and diversion of funds.

Addressing mediapersons, Mr. Chennithala said the CAG report revealed a ‘scam of unparalleled magnitude’ and accused the CPI(M) leadership of covering it up.

“The CAG report clearly states that the purchases made by the Kerala Police were done without meeting the Store Purchase Manual and the guidelines of the Central Vigilance Commission.

As per estimates given by this government eight months ago, the overall purchases made by the force since the taking over of Loknath Behera as State Police Chief alone stood around ₹151 crore,” Mr. Chennithala said.

Unearthing fraud

For instance, the CAG report had unearthed a huge fraud in the purchase of security equipment through Keltron, causing the State exchequer a loss of up to ₹1.5 crore.

Similarly, a recent move by this government to raise the ceiling on the modernisation expenditure of the State Police Chief from ₹2 crore to ₹5 crore had raised suspicions, he said.

Missing ammunition

Mr. Chennithala said the missing of ammunition from the police armoury and the entry of a private company to the police headquarters in the guise of the CIMS project also cast concerns on national security.

“The government should clarify under what circumstances it roped in a company like Galxion, which began its operations as late as 2017 with a paid up capital of ₹10 lakh,” Mr. Chennithala asked.

Purchase of vehicles

Mr. Chennithala sought to question the purchase of 200 vehicles by the police allegedly in connivance with a private party. “While the norms set by the Union government stipulate the sale of vehicles adhering to the BS6 Emission norms since April 1 this year, this government purchased a fleet of 200 vehicles that belong to the BS4 Emission class.

The alleged intention behind this bulk purchase, made in haste, is to help a private firm,” he added.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/chennithala-seeks-probe-by-central-agency/article30845743.ece

With a day left for the culmination of the five-day monthly rituals in the Malayalam month of Kumbhom, the Ayyappa temple at Sabarimala continued to witness heavy rush on Monday as hundreds of devotees from different parts of south India undertook the pilgrimage to the forest shrine.

Tantri Kandararu Maheshwararu Mohanararu, assisted by Melsanthi E.S. Sankaran Namboodiri, performed the Kalabhapuja at the Namaskara mandapam in the forenoon.

The golden urns carrying the Kalabhom (sandal paste) and Brahmakalasom were taken out in a procession to the sanctum sanctorum, with the accompaniments of the sacred Marappani and the traditional temple percussion. The sandal paste was poured over the Ayyappa idol prior to the Utchapuja (rituals at noon) and the kalabhom offered to the deity was distributed as prasadom (offering) among the devotees, later.

Padipooja, Udayasthamanapooja, Ashtabhishekom and Pushpabhishekom were the other rituals performed at the Ayyappa shrine on Monday.

159,2020/02/17,Rajkumar’s death: CBI arrests former SI of Nedumkandam,"Supreme Court has quashed his bail

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has arrested K.A. Sabu, former sub-inspector of the Nedumkandam police station, in connection with the alleged custodial death of 49-year-old Rajkumar, a remand prisoner, on June 21 last year. He is the first accused in the case. The CBI had summoned him to its office here on Sunday night after the Supreme Court quashed the bail granted to him by the Kerala High Court.

The Chief Judicial Magistrate Court here granted six-day custody of the accused after the investigating agency pointed out that further interrogation was required to ascertain whether senior officers had any role in the custodial torture.

Rajkumar, a private financier from Kolahalamedu, was taken into custody on charges of financial fraud on June 12 and was produced before the court only on June 16. He had allegedly accepted deposits from self-help groups on the promise of providing them loans. However, complaints were filed at the Nedumkandam police station that he had failed to keep the promise.

Rajkumar was allegedly subjected to severe torture at the Nedumkandam police station from June 12 to June 15, leading to his death on June 21.

A post-mortem examination was conducted at the Kottayam Government Medical College Hospital and the wounds in the body were noted in the post-mortem report.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/rajkumars-death-cbi-arrests-former-si-of-nedumkandam/article30845688.ece

161,2020/02/17,Air India resumes jumbo flight from Calicut,"The wide-bodied aircraft being used for direct flights to Jeddah on Monday and Saturday

After a gap of five years, Air India resumed the operation of its jumbo flight to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, from the Calicut international airport from Monday.

Union Minister of State for External Affairs and Parliamentary Affairs V. Muraleedharan, who inaugurated the service of the wide-bodied aircraft, thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Minister for Civil Aviation Hardeep Singh Puri for their efforts to increase the air connectivity to Kerala destinations.

The Air India flight Boeing 747-400 was accorded a ceremonial water salute on the occasion.

Twice a week

The Airports Authority of India (AAI) recently gave approval to the national flag carrier to operate direct flight initially twice a week, Monday and Saturday.

The flight will land at Calicut at 7.05 a.m. and depart for Jeddah at 5.30 p.m. The flight, carrying 420 passengers, will reach Jeddah at 9.15 p.m. From Jeddah, the flight will depart from Fridays and Sundays at 11.15 p.m. Regarding configuration, the jet will have 12 seats for first class, 26 for business and 385 for economy.

The operation of wide-bodied aircraft of Air India began in 2002, but it was banned at the Calicut airport from May 2015 in the wake of a court of inquiry report on the Air India accident at Mangaluru.

DGCA approval

However, the Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) approved the proposal of Air India to recommence operations of aircraft under Code E. This was after it conducted a safety assessment and submitted a report in August last. But it had to rectify some anomalies pertaining to a compatibility study.

Even after that the resumption of service got delayed as Air India officials had proposed that its direct flight be allowed to arrive in the morning and depart only in the evening.

So far Air India has not been given permission to operate Haj flights from Calicut. Only Saudia (Saudi Arabian Airlines), which had already secured a No Objection Certificate in December 2018, now operates Haj flights with its wide-bodied aircraft.

Dubai-based Emirates, which has also got approval to operate wide-bodied aircraft, is yet to begin services.

162,2020/02/17,KER amendment may end up in legal tangle,"Move to regulate appointment of teachers in aided schools

The Left Democratic Front (LDF) government’s move to amend the Kerala Education Rules (KER) to regulate the appointment of teachers in aided schools is likely to lead to a legal tangle.

The government is reportedly planning to change the number of students required to create additional posts of teachers.

The practice of assistant educational officers approving the appointment in primary schools and district educational officers doing it for high schools will also be stopped though the managers’ right to pick teachers may not be taken away.

A mechanism involving higher-level officials is likely to be set up for the approval process.

Right now, the teacher-student ratio in lower primary schools is 1:30, upper primary schools 1:35, and high schools is 1:40.

The government is planning to stop the alleged practice by a section of aided school managers who create new posts even if the number of students goes up by just one.

Drain on exchequer

The Finance Department is of the view that the creation of such additional posts is draining the exchequer at a time when the government is passing through a financial crisis. The department is learnt to have proposed that one new post could be allowed to be created only if the number of students goes up by six. Thus, a second post could be possible only if the number goes up by 36 and a third post if it goes up by 66.

A senior lawyer in the Kerala High Court, who wished not to be quoted, points out that the amendment could be legally challenged citing Article 30(1) of the Constitution that guarantees minorities right to run educational institutions. If any concession is given to the minorities, it may lead other communities to seek similar favours. It will also require changes to the Kerala Education Act, 1958 approved by the Supreme Court.

‘Violation’ of RTE

A.A. Hameed, State joint secretary, Kerala Private School Managers’ Association, says the amendment will also be a violation of the Right to Education of Act.

The teacher-student ratio was changed around a decade ago as per the Act. “Though the government had challenged this in the High Court and later in the Supreme Court, its pleas were dismissed. We will go through the government order once it comes before deciding the future course of action,” he adds.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/lwep64/article30846314.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18tv-Teacher-student-ratiocol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ker-amendment-may-end-up-in-legal-tangle/article30844270.ece
163,2020/02/17,Expulsion of youths: CPI (M)’s message to the rank and file,"Party will not tolerate any criticism of LDF government

Through the expulsion of its members, Allan Shuhaib and Thaha Fasal, who were booked under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) for alleged Maoist links, the CPI (M) leadership has given a clear message to the rank and file that the party will not tolerate any dissent or criticism of the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government.

The arrest on Allan and Thaha, attached to the Meenchanda and Paramal branches, respectively, on November 1 had at the outset unsettled the CPI (M) district committee. But after floundering for more than three months, the party leadership decided to expel them.

Endorsing report

Incidentally, CPI (M) State secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan announced the decision from Thiruvananthapuram endorsing the report of the district unit.

Perhaps, now the district committee can heave a sigh of relief even as its leaders will have to explain the manner the issue was treated. Contradicting the statements of the Chief Minister on and off, party district secretary P. Mohanan on January 23 said that Allan and Thaha were members of the party and that Mr. Vijayan might have relied on police inputs.

But Mr. Kodiyeri on Sunday said the district committee had carried out an inquiry and gave its report a month ago. The issue comes when the party is gearing up for the three-tier local body polls scheduled this year.

Neo-liberal policies

According to party functionaries, the district leaders had earlier been tolerating the activities of the duo who publicly attacked the alleged “neo-liberal policies” of the ruling party. However, these youths had been found to openly criticise Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan too and this gathered momentum after the killings of the four suspected Maoists inside the forest areas of Attappady Hills of Palakkad in October last.

Apparently, the district leadership was caught in a paradoxical situation when Mr. Vijayan said in the Assembly that the investigators had secured incriminating evidence to prove their links with the Maoists. This was after the slapping of charges under the UAPA attracted widespread disapproval within and outside the party.

Islamic terrorism

Mr. Mohanan, even while maintaining that the party had constituted a panel for inquiring into their past activities, had also stoked a controversy linking Islamic terrorism with Maoism.

Buckling under political pressure, the Chief Minister had to write to the Union Home Ministry to assign the case back to the Kerala police after the NIA took over the investigation.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/expulsion-of-youths-cpi-ms-message-to-the-rank-and-file/article30844000.ece
164,2020/02/17,Tamil Nadu to supply milk to Kerala,"Price and quantity to be decided today

The Tamil Nadu Cooperative Milk Producers’ Federation (Aavin) has, in principle, agreed to supply milk to the Kerala Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation Ltd (Milma), Milma officials have said.

At a meeting held in Chennai on Monday, Milma has formally placed a request for a daily supply of two lakh litres.

Tamil Nadu officials are expected to reach a decision regarding the quantity that can be supplied and the price on Tuesday, Milma officials have said. “Tamil Nadu has agreed to supply the milk. They will work out the details and inform us on Tuesday,” Milma chairman P.A. Balan says.

The price per litre demanded by Aavin will be crucial, as Milma will also have to bear the transportation costs to Kerala. Kerala has been purchasing milk from the Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF) at ₹36 per litre (exclusive of transportation costs).

Milma has not formally mentioned the duration of supply in its request, but it is expected that the supply will continue till at least May-end.

Reduction in supplies from Karnataka from February 1 has forced Milma to approach Tamil Nadu. The matter was also taken up at the government level, as milk shortages could worsen with the onset of the summer.

Milma, which procures 12 lakh litres daily in Kerala, is currently getting 95,000 litres from the KMF after the reduction. The federation has requested an addition of 50,000 litres from Karnataka, but no decision has been finalised.

The Milma delegation was led by its managing director Patil Suyog Subhashrao.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/tamil-nadu-to-supply-milk-to-kerala/article30843679.ece
165,2020/02/17,Cracking the whip on illegal houseboats,"Drive to spot unregistered vessels

Cracking the whip on illegal operations of houseboats, the Ports Department has asked the Kerala Maritime Board to carry out a special drive against unregistered houseboats and inspect the registered ones to ensure that they adhere to the relevant Kerala Inland Vessels (KIV) Rules.

The move is in the wake of recent fire incidents on houseboats on Vembanad Lake. The chief executive officer (CEO) of the board has been asked to set up multiple teams with officials from the police, revenue, inland waterways, and Pollution Control Board (PCB) to complete inspection of registered houseboats in 15 days.

The special drive is to identify unregistered houseboats, shikaras and other motorised boats, to take steps to register the aceptable ones within one month, and to take action against others as per the KIV Rules. A report will be furnished to the government in 20 days.

The CEO has also been asked to ensure that the web portal for registration of inland vessels is launched within a month. The department has mooted an online tracking mechanism of houseboats in three months on the lines of the Fisheries Department.

Training sessions for houseboat owners and staff will commence in a month. The CEO will take steps to implement a comprehensive waste discharge system for houseboats after holding discussions with the district administration, PCB, and District Tourism Promotion Council.

The registering authority has also been asked to seek assistance from the District Police Chief for the custody and storage of illegal houseboats.

Meanwhile, a high-level meeting chaired by Minister for Tourism Kadakampally Surendran here on Monday decided to provide 15 ex-servicemen for the safety of the seized houseboats and to install CCTV cameras.

Soon to hit the market are products of Athirappilly Tribal Valley Project, an Agriculture Department initiate aimed at the development of Scheduled Tribes in Athirappilly.

Speaking after inaugurating the Athirappilly Tribal Valley Project at a function held at Malakkappara on Sunday, Agriculture Minister V.S. Sunil Kumar said the products would go global in three years.

“The main attraction of farm products from tribal felt is the use of traditional seeds. The government, which rejuvenated the millet farming in Attappady, has introduced six millet-based products in the market. Athirappilly has better prospects in this area, as it is a virgin land and no chemical pesticides are used here. Also, there have been use of hybrid seeds. The products, which uses traditional farming methods and seeds, can fetch high price in the market. If we can secure Rainforest Alliance Certification, we can sell it at a high price anywhere in the world,” the Minister said.

Products like pepper, cocoa, coffee , honey and Ayurvedic medicinal plants are being grown here by protecting biodiversity. The Farmers Producers Company will take the products to the market.

The Minister said Kerala Agriculture University had been asked to start a Tribal Agriculture Wing, which would not have any middlemen. The tribal people would directly get its benefit.

Araku Valley coffee, which is considered as one of the best coffees in the world, was produced by tribal people in Andhra, he said. This was the motivation in developing the project.

Of the fund allotted for agriculture under Rebuild Kerala, ₹7.5 crore has been earmarked for the Athirappilly Tribal Valley Project. The Minister inaugurated the project by receiving products from Perumal, the tribal chief of Adichilthotti tribal hamlet.

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has arrested K.A. Sabu, former Sub-Inspector of Nedumkandam police station, in connection with the alleged custodial death of 49-year-old Rajkumar, a remand prisoner on June 21 last year.

He is the first accused in the case. The CBI had summoned him to its office here on Sunday night after the Supreme Court quashed the bail granted to him by the Kerala High Court.

The accused was presented before Chief Judicial Magistrate court here. The agency had sought an eight-day custody of the police official, who was suspended along with three others, following the custodial death of Rajkumar at Peerumade sub-jail.

Kolahalamedu resident Rajkumar, a private financier, was taken into custody on charges of financial fraud on June 12 and produced before court only on June 16.

169,2020/02/17,"To prove CAG wrong, Kerala police publicly count rifles","The Comptroller and Auditor General had pointed out that 25 assault rifles were missing

The Kerala police on Monday made an apparently overt bid to prove to the public that the 25 assault rifles flagged as missing by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) were in their safe custody.

Seemingly stung by the damning findings of the CAG and cautious about the attempts of the Congress-led Opposition to politicise the issue, the government had despatched ADGP, Crime Branch, Tomin Thachankery, to the armed police camp here to personally enumerate the INSAS 5.56 rifles stockpiled from armed units across the State.

In an unusual move, the police allowed television newspersons into the bell of arms room to record visuals of Mr. Thachankery cataloguing the arms.

After a swift inspection, Mr. Thanchankery told newspersons that the police had accounted for all of the 660 INSAS rifles and none were missing as pointed out by the CAG.

He said the police had counted 647 rifles in the armoury and verified their serial numbers. An India Reserve Battalion unit deployed in Manipur had the remaining 13 guns in its custody.

The officers in Manipur had photographed the serial number of their guns and texted the images to the Crime Branch officers, he said.

Ill-maintained records and clerical error might have prompted the CAG to deem the weapons as lost. Mr. Thachankery said the CB had expedited its enquiry into the 12,061 missing cartridges spotlighted by the CAG.

He said the investigation into the missing ammunition would go beyond the custodians and reach police higher-ups.

The CB had initiated the enquiry in October last. It hoped to charge-sheet the case in April.

He requested the public to have faith in the CB enquiry.

The High Court had transferred the case of ammunition missing from the Kottayam Rifle Club from the CBI to the CB recently, he said.

Chennithala seeks probe

Meanwhile, Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala ratcheted up the demand for a probe by the National Investigation Agency into the case of missing weapons and live ammunition.

He asked in Kottayam why the police could not convince the CAG about the whereabouts of the weapons despite repeated queries from auditors. Moreover, the CAG had physically verified the weapon stick and recorded the shortage.

Mr. Chennithala said the government had attempted to trivialise the “dissappearence” of lethal arms from the police armoury.

He said the CAG report on corruption in procurement and deficit in the stockpile of weapons pointed to the entrenched anarchy in the Kerala police department.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/pprrfo/article30841136.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/rifle,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/to-prove-cag-wrong-kerala-police-publicly-count-rifles/article30841070.ece
170,2020/02/17,Man from Kerala tells country’s history in one-rupee notes,"He has 1,200 notes bearing serial numbers that match with dates of important events in the country

Arvind Kumar Pai, a notaphilist and philatelist from Cherthala of Alappuzha, has many records to his credit.

The 33-year-old has now collected 1,200 one-rupee currency notes bearing serial numbers that match with dates of historical and important events in the country.

For instance, a note with serial number 311084 match the date of assassination of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi (October 31, 1984), 010148 (January 01, 1848 — India’s first school for girls opened at Bhide Wada in Pune), 080457 (April 8, 1857 — Mangal Pandey was hanged), 280228 (February 28, 1928 — Discovery of Raman Effect), 121136 (November 12, 1936 — Temple entry proclamation), 261149 (November 26, 1949 — Constituent Assembly adopted the Constitution of India), 050457 (April 05, 1957 — the first-ever elected Communist government came into power in Kerala), 250675 (25 June 1975 — Emergency declared), to mention a few.

“I started collecting these notes in 2015. I am trying to tell the country’s history through the collection,” says Mr. Arvind, a teacher at Government Town Lower Primary School, Cherthala.

Earlier, he entered the Limca Book of Records for having the largest collection of ₹1 notes totalling 11,111. He also entered record books for possessing at least three notes signed by each of the Finance Secretaries from K.R.K. Menon to Ratan P. Watal.

Mr. Arvind has at least three one-rupee notes in every batch of ₹1 issued in the Independent India.

In 2015, he along with his mother Renjitha Bai, entered Limca Book of Records after he sent her an envelope with most number of stamps pasted on it (322 stamps).

171,2020/02/17,Coronavirus: Second Kerala patient discharged,"More than 2,000 people are still under observation for the virus in the State, which had accounted for all three positive cases in India.

In further relief to Kerala, a student treated for the COVID-19 was discharged on Sunday after two consecutive test results came back negative, thus becoming India’s second patient to recover from the infection, health authorities said.

“Earlier, one patient was already discharged. The number of patients discharged is now two,” the Ministry noted.

The patient from Kasaragod, one of the three positive cases of the virus detected in the country on their return from China, would, however, remain under home quarantine for ten days, the State health department said.

More than 2,000 people are still under observation for the virus in the State, which had accounted for all three positive cases in the country.

On Thursday, a student from Alappuzha was discharged after his two consecutive samples sent for testing at the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune turned out to be negative.

India’s first COVID-19 case, a woman from Thrissur, is awaiting test results from Pune after samples screened at the Alappuzha centre had returned negative last week.

“We are waiting for the test result of the student admitted to Thrissur Medical College Hospital,” an official said.

World Health Organisation has declared the recent Novel Corona Virus (COVID-19) epidemic as Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Till February 16, it has affected 27 countries with majority of the cases detected in China, Japan, Thailand, Singapore, South Korea and Hong Kong. Worldwide, over 50,000 cases have been reported.

Director Bong Joon-ho smiled and waved at a waiting crowd on Sunday as he arrived home in South Korea, his first trip back since he won four Oscars for his movie Parasite, including the award for Best Picture.

The crowd clapped and cheered as Bong walked out of the arrivals gate at Incheon International Airport.

“It’s been a long journey in the United States and I’m pleased that it got wrapped up nicely,” Bong said, speaking in Korean. “Now, I am happy that I can quietly return to creating, which is my main occupation.”

""I’ll diligently wash my hands from now on and participate in this movement to defeat coronavirus,” he said. As of Sunday, South Korea had 29 confirmed cases of the new virus, which the World Health Organization has named COVID-19, referring to its origin late last year and the coronavirus that causes it.

174,2020/02/17,"'Moira', a short film on road safety made by Round Table 20 & Yi Coimbatore","The 40-minute short film has hard hitting messages on road safety

In Moira, a 40-minute short film, Dharma, Imra and Kaala represent Yama the god of death. They are on a mission — to take away the lives of those who violate traffic rules. Just as they are about to strike, three of their intended victims, Shiva, Zakheer and Mahesh, realise their mistake and manage to escape death ( with just a few minutes left to spare). Moira is the Greek word for fate and destiny.

Moira, made by Round Table 20 & Yi Coimbatore, is a wake-up call to road users to abide by the rules, says B. Praveen Kumarr, Chairman of Young India Coimbatore. “In Tamil Nadu, we lose close to 1000 lives to road accidents in a year. Reckless driving, over speeding and lack of awareness on precautions are the main reasons. We wanted to make the film to take the message across. It was two years in the making.”

The film is directed by Vijay Anand TR and his team at S16 Technologies. Shot in Coimbatore and London, the narration in the film is crisp, taut and gripping. Excellent VFX effects and background music give it an added edge. Director Vijay Anand also plays Dharma. He says,“Every fourth minute, a person dies in a road accident in India just because they have not thought the consequences through. What happens to their family? We wanted to discuss death and instil a sense of fear and pain in those who violate traffic rules.”

Drunken driving, talking on mobile phones while driving, not wearing or not strapping helmets securely, all come under the gambit of the film. “In the film, three people escape while three others die. One of them dies because he rides a poorly maintained bike. Then there are those cab drivers who push themselves to work overtime to make extra money. Like Zakheer in the Movie who plays a sleep-deprived cab driver. But, he recognises his exhaustion and requests his customer to take another cab. He listens to his inner voice. We want to tell the viewers to listen to that voice and act on it.”

It’s your life The target audience for the film is those in the 18 to 25 age group — the new users

Young Indian’s have also tied up with educational institutions to spread awareness on road safety. They plan to take it to other cities through NGOs. The film is certified by the CBFC and is now available on Moviebuff Tamil channel on YouTube

Moira’s sound design is by Sync Cinema. Sound mixing is by M R Rajakrishnan of Four Frames in Chennai (he recently won a National Award for his work in the Telugu film Rangasthalam)

Vijayanand can be contacted at 99447-27777

Tragedies of road accidents are universal, says Vijay Anand. That is the reason the final portion of the film, shot in London, shows a girl talking on the phone on her way back after a late night party and her car crashes. “Wherever you are, follow road rules,” he urges.

Says Praveen Kumarr, “When in college people ridiculed me for wearing seat belts. It is better to be safe. The danger could be at a street corner or a highway. People take it lightly. I have seen people take off their helmets once they cross the junction where there are cops. Accidents happen on the highway in a micro second. Not just over-speeding, sleep deprivation is a very real danger. Shutting your eyes even for a flicker can lead to horrific consequences. As can badly maintained vehicles. Our film deals with some fundamental dos and don’t s that can save lives. ” He points out to another dangerous trend of underage children driving. “We have to value lives and follow road etiquette. What we need is an attitudinal change.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/wnpdo9/article30841860.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10CMmoira2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/moira-a-short-film-on-road-safety-made-by-round-table-20-yi-coimbatore/article30841861.ece
175,2020/02/17,A.R. Rahman’s daughter Khatija: ‘Why double standards only when it comes to women of a certain faith?’,"Khatija Rahman was responding to criticism on her choice of clothing, and asked Taslima Nasrin to Google the meaning of ‘true feminism’

A.R. Rahman’s daughter Khatija has responded to Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin’s comments on the former’s choice of clothing on social media.

Earlier this month, the writer tweeted that she felt ‘suffocated’ whenever she looked at pictures of Rahman’s daughter. Sharing a photo of Khatija covering her face with a niqab, she posted, “It is really depressing to learn that even educated women in a cultural family can get brainwashed very easily!”

It was only last year that Rahman faced criticism for the same issue, and the composer responded by stating that women in his family were free to wear whatever they wanted to. The Academy Award-winning music director shared a photograph of his wife and two daughters, along with the hashtag ‘FreedomToChoose’.

Now, after Taslima Nasrin’s post, Khatija herself took to her Instagram profile to reply to the writer: “Been only a year and this topic is in the rounds again… there’s so much happening in the country and all people are concerned about is the piece of attire a woman wants to wear. Wow, I’m quite startled. Every time this topic comes the fire in me rages and makes me want to say a lot of things..Over the last one year, I’ve found a different version of myself which I haven’t seen in so many years. I will not be weak or regret the choices I’ve made in life. I am happy and proud of what I do and thanks to those who have accepted me the way I am. My work will speak, God willing... I don’t wish to say any further.”

Khatija, who is a social worker, Director and Trustee of the A R Rahman Foundation, as well as a musician-singer, added, “Dear Taslima Nasreen, I’m sorry you feel suffocated by my attire. Please get some fresh air, cause I don’t feel suffocated rather I’m proud and empowered for what I stand for. I suggest you google up what true feminism means because it isn’t bashing other women down nor bringing their fathers into the issue. I also don’t recall sending my photos to you for your perusal.”

In her next post, Khatija said she was overwhelmed by the love and support of people on social media and thanked them. “I request you all not to abuse or make any hate speech against Ms. Taslima. Lets strive to become a broad minded society in accepting the choices our fellow human beings make and also remember Ms. Taslima in our prayers and not judge her for the choices she’s made in life. Peace,” she concluded.

Finally, before posting a picture with her dad and sister Rahmeen at Baku in Azerbaijan, titling it, “Peaceful time with family away from ‘suffocation’”, Khatija also shared a picture of a burqa-clad woman, writing, “Why the double standards and sudden concerns only when it comes to women belonging to a certain faith? Haven’t we seen men wearing turbans? Women wearing habits ? Why only when it comes to a particular faith are women targeted for the choices they make wholeheartedly and with pride. Why ? Why ? And why ? I simply do not understand.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/v5mmyg/article30841513.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/khatija,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/ar-rahmans-daughter-khatija-why-double-standards-only-when-it-comes-to-women-of-a-certain-faith/article30841514.ece

177,2020/02/17,‘Fantasy Island’ movie review: More yawns than frights,"A remake of the popular 70s show, this offering seems like a slapdash attempt instead of an a horror-adventure film

When you think of Blumhouse Productions, a spate of successful horror films like Paranormal Activity, Insidious and The Gift come to mind. The production house has carved a name for itself with micro-budgeted films that have borne box office gold. Jason Blum at the helm of the company has in fact been nominated for a few Academy Awards for producing Whiplash, Get Out and BlacKkKlansman. But his latest project earns a few head scratches. A remake of the popular 70s show, Fantasy Island, the film is a peculiar addition to Blumhouse’s roster.

Sure it’s got a supernatural inclination to it. But mostly the film is a tired adaptation of the essence of the series which had the time and scale to delve into the intricacies of a unique premise. Fantasy Island 2020 brings back Mr Roarke (Michael Peña) as the host who manifests people’s most desired wishes. Gwen (Maggie Q) regrets spurning the man she still loves; Patrick (Austin Stowell) wants to be a soldier for a weekend; while Melanie (Lucy Hale) seeks revenge on high school bully Sloane (Portia Doubleday). Lastly, brothers from different mothers JD (Ryan Hansen) and Brax (Jimmy O. Yang) just want to have the party of their wildest dreams. While the island brings to life their fantasies, something obviously isn’t right when things go awry.

Fantasy Island Director: Jeff Wadlow

Cast: Michael Peña, Maggie Q, Lucy Hale, Austin Stowell, Portia Doubleday, Jimmy O. Yang, Ryan Hansen, Michael Rooker

Storyline: A group of seemingly unrelated people embark on fulfilling their fantasies on a mysterious island with supernatural powers

That trouble should hit the fan is visible a mile away. Director, co-writer and producer Jeff Wadlow seems to have done a slapdash hurl of the script on to the big screen. With no consideration to nuance or gasp, even run-of-the-mill jump scares, Fantasy Island unravels like a ball of yarn across a flat floor. It’s strange how the film can be both predictable and confusing simultaneously. A twist that should ideally grab some eyeballs just ends up being exasperating and frankly a little stretched. Whatever little humour there is, is courtesy of comedy veterans Hansen and O. Yang, hits its peak right at the start with the two wading through woods: “I’m not into bush whacking” the retort to which is, “Is that why Jenny dumped you?”

For a company that focuses on horror, Blumhouse’s Fantasy Island elicits more yawns than frights.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/trn63h/article30840958.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15bm-pg2-Fantasy-Island,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/fantasy-island-movie-review-more-yawns-than-frights/article30840959.ece

The Beijing premiere and a tour of other cities in China for the upcoming James Bond film, No Time To Die, has been called off due to the coronavirus outbreak.

According to Deadline, the movie’s lead star Daniel Craig and other cast members won’t attend the April screening or the subsequent publicity tour of the country.

Cinemas across the world’s second-largest box office market remain shut indefinitely amid efforts to controlling the spread of the virus.

There is currently little clarity on when business may return to normal. The death toll in China now exceeds 1,770 people.

Craig returns to play the suave British spy for the fifth and final time in the movie, directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga.

179,2020/02/17,"Odd woman out: Meet Madhurjeet Sarghi, the 'Chhapaak' lawyer everyone is talking about","The actor speaks about playing the role of Archana Bajaj, the tough but empathetic lawyer of acid attack survivor Malti in the recent Deepika Padukone movie

A number of Chhapaak viewers may have admired Archana Bajaj, the tough-as-nails but empathetic lawyer of acid attack survivor Malti (Deepika Padukone); few, however, would know of the consummate actor behind the character — Madhurjeet Sarghi.

Her prominent and weighty presence on-screen makes it easy to presume that she is not just someone who randomly walked into the film set, and the role, but is an artiste of some calibre picked up with the right thought and intention. Curious to know more about her, I go on a bit of a wild goose chase to try and reach her professionally. Only to eventually fall back on the obvious personal connect — her director-husband Anurag Singh (Kesari, popular Punjabi films, Jatt & Juliet and Punjab 1984) — and I soon find myself seated across the table in the couple’s Oshiwara office.

Life after Chhapaak

If not entirely surprised, Sarghi is mildly pleased at our pursuance. Perhaps because the irony of being a good supporting actor in Hindi cinema is that however much the audience may have loved your character in the film, they are most likely to not recognise you on the streets. Has Chhapaak changed that? Is the appreciation pouring in? “There are people who have caught up on the road to tell me that they liked my work. I like such validation,” she says.

But, for Sarghi, the change in the world’s attitude towards her is not as consequential as how she herself has transformed within. “The film has improved my aesthetics of cinema; in terms of how to approach a role. I feel enriched. Whatever else is happening is a bonus.” The actor is quite zen and self-effacing about it: “It’s a well-written and meticulously crafted script. All I had to do was serve the script. The role is such that whoever would have done it, would have earned praise.” All that Sarghi was concerned about, all through the making of the film, was to not botch up the terrific opportunity that came her way.

Screen calling

She might have played a seasoned lawyer on-screen, but the actor had never been to the court before. “I didn’t even know the full form of PIL,” she recalls. She briefly met Aparna Bhat, the real-life lawyer of Laxmi Agarwal (on whom her character is based), when she came visiting on the set once. In fact, the one person she relied on a lot for inputs was a cousin who happens to be a judge.

Up close Sarghi is a fan of films from Iran. Abbas Kiarostami’s Close Up is an all time favourite. She remembers Mike Leigh’s Another Year frame-by-frame, thinks Lesley Manville is goddess and British actors, in general, are a class apart. Recently watched For Sama and Judy, and is rooting for Renee Zellweger’s performance in the latter.

She thinks the best poetry is being written in Poland, and is a die-hard admirer of Wislawa Szymborska, Vera Pavlova, Tadeusz Rozewicz. The day we meet, she was reading Egyptian poet Iman Mersal.

On OTT platforms, Sarghi is a fan of Fleabag and The Crown. Amongst the Indian ones, she liked The Family Man and thought the actresses in Soni were brilliant.

She rehearses at Starbucks early in the morning when it is the quietest.

Acting for the English literature graduate from Jalandhar goes way back to her theatre days in college. The academic, literary environment at home — mother, Tejinder Kaur, a retired professor, lyricist and screenwriter and father, Harjit Singh, a PhD scholar, former Doordarshan employee and Punjabi filmmaker — only helped in stoking the interest further. The siblings are also all as culturally inclined — filmmaker and singer brothers and a Kathak dancer sister. “We are a bhaand family (family of entertainers),” she laughs.

Husband Anurag Singh is the other sounding board. He had been a childhood friend; both their mothers were working in the same department in the university. “He was three when I was born and he visited the hospital with his mother to see me,” she laughs. They continue to be friends even in marriage and are brutally honest about each other’s work. He has seen and liked Chhapaak and wants to watch it again to discuss it in depth with her. She reads his film scripts to offer feedback from an actor’s perspective.

It wasn’t easy getting roles post moving to Mumbai after marriage, though she says the city felt like home; still does. Na Aana Is Des Laado on Colours TV that ran for four-and-a-half years was a success, and a huge financial support, but she lost interest when the story took a leap and things started getting way too stretched. She also did a small role of Manto’s sister in the Nandita Das biopic.

There was also a long period of depression to cope with in the middle, all due to lack of work. It was then that she started working on her own. She would religiously read a story or poem every day, something she keeps doing till date to keep her mind alive and centred. Sarghi also got associated with the group Jashn-E-Qalam that stages solo performances of stories. “I have not been without work for a single day since. Stories of Manto, Mohan Rakesh… I have kept performing something or the other,” she says. Some of the more celebrated ones have been performances of Mohan Rakesh’s Uski Roti and Rajendra Singh Bedi’s Lambi Ladki.

Being Bajaj

In the midst of this, her biggest role to date in Chhapaak came her way out of the blue. All because she decided to switch restaurants on an outing with her mother and bumped into casting director Gautam Kishanchandani and his assistant Desh Deepak who berated her for not responding to their audition messages. “I don’t know how I skipped seeing them,” says Sarghi, who went for the ‘lawyer test’, as she calls it, after a week’s preparation. It was January 3, 2019, she remembers, and the screening of the film for the cast and crew happened exactly a year after.

There is an honesty and transparency with which she tells you that she is not as sorted as Archana Bajaj, that she is not ambitious, just happy basking in the appreciation. There is no manager, agent or publicist around, no portfolio of photographs to pitch to the press, casting directors and producers alike; no chase for the lucre, only good substantive roles, even the length, number of scenes and dialogue don’t matter. “I am out of the rat race,” she says, even while being just at the start of it. At the moment she is working on a dramatic story reading and performance of another Mohan Rakesh story, Gunaah Belazzat. Sarghi hopes that more people get to watch Chhapaak, and that more Archana Bajajs would come her way.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/mfte88/article30840039.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/C1417BC7-6177-4AA8-BF36-9F2189D0AA00,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/how-art-helped-madhurjeet-sarghi-of-chhapaak-conquer-depression/article30840042.ece
180,2020/02/17,‘Queen of Katwe’ actor Nikita Pearl Waligwa dies aged 15,"The Ugandan, who played a memorable role in a 2016 Disney film about a local chess prodigy, had been in and out of hospital with a recurring brain tumor

A Ugandan student who played a memorable role in a 2016 Disney film about a local chess prodigy has died at the age of 15.

Nikita Pearl Waligwa died on Saturday at a hospital near the Ugandan capital, Kampala. The cause was a brain tumor, according to the girls’ secondary school she had attended since 2018.

She was “a darling to many,” Gayaza High School said on Twitter.

Local media reported that Waligwa had been in and out of hospital with a recurring brain tumor and had previously received treatment, including surgery, in India.

Tributes were coming in for her on social media as Ugandans expressed sadness and recalled her role in the 2016 movie directed by Mira Nair and filmed in Kampala.

Queen of Katwe follows the rise of Ugandan chess prodigy Phiona Mutesi as a chess player amid grinding poverty in the Kampala slum of Katwe, with her single mother barely able to support her and her two siblings.

181,2020/02/17,Can film songs be termed as ‘service’? Case filed by A.R. Rahman poses interesting questions,"The music director contends that his compositions for films are ‘original music work’, don’t attract service tax.

A case filed this week in the Madras High Court by Academy-award winning composer A.R. Rahman has brought forth an interesting question of law: whether songs and background score composed by a music director at the behest of a film producer and as per the requirements of the movie’s director could be termed as a ‘service’ liable to tax or not.

More interestingly, his case has posed a generic question whether a musician can claim copyright over songs composed by him on the basis of contractual obligations to a film’s producer, unlike instances of composing music on his/her own without being bound by such a contract and then assigning the copyright to the producer for a valuable consideration.

Documents accessed by The Hindu show that a Commissioner of Goods and Services Tax (GST) answered both the questions against Mr. Rahman in an order passed on October 17, 2019, accusing him of intentionally evading service tax payment of ₹6.79 crore and imposing a penalty of another ₹6.79 crore at the rate of 100% of tax supposedly evaded.

The order was passed after rejecting the musician’s contention that music composed for movies would also fall under the term ‘original music work’ as defined in Section 13(1)(a) of the Copyright Act of 1957 and therefore, he should be considered as a copyright owner, who simply transfers his right to the producer of a movie and therefore not liable to pay service tax.

Artistic works

Enunciating reasons for rejecting the contention, the Commissioner said Section 17 of the Copyright Act explains who could be the first owner of a copyright and it distinguishes between a ‘contract of service’ and a ‘contract for service’, with the latter being in the nature of artistic works performed by an employee at the behest of his/her employer.

After extracting certain clauses in agreements entered between Mr. Rahman and Thenandal Films for actor Vijay-starrer ‘Mersal’ and with Lyca Productions for Rajinikanth starrer ‘Robot 2.0’, the Commissioner said: “The above clauses clearly indicate that the nature of service is a ‘contract of service’ and ARR is not the original owner or author of the work/service he is providing.

“The agreement remains only a contract of service and mention of any assignment of copyright is only to camouflage the ‘service agreement’ as an ‘assigning agreement.’ It is also clear that the assessee is not producing music in his leisure and assigning it to the producers. It is the producers who enter into a service agreement to engage his services for scoring music.

“Therefore, in as much as the work of the composer/assessee is under a ‘contract of service’ and the music is made as per requirements of a film producer/director, the producer is the author of the copyright as per Section 17(c) of the Copyright Act... By no stretch of imagination, the assessee can be the original owner of copyright,” the Commissioner of GST had concluded.

The Commissioner also pointed out that Mr. Rahman was in the habit of receiving a composite amount from film producers for composing tunes, engaging singers, sound engineers and instrumentalists and also for recording the music. He does not hand over the musical notations to the producers. Only the recorded compositions are handed over in hard disks.

Of the composite amount, he used to earmark 10 to 15% towards sound recording expenses, since the songs got recorded in his own studio and had paid service tax for that recording expense alone.

“I find that ARR has artificially segregated the total consideration into taxable part and non-taxable part without any valid ground and paid service tax only for a meagre portion.

“He withheld all the related information from the knowledge of the department and contravened the provisions of the Finance Act of 1994 with the intention to evade payment of service tax,” the officer had said and invoked Section 78, which provides for penalty for failure to pay service tax for reasons of fraud, collusion, wilful misstatement or suppression of facts.

Now that Mr. Rahman has challenged the Commissioner’s order before the Madras High Court and also obtained an interim stay on the operation of the order, a final verdict in his case would have larger implications on the practices followed by various musicians in the Indian film industry.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/1e4pic/article30837770.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16FEBTHTHAFUTURES,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/case-filed-by-ar-rahman-poses-interesting-questions/article30837772.ece
182,2020/02/17,Farmers say TN must adopt Assembly resolution declaring Cauvery delta a protected zone​,"The demand is one of several of farmers who participated in a march in Krishnagiri district on Monday

Farmers’ leader P Ayyakannu on Monday said that the State government must adopt a resolution in the Legislative Assembly declaring the Cauvery delta a Protected Special Agricultural Zone, a move that Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami had announced recently. ​

Mr Ayyakannu, leader of a collective of farmers for the interlinking of national and south Indian rivers, led a march from Thumbalahalli in support of a charter of demands including nationalisation of rivers, loan repayment waivers, and implementation of water conservation projects locally.​

​The farmers who participated in the march, also urged the government to implement the Ennekol –Thumbalahalli water harvesting scheme that envisions extension of the left and right canals to tap the excess water in Thenpennai river to fill the intervening water bodies. The project that was announced at a cost of ₹276 crore last year is yet to see progress.​

​They also called for an immediate stay on the Mekadatu check dam under construction by Karnataka on river Cauvery; and ₹25 lakh as compensation to the families of farmers, who had committed suicide over farm distress. According to the farmers’ collective, over 300 farmers had committed suicide in recent years. ​

​The farmers demanded an increase in the procurement price of sugarcane to ₹6,000 per tonne. The government should ensure sustainable support prices for agricultural produce by farmers and ensure that farming become remunerative.​

​The protest march culminated at the Collectorate in Krishnagiri.​

185,2020/02/17,"Mischievous campaign instigated violence in Washermanpet, says Edappadi","The Chief Minister also said the Muslim community should reject false propaganda and cooperate with the government to maintain social harmony

Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Monday alleged that “some forces instigated” the untoward incidents in Washermanpet in Chennai, where a group of Muslim residents had organised protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) last Friday.​

“Tamil Nadu has witnessed similar protests, demonstrations and rallies in the past. The police officers provided security and no untoward incidents were witnessed. Now some forces instigated these incidents,” he charged while responding to DMK leader M.K. Stalin who raised the issue of police action against the protesters in Washermanpet.​

​Mr. Palaniswami said the Muslim community should reject false propaganda and acts of the miscreants and cooperate with the government to maintain social harmony. “The government of Amma (Jayalalithaa) will not allow anything against the minorities and it will remain a protector,” the Chief Minister said.​

Pointing out that permission for the protest was sought on behalf of 13 mosques only on February 13, the Chief Minister said that suddenly, 300 Muslims including 200 women assembled at the roundtana and raised slogans against the CAA. ​

​“The police held talks with them and advised against protests since it had thrown traffic flow out of gear. But they rejected the advice, raised slogans and resisted the police from detaining 40 persons. When the police kept the arrested persons in a bus, they smashed the window of the vehicle,” he said.​

The Chief Minister said the protest resumed at 6 p.m. following which a warning was issued as the protest was causing inconveniences to the public and had affected traffic flow. “They were asked to disperse. But the protesters threw bottles, chappals and stones at the police. Rajamangalam Sub-Inspector Rajkumar, constables Udayakumari and Kala were injured. IPS officer Vijayakumari was hit by a stone,” he said.​

Mr. Palaniswami said barricades were put up to prevent the protesters from causing damage to public property, but the protesters instigated the local people to push the barricades and the police. He added that 82 protesters were arrested and they broke the windows of the bus.​

The Chief Minister said the death of an elderly man Fazurulla due to natural causes was distorted as a death in the police action and it led to protests in Chennai and other areas.​

186,2020/02/17,"To improve quality of education, policy for training teachers released","The training proposes an all-round development of teachers including exposure of teachers to curriculum planning, professional ethics, communication skills, innovation, research and development and institution management

The National Institute of Technical Teacher Training and Research has uploaded on its website a comprehensive policy document on teacher training, with the aim of equipping teachers to improve the quality of education.

The policy envisages eight training module of 40 hours (eight weeks) each. Teachers would have to take up the courses mostly through Massive Open Online Courses, which will be linked to the University Grants Commission’s Swayam portal.

The training proposes an all-round development of teachers. It would include exposure of teachers to curriculum planning, professional ethics, communication skills, innovation, research and development and institution management.

In an interaction with stakeholders, the All India Council of Technical Education officials mentioned that young teachers must compulsorily undergo the training programmes

Teachers in government institutions have welcomed the policy. They were at the receiving end, as their Career Advancement benefits was delayed by several years as the teachers had not undergone structured training. Though all other institutions had implemented the 7th Pay Commission recommendation, engineering and polytechnic college teachers were denied pay revision as they could not complete the mandatory training. It was only on Thursday that the State Higher Education department formally approved the pay revision for the teachers.

“It is a good move as it will keep the teachers focused and remain engaged in the profession,” said a principal of a government engineering college.

A teacher from a polytechnic said the policy would enable teachers to learn multi-tasking. “The 360-degree feedback will assess the teacher’s strengths. It requires the teacher to participate in the management of the institute and not be content with producing results,” he said.

The teachers hope that the All India Council for Technical Education would make it a mandatory qualification for teachers in self-financing technical colleges too. “That only 10% of students are employable is a reflection of the quality of teachers. The AICTE should shut down institutions if they do not appoint qualified teachers,” said a representative of the technical teachers’ association.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/to-improve-quality-of-education-policy-for-training-teachers-released/article30841580.ece
187,2020/02/17,Tamil Nadu to implement staff rationalisation committee recommendations,"​The Staff Rationalisation Committee’s report, submitted to the Chief Minister last week, looks at rationalising revenue expenditure among other aspects ​

Within a day after of receiving the report of the Staff Rationalisation Committee headed by retired IAS officer S. Audiseshiah, the Tamil Nadu government on Friday informed the Legislative Assembly that it would implement its recommendations.​

​Though the government had, in its February 2019 government order, termed the committee the ‘Staff Rationalisation Committee’, in the State Budget Finance Minister O Panneerselvam referred to it as ‘Expenditure Rationalisation Committee’.​“I expect that the implementation of the recommendations of the Expenditure Rationalisation Committee will enable the government to substantially enhance productivity of government departments and thereby free up more resources for development programmes,” he said. ​

​The Committee had submitted its report to the Chief Minister on Thursday. “Through the implementation of the Integrated Financial and Human Resources Management System (IFHRMS), by modernising budget formulation and fiscal risk management, securing expert advice and consistent efforts within the government, I am confident the finances of the State will be even better managed in 2020-21,” he added.​

​Noting that Tamil Nadu continued to see sustained increase of its revenue deficit, the Deputy CM said the lag effect of the implementation of the 7th Central Pay Commission was among the reasons.​

​“Salary and pension-related expenditure shows a consistent increase. The government is committed to find ways to contain the overall level of non-development expenditure and find additional resources to finance growth-oriented expenditure,” he said.​

​The Staff Rationalisation Committee was one of the measures to assess the quality of revenue expenditure and to improve the expenditure profile by enhanced allocation to growth-oriented expenditure as well as to rationalise revenue expenditure.​

​A source said that the Committee had recommended the redeployment of additional staff to departments where there is a shortage. “That way, the expenditure might come down,” the source added.​

​The Tamil Nadu Government Employees’ Association president M. Anbarasu however, told The Hindu: “The very fact that the report was submitted on Thursday and government decided to implement it the following day shows it wants to outsource people for government work.”​

​While several lakh youth were waiting for employment and about 4 lakh posts in the government were lying vacant, the decision only showed the government wanted to reduce the number of permanent staff, he felt. He also pointed out that the IFHRMS was handled by a corporate major. ​",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/o58z8b/article30840351.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17FEBTH-RATIONALISATION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tamil-nadu-to-implement-rationalisation-committee-recommendations/article30840353.ece

189,2020/02/17,AIADMK has perfected the art of funny money accounting: P.T.R. Palanivel Thiagarajan,"The numbers provided in the Budget are meaningless, says DMK’s IT wing chief

The AIADMK government has presented a Budget without populist schemes. DMK IT wing head and legislator Palanivel Thiagarajan, a former banker, contends that populist schemes might come as part of the Chief Minister’s announcements and why such announcements under Rule 110 in the Assembly are bad. In an interview with The Hindu on Sunday, he accuses the AIADMK government of managing the economy badly and also talks about his party affairs. Excerpts:

Just a year before the 2021 Assembly polls, Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam in the last full Budget of this government did not announce any populist scheme. Do you think rising debts could be a reason?

They [The government] have already projected rather massive schemes and grants and subsidies year after year. Just because the Finance Minister has not announced populist schemes, doesn’t mean they are not going to do it. I believe these numbers [provided in the Tamil Nadu Budget] are just meaningless numbers. The gap between what they said they will do in the Budget, what they said they have done in revised estimates and what they end up doing eventually is huge. Even between the revised estimate and the final account, there has been an increase. In the 2019-2020 Budget, they said they would have a revenue deficit of ₹14,000 crore in 2019-20, but in the revised estimate the figure went up to ₹25,000 crore. They have perfected the art of funny money accounting.

In the old days, Ministers did their respective jobs. But now, the Chief Minister has to announce all new schemes under Rule 110. I guarantee you that between now and Thursday next, the CM will make some announcements under Rule 110. This is bad not just for democracy, but also for administration. It is bad for administration because it concentrates power in one person. Bad for democracy, in the sense, what is the point of having a legislature and a Cabinet? So, I don’t yet share your optimism that because of the large debt, they will not undertake irresponsible populist schemes.

The DMK aspires to come to power in 2021, and if that happens, how do you plan to handle the situation of the rising debt and manage the economy?

I am not senior enough in the party to make policy decisions. My leader will show us the way. But in my professional opinion, as a former banker, I think we have to consider some fundamental restructuring, because we have reached a point where the non-discretionary spending – pensions, salary, non-wage operational and maintenance expense and interest charges – has taken up almost 100% of the State’s own revenue. That means there is no money left to do anything discretionary. However, you cannot really cut any of the first three non-discretionary spending items, but you can cut down the fourth – interest charges. Total interest charges have escalated beyond all measures.

People who do not admit their problems, can’t begin to fix them. I have been saying since 2016 that our State’s biggest problem is that the revenue as a percentage on GSDP [Gross State Domestic Product] has dropped dramatically. It has dropped from 14.45% during ‘‘Thalaivar” Kalaignar [M. Karunanidhi]’s rule to 12.67% during “Ammaiyar’s” [Jayalalithaa’s] rule to 10.4% during this rule. There are certain expenses you cannot cut out — pensions, salaries, non-wage operational and maintenance and interest payments.

The AIADMK has revoked its decision to hold public exams for Class V and VIII. The Chief Minister has won praise for announcing that the Cauvery Delta would be declared as Protected Special Agriculture Zone. Some of your allies too welcomed it. Does the DMK have any issues to campaign against the government?

Just because they corrected their mistake [implementing public exams for Class V and VIII], doesn’t mean we have the same ideology. The DMK is for the Special Agriculture Zone but we are asking as to how the government is going to implement it. There are several other issues on which the AIADMK is on the other side of us. Why didn’t they get their alliance party [the BJP] to exempt Tamil Nadu from NEET? DMK wants more federalism, less interference from the Centre, less imposition of Hindi. We are against the CAA-NRC-NPR, we are against the new educational policy. But the AIADMK government doesn’t seem to oppose any of these.

Founded in 1949, the DMK has been led by stalwarts, including C.N. Annadurai and M. Karunanidhi. Should a party as big as the DMK need external hand-holding by electoral strategist Prashant Kishor?

As a former consultant (for over a decade before I was a banker), it’s a deeply personal question. I feel that many powerful people in the world engage specialists as and when required. I have been a consultant for several large multi-national corporates. Every person, who has a unique skill, can offer advice as long as they can add value to any organisation. Mr. Kishor has worked as a consultant for the BJP. Does it mean that he has shaped Mr. Modi’s policies? Such a man should be seen as a professional, who comes in as an adviser for a specific subject such as campaign strategy. Consultants work for different competitors in the same industry. The reason they are brought in as consultants is that they have a broader view than internal office-bearers. Mr. Kishor has now clearly developed a particular philosophy. He is pro-Constitution, against centralisation, against autocracy, against the CAA, the NRC and the NPC and pro-federalism. He has exited the JD (U) over the CAA.

Senior BJP leader L. Ganesan has alleged that the DMK is instigating the anti-CAA protests in Tamil Nadu. Your views…

I am appalled. It is morally reprehensible. I am a Hindu and I have faith. And I think a true Hindu would not thrust his belief on others and, in fact, would defend others’ faith as his own. The BJP is doing politics by dividing people based on religion. I think that is vile and uncouth and in fact, ‘un-Hindu’. My grandfather had the main idol in Sabarimala made by a ‘sthapathi’ in Swamimalai and donated it to the temple. The DMK, through its ‘thiruppanis’ while in government, has done more service to Hinduism than all Brahmins combined. I venture to say that I have done more for temples and Hindus’ events than Mr. Ganesan and H. Raja combined.

Revenue Minister R.B. Udhayakumar has said only those without proper understanding of the CAA are protesting...

The CAA is not a complicated law. Union Home Minister Amit Shah had said “Aap chronology samajh lijiye” [You all please understand the chronology – to say that the CAB will come and then the NRC]”. Either Mr. Udhayakumar is genuinely unaware of the CAA or he is playing petty politics. Let Mr. Udhayakumar print pamphlets over the CAA and carry out a campaign in support of the CAA or let him explain what Mr. Shah has said is not true, or will not happen.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/4eibmy/article30839532.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH17PTRPALANIVELTHIAGARAJANDMK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/aiadmk-has-perfected-the-art-of-funny-money-accounting/article30839534.ece

191,2020/02/17,Teachers against holding training sessions ahead of board exams,"Back-to-back programmes leave them with very little time for students.

A slew of initiatives taken by the School Education Department, which has resulted in scheduling of back-to-back training programmes ahead of the board exams, has left teachers of government and government-aided schools concerned.

Among the training programmes, graduate teachers who handle Classes VI to X are expected to attend a post National Achievement Survey (NAS) programme, which will begin for teachers in Chennai this week.

Besides, teachers are undergoing an ICT training programme in effectively using technology in classrooms for their subjects as well as spoken English training sessions.

“Teachers handling Class X, XI and XII in particular should be exempted from attending any training programmes from January to March in the academic year. Students who are going to take up board exams are dependent on their teachers for revisions and they should not be away from school at this critical time,” said P.K. Ilamaran, president, Tamil Nadu Teachers’ Association.

With a revamped syllabus, the Education Department has been hosting programmes to ensure that it is implemented well across schools. An official said teachers from senior classes, especially those handling students taking board exams, are not expected to attend training sessions. But the association president said this was overlooked by the different bodies that conduct these programmes. “Many teachers handling Class X end up having to attend these programmes,” Mr. Ilamaran said.

Change of schedule

Stating that they had represented the issue to the Education Department in the past, P. Patric Raymond from the Tamil Nadu Graduate Teachers’ Association, said every teacher ended up attending at least five days of training from January.

“With practical and revision exams going on for students, we are left with very less time to coach them. Since the first term generally has the most number of working days, we would prefer if these training programs are accommodated then or even at the beginning of the summer holidays for a week,” he added.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/s3gi8t/article30837813.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16FEBTHSAMAGRASHIKSHA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/teachers-against-holding-training-sessions-ahead-of-board-exams/article30837814.ece

193,2020/02/17,Tamil Nadu’s Combai joins CRPF,"The dog breed is known for its fearlessness and loyalty to its owners

Combai, a dog breed from Tamil Nadu, known for its fearlessness and loyalty to its owners, has joined the Dog Breeding and Training School of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), Bengaluru, on a pilot basis.

“We have received two puppies from R. Aravindraj of Madurai. One more puppy will join the training school,” said Mr. Ravindra, M.L. DIGP, CRPF, who was instrumental in inducting the dog breed into the school.

Mr. Aravindraj, who has been breeding Combais for many years, presented two puppies to P. Manoj Kumar, Commandant, CRPF, after coming to know about the CRPF’s plan to acquire Combais.

“I have 30 dogs, and my purpose is to popularize the breed. I prefer to sell dogs only to those who approach me with references from my friends. I have given a male and a female puppy to the CRPF. I will give one more female puppy to them,” Mr. Aravindraj said.

Multiple tasks

In his book The Ultimate History of over 1000 Dog Breeds, Zoologist Desmond Morris said Combais had the ability to overcome almost any obstacle in their path. They are fast, muscular, powerful and athletic. The breed is normally used for boar hunting and guarding. Its coat is usually reddish brown, with a paler underside.

At present, the CRPF has the Belgian Malinois, and is the first agency to successfully train the renowned dog breed. In Bengaluru, they train dogs for multiple tasks, including sniffing, tracking and assault, and the Belgian Malinois perfectly suits the purpose.

“We also considered the idea of training native breeds as part of research and development, so that we need not depend fully on foreign breeds. Last year, we trained two mongrels and two Mudhol hounds, and after 40 weeks of training, they were sent for field trials. We read about Combai and found that it was good at guarding and hunting and was a one-man dog when it comes to obedience. Its temperament suits us,” Arun Kumar, AC (Training Officer), CRPF, and a native of Erode, explained.

In the CRPF, the training for the dogs will start after they cross 90 days of age, and puppies will be brought to the school when they are 45 days old.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/xxordu/article30837620.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th17combai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tamil-nadus-combai-joins-crpf/article30837621.ece
194,2020/02/17,Shaheen Bagh-style anti-CAA protest enters day 3 in Chennai,"For protesters, Old Washermanpet venue is now ‘Shaheenpet’

Drawing inspiration from the Shaheen Bagh protests in Delhi, thousands of protesters in Chennai, mainly women, continued their agitation for the third day on Sunday, raising slogans against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens.

The protesters were firm in their demand that the Tamil Nadu government should pass an Assembly resolution stating that the NPR will not be implemented in the State.

The protests, which began on Friday afternoon on two narrow streets — the Sajja Munusamy Street and the Aziz Mohamed Street — in response to police excesses against agitators, continued with the same zeal and vigour on Sunday evening too.

Sunday surge

Being a Sunday, the third day of the protests saw women from various parts of the city pour into the venue. Sitting shoulder-to-shoulder, they raised slogans throughout the day. “Combining Shaheen Bagh and Washermanpet, we have coined a new name — Shaheenpet. This will provide us a unique identity,” a protester said.

The posters on the walls pinned the blame on the BJP government at the Centre, the RSS, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah. Posters condemning the NRC and the CAA, made by the women protesters, dotted the walls on both the streets.

Since Saturday evening, a few non-Muslims have been providing parottas and rotis to the protesters.

On Sunday afternoon, a few of them were seen providing tea to the protesters. “Hindus and Muslims have been living peacefully here. Many Muslims have been living here for decades, running businesses like biscuit-making units, hardware shops, garment shops, etc. Even at the time of the Babri Masjid demolition, we were living harmoniously. Hence, my family and I try to help the protesters,” said R. Lalithaa, a resident.

Volunteers, both young and old, male and female, provided water and other refreshments to the protesters on a hot, sunny day. Many of them criticised the manner in which the protesters were being portrayed in some sections of the media, and urged Hindus to support their cause. A couple of speakers sought to refute allegations that the agitators had been paid and that the protests had been orchestrated with a “sinister agenda”.

“If someone asks you who is behind these protests, tell them that you are protesting because of Prime Minister Modi and Amit Shah,” said a speaker at Sunday’s protest. Teenagers came forward to sing and raise slogans against CAA-NRC-NPR, as chants of Azadi reverberated in the locality.

Coinciding with the glittering opening of BioAsia 2020, the 17th in the annual series of Life Sciences and Biotechnology convention on Monday, was commissioning of a facility each of contract research organisation Syngene International and pharma company Biological E (BE) in Genome Valley.

The two facilities were inaugurated by Industries and IT Minister K.T.Rama Rao earlier in the day. He also mentioned about them in his speech at the BioAsia inaugural later, pointing to how Hyderabad was attracting more investments in the Life Sciences space.

Stating that Syngene’s decision would further consolidate Hyderabad’s position as a global R&D hub, the Minister said the first phase of the company facility in Genome Valley has been built with an investment of ₹170 crore.

Syngene managing director Kiran Mazumdar Shaw said it was the first Syngene facility in Hyderabad and there were plans to invest more. It will be fully commissioned by the end of this year and cover a total of 94,000 sq ft and house around 270 scientists. Initially, the company will offer Discovery Chemistry services from Hyderabad. In the next phase, other research services will move to this centre providing research to the world’s leading pharmaceutical companies.

On the Biological E’s vaccine facility, Mr.Rao said its foundation was laid during BioAsia in 2017.

Commercial production

In a statement, Biological E Managing Director Mahima Datla said the company has invested around ₹300 crore on the plant, located on about 29 acres and ready for commercial production. The plant would generate employment opportunities for around 1,000 people. “This new facility will help our existing vaccines plant enhance the production and manufacture new products, which are in the pipeline,’’ she said.

Mr.Rao also unveiled a new Typhoid Conjugate Vaccine (TCV). BE said it received authorisation from the health regulatory authorities of India recently to license and market a new Typhoid Conjugate Vaccine.

This vaccine has been developed in partnership with the GSK Vaccines Institute for Global Health, Italy, which first developed the asset and transferred it to BE in 2013. Subsequent developmental work on the vaccine was done by BE, including manufacturing process optimisation and scale up, pre-clinical studies and full clinical trials in India. This vaccine will be manufactured in BE’s GMP manufacturing facilities in Hyderabad and could be commercially available within three months.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/syngene-biological-e-facilities-opened/article30845063.ece
197,2020/02/17,"Peak power demand cross 12,000 MW barrier for first time in TS","Consumption from agriculture, irrigation sectors jacks up demand

The peak power demand on the system crossed the 12,000 MW barrier in Telangana for the first time on Monday morning as the consumption of energy by the agriculture and irrigation sectors zoomed as part of the ongoing rabi cultivation operations.

According to the energy officials, the previous highest demand on the system was eclipsed on Sunday when the demand clocked 11,783 MW against 11,703 MW recorded on August 30 last year (2019). However, in terms of energy consumption in a day, August 30, 2019 remains at the top as the consumption was recorded at 241.68 million units (MU) against 235.56 MU clocked on Sunday.

“The intra-day peak demand touched about 12,060 MW on Monday at 10.15 a.m. with major spike in demand from the agriculture (pump sets) and irrigation (lifts) sectors. We expect the peak demand of power move towards 13,000 MW mark and energy consumption towards 250 MU mark this season,” a senior executive of TS-Transco said adding that they were prepared to meet the demand.

The official attributed the increased demand of energy to cultivation of paddy in a huge extent of over 10.81 lakh hectares, the highest ever, during the rabi season in the State as also the consumption from lift irrigation projects such as Kaleshwaram and Kalwakurthy. Cultivation of rabi crops with groundwater such as maize and groundnut is also high this season.

There are about 25 lakh agriculture pumpsets availing 24x7 free power supply in the State and the groundwater table has improved by 3 meters as in January compared to the same period last year. Good monsoon rains as well as filling of thousands of minor irrigation tanks with the operation of Kaleshwaram, Kalwakurthy, Nettempadu, Bhima, Koilsagar, Sitarama and Srisailam Left Bank Canal (AMRP) lift irrigation projects as also other smaller lifts has helped improve the average groundwater table from 11.88 meters below ground level to 8.88 meters this January, according to agriculture department officials.

“The intra-day peak on Monday was due to the operation of a maximum number of agriculture pumpsets and running of all the 11 motors with 40 MW capacity each in the Kannepally pump house to lift back Godavari water from Gayatri (Medigadda) barrage to Saraswati (Annaram) barrage for their backward journey towards Sundilla and Yellampally barrages and to Mid Manair reservoir through Nandi Medaram and Laxmipur pump houses as part of the Kaleshwaram project,” the official explained.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/38lfhr/article30844756.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy17Pump,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/peak-power-demand-cross-12000-mw-barrier-for-first-time-in-ts/article30844757.ece
198,2020/02/17,Drone used in Sircilla for seed ball dispersal,"If there is an award for the effort towards afforestation on Chief Minister K.Chandrasekhar Rao’s 66th birthday on Monday, Marut Drones will emerge as a strong contender for the same.

The start-up company in drone technology applications, together with the Forest department, has attempted dispersal of 15,000 seed balls in the forests near Veernapally village of Rajanna Sircilla district in a single day. They have performed the feat through a custom-made drone flying at a height of 40 to 50 feet above ground, which they say is a pilot effort. “We have designed the drone especially for seed ball dispersal, and equipped it with a carrying capacity of 400 balls, which could be bombed into the area at the rate of one ball per second,” shared Prem Kumar Vislawath, CEO and Founder of Marut Drones.

It took a seven-month effort to design the prototype, since the company received a requisition from the Environment and Forests, and IT departments. The idea was said to be the brainchild of Minister K.T. Rama Rao who represented the Sircilla constituency.While the seed ball technology is not new, the method used to distribute them in a forest area is, says Mr.Vislawath.

As part of Telangana Ku Haritha Haaram programme, the Forest department had already attempted barren hill afforestation by way of seed ball dispersal through manual means. However, it was proven to be largely ineffective, as the seedlings sprouting from the seed balls became victims of cattle grazing.

Seed balls are prepared using red soil, cow dung, cow urine, chickpea flour, and jaggery, into which one or multiple seeds are ingrained based on the size. They have a year’s time till germination, hence could be dispersed much before actual monsoons, say officials.

For drone dispersal, seeds of forest variety Ficus (Raavi, Marri, and Juvvi), Seetaphal, Wood-apple, Seema Chintha (Pithecellobium dulce), and Beechwood were used, which are hardy varieties and can survive with very little water, they said.

An effort was made to record the coordinates of where each seed ball hit the ground. The information will be processed to a geo-tag them, says Mr.Vislawath, adding that his next target is to disperse one lakh seed balls in a day. Costing ₹8 lakh for designing, prototyping and automation, the exercise was done free of charge for the government.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/drone-used-in-sircilla-for-seed-ball-dispersal/article30844632.ece
199,2020/02/17,"Telangana to give fillip to life sciences sector, says KTR","Eyes doubling of enterprise value to $100 billion, Minister tells BioAsia meet

Telangana government is pursuing a vision of doubling growth of life sciences sector in the State to $100 billion and help create four lakh new jobs this decade, Industries and IT Minister K.T.Rama Rao told BioAsia 2020, a three-day conference devoted to the sector that began here on Monday.

The approach to consolidate on Hyderabad’s emergence as a major hub for life sciences in Asia will be supported by the government’s Life Sciences Grid, a plan to create a network of infrastructure, stakeholders, skilled workforce and efficient processes.

With more than 800 pharma, biotech and medical technology firms, Telangana has a combined enterprise value of $50 billion, Mr.Rao said, adding Hyderabad’s share in national pharma production was over 35% and it also contributed to one-third of global vaccine output.

The Minister, who earlier presented the Genome Valley Excellence Award to Dr.Carl June, pioneer of CAR-T Cell Therapy for cancer treatment, said Hyderabad Pharma City project will be the largest initiative under the Grid plan.

Pharma City

All planning works to establish the Pharma City were complete. Statutory clearances, including environmental clearance were in place. The Centre has also accorded the project the status of National Investment and Manufacturing Zone. “We are very close to land allotments to industries,” Mr.Rao said.

Expansion of Genome Valley Life Sciences clusters was another component of the Grid. Preparation of Genome Valley 2.0 masterplan was completed and “we are looking at improving the social infrastructure around the cluster,” he said. For the setting of B-Hub, first-of-its-kind scale up manufacturing facility in Genome Valley, the Centre’s Department of Biotechnology has agreed to partner with the State government. The project will be grounded in next two months and will feature a growth phase park, 200 L single-use scale-up manufacturing facility and also training as part of its mandate.

Med Devices Park

Figuring in the Grid plan was the setting up of country’s largest medical devices park, on over 276 acres, near Hyderabad. Within two years, over 20 companies were already setting up their manufacturing and R&D units, he said. Stating that Hyderabad, with its strengths in technology and life sciences, is well positioned to contribute to the global efforts in Digital Medicine Space, Mr.Rao said Telangana government is committed to building capabilities of tomorrow.

It plans to establish a world-class institution focused on curative therapies in Hyderabad in partnership with Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB). The institute will be engaged in affordable development and commercialisation of the new age curative therapies.

Network of innovators

Switzerland is the partner country for BioAsia. Addressing the gathering, Ambassador of Switzerland Andreas Baum said platforms like BioAsia offered scope for the network of innovators and exchange of ideas between the two countries to be grown stronger.

The session was witness to signing of an MoU for setting up of India outpost of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in Hyderabad. Industries Secretary Jayesh Ranjan and Peter Piot from the School exchanged the documents.

202,2020/02/17,Cabinet resolution against CAA is ridiculous: Laxman,"State governments are bound to enact law passed by Parliament, says State BJP chief

Telangana state BJP president K. Laxman on Monday decried the decision of State Cabinet to pass a resolution against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in the State Assembly on the lines of other states.

In an informal chat with reporters here, Mr. Laxman said it was ridiculous that the State Cabinet led by Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has decided to pass a resolution and demanded abrogation of CAA when the law enacted by Parliament is getting ready for implementation in the country.

The State BJP chief wondered whether the Chief Minister read the Constitution as he claimed to have read thousands of books or an announcement was made after the Cabinet just to satisfy MIM which is protesting against CAA.

Dr. B. R. Ambedkar, architect of Indian Constitutions, has clearly explained about the law and State governments are bound to implement the law enacted and passed by Parliament, he said adding that the State Cabinet decision is against the spirit of the Constitution. Even eminent lawyer and senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal had also said that there is no way a State can deny the implementation of the CAA when it is already passed by Parliament, Mr. Laxman quoted.

Only for refugees

The CAA is to accord citizenship to those minorities who faced religious persecution in Islamic countries of Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh and living as refugees in our country, he clarified and said the CAA is nothing to do with Indian citizens. He wanted to know whether KCR wanted to give citizenship to Muslims of Islamic countries. If so let him pass a resolution in the State Assembly urging Central government to give citizenship to Muslims of other countries, he asked.

Taking a dig at the KCR and KTR who always advocate not to discriminate on the basis of religion, Mr. Laxman said: “you have no moral rights to talk on discrimination on basis of religion when your government has given 12 % reservation to Muslims.”

‘Pakistani agenda’

In a series of tweets, Bharatiya Janata Party national general secretary P. Muralidhar Rao brought the Telangana Cabinet’s stand against the Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019 into cross-hairs and accused the Telangana government of being ‘aligned’ with Pakistani agenda against India.

In a series of tweets he said: “This entire effort is completely in alignment with Pakistani mischievous campaign against India. Telangana people will not accept this divisive vote bank campaign. #IndiaSupportsCAA“.

In another tweet he questioned why Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao wants to allegedly accord citizenship to Muslims from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan, and also Rohingyas.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/2qnzac/article30844549.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY18KLAXMAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/cabinet-resolution-against-caa-is-ridiculous-laxman/article30844550.ece
203,2020/02/17,Mystery shrouds death of three of family,"Submerged car with decomposed bodies found in Kakatiya Canal during efforts to trace another drowning victim

Three persons of a family, who were missing since the last 20 days, were found dead under mysterious circumstances in their car in Kakatiya Canal waters at Alugunur on the outskirts and their decomposed bodies were fished out on Monday.

The irrigation officials had reduced the release of waters from LMD reservoir into the Kakatiya Canal to retrieve the body of a woman who drowned in the canal waters on Sunday night. The couple Pradeep and his wife Keerthana were proceeding on their motorbike to Ganneruvaram from Karimnagar when their bike plunged into the canal. The police rescued Pradeep while Keerthana was washed away.

In order to retrieve the body of Keerthana, the police asked the irrigation authorities to reduce the flow into the canal. However, the police were shocked to find a car submerged in the water and with three decomposed dead bodies. A huge crane was pressed into service to lift the vehicle to the bund and the bodies were retrieved.

With the help of the vehicle number, the police could identify the victims as Nareddy Satyanarayana Reddy (55), a businessman, his wife Radha (50) a government teacher and daughter Vinayasri, who is studying dental science course in Nizamabad. Incidentally, the family is related to Peddapalli legislator Dasari Manohar Reddy. Radha was his own sister.

Police sources said that the victims residing in Bank Colony here were on a tour on January 27 evening. The police suspect that their car might have plunged accidentally into the canal on their way to Hyderabad and not noticed by anyone. As the water flow was heavy, the car was completely submerged.

Commissioner of Police V.B. Kamalasan Reddy said that they have no information about how the accident took place and added that they had instructed trainee IPS Nikitha Pant to investigate into the case.

Expressing shock and grief over the accidental death of his sister Radha and her family members, Peddapalli legislator D Manohar Reddy, however, ruled out any foul play in the death of his relatives. He said that the narrow road at the canal and non-availability of barricading might have caused the accident.

“Usually, the family goes on a pilgrimage occasionally and we expected that they were on tour. We all expected that they would return soon. We never expected that they would be found dead in the canal,” he added.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/5jgst9/article30844463.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY18DRWON,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/mystery-shrouds-death-of-three-of-family/article30844464.ece

205,2020/02/17,Absence of barricades at canals causing accidents,"During the last one month, three major accidents took place in Kakatiya Canal

The Kakatiya Canal in Alugunur on the outskirts here , which is infested with mosquitoes and insects, is now posing an additional problem with the risk of people falling into the canal due to absence of barricade and barriers to prevent accidents.

During the last one month period, three major accidents took place in the Kakatiya Canal at Alugunur killing six persons. In one mishap, a car-borne couple from Sultanabad drowned when their car fell into the water they were reversing after purchasing fish near the bund. On Sunday, a motorcyclist plunged into the canal as he lost control after an insect hit his eye. His wife died and he was rescued by the police.

In another incident which took place some 20 days ago, a family of three members, who were close relatives of Peddapalli legislator D Manohar Reddy, are feared to have drowned after their car plunged into the canal. All the above incidents took place due to lack of railings and radium signboards to warn about the canal and due to darkness.

At nights, people coming from Karimnagar and going to Hyderabad, who are unfamiliar with the area which is elevated and suddenly opens on the left into the canal, slip and fall into the canal as there are no barricades and radium signboards. Even on the Hyderabad to Karimnagar direction the road leads directly into the canal in the absence of barriers.

Similarly, the SRSP canals at various parts of the integrated Karimnagar district are also posing threat to the road users during the nights due to non-availability of barricades and signboards informing about the canal and narrow road. At several places such as Gattududdenapalli, Huzurabad, Kothapalli, Edulagattepalli, Jagtial and Peddapalli where the SRSP canals pass, there is a serious threat to road users in the absence of barricading and damaged railings.

Vishwa Prakash, a faculty of a private engineering college in Thimmapur mandal, who passes everyday on his motorcycle on this road, complains that they face several problems on this stretch. “We travel every day and we know how to go safely, but people who are unfamiliar with the road and canal are suffering a lot,” he said.

208,2020/02/17,Saplings planted on Legislature premises to mark CM’s birthday,"Council chairman and Legislative Affairs Minister want CM to render services at national level

The talk of Chief Minister and Telangana Rashtra Samithi president K. Chandrasekhar Rao playing an active role at the national level surfaced yet again after lying dormant for some time.

Legislative Council Chairman G. Sukhender Reddy and Legislative Affairs Minister V. Prashanth Reddy wished that the TRS president render his services at the national level. Mr. Sukhender Reddy recalled how the Chief Minister’s birthday was being celebrated by all sections with fervour and said the Chief Minister gave ample uplift to the sections that were neglected in the past.

Schemes like Rythu Bandhu introduced by the TRS government had become role models for the country and the Chief Minister should render services at the national level. Mr. Prashanth Reddy wanted the Chief Minister to continue serving the people for the coming three decades.

They were speaking after planting saplings on the legislature premises to mark the Chief Minister’s 66th birthday on Monday. Assembly Speaker Pocharam Srinivas Reddy accompanied by Government chief whip D. Vinay Bhaskar, BJP MLC N. Ramachandra Rao and Legislature secretary V. Narasimha Charyulu planted saplings in the Assembly precincts to mark the occasion.

The Speaker released the Assembly Diary as well as a booklet on Who’s Who of the legislature.

209,2020/02/17,"BJP, TRS governments against quota for dalits and tribals, says TPCC","SC judgement that reservation was not a fundamental right is shocking, says TPCC president

Several Congress leaders have accused the BJP-led government at the Centre of moving towards scrapping of reservation to the socially backward sections — Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Other Backward Classes and Minorities. They also alleged that TRS government in the State is also against the reservation to those communities.

Participating in a protest organised by the Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) here on Monday, its president N. Uttam Kumar Reddy alleged that the BJP and TRS governments at the Centre and in the State were against continuation of caste-based reservation and they were in favour of scrapping such quota.

A host of Congress leaders, including AICC in-charge of party affairs in Telangana R.C. Khutia, TPCC working presidents A. Revanth Reddy, Ponnam Prabhakar and J. Kusum Kumar, former PCC presidents Ponnala Lakshmaiah, V. Hanumantha Rao, former ministers K. Jana Reddy, J. Geetha Reddy, T. Jeevan Reddy, G. Chinna Reddy, Md. Ali Shabbir, M. Kodanda Reddy, former MPs Mallu Ravi and Madhu Yaskhi Goud, AICC spokesperson D. Shravan and others, participated in the protest.

Non-political protest

Mr. Uttam Kumar Reddy said the verdict of the Supreme Court stating that reservation for SCs and STs was not a fundamental right was “shocking”. He attributed the judgement to the misleading and wrong representation made by the Centre on the issue. Alleging that BJP and RSS were against reservation for SC, ST, OBC and minorities, the TPCC chief said the Congress party would never let them succeed in their goal of scrapping reservation.

Terming the protest taken up by the Congress as non-political, the TPCC president said it was organised to infuse confidence among dalit, tribal, backward classes and minorities communities. The apex court judgement had created lot of confusion and the Centre was not giving any clarity by re-assuring the SC, ST, OBC and minorities that the ongoing quota would remain intact.

Stating that it was only the Congress party that had empowered dalit and other weaker sections, Mr. Reddy slammed TRS for its silence on the promise of enhancing quota for Muslims and STs in Telangana. He pointed out that TRS MPs did not raise the issue in Parliament even once. Stating that there were no legal hurdles involved in enhancing ST quota, he demanded increase in quota for them to 10% without further delay.

Mr. Uttam Kumar Reddy noted that Congress regime in the past had introduced reservation in the premier professional educational institutions such as IITs and IIMs and said it was done as part of empowering those sections. He demanded that the Centre take curative legal and legislative measures to protect SC, ST reservation in the wake of Supreme Court judgement.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/yieqin/article30843717.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy17Uttam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/bjp-trs-governments-against-quota-for-dalits-and-tribals-says-tpcc/article30843718.ece
210,2020/02/17,Minister asks redgram farmers not to resort to distress sale,"Government willing to spend ₹200 crore to buy the produce

Minister for Agriculture S. Niranjan Reddy has assured the redgram farmers not to worry about sale of their produce and not go for distress sale as the State government would purchase it at the minimum support price of ₹5,800 per quintal by sparing ₹200 crore for the purpose.

He stated here on Monday that repeated requests by the State government to the Centre to increase the redgram procurement quota of 47,500 tonnes in Telangana under the price support scheme at MSP by the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation (Nafed) had fallen on deaf ears. “Surely, it’s not the way to achieve the goal of doubling the farmers’ income by 2022 set by the Centre as the production of the pulse crop is estimated to be about 2.3 lakh tonnes this year,” the Minister said speaking to reporters here.

The Minister cautioned the officials against colluding with traders or brokers who bring the commodity to procurement centres illegally. He also wanted the officials to improve vigilance in the State borders with Karnataka, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh to prevent flow of the produce to the markets and procurement centres in Telangana.

With the help of good monsoon season and increased irrigation with the diversion of Godavari and Krishna waters, cultivation of crops in the kharif season was taken up in about 46.65 lakh hectares, including cotton in 19.9 lakh ha, paddy in 13.63 lakh ha and redgram in 2.86 lakh ha, the Minister said adding that both paddy and cotton were being procured till the last quantity of produce with the farmers.

Mr. Niranjan Reddy also criticised the Centre for neglecting the Telangana’s plea for establishing a turmeric board in the State as export of the raw and processed crop would bring in foreign exchange. He thanked the farming community for standing behind Telangana Rashtra Samithi in the cooperative elections.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/t943gf/article30845913.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY18SNIRANJANREDDY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/minister-asks-redgram-farmers-not-to-resort-to-distress-sale/article30843159.ece
211,2020/02/17,Telangana Cabinet requests Centre to abrogate CAA,"The KCR-led government intends to move a resolution to this effect in the Telangana Assembly

The Telangana Cabinet has requested the Central government to take steps to abrogate the Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2019 as it will lead to discrimination on the basis of religion while granting citizenship and, thereby, jeopardise secularism envisaged in the Constitution.

It was decided to pass a resolution to this effect in the State Assembly as was done in Kerala, Punjab, Rajasthan and West Bengal, a release said.

The Cabinet also appealed to the Union government not to discriminate people on the basis of religion for according Indian citizenship. All religions must be treated on par in the eyes of law.

Last month, during a press meet, Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao said the CAA had damaged India’s reputation abroad as a peace-loving country and this was not at all good for the country where people had coexisted for centuries.

212,2020/02/17,Eight Indian and Korean ceramic artists come together in a collaboration at Kalakshetra,"Earth Matters — 3, an exhibition, will be on display from February 27 to March 3 at DakshinChitra

The smoke that emanates from the many kilns at Kalakshetra’s Ceramics Department signals a flurry of activity. The smell of burnt earth hangs in the air as one walks into the otherwise quiet, and hidden part of the campus which houses a workspace. For the past few weeks, this has been the second home for a group of Indian and Korean artists who are seated near a calming mini-pond. By the end of February, whatever they are working on will materialise into a display titled Earth Matters - 3 — an attempt at exploring ideas and thoughts that pertain to Nature.

InKo Centre, in association with Clayarch Gimhae Museum in Korea, Kalakshetra Foundation, and DakshinaChitra, has brought four Korean and four Indian ceramic artists to create a multicultural dialogue in the medium.

The crowded workspace lends to a collage of sights; while coffee is being brewed in one corner, a figurine of Buddha takes form in another. In the backyard, the first batch of sculptures are being fired. On one of the worktables, artist Suh Sanghee is finishing a bust on clay while referring to a picture on her phone. “The picture is that of one of our helpers here. He is the only one who could make friends with the dogs here,” she laughs. Her finished figurative works include the busts of Ganesha, Buddha and the figurine of a cow.

“Many people come to India to find enlightenment and peace, so did I. I was looking for happiness. But the first thing that struck me was what the figure of Ganesha means to people here,” says Sanghee who will present five works in the exhibit, adding that the idea was to create structures that ultimately redefined the meaning of happiness for her. On the other hand, Park Ja il’s undefined, almost fluid structures look at identity as a concept.

“These abstract compositions reflect emotions I felt during moments I question my identity. These works can be described as emissions, emptiness and explosions,” says the artist whose work is a result of her emotional journey.

Hong Geun Young takes this concept further by creating structures that emote through the physical body — abstract figures with human traits and unusual elements make most of her work.

Indian ceramic artist Neha Kudchakar also follows a similar trajectory with one of her works. Though still in its genesis, Neha’s assortment of 21 nail-like structures, reflect her personal and emotional evolution. “I also use a lot of photography. Along with this particular work, I will display photographs that show the juxtaposition of two bodies, and the voids that it may create when placed against each other,” says Neha who will display three works in total. Another work of hers, is modelled out of fragmented plastic containers that households use on a daily basis, which will be put together to form a china wall (porcelain walls that are often associated with luxury and monetary privilege).

While Abir Patwardhan looks at Nature and its ability to create something out of nothing, specifically, “the interconnectedness of Nature”. He works with rope which forms the structure but on firing, it disappears leaving a void. This is an entirely new process that Abir is experimenting with. Snaking, intricate webs of clay, are the result of this.

Chennai-based Ramkumar Kannadasan’s work is a rebuttal to urbanisation that happens at the cost of Nature. His sculpture of an elephant’s body, divided in half, between an urban area and a forest, captures the contrast he intends to display. “Whenever something comes in the control of humans, it shrinks. When left alone in its natural environment, it is the other way around,” says the artist.

Though the techniques are similar, what the different cultures bring to the table, is the point of interest in the exhibition. For the artists, the camaraderie and artistic output born out of it, is the main takeaway of the residency.

Earth Matters - 3 will be inaugurated on February 27, and will be on display till March 5 at Varija Art Gallery, DakshnaChitra, Muttukadu.",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/22fnem/article30842350.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18MPCERAMICSCULPTUREWORKSHOP1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/eight-indian-and-korean-ceramic-artists-come-together-in-a-collaboration-at-kalakshetra/article30842352.ece
213,2020/02/17,Uncertainty over Prabhat Patnaik’s lecture at Visva-Bharati,"University authorities not in favour of inviting the noted economist; lecture likely to be called off

A lecture that was to be delivered by noted economist Prabhat Patnaik at Visva-Bharati on March 12 is most likely going to be called off because university authorities are not in favour of it, sources in the institution said.

Professor Patnaik was to deliver the Ashok Rudra Memorial Lecture and had been invited about a month ago. The lecture was instituted last year when Amartya Sen was the chief guest and Pranab Bardhan, professor of economics at the University of Berkeley, was the key speaker. It is organised by Visva-Bharati’s department of economics and politics.

“The Vice-Chancellor’s secretary called up the principal of Vidya Bhavana [of which the department is a part] and told him to ‘withhold’ the lecture. Nothing was given in writing. It is becoming a practice now for orders to be issued orally,” said a professor involved in the organising of Professor Patnaik’s lecture. The professor did not want to be named because a recent order — a written one — prohibits all staff, except the university PRO, from speaking to the media.

The PRO, Anirban Sircar, did not respond to calls when contacted for a comment.

“If the lecture is not held in March then the fund allotted for it will lapse once we move to the new financial year,” the professor said. According to him, the department’s board of studies had a meeting on Monday afternoon and it decided to ask the Vice-Chancellor, Bidyut Chakrabarty, whether he was in favour of another date in the month of March.

If the lecture is actually called off, it would hardly come as a surprise because Professor Patnaik, who has taught at JNU, is a known Marxist; whereas Visva-Bharati, under the stewardship of Mr. Chakrabarty, has been inviting right-wing ideologues to deliver lectures. Most recent speakers at the university include Meghalaya Governor Tathagata Roy and BJP MP Swapan Dasgupta.

Visva-Bharati, founded by Rabindranath Tagore in 1921, is a Central University and has the Prime Minister as its Chancellor.

When asked how, under the current dispensation, Professor Patnaik came to be invited in the first place, the professor said, “He is one of the tallest economists in the country, therefore the department was keen on having him over. When we had proposed his name, the Vice-Chancellor appeared to nod in agreement. Obviously we misread the nod.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/2dqm9u/article30845864.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE18PRABHATPATNAIK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/uncertainty-over-prabhat-patnaiks-lecture-at-visva-bharati/article30845865.ece
214,2020/02/17,BJP not planning ‘Operation Lotus’ in Maharashtra: Patil,"State party president says MVA govt. will fall on its own

The Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) is not working on ‘Operation Lotus’ to bring down the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in Maharashtra, State party president Chandrakant Patil said on Monday.

While the BJP believes the tripartite government is on a sticky wicket, the party will not work to bring down the government in an unconstitutional manner, he said. Mr. Patil was reacting to reports that the BJP may fashion a Karnataka-style ‘Operation Lotus’ to poach MLAs during the upcoming budget session of the Assembly and fashion a downfall of the MVA government.

“This government will fall on its own and the BJP will not attempt unconstitutional means to work behind the scenes on this. The people are aware these parties have formed the government despite not having the mandate. The voters will bring them down,” Mr. Patil said.

Earlier, the ruling alliance had alleged that the BJP was trying to poach some MLAs from the Congress and the Shiv Sena by using unconstitutional methods.

Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had threatened his former ally to desist from luring his party’s MLAs or pay a heavy price. “I challenge them (the BJP) to bring this government down,” he had said.

Meanwhile, the BJP on Monday announced that it will hold protests against the MVA government’s failure on February 25. The protests will be held in all districts and regions outside the local tehsildar’s office.

Former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had announced the move at the party’s State meet in Navi Mumbai on Sunday. “This MVA government has worked against the interest of not only farmers, but slum dwellers, women and other sections of society. We will not bring down this government. But I challenge this MVA government to fight elections against the BJP. We will defeat them with a big margin,” Mr. Fadnavis had said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/fhj39c/article30845844.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18BMBJP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bjp-not-planning-operation-lotus-in-maharashtra-patil/article30845845.ece
215,2020/02/17,"Odisha to conduct survey on educational, social condition of backward classes","Assembly resolves to amend Odisha State Commission for Backward Classes Act, 1993

The Odisha government will conduct a survey on educational and social condition of people belonging to the backward classes on its own.

The State Assembly on Monday resolved to amend the Odisha State Commission for Backward Classes Act, 1993, to enable the State Commission for Backward Classes to make survey of the educational and social condition of the people belonging to the backward classes.

The amendment was passed after the State government failed to get any response to its demand that a socio-economic caste survey be conducted simultaneously with the general census in 2021.

The State government had constituted the Commission for Backward Classes in accordance with the provisions contained in the Odisha State Commission for Backward Classes Act, 1993 on February 12.

Soon after the amendment was passed in the Assembly, Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik thanked all Members of the House. “This very significant moment will have a transformative impact on the backward classes of our State,” he said.

The Odisha Cabinet had on January 11 resolved to move the Central government to include backward class survey as part of the Census 2021. This had been formally moved by the State government to the Central government, informed the Chief Minister.

“Further this issue has been raised both in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha by our Members of Parliament. However, there has been no response,” said Mr. Patnaik.

Referring to the commemoration of the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, Mr. Patnaik said Gandhiji’s idea of India had the empowerment of the vulnerable as the core objective of the State.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/odisha-to-conduct-survey-on-educational-social-condition-of-backward-classes/article30845836.ece
216,2020/02/17,"On Konkan tour, CM avoids Nanar issue","Desai says party hasn’t changed stance on refinery; Rane accuses Uddhav of double standards

While emphasising the strong ties between the Shiv Sena and the Konkan region, Sena president and Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday cautiously avoided commenting on the contentious Nanar refinery project in Ratnagiri district.

Mr. Thackeray started a two-day visit to Konkan, his first visit to the region since becoming Chief Minister, on Monday. “Together with the Konkan region, we will create a new Maharashtra,” he said during a groundbreaking ceremony in Ganapatipule in Ratnagiri.

The Chief Minister avoided making any remarks on the Nanar refinery project and whether his party, which has been vehemently opposed to the project, would stick by its stand.

Saamana advertisement

The Sena had opposed the Ratnagiri Refinery Petrochemical Limited, commonly known as the Nanar refinery project, when it was in power with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the State.

However, an advertisement for the project in the Konkan edition of Saamana, the Sena’s mouthpiece, has raised eyebrows and irked the residents of Nanar, who have threatened agitations if the party does a volte face on its promise to scrap the project.

Speaking earlier in Dhule, Industries Minister Subhash Desai said, “Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray is not a person to change his stance. We have cancelled the notification for the Nanar refinery project. No other party has gone to this extent. The Sena has not changed its stance on the project.”

Not all was smooth on the first day of the Chief Minister’s tour, as he had cope with fractiousness within his own party and criticism from the Opposition in the form of his bête noire, Konkan BJP leader and ex-Shiv Sainik Narayan Rane.

Mr. Rane, a former chief minister, accused Mr. Thackeray of duplicity over the Nanar project, while alleging that the Maha Vikas Aghadi government and the Chief Minister’s Office were a wellspring of corruption. “This government is not pushing any development projects, but halting all previous ones initiated by the erstwhile BJP government. Uddhav Thackeray has shown his double standards over Nanar by first opposing it and now permitting [its] advertisements in Saamna,” Mr. Rane said.

He questioned the CM’s silence over the matter and asked why Mr. Thackeray had refused to meet anxious Nanar residents despite promising never to permit the refinery to come up.

Unhappy MLA

Meanwhile, Mr. Thackeray’s event in Ganapatipule was marred by Sena MLA from Ratnagiri Bhaskar Jadhav refusing to join in the felicitation ceremony for the Chief Minister.

Despite Mr. Thackeray personally requesting him, Mr. Jadhav, a former NCP leader and erstwhile guardian minister of Ratnagiri, refused to participate. He angrily warded off the attempts of Sena MP Vinayak Raut and Mr. Thackeray’s political secretary, Milind Narvekar, to include him.

Mr. Jadhav, who has been disgruntled for not getting a Cabinet berth, took umbrage at the fact that he was seated at the far end during the ceremony. In December last year, Mr. Jadhav had openly expressed shock at his exclusion from the Cabinet.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/yguwbn/article30845809.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18bmCM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/on-konkan-tour-cm-avoids-nanar-issue/article30845810.ece

Given the shortfall in production by the State-owned power plants at Lehra Mohabbat and Ropar, the Chief Minister said his government would work around the existing arrangements with the private players to make power rates more affordable.

Days after four children were burnt alive in Punjab’s Sangrur when a mini-van transporting them caught fire, the State Transport Department on Monday started a drive to inspect roadworthiness of school vans and buses.

Across the State, as many as 4,504 school buses and vans were checked in which 1,649 challans were issued for various violations.

As many as 253 vehicles were impounded for not complying with the requisite parameters of the Motor Vehicles Act during the drive by joint teams of the Punjab police and the civil administration of districts, according to an official spokesperson.

CM’s order

The drive was launched following directions by Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, who ordered the Transport Department to launch a State-wide checking of all school buses to ensure safety and security of students to avoid recurrence of tragic mishaps like the school van fire in Sangrur last week.

Capt. Amarinder had also directed the district child protection officers of the Social Security Department to keep a strict vigil on schools vehicles violating provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act and also school managements that are using worn-out vehicles for transportation of students.

The FIR has been registered while taking cognisance of the social media posts by miscreants by using different VPNs, which are propagating rumours with regard to the current security scenario in the Kashmir valley, secessionist ideology and glorifying terrorists, the police said.

‘Incriminating material’

“A lot of incriminating material has also been seized in this regard,” the spokesman said.

The case is registered under FIR No. 01 of 2020 U/S 13 U A (P) Act, 188, 505 of IPC and 66-A(b) of the IT Act.

“I appeal to the general public not to use social media via VPNs,” Inspector General of Police Vijay Kumar said.

The J&K government had on January 14 banned all social media sites. The ban, the government said, was to curb the misuse of sites by miscreants for propagating false information “having the effect of causing social instability”.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/4xtbh7/article28681358.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/data-spyware,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/jk-police-fir-against-social-media-users/article30845597.ece
221,2020/02/17,Agra readies to receive Donald Trump,"City getting a makeover and intelligence sweep ahead of U.S. President’s visit

The city of Taj is being spruced up to welcome U.S. President Donald Trump and wife Melania on February 24. Shops have been painted in one colour and hoardings are being cut in one format to avoid any visual discomfort to the VVIP couple. Water is being sprayed so that the dust settles. Even trees are being washed. “Even statues at the roundabouts are being given a bath,” said an elated Rajesh Kumar, who runs a grocery store near Fatehabad Road. In the Swachh Survekshan 2019 cleanliness rankings, the Agra Municipal Corporation was placed 85th nationwide.

Old-timers remember that Bill Clinton was the last U.S. President to visit the Taj in 2000. Barack Obama’s visit in 2015 was cancelled at the last minute, apparently because of security concerns. This time, apprehensions are being raised about the condition of the railway bridge near the Kheria Airport that falls on the way to Taj Mahal. “As the airport is not regularly used, and foreign tourists are expected to take the train route, not much attention has been paid on its maintenance,” said a tourist guide, requesting anonymity.

In fact, the Public Works Department has put up a board saying the bridge is in a weak condition and that heavy vehicles are not allowed. Allaying the fears, Superintendent of Police (City) Botre Rohan Pramod said, “It is not a cause of worry. It was used during the recent visit by the Brazilian President.”

Divisional Commissioner Anil Kumar told reporters on Monday that the PWD and the (U.P. State) Bridge Corporation have been told to do a check-up.

Massive police presence

Police sources said besides 4,000 constables, 10 Superintendents of Police, 18 Additional Superintendents of Police, 75 Deputy Superintendents of Police, 200 inspectors, 350 sub-inspectors and 16 companies of Central Armed Police Forces would be pressed into the security of arguably the most powerful man on earth.

“We are checking every house that falls on the route. The hotels have been asked to submit details of those staying with them to the local intelligence unit. Snipers will be placed on rooftops along the route,” said Mr. Pramod.

Concerns have also been raised about the hotels which are working without proper permission from the authorities. “We are keeping a check on them as well,” assured the official.

The increasing number of monkeys in the monument is also a concern.

Interestingly, Mr. Trump is coming at a time when the Taj Mahotsav is on, with hundreds of artisans in the city. Mr. Kumar said the administration has taken note of it. He said “the visit will end by 7.30 p.m.”, the time when the stage shows of the Mahotsav begin.

222,2020/02/17,Centre lets Ladakh appoint non-gazetted personnel,"Lack of staff hampers day-to-day work, says an official

Following a shortage of personnel, the Union government has empowered the Union Territory of Ladakh to formulate its own rules to appoint “non-gazetted” officials.

A senior official said the day-to-day work in Ladakh was getting hampered as the process to reallocate government officials had not been completed, and not many officials were willing to move to the Union Territory.

The erstwhile State of Jammu and Kashmir was bifurcated into the Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh by Parliament on August 6, 2019. Thereafter, the Union government appointed a panel to find out officials’ preference for posting. The General Administration Department of Jammu and Kashmir issued an order last year seeking options from government officials “for their further allocation” to the two Union Territories. The employees had to fill a form, comprising 18 columns, which sought information on their “place of birth, home district, marital status and caste”. “All employees have submitted their preference,” the official said.

To tide over the crisis, the Centre on January 21 said Ladakh’s Lieutenant-Governor “shall exercise the power to make rules in regard to...the method of recruitment to all Group ‘B’ (non-gazetted) and Group ‘C’ posts under his administrative control”.

‘L-G can decide’

The notification further said the Lieutenant-Governor could decide on the “qualifications necessary for appointment to such services and posts; and the conditions of service of persons appointed to such services and posts for the purposes of probation, confirmation, seniority and promotion”.

The official said a new administrative complex was being built in Leh. It would also house the office of the Hill Development Council.

There are about four lakh State government employees and 66 Indian Administrative Service (IAS) and 68 Indian Police Service (IPS) officers in the erstwhile State. Under the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019, the IAS, the IPS and other central service officers will continue to work in the Union Territories, while new recruits will be allocated the Arunachal Pradesh-Goa-Mizoram and Union Territory cadre.

In the Union Budget unveiled on February 1, a total of ₹30,757 crore was allocated to Jammu and Kashmir and ₹5,958 crore for Ladakh for the fiscal 2020-21.

Earlier, based on the 14th Finance Commission grants, a total of ₹14,559.25 crore was pending to be distributed to the two Union Territories. In December, ₹2,977.31 crore was transferred to Jammu and Kashmir and ₹1,275.99 crore to Ladakh. “This was the first time around 8% Central funds were transferred to Ladakh. Previously, the region received only 2%. The area is underdeveloped and needs greater help from the Centre,” said the official.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/centre-lets-ladakh-appoint-non-gazetted-personnel/article30845317.ece
223,2020/02/17,"In a signal of thaw in relations, Mamata meets Governor","First one-on-one between the two since Dhankhar had assumed office in July.

After months of confrontations between the West Bengal government and the Raj Bhavan, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday called on State Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar.

The hour-long meeting, likely a signal of a thaw in the relations, was the first one-on-one between the two since Mr. Dhankhar had assumed office in July. While not many details have emerged of what transpired at the meeting, the Governor took to social media describing it as “extremely satisfying”.

“Had an extremely satisfying hour-long interaction with Hon’ble Chief Minister Mamata Bannerjee at Raj Bhavan @MamataOfficial,” Mr. Dhankhar tweeted posting photographs of the meeting. There was no response from the Chief Minister about the interaction.

In the past six months, Mr. Dhankhar has got into a series of confrontations with the Trinamool Congress government on issues like law and order, education and other legislative and administrative matters. The convocations at the University of Calcutta and the Jadavpur University, where the Governor could not officiate the ceremony as the Chancellor, was also one of the reasons why the relations had soured.

Mr. Dhankhar had on a number of times complained that the Ministers and the bureaucrats had not shown him due courtesy. The meeting comes within a few days after Mr. Dhankhar adhering to the convention and reading the speech provided by the State government during the opening of the Budget session of the Assembly.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/44is24/article30845684.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17THPTIMAMATABANERJEE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/in-a-signal-of-thaw-in-relations-mamata-meets-governor/article30845142.ece
224,2020/02/17,Government unveils plan for research on ‘indigenous’ cows,"To be funded by multiple institutions, the initiative, SUTRA PIC, is led by Department of Science and Technology.

The government has unveiled a programme to research on ‘indigenous’ cows. To be funded by multiple scientific ministries, the initiative, SUTRA PIC, is led by the Department of Science and Technology (DST). It has the Department of Biotechnology, the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the Ministry for AYUSH (Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha, Homoeopathy) among others and the Indian Council of Medical Research as partners.

Five themes

SUTRA PIC or Scientific Utilisation Through Research Augmentation-Prime Products from Indigenous Cows, has five themes: Uniqueness of Indigenous Cows, Prime-products from Indigenous Cows for Medicine and Health, Prime-products from Indigenous Cows for Agricultural Applications, Prime-products from Indigenous Cows for Food and Nutrition, Prime-products from indigenous cows-based utility items, according to a concept note on the DST website.

Researchers from academic organisations as well as “capable voluntary organisations (NGOs) active in India with proven record of accomplishment in executing S&T-based R&D projects,” were invited to apply for funding.

“The proposals under this theme should aim to perform scientific research on complete characterisation of milk and milk products derived from Indian indigenous cows; scientific research on nutritional and therapeutic properties of curd and ghee prepared from indigenous breeds of cows by traditional methods; development of standards for traditionally processed dairy products of Indian-origin cow,” says the 22-page note explaining the objectives of the programme.

Budgetary outlay?

Two of the seniormost officials of some of the ministries involved said they were not aware of the specifics of the programme and claimed ignorance of the budgetary outlay. “I haven’t seen the file on this programme because only research programmes, say over ₹1 crore, need to be formally cleared by me,” Ashutosh Sharma, DST Secretary, told The Hindu.

The Hindu couldn’t immediately contact the officer in the Science for Equity, Empowerment and Development (SEED), the department in charge of the programme.

Shekhar Mande, Director-General, CSIR, said he was unaware of the programme. Renu Swarup, Secretary, Department of Biotechnology, said the department had not yet allotted any funds for SUTRA PIC and the nature of the department’s involvement was not yet “defined.”

“If and when specific biotechnology related projects or research proposals come by, we will look at funding but as of now there is not yet any financial commitment by the department,” she told The Hindu.

Research on Panchgavya

In 2017, SEED constituted a National Steering Committee (NSC) for ‘Scientific Validation and Research on Panchgavya (SVAROP)’.

Panchagavya is an Ayurvedic panacea and is a mixture of five (pancha) products of the cow (gavya) — milk, curd, ghee, dung and urine. Its proponents believe it can cure, or treat a wide range of ailments.

V.K. Vijay, the head of the Indian Institute of Delhi’s Centre for Rural Development and Technology (CRDT), said he was involved in SVAROP discussion and would be submitting research proposals to SUTRA PIC. The Finance Minister had announced research programmes into indigenous cattle in the 2016-17 as well as in the 2019-20 Union Budget. The stated objective was to develop products as well as improve the genetic quality of indigenous cattle breeds.

A 2019 article in the Journal of Animal Research said India had 190.9 million cattle and 43 registered native cattle breeds. “The exotic / crossbred population has been increased by 20.18% during the period of last census while population of indigenous cattle has been decreased by 8.94% during the same duration. The reasons for depletion of native breeds includes cross-breeding with exotic breeds, economically less viable, losing utility, reduction in herd size and the large-scale mechanisation of agricultural operation,” says an accompanying abstract to the article.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/q4nko2/article30845070.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17THONGOLEBREED2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/government-unveils-plan-for-research-on-indigenous-cows/article30845071.ece
225,2020/02/17,"Sharad Pawar, NCP firm on SIT probe in Elgar, Bhima Koregaon cases","The Aghadi government is divided over the issue as Uddhav and Shiv Sena not keen on perusing the matter further.

Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar on Monday asked his party’s Ministers to ensure that a Special Investigation Team (SIT) was set up in the Elgar Parishad and Bhima Koregaon cases.

After the National Investigation Agency (NIA) took over the case from the Maharashtra police, the NCP Ministers must ensure that a parallel probe was instituted at any cost, Mr. Pawar told his party colleagues while reading out Section 10 of the NIA Act which permitted the State government to set up a parallel probe. Mr. Pawar chaired a meeting of NCP Ministers at the Y.B. Chavan Centre, south Mumbai.

“The moment he read out the Act, we took the cue and spoke amongst ourselves on how to set up the SIT. The party believes, whatever may be the Shiv Sena’s opinion on this, the cases are completely fabricated,” said a NCP Minister.

Legal opinion

After the meeting, Home Minister Anil Deshmukh said the government would set up a SIT once the legal opinion from the Advocate General was received. “Once we have the A-G’s opinion, we will once again speak to the Chief Minister and get approval for this SIT. We are committed to setting up the SIT and most of our leaders agree this should be done,” he said. Two other NCP Ministers, including Minority Minister Nawab Malik and Water Resources Minister Jayant Patil, advocated the need for an SIT. “The NIA Section 10 allows the State to institute this SIT, there is no question of withholding such a move from taking place,” said Mr Malik after the meeting.

NCP’s priority

The Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government is divided over the move to further probe the Bhima Koregaon cases. While the NCP believes the party’s priority is to dig deeper into the issue, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and the Shiv Sena are not keen on perusing the matter further. The Maharashtra Law and Judiciary Department has already given its opinion on setting up a parallel probe as such a move would be difficult from a legal point of view. “But this has now become a matter of prestige for honourable Pawar saheb [Mr. Sharad Pawar] and he will ensure the probe is instituted,” said another senior NCP Minister.

Earlier, reports of rift in the MVA government had emerged after Mr. Thackeray last week announced he did not have any issue in handing over the probe papers to the NIA. Mr. Pawar later said it was not right on the part of the Centre to take over the probe via NIA and for the Maharashtra government to agree to hand over documents to the NIA.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/19r5zd/article30844903.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH18SHARADPAWAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/pawar-ncp-firm-on-sit-probe-in-elgar-bhima-koregaon-cases/article30844904.ece
226,2020/02/17,"Students on march, scribe released on bail in Uttar Pradesh","They were going from Chauri Chaura to Rajghat.

A group of 10 persons comprising nine students and activists and an accompanying female journalist, who were arrested in Uttar Pradesh’s Ghazipur district while on a ‘Satyagraha’ march to Delhi, were enlarged on bail on Sunday evening.

An SDM court granted them bail on personal bonds of ₹1 lakh each.

Among those released was Delhi-based freelance journalist Pradeepika Saraswat, who said police had arrested her despite being informed that she was a scribe. While Ms. Saraswat admitted that she was not carrying her ‘press’ identification card during the padayatra, she asserted that she had shown the police her articles published online but that the police “did not listen to anything”.

Ms. Saraswat said she had joined the yatra “as a journalist” to cover it for a prospective first-hand account for an online portal or even a small book.

“I thought if I write 1,000 words daily, it will be 60,000 words in the end, it can even come up as a small book about this yatra and the current times,” Ms. Saraswat told The Hindu by telephone.

She said she had been motivated to walk with the students and activists as she had been impressed by their “energy” and goal of communicating with common people about the “division the current regime is creating.”

Ms. Saraswat and nine others, most of them BHU students, were at the head of the march from Chauri Chaura, near Gorakhpur, to Rajghat in Delhi when they were arrested on the ninth day in Ghazipur district.

Police accused them of “misleading people” and “instigating them” against the issue of CAA and the proposed nationwide National Register of Citizens (NRC). The yatra was also deemed illegal.

Friends of those arrested, who were collectively grouped under the banner of ‘Team Nagrik Satyagraha’, however, accused the police of trying to “shrink and divert the objective” of the yatra, which they said was “against every form of violence and hate which exists in society and to spread [the] idea of Gandhi”.

Ms. Saraswat said the police had detained and sent them to jail without taking them to any police station. “The day we entered Ghazipur, the local intelligence units and police started following us,” she recalled.

“They took down our names. And two or more policemen were following us on bikes and updating their superiors. The first night we spent in Ghazipur, a couple of policemen also stayed with us. We were told the police were for our security. But the next day, after a couple of kilometres, they arrested us.”

The released students said that while detaining them, the police took objection to a pamphlet they were distributing about the yatra, which said, ‘Ao hamare saath chalo (Come, walk with us)’.

Police alleged that the call given in the pamphlet could ‘cause the yatra to swell into a mob’, said Raj Abhishek, a BHU student studying Conflict and Peace Management. Mr. Abhishek said the arrest was a “curb on our fundamental rights”.

“We walked with the message of peace and brotherhood of Gandhiji,” he said, adding that the goal of the yatra was to tell people to shed communal “hatred”.

“The basic issues of education, health and employment are being left behind amid the talk on CAA,” he said.

Team Nagrik Satyagraha said after their release, the marchers had tried to resume their padayatra from the same place in Ghazipur where they had been halted by the police, but that on Monday morning the police had picked up six of them and dropped them by car at the gate of the BHU in Varanasi.

A decision on the next phase of their yatra would be taken soon, they added.

When contacted, SDM Sadar Ghazipur Prabhas Kumar said “due process was fully followed” during the arrests.

“There were no irregularities of any kind,” he asserted.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/dseg9r/article30844809.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH18CAAPROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/students-on-march-scribe-released-on-bail-in-uttar-pradesh/article30844810.ece
227,2020/02/17,"NPR will not be implemented in Madhya Pradesh, says Kamal Nath","Congress govt. issued notification as per 2003 rules, not CAA rules, on Dec. 9: CM

Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath on Monday said the National Population Register (NPR) would not be implemented in the State “at present”, allaying fears over a notification for its update issued by the State government earlier.

“The notification being talked about was issued on December 9,” he was quoted as saying in a note issued by his office. “After this, the Centre implemented the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. Therefore, the NPR notification has not been issued under the CAA, 2019.”

According to the notification dated December 9 and published in the gazette on December 13, the update of the NPR will be undertaken along with House-listing exercise from May 1 to June 14. The CAA received the President’s assent on December 12.

Mr. Nath said the notification was issued under rule 3 of the 2003 rules of the Citizenship Act, 1955, a clarification given in response to Congress MLA (Bhopal Central) Arif Masood’s threat of agitation if the State government went ahead with the update.

“We would launch a campaign from Bhopal against the CAA, the NRC and the NPR,” Mr. Masood had told reporters.

The notification says the update would be undertaken in pursuance of sub-rule (4) of Rule 3 of the Citizenship Rules, 2003. The sub-rule under the “National Register of Indian Citizens” says the Centre may decide a date by which the NPR shall be prepared by collecting information relating to persons “usually residing” within the jurisdiction of the Local Registrar. While sub-rule (5) says the Local Register of Indian Citizens shall contain details of persons “after due verification” made from the NPR. The 2003 rules, however, prescribe 12 queries, while more contentious ones, including the place of birth of parents, have been mooted after the CAA.

Earlier, State Law Minister P.C. Sharma had told The Hindu the Congress government’s stand remained unchanged, despite the notification.

Moreover, on February 5, the State Cabinet passed a resolution exhorting the Centre to abrogate the contentious law, and begin the NPR update only after withdrawing the plan to seek new information, to quell apprehensions.

The Congress Working Committee (CWC) on January 11 demanded the “process of NPR be stopped forthwith”, a resolution later adopted by the Assemblies of Congress-led Rajasthan, Punjab and Puducherry.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/fx817t/article30771964.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/9TH-KAMAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/npr-not-to-be-implemented-in-madhya-pradesh-says-kamal-nath/article30844011.ece
228,2020/02/17,Odisha may continue to sustain revenue loss due to GST beyond 5 years,"The introduction of GST in July 2017 had resulted in 17 taxes levied by the Centre and States being subsumed under the GST

Odisha may continue to sustain revenue losses on account of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) even after five years, while the existing constitutional provision provides for compensating loss to a State’s revenue for a period of five years only, the State government observed in the annual ‘Odisha Economic Survey’ tabled in the Assembly on Monday.

The introduction of GST in July 2017 had resulted in 17 taxes levied by the Centre and States being subsumed under the GST.

“With initial... issues related with the implementation of the new tax regime, Odisha has been facing revenue loss,” the government said in its latest economic survey.

“As per the constitutional provisions, the State will get compensation towards loss of revenue for five years. However, the State may continue to sustain loss on account of GST even after five years because of the structural changes like the rate structure, abolition of central sales tax and entry tax,” the government observed.

As per the economic survey, applying 14% growth rate to the base year’s collection, revenue for 2018-19 is worked out at ₹16,370.08 crore, whereas revenue collection under GST during this period is ₹12,140.45 crore. It implies that compensation claim of the State stands at ₹4,229.64 crore, out of which compensation received so far is ₹3,785 crore. The balance compensation of ₹444.64 crore is yet to be received.

The Odisha Economic Survey projects Gross State Domestic Product to grow by 6.16% in 2019-20, compared with the 7.9% pace posted in 2018-19.

The slowdown in the pace of growth has been attributed to lower agricultural production — with output affected by cyclones — and a deceleration in both mining and manufacturing.

After a dip in growth in 2014-15, as mining and manufacturing decelerated, Odisha’s economic momentum recovered in 2015-16 to 8%. Thereafter, it jumped to 15.6% in 2016-17 due to high production in agriculture, more fiscal consolidation and an increase in manufacturing output.

Growth, however, softened in 2017-18 to 6.3% owing to reduced agricultural production and contraction in manufacturing and mining sector. In 2018-19, the pace ticked up to 7.9% on account of higher agricultural output.

The per capita income of Odisha in 2019-20 is, however, expected to reach ₹1,01,587 up from ₹95,164 in 2018-19. As per advance estimates for 2019-20, the State’s per capita net domestic product at current prices is estimated to grow by 6.75%. During the same period, the per capita net national income is estimated at ₹1,35,050, marking an increase of 6.84% compared with ₹1,26,406 during 2018-19.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/tmi6ju/article30588636.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH17GST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/odisha-may-continue-to-sustain-revenue-loss-due-to-gst-beyond-5-years/article30843681.ece

Days after four children were burnt alive in Punjab’s Sangrur when a mini-van transporting them caught fire, the Transport department on Monday started a drive to inspect the roadworthiness of school vans and buses.

Across the State, 2,654 buses and vans were checked in which 1,049 challans were issued for various violations. During the drive by joint teams of the Punjab police and the civil administrations of districts, 207 vehicles were impounded, according to a tweet from the official handle of the Chief Minister’s Office.

Chief Minister Amarinder Singh directed the officials to ensure that accidents like the school van in Longowal town of Sangrur district last week did not recur.

Capt. Amarinder also directed the district child protection officers of the Social Security department to keep a strict vigil on vehicles violating the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act and also the school managements using vehicles in bad condition.

The Rajasthan Anti-Corruption Bureau has busted a bribery racket in the State’s Transport Department, seizing cash worth ₹1.20 crore from private agents, officials said on Monday.

On Sunday night, the ACB arrested Transport Inspector Udaiveer Singh while accepting a bribe of ₹40,000 from private agent Manish Mishra, they said.

Seven other officers and six private agents were also detained, ACB officials said.

A probe was ordered after the ACB received complaints from transport company owners four months ago that district transport officers were collecting monthly bribes through private agents by threatening to cancel their registrations.

“Investigations were carried out to verify information following which the action was taken,” ACB DG Alok Tripathi said.

Additional Director General (ADG) ACB Dinesh M.N. said 17 teams were formed which raided 13 locations in Jaipur, three in the outskirts and one in Rewari in Haryana.

Shahjahanpur DTO Gajendra Singh, Chomu DTO Vinay Bansal, Jaipur headquarters DTO Mahesh Sharma, RTO inspectors Shivcharan Meena, Alok Budhaniya and Ratan Lal were detained, he said.

Private agents Jaswant Singh Yadav, Vishnu Kumar, Mamta, Bunty, Ranveer, Vishnu Kaushik and Pawan alias Pehalwan were also detained, he added.

The matter was raised in the Rajasthan Assembly on Monday. Rajasthan Transport Minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas said the action was taken to eliminate corruption in the State Transport Department.

“The Congress government’s aim is to end corruption. I assure that justice will be done with those who are not guilty. Innocent officers need not be afraid if ACB team arrives, whereas corrupt officials will not be spared,” Mr. Khachariyawas told reporters outside the House.

The Minister said only one inspector was caught red-handed and searches were conducted on the premises of others.

He also told reporters that the inspectors’ association members of the Transport Department also met him.

“I told them that action against the corrupt will be taken but if someone is innocent, he need not fear,” he said. BJP MLA Kali Charan Saraf said the way ACB has taken action, such a big-scale corruption cannot be limited only to the lower level and a monthly collection must be going to the upper level.

The Chief Minister should ensure effective probe and action against whosoever is involved,” he said.

Congress MLAs too raised questions on the Transport Department functioning, accusing its officials of indulging in large-scale corruption.

As per my information, majority of officials of the Transport Department are corrupt. The monthly recovery is shared till top, it is a big network,” said Congress MLA Rajendra Gudha.

He claimed that the corruption booty goes up to the top level functionaries not merely from the Transport Department, but also from the Excise and Mines Departments.

Congress MLA Ramnarayan Meena also said that corruption “has spread its wing and no one is clean”.

Malvinder (46); his brother Shivinder, also a former Fortis Healthcare promoter; former CMD of Religare Enterprises Limited (REL) Sunil Godhwani (58); former CEO of REL, Kavi Arora (48) and former CFO of RFL, Anil Saxena, were arrested by the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of Delhi Police for allegedly diverting RFL’s money and investing in other companies.

The EOW registered an FIR in March last year after it received a complaint from RFL’s Manpreet Suri against Shivinder, Godhwani and others, alleging that loans were taken by them while managing the firm but the money was invested in other companies.

“They put RFL in a poor financial condition by disbursing loans to companies with no financial standing and controlled by them. The companies to which the loans were disbursed wilfully defaulted in repayments and caused a loss to RFL to the tune of ₹2,397 crore,” the police had alleged.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/36lv14/article30007804.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11NOVTHRANBAXYEARNS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/rfl-case-delhi-court-dismisses-bail-plea-of-former-fortis-healthcare-promoter-malvinder-singh/article30843239.ece
232,2020/02/17,Gujarat Congress warns of protest at Ahmedabad’s Motera stadium during Donald Trump’s visit,"On February 24, the stadium at Motera would be inaugurated by Mr. Trump and Mr. Modi, and the two leaders will also address a gathering on the occasion.

Unhappy over a recent Supreme Court order on reservation, the Gujarat Congress on Monday threatened to stage a protest on February 24 outside the newly built cricket stadium in Ahmedabad where the U.S. President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi will take part in a mega event.

On February 24, the stadium at Motera would be inaugurated by Mr. Trump and Mr. Modi, and the two leaders will also address a gathering on the occasion.

The Opposition party said it will not hesitate to hold a protest against the BJP outside the stadium if the Centre fails to take appropriate decision over the apex court’s ruling on reservation in jobs for SC/ST communities.

The Gujarat Congress on Monday organised a ‘Save Constitution’ rally in the Sarangpur area over the last week’s Supreme Court judgment which says States are not bound to provide reservation in appointments and there is no fundamental right to claim quota in promotions.

The Congress demanded that the NDA government file a review petition against the Supreme Court ruling or bring a Constitution amendment to nullify the order.

“The Congress will not let the rights of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Castes taken away. No one can snatch reservation rights till the Congress is there. This protest is just the beginning. In coming days, we will reach out to people in small towns and villages. If needed, we will hold protests at Motera and Delhi,” Gujarat Congress president Amit Chavda said while speaking at the rally.

In his address to party workers, All India Congress Committee (AICC) in-charge for Gujarat Rajiv Satav said the BJP has always “conspired” against the marginalised sections and tried to take away reservation rights.

“Both the BJP and the RSS are trying to remove reservation since many years now. It is their agenda to remove reservation, which was introduced by our great leaders so that the marginalised sections of the society get equal opportunities,” said Mr. Satav.

The rally was attended by several senior Congress leaders and MLAs, including former party State unit chiefs Bharatsinh Solanki and Arjun Modhwadia.

MLAs Shailesh Parmar, Himmatsinh Patel, Lakha Bharwad, Kanti Kharadi, Babu Vaja, Gyasuddin Shaikh, C.J. Chavda and Vimal Chudasama, among others, also took part in the rally.

From Sarangpur, party leaders went to Collector office and handed over a memorandum asking the ruling BJP to file a review petition against the Supreme Court ruling or bring a Constitution amendment to nullify the quota order.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/zdjg33/article30795433.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH12STADIUM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/gujarat-congress-warns-of-protest-at-ahmedabads-motera-stadium-during-donald-trumps-visit/article30843042.ece
233,2020/02/17,Blessings of Shivneri Fort’s soil has made me Maharashtra Chief Minister: Uddhav Thackeray,"The Chief Minister said the protection of forts is the responsibility of every citizen and he promised all possible support from the State government for their upkeep.

Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday said he reached the top post in the State due to blessings of the soil of Shivneri Fort, the birthplace of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.

He was speaking at a function in Poladpur tehsil in neighbouring Raigad district to dedicate the samadhi of the Maratha Emperor’s general Tanaji Malusare, whose exploits during the Battle of Sinhagad made him a revered figure in military folklore.

The fort was called Kondhana before this battle but it was renamed Sinhagad to honour the bravery and supreme sacrifice of Tanaji Malusare.

Monday’s function was organised to mark the 350th death anniversary of the famed general, whose life was the subject of a recently released film Tanhaji.

Calling the day an auspicious one, the Chief Minister said it was necessary for people to know about the exploits of great men of history.

“I had taken the soil of Shivneri Fort to Ayodhya and within one year the verdict on the Ram Temple there was delivered. I became Chief Minister of Maharashtra because of the blessings of the soil of Shivneri Fort which creates wonders. Many have shed blood on this soil,” Mr. Thackeray said.

234,2020/02/17,Magsaysay awardee Pandey held by police while distributing pamphlets against CAA,"Police are yet to officially state if he had been detained or arrested and for what offence

Magsaysay awardee Sandeep Pandey was on Monday “arrested” by the Uttar Pradesh police while distributing pamphlets against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the proposed nationwide National Register of Citizens (NRC), his wife said.

While sources said he was being booked under Section 151 of the CrPC, police were yet to officially state if he had been detained or arrested and for what offence.

“Sandeep Pandey arrested. Taken to Thakurganj thana,” his wife Arundhati Dhuru, an activist, said in a text message.

Mr. Pandey’s friends shared videos showing the social activist being driven away in a police jeep.

Mr. Pandey was allegedly picked up from near the Hussainabad Clocktower, where several hundred women have been staging a sit-in against the CAA since last month.

The pamphlets distributed by Mr. Pandey, which had been signed by a number of activists, were titled “Desh ko Baatne ki, Lootne ki aur Bechne ki Rajneeti nahi chalegi’ (The politics of dividing the country, looting it and selling it won’t work).”

The signatories to the pamphlet urged citizens to unite and turn the Preamble to the Constitution “into a reality.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/hnr4sx/article30842037.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Sandeep-Pandey,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/magsaysay-awardee-pandey-held-by-police-while-distributing-pamphlets-against-caa/article30842038.ece
235,2020/02/17,"MHA-appointed committee on Assam recommends 1951 as cut-off year to define indigenous people, ILP","The committee has also suggested two formulas for the reservation of seats for the indigenous people in the Assam Assembly and Lok Sabha constituencies of the State, including 67% quota for them.

A Home Ministry-appointed committee has suggested that 1951 should be the cut-off year for defining the indigenous people of Assam and introduction of the Inner Line Permit (ILP) to control the movement of people from outside the State, sources said on Monday.

The committee has also suggested two formulas for the reservation of seats for the indigenous people in the Assam Assembly and Lok Sabha constituencies of the State, including 67% quota for them.

The high-level committee was set up by the Ministry to suggest ways to provide constitutional safeguards to Assam’s indigenous people.

The sources said the 13-member panel, headed by Justice (Retd.) Biplab Kumar Sharma, finalised its report last week, conveyed to the Home Ministry that it was ready to submit it to Union Home Minister Amit Shah and sought an appointment with him.

The report is expected to be submitted this week itself.

The committee, according to the sources, unanimously recommended that those who were residents of Assam in 1951 and their descendants, irrespective of community, caste, language, religion or heritage, will be considered as indigenous people of the State.

Besides, the panel suggested that the ILP should be introduced in Assam so that movement of people from outside the State could be controlled.

As per the rules, outsiders have to take permission from designated authorities before entering the areas where the ILP is applicable.

The ILP, notified under the Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulation, 1873, has been in operation in Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland and Mizoram for long and it was introduced in Manipur in December 2019 following an uproar over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

In case of reservation of seats in the Assam Assembly and Lok Sabha constituencies in the State, all members, except three, have suggested that 67% seats should be reserved for the indigenous people. The remaining three members suggested that the reservation in legislative bodies should be 100%.

“We have mentioned that there is no dissenting note but there are two suggestions for the reservation of Assembly and Lok Sabha seats,” a source said.

In addition to the 67% reservation for the indigenous people, 16% will also be reserved for the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe communities.

“So, effectively, the reservation will go up to 80% if it is accepted,” the source said.

In case of State government jobs, the committee recommended 80% reservation for the locals.

A number of other recommendations were also given for the protection and growth of Assamese and other indigenous languages.

“The committee’s job is over. After its formal submission, the Central government can either modify, reject or implement (the report) in toto,” another source said.

The committee was set up in July 2019 as per the Clause 6 of the 1985 Assam Accord. The clause envisages constitutional, legislative and administrative safeguards to protect, preserve and promote cultural, social, linguistic identity and heritage of the Assamese people.

On February 7, addressing a rally in Assam, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said the Central government will work expeditiously to implement Clause 6 once the high-powered committee submits its report.

In his speech in Rajya Sabha during the debate on the CAA, Mr. Shah had said, “In 1985, the Assam Accord happened. There is a provision in Clause 6 to protect the indigenous culture of the State. From 1985 to 2014, the committee was not constituted for Clause 6.”

“I want to assure that the NDA government, through Clause 6, will protect rights of the people of Assam. We have constituted the committee and All Assam Students’ Union is part of the committee. I want them to send the report of the committee quickly,” he had said.

According to its terms and conditions, “The committee will assess the appropriate level of reservation of seats in the Assam Legislative Assembly and local bodies for the Assamese people.”

“The committee will recommend the appropriate level of reservations in employment under the government of Assam for the Assamese people,” according to a Home Ministry notification.

Assam has witnessed widespread protests against the CAA. There has been a growing feeling among the indigenous people of the State that the newly enacted legislation will hurt their interests politically, culturally as well as socially.

The Assam Accord provides for detection and deportation of all illegal immigrants, who entered the country after 1971 and are living in the State, irrespective of their religion.

According to the CAA, members of Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian communities who came to India from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan till December 31, 2014, to escape religious persecution will not be treated as illegal immigrants but given Indian citizenship.

236,2020/02/17,14 forest officials booked for ‘shooting dead’ Dalit man in Madhya Pradesh,"Activists allege the victim was killed for filling water from a hand pump

The Shivpuri Police have registered a case against 14 forest officials for allegedly shooting dead a Dalit man, while his family filled water from a hand pump near a forest post, in the district on Sunday.

The Forest Department claims that when a patrolling team reached a forest post at Fatehpur village near Karera, 50 km from Shivpuri, to remove an encroachment by the victim, Madan Mehtar, villagers pelted stones on them, prompting the firing of pellets. The victim’s family alleges the officials fired at them during a scuffle that broke out over drawing water from a hand pump in the village.

FIR registered

“An FIR (First Information Report) has been registered against ten identified persons and others who are unnamed,” said R.S. Chandel, Shivpuri Superintendent of Police. A case has been registered under Sections 302 [Punishment for murder], 307[Attempt to murder], 323 [Punishment for voluntarily causing hurt], 294 [Obscene acts], 147 [ Punishment for rioting.], 148 [Rioting, armed with deadly weapon], 149 [Every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence commit­ted in prosecution of common object] of the Indian Penal Code and section 3(2)(v) of the The Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. No arrests have been made so far.

The victim’s father, Mahotam Mehtar, a permanent employee at the Madhav National Park in Shivpuri, had not received his salary for five-six months owing to absence from duty, though on medical grounds. This had led to a dispute with foresters, said Mr. Chandel.

“The victim suffered more than 50 pellet wounds. A post mortem has been conducted on the body and we will get the report soon,” he said.

The victim’s wife Saroj Mehtar,28, gave an oral complaint to the police, based on which an FIR was registered. “Around 2.30 p.m., along with mother-in-law and two daughters, she went to fetch water from the hand pump near the forest post like every day,” said the FIR. While one of the daughters washed utensils there, some water splashed on a forest Ranger nearby who’d come to fill a bottle. “He abused them and said - You lowly people, why do you come to fill water from the pump near the post?”

When they protested against being abused, a female forest official allegedly slapped them. And one of the daughter called Mr. Madan and his brother Pankaj Mehtar from home, who were then hit by “rifle butts and sticks”. As they attempted to run away, ""foresters fired at them from behind"", injuring them. “The brother in law got injuries on his right shoulder. Mr. Madan died on the way to the hospital.”

Second incident

This is the second reported incident of pellet gun firing by the Madhya Pradesh Forest Department in eight months. In July last year, during an eviction drive in Burhanpur district, officials reportedly fired pellets at tribals, injuring four.

Meanwhile, Madhav National Park Director Mohan Meena, who has initiated an inquiry, said whether the guns belonged to the department or were privately owned was being looked into. “The patrolling team comprised of rangers, SDOs (Sub Divisional Officers), and two former Army soldiers who carried rifles,” he said.

Mr. Meena alleged that villagers used country pistols and pelted stones on foresters as they approached the encroachment. As for drawing water from the pump, he said, “All arrangements are made before going out on a patrol. Officials carried water with them,” he claimed.

Terming the incident an “encounter”, Sudhir Kode, a Dalit activist, said, “Officials took law in their own hands. They fired unprompted, that too without permission.”

‘Prejudice persists’

Stating that the incident portrayed an attempt by upper castes to deny Dalits access to resources, including water, Ravi Mahant, an activist said, “Those belonging to upper castes, even in uniform, fail to shed their identity to ensure equitable distribution of resources. No matter your position in power, caste prejudice persists.”

Threatening to stage a dharna outside the Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister’s residence in Bhopal, Former Bhim Army State in-charge Sunil Astay wrote on Twitter, “Can’t Dalits even touch a hand pump now? The mountain of atrocities has broken loose on Dalits in Madhya Pradesh…. A brother of the Valmiki caste was shot dead for filling water from the pump.”

Last September at Bhavkhedi village in the district, two upper caste men allegedly thrashed to death two Dalit children, who did not have toilets at home, for defecating in the open.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/14-forest-officials-booked-for-shooting-dead-dalit-man-in-madhya-pradesh/article30841991.ece
237,2020/02/17,Ex-Tripura Chief Secretary held in ₹640-crore PWD scam,"Y.P. Singh had been evading arrest for almost five months

Former Tripura Chief Secretary Y.P. Singh — a key accused in the ₹640-crore PWD scam of 2008 — was on Monday arrested from Ghaziabad in Delhi NCR. A team of the Crime Branch comprising senior police officials left for Ghaziabad to take the custody of the former bureaucrat who was the Principal Secretary of the PWD when the graft had allegedly occurred.

Mr. Singh had been evading arrest for almost five months since an FIR into the scam was registered in the West Agartala police station. Former PWD Minister and CPI(M) veteran Badal Choudhury and former PWD Chief Engineer Sunil Bhowmik were also arrested in the case and both had recently secured bail from the High Court.

Investigation Officer Ajay Das said the accused would be brought back to Tripura after receiving his transit remand from a court.

Mr. Choudhury though denied his involvement in any financial irregularities and termed his indictment politically motivated.

238,2020/02/17,Babulal Marandi merges JVM(P) with BJP,"Two of the three MLAs join Congress.

The Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (Prajatantrik), led by Babulal Marandi, formally merged with the BJP on Monday in the presence of Union Home Minister Amit Shah and other party leaders in Ranchi.

On the occasion, Mr. Marandi, who quit the BJP in 2006, lashed out at the present grand alliance government in Jharkhand led by Chief Minister and Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) leader Hemant Soren.

“This government is running only on Twitter…but the governments can’t be run on Twitter…what is the law and order situation here we all know”, Mr. Marandi said at the Milan Samaroh (meeting programme) at Ranchi’s Prabhat Tara ground.

Mr. Shah said, “The Narendra Modi and Raghubar Das governments had been successful in implementing all programmes and policies for the welfare of the poorest of the poor in Jharkhand through supply of LPG connection, electricity, construction of homes. And now piped water will be provided to them”.

The BJP would do more works for the welfare of common people while in opposition in Jharkhand, Mr. Shah added. He declared that soon “a sky-reaching Ram temple” will be constructed in Ayodhya.

“By abrogating Article 370 and 35-A, the Narendra Modi government has also made Kashmir an inseparable part of India”, Mr Shah said. He also took on the Soren government on the recent killing of seven tribal people in West Sighbhum district.

Mr. Marandi was the first tribal Chief Minister of Jharkhand after it was bifurcated from Bihar in November 2000. However, he left the party in 2006 and floated JVM(P).

In the recent Assembly elections, the JVM(P) won three seats. Besides, Mr. Marandi, Pradip Yadav and Bandhu Tirkey were elected.

Earlier, Mr Marandi expelled both Mr. Yadav and Mr. Tirkey from the party on the ground of “anti-party activities”.

Mr. Yadav recently met Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi in New Delhi. He is likely to join that party.

Mr Marandi is a tall tribal leader of Jharkhand and after losing power, the BJP is aiming to revive the party leadership in the State with a tribal face. It is likely to elect Mr. Marandi as the Legislative Party leader. The post of Opposition leader in the Assembly is still vacant.

In last Assembly polls, the BJP miserably failed to perform well in the tribal dominated seats as the non-tribal Chief Minister Raghubar Das was completely disconnected with the tribal voters.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/2ucpsz/article30844634.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18TH-MARANDI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/babulal-marandi-merges-jvmp-with-bjp/article30841448.ece
239,2020/02/17,Inter-State vehicle theft racket busted; seven held,"The Palghar police claimed to have busted an inter-State four-wheeler theft racket with the arrest of seven people this weekend.

The accused allegedly stole 55 vehicles, mostly pick-up vans, an official said, adding that 27 vehicles worth about ₹1 crore were seized from them.

The modus operandi of the accused was to steal vehicles, change their engine and registration numbers and sell them at a lower price, District Superintendent of Police Gaurav Singh told reporters on Saturday evening. He said a special team was formed after the police received several complaints of four-wheeler thefts in the district.

The accused used to watch out for the vans during the day and steal them at night using duplicate keys. They took the vehicles to a garage in Bhiwandi, where they removed the original number plates and erased the engine and chassis numbers.

These were replaced with numbers and specifications of scrapped vehicles. The accused sold these vehicles at a lower price, Mr. Singh said.

During interrogation, the accused confessed to having stolen 51 pick-up/ towing vans from Palghar, one from Kapurbawdi in Thane, two from Valsad in Gujarat, and another vehicle from Dadra and Nagar Haveli. They had stolen parts of five parked vehicles and also made away with five stray cattle, the official said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/inter-state-vehicle-theft-racket-busted-seven-held/article30839488.ece
240,2020/02/17,"Centre’s decisions leading to suspicion, says Ashok Gehlot","‘An environment of doubt is inevitable as it is unclear in which direction the country is headed’

Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Sunday accused the BJP-led Union government of taking arbitrary decisions, leading to an environment of suspicion in the country.

He said the intention of those at the helm at the Centre was not clear due to which it was not known where the country was headed to.

Mr. Gehlot said this while addressing a dharna held in the backdrop of an apex court ruling that States are not bound to provide reservation in appointments or promotions.

The Supreme Court had given the judgement last week, upholding the contention of the Uttarakand BJP government.

Congress leaders also submitted a memorandum to the President through the Rajasthan Governor, urging to take action according to the basic spirit of the Constitution over the question of reservation.

“The intention of people ruling the country at present is not clear. The Centre is taking decisions arbitrarily. An environment of doubt is inevitable as it is unclear in which direction the country is headed to,” Mr. Gehlot said.

He said the BJP was making arbitrary decision despite getting only 39% votes in the Lok Sabha elections.

Mr. Gehlot said the ruling party at the Centre can go to any extent to impose its agenda and in such a case, danger on quota for deprived communities was obvious.

He accused the BJP and the RSS of inciting people in the name of nationalism.

“Their nationalism is pseudo-nationalism. Their only aim is to win elections by instigating people. Where would 20% Muslim minority population go,” he said.

Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot said their protest is to alert the BJP government at the Centre that no ideology or power can abolish the fundamental rights of the citizens of the country.

He said Ambedkar had made a provision for reservation so that standard of living could be improved by connecting the Dalits and backward with the mainstream.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/de3dbf/article30839411.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE16-GEHLOT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/centres-decisions-leading-to-suspicion-says-ashok-gehlot/article30839412.ece

242,2020/02/17,HAM radio comes to rescue during natural calamities,"Group tests its efficacy in simulated conditions on an island

At an uninhabited island near the mouth of Chilika lagoon, 10 members of the Amateur Radio Society of Odisha (ARSO), with no access to electricity and communication lines, tested their skills and technology to use radio for enhancing preparedness for natural calamities.

The three-day-long second annual field camp at the remote island ended on Sunday. Using amateur radio, also known as HAM radios, with minimal power supply was the theme of the camp.

During the devastating Fani cyclone in 2019, Puri district remained without power and telecommunication for several days.

At that time HAM radio became the only means of communication between the Puri collectorate and State secretariat in Bhubaneswar, said ARSO members.

The HAM operators employed high frequency signals to connect with other operators living far away. Participants were able to connect to around 60 such operators in different parts of India and abroad, including three operators in Indonesia, Malaysia and the UAE.The operators contacted in India were located at places like Erode in Kerala, Chandigarh, New Delhi, Guwahati in Assam.

“Minimal amount of power was used for HAM connectivity and personal use ... Only 30-40 watts of electricity from portable small batteries were used for the purpose”, said Gurudatta Panda, a participant at the camp.

ARSO members reached the island on the evening of February 14 and remained cut off from the rest of the world till February 16. To simulate situations during a natural calamity, the group operated without power and conventional modes of communication, and used bamboo poles and domestic electrical wires to construct an antenna tower.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/jx23jc/article30838082.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20200216-WA0002,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ham-radio-comes-to-rescue-during-natural-calamities/article30838083.ece

The Jammu and Kashmir government on Sunday said ailing Hurriyat chairman Syed Ali Geelani, 90, was stable and conscious. The Valley’s popular Sunday Market was shut in the wake of rumours about deterioration in his health.

“The condition of senior political leader Syed Ali Geelani is stable, and he is conscious, cooperative and oriented,” A.G. Ahangar, Director, Sher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences, said here.

The government said a team of doctors was monitoring his condition. “Mr. Geelani is better than before, taking liquid diet and other medicines prescribed by chest physician Naveed from the Chest Medicine Department of the Government Medical College, Srinagar,” an official health bulletin said.

Meanwhile, the security agencies and the officials of the civil administration held several meetings in Srinagar to deliberate on the situation arising in case of deterioration in Mr. Geelani’s health. The Hurriyat leader has wished to be buried at the ‘Martyrs Graveyard’ in Srinagar’s Eidgah area.

247,2020/02/17,Amazed by Indians’ passion for dance: German choreographer André Koschyk,"André is in the midst of a three-month long tour of India

When German choreographer André Koschyk says that he is “amazed by the passion people have for dance in India”, it might come across merely as a courteous comment after being invited to the country. Koschyk is on a three-month long tour of India to train dancers, who are a part of Indian choreographer Shiamak Davar’s one-year certification course. He goes on to say that he finds the passion for dance here greater than it is in Europe. That is high praise coming from a dancer who has been choreographing, training and performing in Europe for over two decades. “In India, I saw that dancers put their body, heart and soul into dance. That is something I will take with me back home and tell my students there.” André was at The Glitterers - Dance and Fitness Studio in Bengaluru on Sunday for a workshop on tap dance and musical theatre. André got into dancing when he was 15. “In Europe, that is quite late. People who want to become professional dancers start as early as five.”

Influenced by his father, who was a chorister, he wanted to be a singer. “My friends asked me to try out tap dancing… I liked it and that is how it began,” he says.

André was trained at the prestigious Doreen Bird College of Performing Arts in London. He then started his career as a singer and dancer in musical theatre, where he also choreographed many musicals in Germany.

André and his wife run a dance school in Ulm, Germany, where they also have a vocational teacher training course. André is a member of the Fellowship of Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing and a tutor for modern theatre and tap dance. He teaches in various summer schools, including the ISTD summer school in Italy.

Most of his three-month stay was in Mumbai. Despite the “crowded trains” and “crazy traffic”, he found the city welcoming. “I also attended a few Indian classical dance shows. Even though the movements and the stories behind them were unfamiliar to me, I enjoyed the shows.”

Shiamak has devised his own style of dance, which is taught during the course. Of this, he says, “It is hard to describe his style. It borrows elements from jazz and contemporary… and they sort of amalgamate in a nice way.”

André reckons professional courses facilitate careers for dancers. Even in Europe, he says, it isn’t easy to be a professional dancer.

“In Germany, for instance, if you want to have a career in ballet, you have to be versatile. Over there, every big town has a theatre.

You have to write to them and audition there. Sometimes people are looking for a specific type of dancer — tall or short — so, you wouldn’t fit. And, it is difficult to get a long-term contract.”

André says he misses his wife in Germany and is looking forward to his return at the end of February. “But I would love to come to India again.”",dance,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/oz0avc/article30843272.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AndreKoschyk2jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/amazed-by-indians-passion-for-dance-german-choreographer-andr-koschyk/article30843274.ece
248,2020/02/17,"T20 World cup | Young India a top contender, says India captain Harmanpreet Kaur","Harmanpreet says team misses Mithali and Jhulan’s experience, but...

The void left by legends such as Mithali Raj and Jhulan Goswami is not easy to fill, India captain Harmanpreet Kaur said on Monday but also asserted that her young side had grown substantially to be a top contender for this month’s women’s T20 World Cup.

The average age of India’s squad in Australia is 22.8 with Harmanpreet being among the seasoned ones.

“We already miss the experience they shared with us, but these young girls are showing their talent and ability,” said the 29-year-old, speaking at the captains’ media day at Taronga Zoo here.

The ICC Women’s T20 World Cup will open with a clash between India and defending champion and hosts Australia in Adelaide on February 21.

“In the last two years I’ve gone from being the youngest to one of the oldest in the team,” she said. “They never show that they’re young, they can always do what we expect of them. The team is looking in really good shape and showing what they can do with extra responsibility,” she said.

She is still not over the disappointment of missing the ODI world title in 2017 and Harmanpreet said the T20 World Cup trophy would go a long way in making up for that debacle.

“Our team is growing day by day, everyone is looking so positive,” Harmanpreet said. “It’s going to be very big if we win, I was very surprised at all the reaction from 2017. My parents didn’t tell me, they didn’t want us to feel the pressure.”

Reward to be reaped

She is well aware what a long run in an ICC tournament can do for her country. “If we win the World Cup, there’s no doubt things will change.

249,2020/02/17,India in NZ | Senior pacer Trent Boult back for Test series,"Jamieson, Ajaz included; Taylor set to touch 100 in all formats

Fit-again senior pacer Trent Boult has been named in the 13-member New Zealand squad for the first Test against India starting here on February 21.

According to a media release issued by New Zealand Cricket, the 6’ 8” pacer Kyle Jamieson, who made his ODI debut against India in the recent series, has also earned his call-up in the Test squad, which will have slow left-arm orthodox Ajaz Patel as the only spinner.

Big boost

Boult’s comeback is a big boost for the New Zealand side as he missed the entire limited-overs leg due to a fractured right hand sustained during the Boxing Day Test against Australia at the MCG.

“It’s terrific to have Trent back with us and we’re looking forward to the energy and experience he adds to the group alongside his obvious class with the ball in hand,” head coach and chief selector Gary Stead said.

Jamieson, on the other hand, has been included in a pre-series Test squad for the first time. He had replaced injured Lockie Ferguson midway in Australia in December last year.

Mumbai-born Ajaz was chosen over leg-spinner Ish Sodhi because of his consistency. “We’re excited to welcome back Ajaz who has done a great job for us overseas and has a proven domestic record in New Zealand conditions,” the coach said.

Daryl Mitchell is also in the squad as a batting all-rounder. Tom Blundell will continue to open the batting alongside Tom Latham following his breakthrough century in Melbourne.

The Wellington Test will also be Ross Taylor’s 100th Test, joining ranks with his former teammates Brendon McCullum, Daniel Vettori and Stephen Fleming.

Taylor will become the first cricketer in the world to complete 100 games across three international formats.

“To play 100 Tests for your country is an incredible achievement and a testament to his work ethic and complete professionalism,” Stead said of Taylor.

The squad: Kane Williamson (Capt.), Tom Blundell, Trent Boult, Colin de Grandhomme, Kyle Jamieson, Tom Latham, Daryl Mitchell, Henry Nicholls, Ajaz Patel, Tim Southee, Ross Taylor, Neil Wagner and B-J.

250,2020/02/17,"Living a dream, says fast bowler Navdeep Saini","‘Making Team India life-changing’

Fast bowler Navdeep Saini says representing India was a life-changing moment for him and he would look to continue his dream of playing at the highest level after getting a maiden Test call-up for the two-match series against New Zealand.

The 27-year-old has claimed 18 wickets in the limited-overs matches he has played so far.

“It’s everyone’s dream to reach this level. I want to carry this further,” Saini told senior pacer Mohammed Shami in a video posted on BCCI.TV.

“When I was selected for the Indian team, it was like a dream come true for me. I started playing at local level and moved on to Ranji. From there, to becoming a part of Indian national team, it was a life-changing moment for me,” he said.

Asked how he was helping budding cricketers, Saini, who made his India debut during the T20I series against the West Indies last year, said: “I help all the budding cricketers in the academy. I have helped a few kids with cricket equipment, spikes, or financial aid. I have seen how important all these things are for a young cricketer.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/9hth0r/article30845417.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH18SAINI,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/living-a-dream-says-navdeep-saini/article30845418.ece
251,2020/02/17,"Australia will be favourite down under, says Steve Waugh","The former Australian captain also impressed with Marnus Labuschagne’s rise

When Sachin Tendulkar points out someone as the cricketer who reminds him of himself, there is bound to be a lot of interest on the player. But former Australian captain Steve Waugh does not think Marnus Labuschagne could turn out to be someone like Tendulkar though he is very impressed with 25-year-old.

“Maybe he’s trying to put him off by saying so. I don't think so but look, Sachin has got every right to say that.

“Maybe he saw something, in my opinion, his temperament or the way he goes about his batting,” said Waugh on the sidelines of the 20th Laureus World Sports Awards celebrations here.

“He has appetite for runs and tries exceptionally hard. I was really impressed with him when he stood out at the Ashes. He wanted to make a difference, he wanted to be the next player to do well.

“He came a long way from the back of the pack... 12 months ago he was just in the top 26 players in Australia, now he is the fourth-ranked Test batsman in the world. So, it's been an incredible transformation.”

Was he trying to brush away the pressure on Labuschgne?

With Tendulkar's praise, the spotlight will be on Labuschagne, who recently won Australia’s Player-of-the-Year award, as India travels down under towards the end of the year for a four-match Test series.

India had beaten Australia 2-1 for its first-ever Test series win down under early last year, but Waugh felt the Aussies would start favourites this time.

Knowledge of pitches

“Australia will be the favourite I think because we are playing in Australia and we know the pitches well and the day-night Test is something reasonably new. “

“I like the way Virat Kohli is taking that challenge. If you want be the best side in the world, you have to win away from home as much as you can,” he said.

“As you said they won the series last time... you can’t take anything away from India but the fact is, we did not have two of our best batsmen last time and now Labuschagne has come out of nowhere.

“Our bowling attack is settled and there are no weaknesses in the Australian side. India does not have weaknesses too; so it's going to be potentially a great series.”

The coming series could be one where fast bowlers could be the big difference. How does Waugh compare India and Australia in that department?

“India has the best fast bowling attack in India. When they are playing in India they are best attack in the world. When cricket is played in Australia, I think Australia is the best fast bowling attack in the world,” he said.

Slight edge

“So, when they come to Australia, I think we will have a slight edge. And if we go to India, India will have a slight edge.

“Hence, it's touch and go, both captains will be very happy with their personnel and they know they can take 20 wickets. And that's what is needed to win Test matches.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/1vv0yd/article30845275.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH18-STEVE,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/australia-will-be-favourite-down-under-says-steve-waugh/article30845276.ece

262,2020/02/17,Delhi High Court sets aside PCI decision rejecting INS nomination for membership,"The court directed the chairman of PCI to re-consider the eligibility of Hormusji N Cama, Director of Mumbai Samachar and a member of the INS, keeping in view the material placed by the Society.

The Delhi High Court has set aside a decision of the Press Council of India and asked it to reconsider the nomination of a member proposed by the Indian Newspapers Society (INS) for filling up vacancies in the PCI’s 13th term in 2018.

The court directed the chairman of PCI to re-consider the eligibility of Hormusji N Cama, Director of Mumbai Samachar and a member of the INS, keeping in view the material placed by the Society.

The court passed the judgement on the plea by INS against the rejection of nomination of Mr. Cama in the category of medium newspapers.

“The impugned order dated March 20, 2018 in so far as it holds the respondent no.3 [Mr. Cama] to be ineligible to be nominated under Section 5(3)(b) of the Act to the PCI is set aside....,” Justice Navin Chawla said in a recent judgement.

The court said it is important to remember that the purpose of establishment of the PCI is for preserving free Press and for maintaining and improving the standards of newspapers and news agencies in India.

“It is, therefore, important to ensure adequate and proper representation of each category of members, as has been mentioned in...the [Press Council] Act, in the PCI,” it said.

According to the Act, the council consists of a Chairman and 28 other members. The PCI Chairman had said that the nomination of the Editors among Working Journalist categories did not contain the required number of members to be nominated.

The judge said there was no merit in the submission of the INS counsel that instead of remanding the matter back to the chairman for fresh consideration, the court should direct Mr. Cama to be nominated under the Act as a member of PCI, which was represented through advocate T. Singhdev.

The court rejected the INS counsel’s submission that the chairman of the previous council should not have embarked upon an enquiry into the eligibility of Mr. Cama as was done and held him to be ineligible.

“While it is true that there is a presumption of eligibility of a person being nominated by the association, it cannot be extended to a state of fait accompli for the Chairman of the PCI. As far as the Chairman of the council is concerned, he can hold an inquiry to determine the eligibility of such person being nominated, however, being guided by a presumption that such person is eligible,” the court said.

The INS plea contended that the PCI Chairman misread the provisions of the Press Council Act and “wrongly exercised” its power in rejecting the nomination.

Claiming that the decision was “perverse”, the INS had said the council’s decision should be set aside as it was “bad, illegal and void”.

The petition had said that the Chairman was required to invite the panel of names from notified associations for filling up 20 out of 28 vacancies in the PCI and out of those 20, six were to be filled up from among owners or managers of big, small and medium newspapers.

It had said that the PCI rejected the panel of names submitted by the INS by taking the view that it did not contain 12 names for the six vacancies.

“Although the PCI Chairman took the view that the panel was defective as only eight names were provided, yet he purportedly examined the eligibility of each individual name in the panel,” the plea had said, adding that the Chairman proceeded to hold that out of the eight names, Mr. Cama and Kalyan Barooah were ineligible.

Rest of the six were held eligible, it had said.

The petition had said Mr. Cama was a member of the PCI in its 12th term and was seeking nomination to the council in the 13th term.

The INS, which comprises owners of big, medium and small newspapers in India, has sought a direction to the PCI Chairman to recall and set aside the March 20, 2018 decision and forbear from taking any steps in furtherance of the decision.

The plea had said that the PCI should accept the names submitted by the INS on March 13, 2018 and select Mr. Cama as per the indicated preference in the category of the medium-size newspapers under the Act.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/ppisdz/article30842388.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17IN-CAMA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/delhi-high-court-sets-aside-pci-decision-rejecting-ins-nomination-for-membership/article30842353.ece
263,2020/02/17,Jamia viral video: student partially blinded in violence was in same room,"Police banged the door to the research scholars’ section of the library, broke the latch and entered, Mohammed Minhajauddin says.

“What more does the police need in terms of evidence? Everything is crystal clear,” said Mohammed Minhajauddin, who was blinded in one eye during the police crackdown at Jamia Millia Islamia on the night of December 15.

Mr. Minhajauddin was among the many students seen in a CCTV video purportedly of the varsity’s research scholars’ library, where police personnel are seen beating up people present indiscriminately. “A few of my friends and I were there since around 2 p.m. We went downstairs for a while and then returned. We even have CCTV footage of this which we have submitted to the court,” he told The Hindu.

Narrating the sequence of events, Mr. Minhajauddin said that by evening, police had entered and spread across the campus, and everyone was in a state of panic. “There were a lot of sounds, and many students had switched off their laptops and were just worried about finding a way out,” he added. With several people having entered the research scholars’ section to seek refuge, the door to the section, which is the only point of entry, was latched from inside.

“But they (police) banged the door several times, broke the latch and entered,” Mr. Minhajauddin said. After entering, police personnel are in the video seen indiscriminately hitting people with lathis, allegedly without any warning. He said the police gave no instruction to leave the area or anything else, but were simply hitting anyone in sight and were also hurling communal slurs. He added that his fingers were fractured when he was hit by a lathi, and as he tried to escape from the room, he was hit in the left eye and lost his vision.

While police personnel were hitting people with lathis inside the section, more personnel were allegedly waiting at the door and attacking people as they came out, Mr. Minhajauddin said.

“I started to feel unconscious and somehow made my way to the bathroom,” he said. Mobile footage from the day, showed him bleeding from his face, lying unconscious on the floor of the bathroom along with another student.

“Jamia (Millia Islamia administration) could have released this footage and made everything clear, but they were also worried about the law and order situation,” he said. There was enough evidence to establish police brutality and action must be taken, he added.

Mr. Minhajauddin said he is undergoing treatment at AIIMS to ensure that his other eye does not get infected. Various non-profts had reached out to him and were helping him finance his treatment, he said, adding that he had been recommended to go abroad to seek treatment but was yet to take a decision. He said he has approached multiple authorities to lodge a case in the matter and has also moved the High Court to seek compensation. A notice was issued to authorities on February 11 in this regard, he said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/ml2bum/article30841524.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Jamia-library-police-violencejpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/student-partially-blinded-in-jamia-violence-was-in-same-room-as-viral-video/article30841525.ece
264,2020/02/17,"Delhi High Court seeks response of Centre, AAP, police on injured Jamia student’s plea for compensation","Mujeeb sought ₹2 crore compensation for the injuries suffered in alleged police action against anti-CAA protesters.

The Delhi High Court on Monday sought the response of the Centre, the city government and the police on a plea by a Jamia Millia Islamia student seeking compensation for injuries suffered allegedly in police action against anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protesters on December 15 last year.

At the outset, the court was of the view that the student ought to have filed a civil suit if he was seeking compensation as his claims would have to be proved through evidence.

“These are matters of evidence. Why are you not filing a suit for damages? On the basis of annexures in a writ claims cannot be proved,” said a Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice C. Hari Shankar.

“It has become a fashion in Delhi to file a writ for everything,” the Bench said.

Fracture of legs

The plea by Shayaan Mujeeb, a Jamia student, has alleged that his both legs got fractured in the “brutal violence carried out” by security personnel.

He contended that he was in the university library on December 15, 2019 studying, when police personnel entered the building and allegedly beat up the students there.

Advocate Nabila Hasan, representing the student, contended that CCTV footage show the police entering the library and beating up the students. Mr. Mujeeb has sought a ₹2 crore compensation for the injuries suffered and registration of an FIR for the offences allegedly committed by the police.

He also sought reimbursement of ₹2 lakh, which, he claimed, was spent on treatment of his broken legs, in one of which a rod has to be inserted due to the severity of the fracture.

Another claim

Earlier, another student, Mohd Minhajuddin, who claimed to have lost vision in one eye in the incident, had moved a separate plea seeking a probe into the incident and demanded compensation for injuries.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/y5yf38/article30840949.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SAIRAJAMIAPROTESTDELHICAB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/delhi-hc-seeks-response-of-centre-aap-police-on-injured-jamia-students-plea-for-compensation/article30840950.ece

268,2020/02/17,Facial recognition helps police nab burglar,"Stolen valuables worth ₹25 lakh recovered from him: police

Delhi police arrested a burglar with the help of facial recognition application and recovered valuable worth of Rs 25 lakh stolen from a house in South East Delhi's Lajpat Nagar, said police on Sunday.

Police said that the accused, Manoj Singh, is a native of Uttarakhand's Champawat district and was living in a rented house in north Delhi's Burari. He was arrested on Friday, they said.

On February 4, police received a complaint from one Agender Kumar about a burglary at his house. He alleged that someone had broken the lock on the main door of his house to gain entry, the police said.

Singh was seen in the footage of a CCTV camera installed near Kumar's house. He was seen carrying a black bag and was later identified through face recognition app, they said.

On the basis of technical surveillance, the police raided Singh's residence in Champawat's Kaknai village and arrested him, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Southeast) R P Meena said.

Stolen jewellery and cash worth approximately Rs 25 lakh was recovered from him, he said.

During interrogation, Singh told police he wanted to live a lavish lifestyle and was fond of premium whiskey. He often used to visit bars and cafes in Hauz Khas village and Paharganj, he added.

Singh was unemployed and committed burglaries to earn easy money. He has spent thousands of rupees of the stolen money in bars, Mr Meena said.

He looked for houses in colonies and residential societies which would be locked in the day. He stole cash and jewellery but never things like mobile phones and laptops, fearing they could be traced, he said.

Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Sunday said that Delhi Police should remain calm despite “provocation” but should also be concerned about protecting people from“miscreants”.

Speaking at the 73rd Raising Day ceremony of Delhi Police, Mr. Shah called it one of the leading metropolitan police forces in the country and the world.

Citing a speech of the country’s first Home Minister, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel in 1950, Mr. Shah said that despite all the anger and provocation, Delhi Police should remain calm and should also be ready to deal with miscreants with “firm hands” to protect the people. “I believe, on many occasions, Delhi Police has lived up to this advice of Sardar Patel,” he said.

Mr. Shah lauded the police saying that they had helped the government on important occasions. It has helped foil attempts of disturbance.

Constructive criticism

The Minister observed that while constructive criticism of the police force is always welcome, it must also be kept in mind that more than 35,000 police personnel laid down their lives while on duty.

The Minister also paid homage to five policemen who lost their lives in 2001 Parliament terror attack, and inspector M.C. Sharma who died in the Batla House encounter against terrorists.

‘Surreal’, ‘dream come true’, ‘proud moment’ — these were the sentiments of people, called Delhi ke Nirmata by AAP for their contribution to the city’s development, after they shared the stage with Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal during his swearing-in ceremony on Sunday.

Around 50 people from different walks of life were special guests at the event held at the Ramlila Maidan here.

Shabina Naaz, who has been working with night shelters around Chandni Chowk and Kashmiri Gate for the last five years, said she can’t believe it really happened.

“When the first time I got a call I could not believe that it is really happening. I can tell you that only the AAP government can invite a person as unimportant as me,” Naaz said.

Lazwanti, who has been working as a sanitation worker for the last nine years in Delhi, said recognising people like her shows the “affectionate nature” and the ground connect of the AAP government.

“No one recognises our contribution but this government is different. It not only recognised our contribution but also honoured us,” and an emotional Lazwanti said.

Arun Kumar, a bus marshall who saved a six-year-old from being kidnapped, said the experience has changed his life.

“It is an honour for me to represent bus marshals. We work hard every day to provide security to women. The AAP government is very serious about women’s safety and we are making the dream of Arvind Kejriwal true,” said Kumar.

Mr. Kejriwal, in his address after taking oath as Chief Minister, also lauded the contribution of the ‘Delhi ke nirmata’, saying “it is not me, or AAP but all people like these who are responsible for developing the national capital“.

Geeta Devi, a bus marshall, said she always wanted to be a police officer but could not become one.

When she got to know about the work of bus marshal, she applied for it and since then she says she never looked back. “I think that Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is working very hard for the security of women of Delhi. I am a very proud bus marshal and I work to ensure the safety of passengers on the buses. The experience to attend the oath taking ceremony was surreal,” said Devi.

Gajraj Singh thought he was being pranked when he received invitation to attend the oath taking ceremony.

Several Aam Aadmi Party supporters, who gathered at Ramila Maidan for the swearing in of Arvind Kejriwal as Chief Minister, hoped that Mr. Kejriwal would one day address the nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort on Independence Day.

As Mr. Kejriwal was taking oath, sections of crowd started cheering him and asked the CM to become the next Prime Minister.

“The mandate in Delhi is not just for the post of Chief Minister but also the entire country. The work Kejriwal has done here will be spread everywhere,” said Sandeep Mishra who held up a placard with the phrase “Goli Gali Manzoor Nahi, Lal Quila Ab Dur Nahi” [shooting and abuse are not acceptable, red fort is not far now”].

Ramesh Chand, a street vendor from Khyala said, if Mr. Kejriwal continued to work in the way he had been, he would be capable of becoming Prime Minister.

Chants of “Hamara PM Kaisa ho” were returned with crowds saying “Kejriwal Jaisa ho” in multiple small gatherings.

In his address, Mr. Kejriwal also said that he had a dream that people across the world would be praising India and that Delhiites had brought about a change in politics in the country by ushering in “politics of work.”

277,2020/02/17,"This is a celebration of the victory of every Delhiite, says AAP chief","In inaugural speech, Kejriwal defends government’s signature schemes

Addressing the gathering after the Lieutenant-Governor left the dais, Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday defended the previous Aam Aadmi Party government’s steady roll-out of populist schemes, including water and electricity bills and free travel for women on buses.

The Chief Minister said his government is often criticised for making everything free but nature has made everything precious in the world free. “When a mother loves her child or makes a sacrifice, that love is free. The fact that a father stays hungry to afford a good future for his child is priceless. Shravan Kumar [a character from The Ramayana] served his parents with all his might. In the same way, Kejriwal loves his Delhiites and Delhiites love Kejriwal and this love is free. How can I charge a fee from a child in a Delhi government school or ask people to pay for healthcare?” the CM said.

Thanking everyone, Mr. Kerjiwal stressed that it was not his victory that was being celebrated but the victory of every Delhiite. He promised that he would work for every person in the city irrespective of their affiliation to different political parties and would not discriminate on the basis of religion, caste or which strata of society they come from. “Your son has taken oath for the third time as Delhi Chief Minister. This is not my victory but yours. For the last five years, we have worked to make the lives of every person in the Delhi better and we will continue to do the same in the next five years as well,” Mr. Kejriwal said.

Making a mention of the 50 special guests he had invited to share the stage with him, he said, “Delhi is not created by us, or the politicians, or parties. Delhi is Delhi because of the teachers, students, doctors, auto drivers, rickshaw-pullers, businessmen, architects etc. who run it.” He added that the contributions and sacrifices of the people of Delhi is what will take it forward.

Mr. Kejriwal began his address with ‘Bharat Mata ki Jai’, ‘Inquilab Zindabad’ and ‘Vande Mataram’ and ended it by singing ‘Hum Honge Kamyaab’, in which he was joined by the crowd at the venue.

Selection of venue

AAP chose to use Ramlila Maidan for the third time for the oath-taking ceremony as it was the site of the landmark anti-corruption protests of 2011, protests that snowballed into a movement and eventually led to the formation of the party.

The party had planned to keep the ceremony “Delhi-specific” and did not invite Chief Ministers of other States or political leaders.

Thousands of people gathered at Ramlila Maidan to see the oath-taking ceremony of AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday.

The majority of the people present at the spot said they want the AAP government to work like it did in the past five years.

Shahida Begum from Old Delhi, who had come to Ramlila Maidan for the first time, said: “I had voted for him [Kejriwal] and just wanted to see him. My electricity bill is zero and we don’t need to pay for water. What else can I ask for? If he continues doing such work in the next five years, it would be great.”

Minu Ram, a resident of Bhalswa Dairy, who had come to the ceremony with her friend Talat Khan, said they were very satisfied with the work done by the AAP government in the last five years in education and health sectors. She said she would like people of different religions to get along “like both of us”, she said referring to her friend.

For 53-year-old Mohammad Afak, Kejriwal is the “elder son” of the citizens of Delhi.

He said it would be enough if the Chief Minister fulfills the 10 promises mentioned in the “Guarantee Card”.

‘Positive development’

Commenting on AAP's plans to become a national party, Mr. Khan said: “It is a positive development. He [Kejriwal] has more experience than 500 Chief Ministers.”

Some at the venue said they had no problem with the Delhi government having not even a single woman in the Cabinet. However, 24-year-old Hafiza said: “There should have been at least one woman.”

Baby Singh, a housewife, said there were no women Ministers in the previous Cabinet either “but work got done right? That's all that matters,” she said. With the ceremony ending by early afternoon, crowds from the spot spilled out on to the streets, celebrating the occasion with many chanting — Desh Ka PM Kaisa Ho..Kejriwal Jaisa Ho.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/vzpra4/article30837869.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE16AAP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/thousands-flock-to-ramlila-maidan-to-support-aap/article30837874.ece
279,2020/02/17,AAP-branded free soft drink causes chaos,"A man sustains minor injuries while another loses his phone

Chaos ensued at a free beverages stall set up inside Ramlila Maidan on Sunday when an unruly crowd tried to get AAP-branded soft drinks.

The AAP Cola —with a tagline that says “drink and fight corruption” — was distributed for free at the venue. It came in cola, lemon, orange and ‘surprise’ flavours.

The commotion started when the stalls, which were manned by eight to ten volunteers, started giving away the soft drink to those who flocked there to witness the swearing-in ceremony of Arvind Kejriwal as Delhi Chief Minister.

Since it was a hot day, hundreds of people at the spot choose the drink over free free potable water supplied by Delhi Jal Board, just next to the beverage stall.

Cola bottles in the air

In absence of any arrangement to maintain queues, the stall got overcrowded.

The people at the event started snatching the cola bottles from each other. After this, the AAP volunteers started throwing the bottles at the crowd due to which the numbers started swelling up after the end of the swearing-in ceremony.

Amid the chaos, a man, in his early 50s, got injured while trying to get the cola drink. He, however, managed to get hold of a lemon flavour at the end.

Another man, Zulfikar from Bhajanpura said he lost his mobile phone while trying to get a cola bottle. “I regret the decision,” he said.

As the security personnel at the spot failed to contain the mob, many people later resorted to ransacking the stall from the sides and the back to get hold of as many free drinks as they could. A few AAP volunteers nabbed a man, who they claim was a phone snatcher. He was later handed over to the police.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/m8kfd2/article30837867.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE16COLA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/aap-branded-free-soft-drink-causes-chaos/article30837868.ece
280,2020/02/17,Group of AAP volunteers from Hyderabad attend event,"Belonging to all age groups and from different walks of life, they feel need to revamp AAP in their State

Among the thousands of people at Ramlila Maidan on Sunday were several Aam Aadmi Party volunteers who travelled from places as far as Hyderabad to attend the oath-taking ceremony.

Acutely aware of AAP’s intention to broaden its footprint across the country after the landslide victory in Delhi, the group of around 20 volunteers said: “We need to revamp the party organisation in the State from the ground-level.”

They said they are hoping that in other States too “they get to as see a similar level of development and work done by Mr. Kejriwal. This kind of politics should be an example for other States too”.

The volunteers who had come on an invitation from AAP had people belonging to all age groups and from different walks of life.

Jairam Reddy, a full-time AAP volunteer, said he has left everything to devote his time to the party. On being asked from where he gets money to support his family, Mr. Reddy said: “My wife is a government employee.” He added: “We all came to Delhi in a train...we are very happy to witness Mr. Kejriwal become the Chief Minister again.”

Retired physics professor Balalaxmi said he has devoted his life to bring about social change. The 70-year-old said: “I wish to see the Delhi model of development in all States across the country.”

Revanth Reddy, a young MBA graduate, who is currently working at a micro-finance firm in Hyderabad, said: “We are expecting him [Kejriwal] to be the Prime Minister of India someday.” As a volunteer, Mr. Reddy said he handles social media marketing for AAP in his region.

Talking about the support AAP has in Hyderabad, the volunteers said there are about one lakh volunteers in the State.

At the venue, a man named Satyadev Manjhi had cycled all the way from Maharajganj in Bihar to witness the ceremony. “Desh pe har jagah jhaddu lagna chahiye [every part of the country should be cleaned using a broom]. Main yaha AAP ko aashirwad dene aaya hu [I am here to bless AAP],” Mr. Manjhi said.

He also wished that Mr. Kejriwal will support his Hum Do Hamare Do scheme of population control.

“I have collected signatures of over 15,000 people, who have supported the idea,” he added.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/x9tzv/article30837854.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL17AAPVOLUNTEERGROUPFROMHYDERABAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/group-of-aap-volunteers-from-hyderabad-attend-event/article30837855.ece
281,2020/02/17,Naga tribal traditions kept alive by Runway Nagaland art collective,"From battle dances to artistic patterns inspired by fauna, the vast breadth of Naga culture is on display at Chennai’s Nagaland Festival

Hundreds of delicate cotton strands make way for shimmering glass beads in the nimble fingers of Angam Konyak. A member of the Konyak Naga tribe, Angam is busy at work, seated on a low wooden footstool, in a black top paired with striped mekhela (a skirt, half of a traditional ensemble called mekhela chador), resplendent with a yaknyv (wedding headband), necklace and belt in shades of orange, blue and white. Angam is part of the artisan collective Runway Nagaland, presently visiting DakshinaChitra for the ongoing Nagaland festival, that runs throughout this week.

Nengneithem Hengna, from the Kuki tribe, founder of Runway Nagaland, is interacting with visitors at the stall, as they inquire about customised jewellery. She hands out cards with her Instagram account, for more details.

“When I started Runway Nagaland in 2013, I wanted to create a special space for Naga women, to pass on their traditions with a good business model in place. We cannot market ancient traditions to customers unless we give it a contemporary twist. Each design carefully mirrors traditional pieces, but we play with colours, making each piece wearable with multiple ensembles,” Hengna explains.

Helping hand Chizami Weaves works with around 600 weavers from Chizami and 14 units (towns/villages) in Phek district and Kohima Town.

Their aim is to promote the textile weaving tradition of Naga women, ensure a sustainable source of income for the women weavers who are also farmers, and to enhance economic, social and cultural rights of women.

Runway Nagaland comprises 25 women from the Kuki, Konyak, Sumi, Zeliang, Sangtam, Phom, Ao and Chakesang tribes, between ages 19 to 47. Some them are school or college dropouts, some are widows, and many come from financially unstable backgrounds. The startup is a self-sustaining enterprise that uses local material like bamboo, cotton, jute, paper, banana fibre, brass, creating intricate patterns for necklaces, earrings and belts.

It is painstaking work. A single angyak, or queen’s necklace, could be fashioned out of 175-300 strands of beads. “It was used as an upper body garment in the olden days, before women wore blouses,” says Henga, placing an amber one at her neck.

“Starting this endeavour was important to pass on our culture to future generations, and generate employment locally. Otherwise they leave for greener pastures across the country, and we miss a vital link in our ecosystem,” Hengna says.

As Angam defty strings multi-hued glass beads, Hengna pulls out a necklace, a delicate tapestry of black, red, yellow and white beads, called the thangnang. “There is folklore around this piece,” she explains with a glint in her eye. Legend has it that a Naga weaver was visited by a serpent, and falling in love with it, transferred the pattern on its slithering body to woven art. The thangnang mimics this intricate design.

Those who help themselves

Runway Nagaland also champions the cause of its weavers with its handloom branch called Kinep, meaning ‘hope’ in the Kuki dialect. The female weavers make soft cotton pouches to pack the jewellery as well as bags with varied motifs on them. Wooden masks of local tribespeople also dot the store display, with distinct earpieces and hairstyles.

Naga headgear, weapons, shawls and photographs are on display at another stall, curated by Dingde Gangte, an alumnus of the Arts Management course at DakshinaChitra. Sharath Nambiar, director at the living history museum, states, “We organise one national festival every year. For 2020, we chose Nagaland, since it is such a vibrant state with a rich culture and oral tradition.These festivals serve to bridge the widening gap between the urban and rural dweller.”

spirits from the village

In the courtyard, Kuyingpong Culture Society performs a tribal dance, with women and men dressed in finery, arms interlocked as they sing and move to a rhythmic beat. Next to the performance arena, some students come Hengna’s way and say, “Aunty, your necklace... just super!” Hengna, overwhelmed by this sudden show of emotion, gently smiles and says, “A lot of people love our work, but complain that we don’t sell at regular prices, though we do not use precious metals or stones. Our price reflects the value we attach to our culture and our stories. Our rich palette with varying shades of red is informed by our warrior ancestry. What we make at Runway, is our way of giving our children and countrymen, a part of what we hold closest to our hearts.”

Runway Nagaland sells its jewellery at stores in Kolkata, New Delhi, Bengaluru, Mumbai and online at jaypore.com and vajore.com.

282,2020/02/17,India’s history in currency is the subject of Rezwan Razack’s Museum of Indian Paper Money,"Take note

Hailed as the largest collector of Indian currency, Rezwan Razack has opened South India’s first currency museum in Bengaluru. “I am so happy that the former Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, C. Rangarajan inaugurated the museum,” says Razack.

Razack, co-founder and joint MD of Prestige Group, is the Chairman of the International Bank Note Society, India Banknote Collectors’ Chapter, and is recognised for his contribution to the advancement of numismatic knowledge. Razack, who built his collection over 50 years with exhaustive research, enjoys sharing his knowledge with students and encourages budding collectors to promote numismatics as a hobby.

He has co-authored The Revised Standard Reference Guide to Indian Paper Money in 2012, and in 2017 wrote One Rupee One Hundred Years 1917-2017 to mark the centenary of the issuance of the one rupee note. “Rezwan Razack’s Museum of Indian Paper Money will not only be the first of its kind in India, but also the world,” says Razack.

The museum at Prestige Falcon Towers on Bruntun Road, has trained guides to take visitors through the history of currency in India. “The story of money is woven into our very being, uniting us, dividing us, giving us a sense of identity and mapping people or the nation’s power, crises and triumphs. I consider it a comprehensive restoration and preservation of an important national heritage. It is also something that numismatists worldwide will benefit from.”

The initiative, he says, is to help educate, inform and entertain. “The rupee is one thing that is ever present in our lives but never seen as a source of history, information and national pride. I hope visitors understand, enjoy and value this museum of our collective economic heritage.”

The museum displays a diverse collection of Indian paper money and the related material drawn from the Indian subcontinent. “While the concept of money has existed since almost the beginning of civilization, the invention of paper currency is more recent,” says Razack. From the early barter systems and the use of coins as currency, the museum introduces the visitor to paper currency, its origins and its use.

Apart from its selection of banknotes dating back to the early 1800s, an auxiliary collection has also been put together to explain the inspirations and techniques of making paper currency. While original hand-painted essays, patterns, proofs, trials, specimen notes, autographed notes and a rare Star of India Medal demonstrate fascinating aspects of money, meticulously sourced cheques, stamp papers relating to Indian paper money, booklets and banknotes help decode the world of money.

“This museum has been planned meticulously over three years to conform to international standards of lighting and climate control,” says Razack, adding that people don’t often retain paper money“My visits to cut-note dealers in Chickpet and in Fort Bombay gradually increased my collection,” he says, acknowledging that his persistence paid off.

Razack says his collection includes the oldest surviving note from 1812 of Bank of Bengal right up to the notes of 2017 of all denominations. The rare ones are the early Presidency Banknotes of Bank of Hindostan, Bank of Bengal, Commercial Bank, Calcutta Bank, Bank of Bombay, Bank of Western India, Asiatic Bank and Bank of Madras; British India’s Portrait Notes of Queen Victoria, Portrait Notes of King George V and King George VI; and Indian Notes used in Burma and Pakistan; Notes of Indo-Portuguese and Indo-French Territories and Indian Notes since Independence, also used by Haj Pilgrims and in Persian Gulf States.

There is also a lot of importance behind his book dedicated to the One Rupee note. The first One Rupee Note in India was issued on November 30, 1917. “To celebrate 100 years of the one rupee note in India, my book focusses on the origin and journey of the smallest existing denomination through the century, while examining its genesis. As the general population in India were unacquainted with paper notes until 1917, one of the methods adopted to increase the popularity of the one rupee note was to print a picture of the silver one rupee coin on both sides of the note.”

At Prestige Falcon Towers, 19 Brunton Road, Bengaluru; 10-30 a.m. to 5-30 p.m.; closed on Mondays and public holidays;entry ₹100

The collection

The collection includes banknotes from the early 1800s, early private and presidency banks, including the uniface or one-sided notes attributed to the colonial Government of India. The portrait notes of British monarchs such as Queen Victoria, King George V and VI are also present, while India’s colonial history has been documented in the notes from French and Portuguese India. From the princely states of Hyderabad, Jammu and Kashmir and Indian notes issued in the 19th century, to the Saurashtra and prisoners of war cash coupons, the museum maps the shifting kaleidoscope of history in the Indian subcontinent. Indian Notes used in Burma and Pakistan and rare notes used in the Persian Gulf States and by Haj pilgrims are valuable additions.

The beginnings

The journey of collecting paper money for Rizwan Razack began 50 years ago. It all started with the ‘cancelled’ stamped on some Reserve Bank of India banknotes kept in an iron safe at his ancestral family home in Bengaluru. The children were at times privileged to open the iron safe to keep the day’s collection of their grandfather Hajee Abdul Sattar Sait, a trader who ran a lucrative retail business. “The privilege of safely keeping the money packed in a cloth bag was a joy, because, we also discovered other belongings stored in the big iron safe. I remember seeing a few RBI notes with the portrait of King George VI that were cancelled with a rubber stamp which read “Pakistan Note Payment Refused.” I wondered how Reserve Bank of India notes could be Pakistan money and my question remained unanswered for many years.

Collecting, observing and studying them became Razack’s hobby. And in 1971 during his holidays to Coonoor in Nilgiris he saw his cousin, Sadiq Haroon with more such Indian Banknotes at his oak writing desk. One of them read “Rupees Two Annas Eight” or two and a half rupees that he grabbed from Sadiq, amazed at a banknote of a fractional denomination. “After I returned to Bangalore, I pestered my grandfather to give me all the antique banknotes that he had,” says Razack.",history & culture,https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/g3k2pc/article30842043.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17bgm-leadRezwanRazackjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/rizwan-razacks-museum-of-currency/article30842045.ece
283,2020/02/17,"The story of Palam, Delhi","Palam village was held in higher regard centuries ago than it is today

Palam village is a relic of Dhilli or Dhillika, founded by the Tomars. The ancient name of Palam is Palamba and some historians trace its antiquity to Raja Soni, the founder of Sonepat, who was the 13th in descent from Arjuna. The village was flourishing at the time of Mohammad bin Tughlak, in whose reign the Moorish traveller Ibn Battuta visited it.

He was a native of Tangier who came to India in 1333 and remained in Delhi until 1342 after being appointed Chief Qazi. Battuta described Delhi as “a most magnificent city, its mosques and walls without an equal on earth”. But he observed that although the king was then re-peopling it (after his futile experiment to transfer the capital to Daulatabad), it was almost a desert.

“The greatest city in the world has the fewest inhabitants,” he said. What a contrast to present-day Delhi, almost bursting at the seams, and extending even to the remotest pockets which were once thinly populated villages!

One of the landmarks of Palam village (besides the airport to which it has given its name) is the mosque said to have been constructed by a nobleman called Ghaznafar in about AD 1528, which makes it perhaps the only structure of Babar’s reign in Delhi that has survived the ravages of time.

The mosque is built of Kakaia eent (small bricks), with three arched openings leading to its not very large prayer chamber. On the four corners of the roof are small minarets with domes. There are Persian and Arabic inscriptions on the mosque which give the date of its construction as 935AH (Al Hijri).

One is inclined to believe that either this mosque was rebuilt by the illustrious Ghaznafar or there was another masjid in the village that naturally called for an inspection by the Chief Qazi (Ibn Battuta). The Moor’s Travelogue, written after his return to Tangiers, is about the most truthful account of the reign of Mohammad Tughlak. Batuta was a keen observer, who would have made a fine journalist in more recent times.

Palam was also famous for its baoli or step-well, with a Sanskrit inscription, believed to have been written in 1276 during the reign of Balban, one of the great Slave rulers. This means that Palam was more than a village in those times.

Even as late as the time of Shehzada Ali Gohar, who ruled as Shah Alam II from 1759 to 1806, Palam was considered an important suburb of the capital.

The popular saying then wasSultanat-e-Shah Alam, Az Dilli ta Palam, meaning, 'The empire of Shah Alam is from Delhi to Palam', a poignant assessment of the domain of the blind emperor (Andha Moghul to the residents of old Palam).

284,2020/02/17,A musical dozen,"A package of 12 films on Indian musical tradition will be part of BIFFes

Film critic and former artistic director of BIFFes, HN Narahari Rao has put together 12 films on the theme of Indian musical tradition and cinema. “Films including Hamsageethe, Tyagaraja, Purandaradasa, Baiju Bawra, Swathi Tirnal, Meera Tansen, Sant Tukaram, Kanakadasa will be screened,” informed N Vidyashankar, Artistic Director BIFFes.

Rao says, “Indian music has a unique tradition encompassing different forms and styles. It is necessary to study Indian cinema focusing on how music has become an integral part. Probably no other country has used music in cinema to the extent that India has.

“India is a country of vast cultural diversity and the traditions we follow have evolved into different forms and styles of music. In the classical mode itself we have different formats such as Carnatic and Hindustani. There is also a rich tradition of folk music.”

Rao says, ever since the release of Alam Ara (1931) songs have been an integral part of our films. “Cinema was considered an extension of professional theatre, where songs were sung by actors on stage. This tradition has continued to this day. As music and dance, became inseparable from cinema, music directors, singers, composers and lyricists found a platform.”

Films for the package are chosen from 1936 to 2015. Vishnupanth Govind Damle’s Sant Tukaram (1936) is a Marathi film about the saint. It was adjudged one of the three best films of world at Venice Film Festival. It was the first Indian film to run in a single theatre for more than a year and set the template for devotional films. The music had a telling impact on the audience. The music was composed by Keshavarao Bhole. On the other end of the spectrum is the Marathi film, Katyar Kaljat Ghusli (2015) based on the eponymous play with music composed by Shankar Ehsan-Loy.

The highlight of Tansen (1943) is its music. Khemchand Prakash had composed the music and KL Saigal, who was at the peak of his popularity played the role of Tansen. It was challenging job for Khemchand to create Hindustani classical music tunes for the songs. There are 13 songs composed in various ragas in this film including Deepaka and Megha Malhar.

A musical feast, Meera (1945) with MS Subbulakshmi in the lead, directed by Ellis R Dungan is memorable. Meera received rave reviews and The Free Press Journal wrote, “Meera transports us into a different world of Bhakti, piety and melody. It shatters the misguided belief that film music in inferior.”

Chittur V Nagaiah’s Tyagayya (1946) is still remembered for its soul-stirring music. Nagayya plays Tyagaraja rendering the numerous songs in his sweet voice with authentic pronunciation of Telugu words.

Vijay Bhat’s Baiju Bawra (1952) was a trendsetter. For the first time Naushad adapted Hindustani classical ragas to create immortal songs. Mohammad Rafi and Lata Mangeshkar became stars through this film.

TV Singh Thakur’s Jagajyothi Basaveshwara (1959) introduced vachanas-a form of rhythmic writing in Kannada that evolved in the 11th century. Starring Honnappa Bhagavatar, Rajkumar K S Ashwath and B Sarojadevi the film was scored by GK Venkatesh.

Y R Swamy’s Bhakta Kanakadasa (1960) depicts Kanakadasa’s spiritual journey. The film starring Rajkumar and Krishna Kumari is Kannada cinema’s 100th production. Scored by M Venkataraju and Dasa Padagalu, the songs were sung by P.B. Srinivas and S Janaki.

Sri Purandara Dasaru (1967) directed by CV Raju starring K. S Ashwath, R Nagendra Rao stole the hearts of music lovers thanks to the Purandaradasa poems sung by ML Vasanthakumari, M Balamuralikrishna and PB Srinivas.

GV Iyer’s Hamsageethe (1975) had few dialogues. Most of the story of singer Venkatasubbaiah is told through characters, who sing. Most part of the films narrated through song sequences. Balamuralikrishna’s compositions are treat while BV Karanth’s background score helped create the right ambience.

Shankarabharanam (1980) directed by K Vishwanathan discussed the chasm between classical and western music.

285,2020/02/17,"On Ragya, an Indian Classical music streaming app, songs follow the sun","Sunrise, afternoon, late evenings... here’s an app that plays the apt raga for the time of day

Enthusiasts of Indian Classical music will know that every raga is designed to be played at a certain time of the day (prahar). There are your early morning ragas like Bhairav, your late afternoon ones like Bhimpalasi, and your night ones like Bihag.

Now what if you had a music player, that could identify the time and play ragas by veteran Hindustani music exponents in the background, as you go about your day? This was the initial concept behind Ragya, a nascent music streaming app launched by Mumbai-based Aditya Dipankar.

Ragya is dedicated to Indian Classical music, and is as of now full of Hindustani music. “We launched the current version of this app last year, and the idea of providing music according to the time of the day proved really popular. It gives listeners a curated experience,” says Aditya. The track works in tandem with the clean interface and muted backgrounds that sets the mood for the day.

The app features artistes such as Bhimsen Joshi, Satyasheel Deshpande, Sanjoy Bandopadhyay, Anuradha Kuber and Anupama Bhagwat. “We reached out to artistes who provided us with exclusive songs, some from private baithaks,” he says.

Apart from that, he has also reached out to lesser-known artistes. “Most existing platforms chase established artistes, but there is no other platform apart from Youtube and Facebook for these yet new talents to be discovered.”

Aditya’s background in Classical music made the curation process a bit easier. He has played the tabla for 12 years as a child, gotten training in Hindustani vocals, and is partial to nirguni music. It was in 2014, while he was training and looking for a Hindustani music streaming app, that he conceived the idea of Ragya.

“We couldn’t find an app, so we thought we might as well make one for ourselves. The first version of Ragya was actually just a YouTube playlist,” he says, explaining how they created an algorithm to play from a YouTube playlist that they curated and filled with ragas based on the time of the day.

In its current format, the app is more like a radio, with limited browsing options. However, Aditya adds that they are currently working on the next version which will make the listening experience more customised. “With feedback from listeners, we will next include options to browse by selecting not just time of the day, but the artist, instrument, gharana, raaga, and also moods such as to help you calm down, or concentrate, or put you to sleep and so on. This should be done in the next three months,” he says.

By deepening their niche in Indian Classical Music, they hope to stand apart from the many music streaming apps in the market. “We are not worried about competing with them because what we are creating is tailored for Indian Classical music. The others may have libraries and collections for this, but they have not built anything on top of that database, whereas we are trying to provide a listening experience,” says Aditya, adding that they also hope to move into Carnatic music in the near future.

Shoring up the defence against the scourge of human trafficking, the district Anti-Human Trafficking Unit under the Police Department has set up Anti-Human Trafficking Clubs at 11 colleges spread across the city and rural police limits.

So far, clubs have been formed in five colleges in Ernakulam rural and six colleges in the city limits drawing 15 students from each college.

However, a decision has been taken to open the clubs in more colleges and engage maximum number of students. “The members of the club will actively associate with police and labour departments during raid and rescue operations and extend assistance to victims. They will also pass on information about potential human trafficking to enforcement agencies,” said Jeffin Franco, child rescue officer, District Child Protection Unit.

A decision has also been taken to organise awareness campaigns with the participation of club members about human trafficking at important points in the district.

Initially, the clubs were restricted to colleges offering law and B.Ed courses. However, it was decided to expand it to colleges offering courses in social work after the need for social work students was acutely felt. The clubs have been launched in five such colleges offering social work in association with the District Child Protection Unit under the Women and Child Development Department

The department was already engaging social work students in connection with its ongoing project Sarana Balyam aimed at cracking down on child labour and beggary, exploitation of children, and life on the streets. Besides, the children rescued during drives are being rehabilitated through the district child protection unit.

S. Sreejith, Inspector General of Police, South Zone, and nodal officer for the Anti-Human Trafficking Unit, inaugurated the activities of the Anti-Human Trafficking Club in Ernakulam rural limits at the district police headquarters recently.

District Collector S. Suhas has asked the representatives of Kochi Music Foundation (KMF) not to use his name as a patron of the organisation.

The letter comes close on the heels of allegations raised against the KMF representatives that they had not remitted the proceeds of ‘Karuna’, a musical event held here on November 1, towards the Chief Minister’s Distress Relief Fund.

After the controversy erupted, Aashiq Abu, filmmaker and one of the organisers of the event, had posted the image of a cheque for ₹6.22 lakh dated February 14 towards the relief fund. The director had claimed in his social media post that the event was not meant to collect funds for the relief fund. However, they later took a decision to contribute it towards the fund.

In a letter addressed to Bijibal, music director and secretary of KMF, Mr. Suhas said he was not a patron of the foundation and it was found that the representatives had used his name without his permission. He also warned that legal action would be taken against them for using his name.

Plaint to police

The Collector said he had forwarded a complaint filed by Sandeep Warrier, State secretary of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha, alleging financial irregularities in the conduct of the music event to the District Police Chief (Kochi city).

Mr. Bijibal said in his response that the inclusion of the name of the District Collector as a patron was a “clerical error” from their side. He asked those raising allegations against the organisers of the event to take the legal course.

Mr. Warrier had shared an RTI document last week alleging that the organisers had not remitted the proceeds of the event towards the CM’s relief fund.

Hibi Eden, Congress MP, had alleged that the organisers had submitted a letter to the managing committee of the Rajiv Gandhi Indoor Stadium saying that the musical event was held for collecting money for the relief fund. He had also pointed out that the cheque for ₹6.22 lakh was remitted only after the issue hit the headlines.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/collector-warns-of-legalaction-against-kmf/article30844090.ece
288,2020/02/17,KVK to boost availability of desi poultry in urban homes,"Chicks to be procured for sale after ensuring their purity

The Ernakulam Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) will help boost the availability of authentic desi poultry in urban homes through an initiative to gather one-day-old chicks from poultry farmers after ensuring the purity of the genus and distribute them through its sales counter at the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI) premises.

As a first step, the KVK formed a group of desi poultry farmers and their self-help group recently.

After collecting the chicks, the KVK will rear them for two months and during the period necessary vaccines and feed will be administered. The chicks will then be handed over to those in need of the variety, said Shinoj Subramanian, head of KVK.

Before the chicks are bought, the KVK will ensure that farmers follow scientific practice in poultry farms as advised by the Centre.

There is a strong demand for desi poultry products among city residents. “The KVK will start buying the chicks of original desi genus from next May, and it is expected that the vaccinated poultry could be distributed by July,” said the KVK official.

KVK has also decided that the desi eggs and poultry will be made available in the market with a brand name. In addition to creating a marketing avenue for eggs, the price will be made uniform.

A few health clubs in the city have already approached the KVK for genuine desi eggs. Currently, there is no systematic market for desi eggs. Even though there is huge demand for the produce in the city, lack of proper market network stands in the way of farmers.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/tcw1gu/article30839450.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/chick,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/kvk-to-boost-availability-of-desi-poultry-in-urban-homes/article30839451.ece
289,2020/02/17,Crackdown on goods carriers with improper number plates,"High-security registration plates mandatory for vehicles

Goods carriers and other vehicles are wantonly flouting norms regarding registration number plates, even as the Motor Vehicles Department (MVD) has launched a clampdown on automobile dealers who do not fix high-security registration plates (HSRP) free of cost on vehicles that they roll out from their showrooms.

The situation is such that national-permit goods carriers from other States and many such vehicles that are registered in Kerala either do not have proper registration number plates or have their under-run protector fixed in such a way that a view of the rear number plate is blocked.

Ernakulam RTO, K. Manoj Kumar said that it was now mandatory that all goods carriers prominently paint their registration number on the rear right side of their body also, since instances of rear number plate being blocked or damaged are on the rise. “Only then will our inspectors issue fitness certificate every year to goods carriers. This will also lessen instances of hit-and-run.”

Meeting of dealers

He added that a meeting of dealers was convened recently, where automobile dealers were warned of their trade certificate being cancelled if they failed to affix high-security number plates on vehicles that they sell. The MVD will also write to the vehicle manufacturer concerned, seeking action against errant dealers. The clampdown follows instances of half a dozen brand new vehicles being caught during inspections with improper number plates. It was found that dealers handed over the number plates to vehicle owners, rather than affixing them on the vehicles. The errant owners thus affixed fancy number plates which were not properly visible, Mr. Manoj Kumar said.

But the MVD can only impose fine when it comes to vehicles from other States which violate the rule or have their number plate hidden. Else, checking would have to be intensified in border check posts, MVD sources said. On many container lorries operating with different registration numbers at the front and rear, they said it was permissible, since the driver cabin and trailer portion may have different permits. Action will be taken based on the front registration number, in case of accidents or hit-and-run cases.

The HSRPs come with a 15-year guarantee and have inbuilt security features such as a self-destructive sticker, with the engine and chassis numbers of the vehicle. The plates will be fitted on the front and rear of the vehicles, while windscreens will have a number plate tag with hologram. A chromium-based hologram will be applied by hot-stamping on the top left corner of the number plates, both at the front and back. A permanent identification number with a minimum of 10 digits will be laser-branded into the reflective sheeting on the bottom left of the registration plate.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/kg6ufe/article30839440.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17KINUMBERPLATE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/crackdown-on-goods-carriers-with-improper-number-plates/article30839441.ece
290,2020/02/17,KWA lab facilities not being utilised fully: staff forum,"Regional laboratory at Nettoor stops water quality testing for the public

The Kerala Water Authority Staff Association has alleged that facilities at the KWA regional laboratory at Nettoor are not being fully utilised.

Though the laboratory is equipped with machinery to test the quality of water meters, officials are yet to formulate any process in this regard.

The water meter quality check laboratory, set up at a cost of ₹30 lakh, was being wasted by the KWA. It was likely that more funds would be required to make it functional if steps were not taken to utilise the equipment immediately, said a statement issued by the association.

Association district secretary Ragesh B. said that the KWA continued to rely on crude methods to test meters, which were then made available to customers. The issue had been raised with senior officials on several occasions, he said.

The regional laboratory, which used to take up water quality testing for the public, has stopped providing the service.

At present, the services are available only at the laboratory at Aluva. People have to visit the laboratory several times to get the results, and hence the KWA is urged to set up one more lab in the district.

Speaking to The Hindu, regional laboratory director Jessy Jose said the KWA was evolving a package for water meter testing that could be utilised not by domestic consumers, but high-end consumers. The laboratory does not have the facility to test more than 60 meters a day even with equipment to test ten at a time.

However, the market demand is about 3,000 meters a month, she added.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/kwa-lab-facilities-not-being-utilised-fully-staff-forum/article30839428.ece

With three more persons who visited China in recent times placed in home quarantine on Sunday, the number of those under home observation for any risk of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection in the district rose to 328. No one has shown any symptoms of infections so far.

According to the district medical officer, the two patients in the isolation ward at Government Medical College, Ernakulam who had tested negative for COVID-19 have been discharged. Two samples of body fluids were sent to the National Institute of Virology laboratory in Alappuzha, of which one was sent for a re-examination.

The Health authorities have started issuing certificates to those who have completed their 28-day quarantine. All those under home or hospital observation are required to get the certificates from their respective region’s government healthcare institution.

Counselling facilities are being provided to those in quarantine as they had voluntarily given up their freedom of movement for the larger good so that the community they move about in remains free of the risk of infection. Counsellors arranged by the district health authorities contacted 54 people over telephone as part of the counselling programme.

Six persons contacted the district control room on Sunday for more information on COVID-19. The only number now available to call for information is 0484 2368802.

293,2020/02/17,Hat-trick for Mulanthuruthy panchayat,"Local body wins second prize for best performing grama panchayat in Kerala

The successful implementation of various welfare schemes and innovative farming methods has won Mulanthurthy pancyhayat the second prize at the State-level for the best performing grama panchayat. It is for the third time in a row that Kochi’s neighbourhood panchayat is winning the honours, bringing cheer to a host of people who have worked behind the scenes to make the panchayat a model for others.

The honour is doubly sweet for panchayat president Renji Kurian Kollinal, who has been chosen best panchayat president in the State. He is on the verge of achieving a hat-trick. C.S. Sosamma, now retired, has won recognition for her performance as the panchayat secretary.

The local body truly deserved to be honoured, said Saji Mulanthuruthy, social activist and journalist, about the recognitions.

According to him, while it has been an all-round performance, the authorities have done well to get the panchayat rid of fallow land, encouraging farming in a big way over the last three years.

Mr. Kurian said one of the panchayat’s significant achievements had been on the farming front. Actively farmed land in Mulanthuruthy had increased from 64 hectares to over 200 hectares over the years, he said on Sunday.

Mulanthuruthy Public Library secretary K.K. Sunny said the local body had shown the way for others. The panchayat banned plastic about six months ago and was on its way to shifting totally to LED lighting systems as part of a massive energy efficiency move, he said.

Benoy Haridas, a panchayat member, said the local body had been following the directions set by the government in different areas of activities. The Haritha Keralam mission had been implemented through different initiatives, including joint liability groups that had brought fallow land under cultivation, he said.

Mr. Kurian said not only had farming base been expanded, but the panchayat had also succeeded in forming its own ‘Green Army’ of farm hands and mechanising all operations, including planting and harvesting.

Mobile app

The panchayat has also taken steps to care for its aged as well as children, while developing a mobile application to provide various services to the public. The local body has received ISO certification for its operations.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/pdflub/article30837654.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ki17Swaraj1jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/hat-trick-for-mulanthuruthy-panchayat/article30837657.ece
294,2020/02/17,GPS installation in water tankers put on back burner,"No action being taken against tankers collecting water from private wells

The district administration has put on the back burner the directive that all private water tankers operating in Ernakulam should install Global Positioning System (GPS) before January 31.

The move comes close on the heels of relaxing the norms prescribed by the Assembly Committee on Petitions that had recommended stringent measures against private tankers found drawing water from illegal sources. At present, no action is being taken against tankers collecting water from private wells despite the committee’s directive that water should be taken only from hydrants managed by the Kerala Water Authority (KWA). The Assembly committee had also clarified that water would be provided only to tanker lorries having GPS facility.

Officials of the special committee constituted by the district administration to monitor and check the quality of water being supplied in private tankers said they were not taking any action against tankers not having GPS facility. “With the rules for drawing water getting relaxed, we are not looking at whether the tanker operators have installed GPS in their vehicles,” they said.

According to official estimates, 441 tankers transporting drinking water were certified by the Regional Transport Office based on the directive issued by the Assembly Committee as on Friday. “Except for a few new water tankers, none of the other vehicles have GPS facility. Ninety-two tankers transporting sewage water and 33 collecting raw water had also received certification from the Motor Vehicles Department,” said officials.

With the enforcement of GPS norms being delayed, the special team involved in the monitoring of private water tankers will not be able to locate the spots from where the vehicles were drawing water. Round-the-clock tracking cannot be done through daily surprise checks alone due to the manpower shortage for such a massive operation. Unless the authorities issued a directive stating that tanker lorries without the facility would not be permitted to operate, the Operation Pure Water initiative would not yield desired results, said officials.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/drokhl/article30837628.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16KIWATERTANKER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/gps-installation-in-water-tankers-put-on-back-burner/article30837629.ece
295,2020/02/17,All that glow: How singer Chinmayi got into skincare,"The playback singer has developed an online platform to bring K-beauty products to Indian consumers

Playback singer Chinmayi swears by Pyunkang Yul Essence Toner and Leegeehaam Grow Tea Tree Essence. And kunkumadi tailam. The three skin products rub shoulders on the ‘Chinmayi Picks’ section of her Isle of Skin, which hopes to be a platform that curates the best of skincare products for Indian customers.

Skincare isn’t a new subject for the singer behind recent hit number ‘Oohale’ from Telugu flick Jaanu (‘Kaathale’ from Tamil film 96). It has been her passion for many years, when her skincare remedies and reviews have appealed to her followers in the online world.

However, K-beauty (an umbrella term for skin-care products from South Korea), was something she chanced upon when she was browsing a blog five years ago. “I was intrigued,” says Chinmayi, who went on to order a few shipments from online platforms.

Soon, she realised that she was getting charged more as customs duty than for the product itself. “It was getting counter-productive with respect to costing.” At the same time, whenever someone commented on how good her skin was, she would direct them to the respective websites she shopped from.

Back then, she did not see it as a business opportunity.

All that changed when she went to KOTRA, a trade investment promotion agency, and subsequently, armed with Government aid, went to Korea a couple of years ago to speak to a few companies here.

“Importing skincare products to India involves a long process, which took at least six months per brand.” Once she started working with three mid-level brands, she conceptualised Isle of Skin, which she hopes will be a platform for reliable brands that understands Indian skin and offer products that suit the challenging weather conditions here.

So, what is her goal in the long run? “To start a line that will make skincare normal for any gender. There is some amount of guilt associated with taking care of yourself — my mother asks me not to spend too much money on skincare,” she says, “I was not able to shake off my very middle-class upbringing... so the cost of the product is a major factor. When someone says I’m on a budget, I guess I identify with that.”

Isle of Skin is currently associated with four Korean brands — Pyunkang Yul, Leegeehaam, Cosrx and I’m Sorry For My Skin — with two more in the works. The kunkumadi thailam on the site, on the other hand, is by Vaidyaratnam Oushadhashala.

Chinmayi signs off saying, “It gladdens me when people say that they had skin issues before and had spent thousands, when the issue got sorted due to something I had posted.”",fashion,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fashion/dydhv8/article30841639.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/chinmayipicjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fashion/meet-chinmayi-the-skin-specialist/article30841641.ece

In a petition addressed to the Superintendent of Police here on Monday, the villagers said that officials of one organisation named Clean Max had inspected the agricultural land that would be acquired for setting up the solar park, on February 11.

Stating that the primary livelihood of the villagers was cattle rearing, the petition said that solar park would decimate all the natural resources meant for their livelihood.

They feared that besides groundwater depletion, the over heat generated by the solar panels would also take a toll on the insects and birds.

The reflection of light through the panels would also affect the eyesight of the villagers. Its emission of various obnoxious gases would also affect the respiratory system of people of 216 families.

Members of Tenkasi Taluk General Labourers’ Association have appealed to District Collector G.K. Arun Sundar Thayalan to ensure early establishment of Labour Welfare Office for the newly created Tenkasi district as the labourers have to spend a lot of time, energy and money to reach the office in Palayamkottai now to get their grievances addressed.

In their petition, Tenkasi Taluk General Labourers’ Association president Lenin Kumar and secretary Krishnan said the district having 3.50 lakh labourers was yet to get its Labour Welfare Office though it was created 3 months ago. Consequently, the labourers had to go all the way to Palayamkottai where the Labour Welfare Office meant for the composite Tirunelveli district is located.

Since travelling to Palayamkottai from Tenkasi would cost a minimum of ₹ 200 per head towards bus fare and food besides sacrificing a day’s wages, the aggrieved labourers were suffering a lot. Considering their problems, the district administration should take immediate efforts to establish the Labour Welfare Office meant for the new district in Tenkasi itself, they appealed.

‘Open DPC’

On behalf of a non-governmental organisation, one Parthibhan from Sambavarvadakarai submitted a petition urging the government to open a paddy direct purchase centre at Sambavarvadakarai since the surrounding areas including Velayuthapuram, Oormelazhagiyaan, Kovilandanur, Sundarapandiapuram, Thanttaankulam, Kambili and other areas were major producers of the food grain.

He also sought the official machinery to create a home for taking care of the uncared for mentally challenged persons wandering along the streets of Tenkasi district.

‘Get modern gadgets’

One Sudarraj from Keezhapaavoor submitted a petition appealing to the Collector to direct the owners of rice mills to install modern equipment to contain the ash getting discharged into the atmosphere. He said the ash from the rice mills were causing a lot of health issues including breathing troubles, allergy in the eyes etc. to the people living in the vicinity.

Since the owners of the rice mills had chosen to ignore repeated appeals from the affected public, the Collector should direct them to incorporate modern pollution control facilities to minimise the ash getting discharged into the atmosphere, he said.

305,2020/02/17,BJP govt. is actual perpetrator of violence: MP,"Su. Venkatesan says over 25 protesters have been killed in BJP-ruled States

MADURAI

In the nationwide protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) witnessed over the last two months, more than 25 protesters have been killed in BJP-ruled States. This proves that the government is instigating violence against the protesters, who are striving to save the secular fabric of the country in a peaceful manner, according to Madurai MP Su. Venkatesan.

Speaking at the inauguration of a protest organised by Madurai District Muslim Aikkiya Jamath and other Islamic outfits against the CAA and proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR) at Nelpettai here on Monday, he said, “BJP leaders, including Union Home Minister Amit Shah, have termed the protesters ‘anti-nationals’ and said that they will open fire on them, who are their own citizens. This shows that the government is the actual perpetrator of violence.”

The CAA violated the fundamental ideas prescribed in the Constitution. It was against the country’s democratic values and secularism, the MP said. “This peaceful protest is not in favour of a particular religion or section of people, but is a fight to save the Constitution, which is the ‘holy book’ binding the people of the country,” he said.

He also condemned the “brutal” police action on anti-CAA protesters in Chennai on February 14. “Currently, Madurai stands second in the State in terms of the intensity of the protest against these atrocities. Soon, the city will top the list in this fight to save the Constitution,” he said.

The protesters raised slogans against both the Central and State governments, and urged the Union government to withdraw the CAA, NPR and the NRC.

Jamath president S.A. Liyakkath Ali said that the protest would continue till the Centre repealed the CAA.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/bjp-govt-is-actual-perpetrator-of-violence-mp-madurai/article30843564.ece

In her petition, the woman said she got married in 2019 in Paramakudi. However, in about three months, her husband said he would go to a friend’s place looking for a job.

In the meantime, she delivered twin babies. Despite attempts to reach her husband, she was unable to contact him. She suspected that he lived in Erode and had contacts with his parents here.

Three persons – two of them from Kerala – were killed when a speeding omni bus rammed a stationary car near Vasudevanallur in the district in the small hours of Monday.

Police said a family from Puthenveedu in Kottarakkara in Kerala was returning home in a sports utility vehicle from Velankanni. When the car was crossing Arulatchi near Vasudevanallur, it broke down, forcing Sinju K. Ninan, 40, the head of the family, to find a cab to send his family members to his native place. Ninan stayed back at the spot along with T. Shiju Thomas, 41, of Aaduthula in Kollam.

A recovery van driver from Sivakasi, Rajasekaran, 46, reached the spot on request from the stranded duo. When Ninan and Shiju Thomas were about to tow the car, a speeding omni bus, proceeding from Chennai to Shencottai, hit the vehicle, killing all the three on the spot around 5 a.m.

Vasudevanallur police and Fire and Rescue Services personnel rushed to the spot and retrieved the bodies, which got trapped under the car, and sent them for post-mortem.

A group of Tamizhaga Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam cadres submitted petition to Collector Shilpa Prabhakar Satish on Monday urging the State Government to release the Government Order recognising 7 sub-sects of Scheduled Caste as ‘Devendrakula Velalar.’

The petitioners, led by party’s Tirunelveli City district secretary Kanmani Maaveeran, said the TMMK cadre were sporting black shirts for the past 100 days to highlight its demand from the State Government to release the formal Order recognising 7 sub-sects of Scheduled Caste as ‘Devendrakula Velalar.’

Since the Tamil Nadu Government had not taken any decision in this connection, the party was organising demonstrations across the State to highlight the demand, they said.

“Condemning the Tamil Nadu Government for this undue delay in accepting our demand, two of our party cadres tonsured their head, before submitting the petition to the Collector,” Mr. Kanmani Maaveeran said.

Petition against construction

A group of villagers from Arugankulam submitted a petition against the construction made on the drainage channel by an individual. The petitioner villagers said a villager, enjoying the backing of his community members and a political party, had encroached upon the drainage channel by constructing a building on it.

Consequently, the drainage was flowing along the streets to create insanitary conditions in the hamlet. Hence, the officials concerned should visit the village for inspection and remove the encroachment so that the drainage channel would be revived for proper draining of sewage water, they said.

Deep borewell

A group of people from Maettupachchaeri near Seevalaperi submitted a petition against the sinking of deep borewell in the playground in the village.

Another group of villagers from Thiruppanikarisalkulam submitted a petition against the construction of a building on a land allegedly belonging to a particular community. “Since the land belong to our community, the government should have obtained our permission before starting the construction work. However, construction of the building has been started without getting our consent, which should be stopped immediately,” they said.

309,2020/02/17,‘Open DPC in easily accessible place’,"Stop its functioning from a paddy trader’s place: farmers

Demanding opening of paddy direct purchase centre in an easily accessible common place instead of allowing it to function from a paddy trader’s place, a group of farmers, who dumped paddy in front of the Collectorate, submitted a petition to Collector Shilpa Prabhakar Satish on Monday.

In his petition, K. Perumal, former president of Kannadiyan Channel Irrigation Committee 5, of Veeravanallur, who threw paddy on the ground at the Collectorate main entrance along with others, said the direct paddy procurement centre meant for Veeravanallur was functioning for the past two years in a place belonging to a farmer, who is also a paddy trader.

He was procuring the paddy from the farmers of Veeravanallur and surrounding areas in 2019 at the rate of ₹ 2,000 for 150 kg paddy without allowing the farmers to sell their produce directly in the direct purchase centre.

“If the farmers could sell the paddy directly to the direct purchase centre, they would have got ₹ 1,905 for 100 kg paddy (‘A’ Grade) and ₹ 1,865 for 100 kg ordinary variety, as per the latest purchase price. However, intimidation by this farmer, who is enjoying the officials’ backing, denied them this opportunity,” Mr. Perumal said.

After packing the paddy thus purchased in gunny bags, this farmer-cum-paddy trader would sell it to the direct procurement centre functioning from his place. Besides selling 2,500 bags of paddy purchased from farmers in his name to the DPC in 2019, the individual, having only nine acres of land, had sold 15,000 bags of paddy in the name of his wife, his son, daughter-in-law, his two daughters and brother-in-law to the DPC with the help of the two government officials manning it.

“If the Collector examined the paddy purchase accounts of Veeravanallur DPC for 2019, this fact will be brought to light,” Mr. Perumal said.

He suggested that the DPC be shifted to mandapam of Sri Bhoominatha Swamy Temple so that it would be easy for the farmers of Veeravanallur, Ariyanayagipuram, Giriammalpuram and Udhayamarthandapuram to sell their produce. The farmers of these areas raise paddy on 2,276 acre during ‘pisanam’ season every year.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/xu57nf/article30843203.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA18TVL-FARMERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/open-dpc-in-easily-accessible-place/article30843204.ece

Vanavengaigal Katchi has sought “special priority” and rights to worship Goddess Sri Valli to people belonging to Kurava community at the Sri Dhandayuthapani Swamy Temple at Palani.

In a memorandum submitted to Collector M. Vijaya Lakshmi, State president of the party M.P. Eraniyan said that kurava community was one of the oldest Tamil communities.

With a population of some 30 lakh people across the State, the nomadic community have started living in various towns and cities owing to the winds of change.

He said that their ancestors were the chief of Kurinji (mountains) and Goddess Valli belonging to their community was married off to Lord Murugan.

311,2020/02/17,Woman attempts self-immolation at Collectorate,"She complains about lack of police action against those threatened villagers

Virudhunagar

A woman, who was part of a group of villagers, including children, from Moovaraivendran panchayat, attempted self-immolation at Virudhunagar Collectorate on Monday, complaining about lack of police action against few people who were threatening a section of villagers with dire consequences.

However, police personnel deployed at the Collectorate prevented Mahalakshmi from setting her ablaze after she doused herself with a bottle of petrol. She was accompanied by Ramachandran, Pandi Selvi, Subbulakshmi and their children.

The woman said that a section of the villagers had supported the candidature of Ramesh Kannan of Seelanaikkanpatti in the recently-concluded rural local body elections to the post of president of Moovaraivendran panchayat.

This led to the villagers earning the wrath of the local candidate, Muruganandam, who lost the election.

Accusing Mahalakshmi and others that only because of their support extended to Ramesh Kannan, Muruganandam lost the election, the defeated candidate and his supporters had been threatening the villagers, the woman alleged.

They had warned the residents with dire consequences if they did not leave the village, she added.

Mahalakshmi said that despite having lodged a complaint with Nathampatti police, no action has been taken. She said that only because their family members were under a constant threat and had not protection, they resorted to self-immolation.

312,2020/02/17,CPI (M) seeks stringent punishment against accused in child sexual abuse case,"Virudhunagar

Communist Party of India (Marxist) has sought stringent action against the five accused who have been arrested for sexual abuse of three children in a village near Watrap.

In a statement, party Virudhunagar district secretary K. Arjunan has welcomed the immediate intervention of the district police in arresting Vellaisamy, Ganesan, Rajaveeran, Radhakrishnan and Tiruvan.

All the accused have been booked under the provisions of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012.

Mr. Arjunan said that people who indulge in such heinous crime should be booked under non-bailable sections. The affected children and the family members should be given proper protection and the victim children given medical treatment.

Pointing out that similar sexual offences against children were being frequently reported in the State, including a recent incident near Sivakasi, Mr. Arjunan said that such crimes were a result of easily available liquor through TASMAC shops and narcotic substances.

The party sought a solid police action to stop availability of intoxicating substances. It also demanded that police should expedite the hearings in cases booked under POCSO Act so that the accused get punished at the earliest.

Meanwhile, the CPI (M) has expelled the party Rengapalayam branch cadre and union secretary of Agricultural Labour Association Vellaichamy, who is one of the accused in the case.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/cpi-m-seeks-stringent-punishment-against-accused-in-child-sexual-abuse-case/article30842771.ece
313,2020/02/17,Anti-CAA protest continues in Madurai,"Condemning the police action on anti-CAA protesters in Chennai on February 14, hundreds of people continued their protest for the third day at Mahaboopalayam here on Sunday, against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR).

The protest, which started on Friday night, saw hundreds of protesters raising anti-CAA and azadi slogans through day and night. The protesters, who were predominantly Muslim women, raised slogans against the government for the police action on protesters in Chennai on Friday. “On that day, police used brutal force against women protesters. All these years, women from our locality had not participated in any protests. But, this incident has inspired women throughout the State to come onto streets, to raise their voice against this atrocity,” said S. Sharmila Banu, a protester. She also added that women had come out for the sake of a secure future for their children.

S. Hussain Ali Khan, another protester, said that the police attempted to suppress a peaceful protest by using force, which was against democratic principles. He also demanded action against officials who brutally attacked the protesters.

He said that the protests would continue until the government repeals CAA. “Several State governments, including Kerala, have passed resolutions against the CAA. We want Tamil Nadu government to follow suit. The CAA, proposed NRC and NPR are not only anti-Muslim, but they are also anti-minorities.

314,2020/02/17,No public space for performing arts in Madurai,"A place where artistes can sing, dance, read poetry, review a book or release one must be included in ‘Smart City’ plan

It is an irony that though Madurai can take pride in being the cultural capital of Tamil Nadu, the city does not have a dedicated space for performing arts.

Prabhakar Vedamanickam of Kaleidoscope, who hosted Madurai Arts Festival in the first week of February, says the rent is high at the usual venues where a play or performance is conducted. Presently folk dance, music programmes, art display and comedy shows are conducted in big marriage halls, the auditorium on Chamber premises, the small hall on Tamukkam ground, World Tamil Sangam, Gandhi Museum amphitheatre and halls in big hotels. However, event organisers say Madurai lacks open air venues in parks or a city square with limited seats and bare minimum facilities.

It is everywhere

Sumanth Ram, an architect, says Madurai’s rich culture can be traced to its streets. “Every house has a kolam, most people can sing or dance. The padithurais along Vaigai river are frequented by merry-making people during festivals and even tea shops become a place for exaggerated storytelling,” he says.

There is a plethora of folk art forms in villages in and around Madurai. There are regular all-night performances of music and dance in their various forms. These are absent in a metropolitan city.

R. Murali from People's Union for Civil Liberties, an ardent appreciator of arts, says although theatre troupes from different parts of the State used to perform in Madurai, the trend is on the wane through the last decade. Public spaces such as parks and roads in Madurai could be better utilised to host shows, he says.

Mr. Vedamanickam says a simple book release costs ₹20,000 and above and venues like World Tamil Sangam or Gandhi Museum are either expensive or have restrictions on content.

“If this continues, the youth of the city will not have any major outlet for their talent and will keep moving to other cities. Television will become the only medium of entertainment,” he says.

The lounge culture

When Harsh Garg started 808 Events in Madurai, it was out of frustration. His company curates events such as stand-up comedy and music shows and brings artistes from Chennai, Mumbai and Bengaluru. “People go to Chennai, Bengaluru and even Coimbatore to watch shows and complain about lack of such a space in Madurai. Since this city does not have a ‘lounge culture’ where people can eat, drink and watch entertainment, we are promoting this concept here,” he says. Madurai also does not have an ‘open mic culture’ where people can go up on stage and perform anything, he says.

For Reshma Zafar who opened up her terrace at the Urban Spice art gallery, there has been a slow and steady stream of people wanting to be part of art workshop, open mics, music jams and mural- making workshops. She says the inclination to learn different art forms do exists in Madurai, but people are very slow to adapt here.

Smart City plan

While some individuals are showing the way and hosting events like Sumanth Ram and Reshma Zafar, many others want public parks to be thrown open so that people can look forward to an evening of free entertainment. “A city centre where artistes can sing, dance, read poetry, review a book or release a book must be included in ‘Smart City’ plan,” says Mr. Murali.

Mr. Garg says college auditoriums can be thrown open for collaborative cultural performances.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/9r82wt/article30839591.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA17MDUMADURAIMATTERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/no-public-space-for-performing-arts-in-cultural-capital-of-state/article30839592.ece
315,2020/02/17,People striving to save secular fabric of the country: CPI(M),"‘Modi-Shah trying to consolidate hardcore Hindutva votes’

Even in the face of police brutality against anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protesters in Chennai’s Washermenpet, people are striving to save the secular fabric of the country, said Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary Sitaram Yechury.

He was speaking at a public meeting against CAA here on Sunday, organised by the party in support of religious minorities who are protesting against the Centre’s CAA and the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR).

Mr. Yechury said that all citizens must fervently take part in the nation-wide door-to door campaign against the CAA/ NRC/ NPR starting March 1 to 23. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah have been calling us anti-national and accusing us of eyeing vote bank politics. However, it is they who are trying to consolidate a divided hardcore Hindutva vote bank and hurting India by spreading chaos and hate. We must work together to save India first from this large-scale conspiracy and then work towards building a better nation,” he said.

“Let Mr. Modi and Mr. Shah declare half of India as non-citizens as they defy answering questions as part of the NPR and refuse to show documents for the NRC. Let us see which India survives,” he said.

He added that Mr. Modi who is set to welcome U.S. President Donald Trump to Gujarat is taking him into a safe part of the country where they are not anticipating protests. “We will protest U.S. imperialism wherever he lands,” he said.

He added that Tamil Nadu had a rich tradition of standing up to unjust practices that threaten the country’s constitution.

“During the emergency, several members tried to evade arrests and fled to Tamil Nadu as emergency laws were not applicable here. Today, the people here must play the role again to save the country. Public must protest in larger numbers with more determination,” he said.

316,2020/02/17,"Moody’s cuts India GDP forecast; ‘demand, credit growth critical’","Improved indicators indicate economy may have stabilised

Moody’s has revised its growth forecasts for India downward to 5.4% for 2020 and 5.8% for 2021, from its previous projections of 6.6% and 6.7%, respectively.

It has also revised its global GDP growth forecast down, given the adverse impact of the coronavirus on the world economy.

“We we now expect G-20 economies to collectively grow 2.4% in 2020, a softer rate than last year, followed by a pick-up to 2.8% in 2021,” Moody’s said in a report.

“We have reduced our growth forecast for China to 5.2% in 2020 and maintain our expectation of 5.7% growth in 2021,” it said.

Moody’s also lowered growth projections for Mexico and South Africa, as it has for India, as a reflection of domestic challenges in these countries rather than external factors.

On India, it said that the economic recovery would likely be shallow. “India’s economy has decelerated rapidly over the last two years. Improvements in the latest high frequency indicators such as PMI data suggest that the economy may have stabilised,” it said.

“While the economy may well begin to recover in the current quarter, we expect any recovery to be slower than we had previously expected,” it added.

A key to stronger economic momentum would be the revival of domestic demand, both rural and urban. But equally important is the resumption of credit growth in the economy, Moody’s said.

“As data from the RBI shows, credit impulse in the economy has deteriorated throughout the last year as a result of the drying up of lending from non-bank financial institutions as well as from banks. Banks have been both unwilling to lend and to lower lending rates despite successive interest rate cuts by [RBI],” it said.",economy,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/moodys-cuts-india-gdp-forecast-demand-credit-growth-critical/article30845169.ece

Moody’s has revised its global GDP growth forecast down considering the adverse impact of COVID-19 on the world’s economy.

“We have revised our global GDP growth forecast down, and we now expect G-20 economies to collectively grow 2.4% in 2020, a softer rate than last year, followed by a pickup to 2.8% in 2021,” Moody’s said in a report.

“We have reduced our growth forecast for China to 5.2% in 2020 and maintain our expectation of 5.7% growth in 2021. We have also lowered our real GDP growth forecast for Australia, Korea and Japan on account of the coronavirus,” it said.

Stating that the coronavirus outbreak had diminished optimism about prospects of an incipient stabilisation of global growth this year, Moody’s said since the virus was continuing to spread, it was still too early to make a final assessment of the impact on China and the global economy.

“Our baseline assumes the outbreak will cause disruption in Q1 economic activity. Under our baseline forecast, the spread of the coronavirus will be contained by the end of Q1, allowing for resumption of normal economic activity in Q2,” it said.

At present, China’s economy is by far the worst affected. However, the rest of the world also has exposure as a result of a hit to global tourism in the first half of this year and short-term disruptions to supply chains, the rating agency said.

The effects on the global economy could compound if the rate of infection did not abate and the death toll continued to rise, because supply chain disruptions in manufacturing would become more acute the longer it takes to restore normalcy, it added.

On the impact on India, it said that the economic recovery will likely be shallow.

“India’s economy has decelerated rapidly over the last two years. Real GDP grew at a meagre 4.5% in Q3 2019. Improvements in the latest high frequency indicators such as PMI data suggest that the economy may have stabilized,” it said.

“While the economy may well begin to recover in the current quarter, we expect any recovery to be slower than we had previously expected. Accordingly, we have revised our growth forecasts to 5.4% for 2020 and 5.8% for 2021, down from our previous projections of 6.6% and 6.7%, respectively,” it added.

A key to stronger economic momentum would be the revival of domestic demand, both rural and urban. But equally important is the resumption of credit growth in the economy, Moody’s said.

“As data from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) shows, credit impulse in the economy has deteriorated throughout the last year as a result of the drying up of lending from non-bank financial institutions as well as from banks. Banks have been both unwilling to lend and to lower lending rates despite successive interest rate cuts by the central bank,” it said.

“ As a result, non-food bank credit growth decelerated to 7.0% in nominal terms in December 2019, down sharply from 12.8% a year earlier. The deterioration in credit growth to the commercial sector is particularly stark,” it added.

Nominal credit to industry grew at only 1.6% year-on-year in December 2019, while credit to the services sector registered 6.2% nominal growth, and credit to agriculture and related activities grew 5.3%, Moody’s said.",economy,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/uhkq2b/article30801775.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12IN-VIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/moodys-revises-global-gdp-forecast-down-following-spread-of-covid-19/article30840489.ece

Talking about the latest Union Budget’s approach to tackle the economic slowdown, Mr. Ahluwalia said, “For a cyclical revival you have to look at the demand side and I don’t think the actions taken so far will actually have the impact that is expected on the demand side”.

“Private investment is subdued because of a lack of animal spirits. Investors who have the capacity to invest are not able to get credit from the banks. Banks are not extending credit because they're very cautious. Some people have also talked of a fear factor depressing investment. Many people say that our tax laws have become so complex and cumbersome, and we are also criminalising certain aspects of tax avoidance, that people are discouraged from adopting a high profile and are trying to cover their tracks,” he added.

Asked about the recent debate around government data with regard to the economy, he said that “there is a widespread perception that the government was not adopting a transparent procedure” and such concerns needed to be addressed by the government.

Edited excerpts from an interview.

From a ‘Hindu rate of growth’ we are talking about a $5 trillion economy by 2024-25. Is it possible in this time frame?

In order to reach the $ 5 trillion target by 2024-25, the economy has to grow at something close to 9 % starting with 2019-20. We are going to end the year 2019-20 with growth below 5%. The economy may have bottomed out and next year, growth will be somewhere between 5 and 6 per cent on optimistic assumptions. But with that pace of recovery, we will not get to $ 5 trillion in 2024-25. We must acknowledge that we are not growing at the kind of growth rate needed to reach that target. We will get to 5 trillion ultimately but not by 2024-25.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman recently said that there are green shoots and that the economy is not really in trouble. You too have said the economy may have bottomed out.

Bottoming out just means that next year will be better than 4.5%. You could claim to have bottomed out if growth next year is above 5%. But it would be wrong on th at basis to say the economy is not in trouble. What people are now looking for, is a quick and strong recovery. What we are likely to get is a rather slow recovery. And there is no evidence of an early return to 8% plus which is what we need.

Read: Union Budget — full speech

Many experts have said the focus of the government has been wrong. Instead of pushing consumption, focus has been on the supply side.

For a cyclical revival you have to look at the demand side and I don’t think the actions taken so far will actually have the impact that is expected on the demand side. I think the key areas on the demand side are reviving investment and reviving exports.

I don't believe that the steps taken are going to succeed in reviving private investment. Private investment is subdued because of a lack of animal spirits. Investors who have the capacity to invest are not able to get credit from the banks. Banks are not extending credit because they're very cautious.

Some people have also talked of a fear factor depressing investment.

Many people say that our tax laws have become so complex and cumbersome, and we are also criminalizing certain aspects of tax avoidance, that people are discouraged from adopting a high profile and are trying to cover their tracks. I don't think there's anything in the budget that changes all this.

These days there is a lot of questioning about the reliability of our data. What's your view on this?

It is worrying that there is a widespread perception that we are not adopting totally transparent methods of producing and clearing data. We did change the method of calculating Gross Domestic Product [GDP] and the way it's calculated, the negative impact of Demonetization on the informal sector was not reflected in GDP growth. There have been other instances when Survey data have been held up and trashed.

In your book you mention about President Venkataraman not being happy when the rupee being devalued in 1991. But there is a view that Indian rupee is still overvalued and has been kept artificially high.

I am sympathetic to that view. If industry says they are not competitive, that only means they are not competitive at the existing exchange rate. The government has responded by raising import duties. This in my view is the wrong response If we had achieved a weaker exchange rate, we would not have to impose import duties. When you impose a 10% import duty, it makes imports 10% costlier. But if you depreciate the exchange rate, it has the same effect but it exports get a push. Import duties on the other hand actually harm exports. We would be well advised to go back to the trend of gradually reducing duties which successive governments followed, including the Vajpayee government.

You have seen several Prime Ministers from close quarters. Who do you think was the most decisive and a quick decision maker?

That's very difficult because each Prime Minister operated in a different political and economic context.

Indira Gandhi's decision to go in for imported wheat seeds was a highly controversial decision at the time but we wouldn't have had the Green Revolution now.

I worked directly in the office of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and he was the first to signal the need for getting ready for the 21st century. He said in Parliamemnt that we cannot expect to be competing with other countries if we are working with systems that are 20 years out of date.

Under Prime minister Narasimha Rao government, very dramatic changes were made. He gets full marks for backing his Finance Minister [Dr Manmohan Singh] who orchestrated a broad ranging reform program. Prime Minister Vajpayee [A B Vajpayee] continued the reforms and also brought in privatisation.

In the case of the UPA 1 the coalition by itself didn't have a majority and had to depend on the Left for outside support. And course, Dr Singh was not the political head of the Congress. Nevertheless, working within those constraints, in the first seven years of the UPA, we saw a growth rate of 8.4%, which had never been seen earlier. The Indo US Nuclear deal was a very bold decision by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh taken in the face of a lot of opposition.

If you were to advise this government on key issues, what would you tell them to do?

In my book I have outlined a number of ideas which I think should be on the future agenda. The bottom line is that the government should outline a credible action plan to get the economy back to 8% growth as quickly as possible. Reviving private investment and rejuvenating public sector banks is critical. We also need to bring about much needed reform in GST. In all this, we need the widest possible consultation, listening to expert opinion outside the government. But to do this we need to be realistic. If we feel we are on track to hit the $5 trillion target, nothing more needs to be done. The trouble is we are not. The problems are very clear. We have to get the GDP growth up to 8% as quickly as possible. Unless we do this we will not be able to generate the jobs we need. We also need to improve our export performance which has actually deteriorated. The government should outline a credible programme to achieve these objectives and subject it to comment and criticism to take on board as wide a range of technical expert opinion as possible.",economy,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/5bjq44/article30835791.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AHLUWALIA,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/interview-with-former-planning-commission-chairman-montek-singh-ahluwalia/article30835792.ece

Domestic aviation traffic grew at 2.2% last month as compared to the same period last year, according to the DGCA’s monthly report.

Indian airlines ferried a total of 1.27 crore passengers in January 2020 as compared to 1.25 crore in January 2019.

Gurgaon-based SpiceJet maintained its lead in capacity utilisation with 91.5% of seats sold, followed by Go Air (88.7%), IndiGo (87.8%) and Vistara (83.5%).

Air Asia was the most punctual airline in the month, with 75.7% of its flight departing and arriving on time. It was followed by IndiGo (74%), Vistara (70.2%), GoAir (69.4%) and SpiceJet (65.3%).

322,2020/02/17,Response to long-term repo encouraging: RBI,"Bids far exceed notified amount

The response to the first long-term repo auction, which was conducted on Monday, was highly encouraging, the Reserve Bank of India said. The central bank has received total bids of ₹1.94 lakh crore, for the three year repo, compared with the notified amount of ₹25,000 crore.

“The response to the long term repo operation (LTRO) has been highly encouraging. The total bids that were received amounted to ₹1,94,414 crore, implying a bid-to-cover ratio (i.e., the quantum of bids received relative to the amount announced) of 7.8,” RBI said in a statement after the first auction on Monday.

“The total amount of bids has, in fact, exceeded the aggregate amount of ₹1 lakh crore proposed to be offered under the LTRO scheme.” RBI will conduct the second issue for ₹25,000 crore on February 24 which will have a 1-year tenor.

In the sixth bimonthly monetary policy review earlier this month, the central bank, while keeping the key interest rate unchanged, had announced that it would conduct term repos of one-year and three-year tenors up to a total amount of ₹1 lakh crore at the policy repo rate, which is 5.15%.

These will allow banks to garner funds cheaper than the prevailing market and in turn, help them to reduce interest rate costs. “This should encourage banks to undertake maturity transformation smoothly and seamlessly so as to augment credit flows to productive sectors,” RBI had said while making the announcement.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/response-to-long-term-repo-encouraging-rbi/article30845049.ece
323,2020/02/17,SEBI caps fees for investment advisers,"Board okays separation of advisory, distribution to minimise conflict of interest

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has amended the regulatory framework for investment advisers to introduce a cap on the maximum fee such entities can charge to investors while segregating the advisory and distribution activities to minimise conflict of interest issues.

2.5% of assets

The board of the capital markets watchdog, which met in Mumbai, approved the amendment in the SEBI (Investment Advisers) Regulations 2013, which also stipulated that a person dealing in distribution of securities cannot use the nomenclature 'Independent Financial Adviser ' or 'Wealth Adviser' without registering as an Investment Adviser with the regulator.

While the regulator did not specify the upper limit of fees, a consultation paper floated by SEBI in January had proposed capping the fees at 2.5% of the assets under advice or a fixed fee of ₹75,000 per year per family.

Further, an Individual Investment Adviser will not be able to provide distribution services, stated a release by the regulator. On a different note, the regulator also said that Karvy Stock Broking, which is under the regulatory scanner for pledging client securities to raise funds for itself, will make good the payout shortfall by March.

Karvy Group is in the process of selling stake in a group company and the term sheet has already been signed, said SEBI chairman Ajay Tyagi while addressing the media after the board meeting.

The shortfall in payout, after factoring in the available securities and funds of the group, is estimated at about ₹680 crore.

As per the SEBI chairman, Karvy Stock Broking's outstanding payment obligations are pegged at ₹1,189 crore while the group has available funds amounting to ₹511 crore.

Among other things, the regulator has made it mandatory for sponsors of mutual funds to invest in close ended schemes. Currently, such a requirement is mandatory for all kinds of schemes except close-ended ones.

Circular soon

Mr. Tyagi added that the regulator was examining the issue of categorisation of funds and would soon come out with a circular.

This is on the back of representation from the industry that fund houses were finding it difficult to invest, especially in the small-cap universe.

The regulator has also amended the SEBI (Depositories and Participants) Regulations to include a clause that would state that pledge would include re-pledge of securities for margin and/or settlement obligations of the client.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/z8h6pz/article30845011.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18THBUSEBI,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/sebi-caps-fees-for-investment-advisers/article30845012.ece

332,2020/02/17,Museums without meaning,"Recent declarations regarding the preservation of India’s heritage leave many questions unanswered

On a visit to Kolkata last month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi opened an exhibition; inaugurated a sound and light show at Howrah Bridge; and announced that five art museums in Chennai, Delhi, Kolkata, Hyderabad, and Srinagar will be upgraded to international standards. His announcement follows a spate of declarations. Over the next few years, North and South Block buildings that flank Rashtrapati Bhavan will be converted into museums, a national experiential archaeology museum will open at Vadnagar, and a hundred new experiential museums may be built across the country.

These announcements leave elementary questions unanswered. Where does the government plan to build new museums? How will objects be sourced to be displayed in them? Who will staff these museums? What narratives will be recounted in new institutions and those that are to be renovated? All we know from officials is that they will be stunning spaces modelled on the Acropolis Museum in Athens and other world-class museums.

A striking contrast

Good art museums worldwide share several characteristics. At their heart are commitments to serve as stewards of cultural common wealth, ensure that objects in their care are lawfully held, and promote research into objects with an aim of deepening public knowledge of the human experience. They also strive to acquire and occasionally deaccession objects without boosting illegal trade in such artefacts. Club Atlético in Buenos Aires and the Topography of Terror in Berlin, both located at excavated sites of detention and torture, are examples of thoughtful experiential archaeological museums. They use trenches, exhumed artefacts, and testimonies to turn visitors variously into witnesses of open wounds, observers of the meticulous evidence-gathering work of archaeologists, and informed participants in struggles for social justice.

Consider, in contrast, experiments with truth at Rajkot in Gujarat. As dust settles on artefacts in the city’s Watson Museum that hold intricate histories of colonial Saurashtra, Alfred High School has reopened its doors as the Mahatma Gandhi Museum. In one gallery, visitors encounter the “scenario in India when Gandhiji came back from South Africa in 1915.” This takes the form of a collage of doctored, uncredited, and untitled images of events that did not occur that year. One image in the collage is based on Felice Beato’s photograph of an execution held in Lucknow during the Revolt of 1857-58, another on Willoughby Hooper’s photograph of victims of the Madras Famine of 1876-78 at a relief camp, and a third on A.G.E. Newland’s photograph of junior British officers lounging in Burma around 1892. Elsewhere in this museum, Madame Tussaud-style sculptures take the place of archival prints, and florid banners replace personal papers.

From what is publicly known of the government’s deliberations on founding an Indian Institute of Heritage and Conservation it is unclear whether such an establishment will remedy the situation. The proposed institution seems to be little more than bringing existing organisations under a new umbrella. If the proposed institution is to make a real difference, then it must partner with educational institutions across the country to foster a widespread interest in the historian’s craft. It should also draw on the expertise of those visually attuned humanists and social scientists who separate scholarship from spectacle and listen to voices of persons marginalised on account of their race, class, gender, ethnicity, or religion.

The meaning of heritage

Furthermore, before new museums and overhauled galleries open their doors to the public, as Indians we all need to reflect on what heritage means to us. Is heritage something that we have somehow received in sealed containers? Or is heritage a material, or even an intangible trace, of a past reformed by its contact with manifold individuals who have handled it since its initial creation? If so, how will placing heritage in vitrines and vestibules alter identities and values? In probing these questions, we might want to learn from historians who have written on the politics of exhibition, nationalism, and religious revivalism.

We may also want to imbibe from the work of skilled hands. At the Bhau Daji Lad Museum in Mumbai, curators are destabilising received narratives by juxtaposing artefacts crafted in the colonial period with site-specific contemporary artworks. At Amritsar’s Partition Museum, teams are telling many sides of human stories that accompanied the birth of two nations. At the Jadunath Bhavan Museum in Kolkata, not only has the architectural fabric of a scholar’s residence been preserved but space created to house endangered archives that hold the promise of writing histories of the metropolis, from the ground up.

Finally, a growing number of monuments across the country are being illuminated every night. This new development sequesters monuments from surroundings and condenses complex architectural fabrics into spectacular facades, well-suited for serving as backdrops against which visitors might pose for selfies. Sanchi Stupa, Rani ki Vav, Red Fort, a temple at Hampi, and a few other buildings have begun to be printed on our banknotes. These photographic and printed images are vicariously bringing millions into daily contact with a few iconic sites. Meanwhile, innumerable other places of archaeological and historical significance standing across India are slowly slipping away from our collective consciousness.

Forward-thinking master plans for the preservation and interpretation of numerous sites have not been articulated — or at least not been publicly released. Is this because these sites hold narratives that the government is reluctant to recognise? Or because they hold histories that government archaeologists are unable to unearth? We also need to train an army of historians to uncover and write new cultural histories of India that demonstrate how every artefact and architectural ensemble is a receptacle of incredible true stories, or, if you will, histories of resilience and resistance, adaptations and aspirations of individuals and communities. When we demand the retrieval, recording, and narration of these histories, then we will all be able to critically appreciate the wonder that was India — a museum without walls.

333,2020/02/17,An unclear revamp,"There is no clarity on whether the recent MEA restructuring aligns with India’s strategic goals

The restructuring of the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) to effectively empower seven different Additional Secretaries and re-organise their tasks along themes has been widely reported. There is less discussion on whether strategic goals have been updated and how the new capabilities mesh with expected outcomes.

Identifying areas of longer-term impact, empowering Additional Secretaries to oversee integrated tasks and giving Secretaries more time to strategise are laudable objectives of the organisational change. Inducting outside expertise in areas such as trade and economics, and cultural power and development partnerships is also needed as the contours of these issues are more technical than diplomatic.

That apart, negotiations in international organisations require understanding the negotiating strategy of others; listing compromises made in the past to secure lost ground; and assessing in advance implications of the inevitable trade-offs that are made at the final stage. But India’s civil service tenure rules do not recognise the importance of negotiation history and global trends. For example, in climate change since the early 1990s, the same diplomats from the U.S., European Union, Russia, China and Saudi Arabia remained involved for the duration of serious negotiations for over 20 years.

Integration of two verticals

Consolidated territorial divisions reflect changing geopolitical realities in Europe, Africa and West Asia, but how are our vital interests affected by the integration of the Indian Ocean and Indo-Pacific regions into one vertical?

We see the region, as the Prime Minister stated in the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, in 2018, as a “free, open, and inclusive” region, not “directed against any country,” with “Southeast Asia at its centre.” But are relations with ASEAN part of the vertical’s remit? How will it interact with the other new verticals on international organisations and trade? Have India’s priorities changed on maritime security?

It is also unclear why we are focusing to this extent on ‘soft power,’ or on shaping the preferences of others in terms of culture, instead of sharing the technology layer powering Aadhaar, in which many other countries have been showing an interest.

The missing piece in the restructuring is silence on the role of the Public Policy and Research Division, now headed by an outstanding officer. It was central in an earlier round of restructuring with inclusion of military officials and consultants from academia and think-tanks.

In reply to a Parliament question, Sushma Swaraj, former External Affairs Minister, had described the Division’s mandate in terms of publication of the Annual Report of the Ministry, preparation of the Monthly Summary of important developments for the Cabinet, and supervision of the functioning of the MEA Boundary Cell, MEA Situation Room and MEA Library. No assessment of the Division’s coordinating role has been shared outside the Ministry, if it has been made.

Unrealised potential

This raises the question of whether the persisting gap between our potential to play a global role and performance, which shows us more as a regional power, has been addressed. This would require us to understand why there is a gap in identifying decisions and actions that are more important than others, and in making difficult choices about what is most important. Have we assessed the future impact and consequences of today’s decisions? What is the new vision of the MEA?

In a fast-changing global environment, resources need to be concentrated on a limited number of objectives, to be achieved within a defined time-frame. The institutions and rules established by the U.S. and the Belt and Road Initiative of China are examples. What is our ‘big idea?’ As the diplomats and the Chief of Defence Staff work out their new roles, they need to recognise that rearranging silos does not dilute the role of politicians and of officials in working across departmental boundaries.

334,2020/02/17,"In political micro-targeting, the vulnerable Indian voter","With the electoral process tapping data, a data protection framework must uphold a voter’s informational autonomy

Two years ago, there was a massive outcry against the hiring, by Indian political parties, of Cambridge Analytica, a data mining and analytics firm. The episode highlighted the need for regulating social media platforms by way of a comprehensive data protection law which takes issues such as political micro-targeting seriously. With the recently introduced draft of the data protection law, the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019, the debate has again resurfaced. In the Internet age, any data protection law must be alive to the potential impact of social media companies in shaping public opinion. The current draft empowers the Central government to notify social media intermediaries as significant data fiduciaries if their user base crosses a certain threshold and whose actions are likely to have an impact on electoral democracy. This provision merits serious discussion to ensure that digital tools are used for enhancing democracy through citizen engagement, and not for harvesting personal data for voter targeting.

World of political advertising

In today’s world, online presence, which ensures greater outreach, is a key source of competitive advantage. This realisation gave rise to strategic efforts by political parties to tap into the fragmented political discourse by catering to the individual. Earlier, the idea was to capture mass issues. But in the present day and age, the focus of the campaign is the individual. Political parties are increasingly employing data-driven approaches to target individual voters using tailor-made messages. Such profiling has raised huge concerns of data privacy for individuals and has become a burning issue for political debate. Therefore, the concerns related to regulation of the digital world are being debated in all jurisdictions which have experienced the impact of this technological advancement.

Although, each jurisdiction may have distinct factors influencing the final shape of the Internet governance model, the reasons for the initial debate are common to all, i.e. to arrest any negative externalities emerging out of the Internet. Therefore, any forward-thinking regulatory framework needs to have both supervisory mechanisms in place as well as effective law enforcement tools in its quiver.

This situation is not particularly characteristic of Indian politics. The United States and European countries are equally affected by the impact of this unregulated practice of micro-targeting. This practice has raised some serious concerns with regard to the kind of data that is being collected, the manner in which voters are being profiled, how transparent the process of profiling and targeting is, what the nature of functioning of organisations engaged in this business is, and how neutral globally present intermediaries such as Google and Facebook are. Recently, regulators in the U.S. and Brazil have held Cambridge Analytica guilty of employing illegal practices while harvesting personal data of millions of Facebook users.

Over the years, political advisory and advertising firms have devised sophisticated tools to gather voter data and made proper campaign products out of it. The politicians of today’s age leave no stone unturned while canvassing for votes. The reason why this issue becomes important is that the passive users are just not aware of what they are being subjected to.

Unregulated zone

The informational autonomy of the voter is under serious threat because the entire business of collecting personal data continues to remain unregulated and is also proprietary in nature. It is extremely difficult to trace the methods used by such firms to scrutinise the personal life and intimate details of the individual. This threat becomes imminent in light of the rising number of political firms which are making most use of the right to freedom of speech and expression. The status of this right is near absolute with regard to political speech in most countries such as the U.S. It is but obvious that this can be misused by political entities. Profiling the potential voter has become a thriving industry. Therefore, there are extremely well-crafted techniques when it comes to electoral campaigning.

There is serious harm to the country’s democratic nature resulting on account of loss of informational autonomy. The liberating and anti-establishment potential of the Internet are considered as a promise for the health of a liberal democracy. At the same time, it can have serious ramifications if this potential is used by demagogues to spread fake news and propaganda.

Although the digital revolution is being celebrated everywhere, the regulatory efforts regarding different spheres of its influence have only been reactionary. While innovators have continued to develop more advanced technologies, the regulators have never been able to catch up with it. There are infinite contours of this information age; hence, the scope of a data protection framework also needs to be sensitive towards the magnitude of a variety of data usage. The electoral process in India is becoming increasingly advanced in terms of use of data. It is highly likely that within a few years, Indian political parties may start using the same tactics as used by their U.S. counterparts in targeting individual voters. It remains to be seen as to how the privacy law responds to the implications of political micro-targeting.

335,2020/02/17,Perverse zeal: On Kafeel Khan arrest,"The NSA’s misuse to suppress political dissent is a blot on India’s democratic credentials

The detention of Dr. Kafeel Khan under the National Security Act (NSA), within days of his being granted bail, betrays the perverse zeal with which the Uttar Pradesh government is hounding the suspended government doctor. His arrest, at Mumbai airport, was in connection with an allegedly inflammatory speech he had made on the contentious Citizenship (Amendment) Act at Aligarh Muslim University in December 2019. The Special Task Force of the U.P. police accused him of promoting enmity through his speech. It was obvious that the flawed approach that treats criticism of government policy as though it is some anti-national activity was at work. Although he was granted bail, he was not immediately released. A few days later, the NSA was invoked against him, ostensibly to prevent him from acting in a manner prejudicial to public order. The paediatrician from Gorakhpur was sought to be blamed when oxygen shortage in the BRD Medical College Hospital led to nearly 60 children dying in 2017. After he had spent months in jail, an internal inquiry absolved him of the charges of negligence and corruption. However, the State government said he had not been given a clean chit. A fresh departmental inquiry was ordered against him for “spreading misinformation” about the probe report, and some alleged “anti-government” remarks during his suspension.

That the authorities invoked a stringent preventive detention law meant only for booking those whose activities constitute an imminent threat of violence shows that they are not content with prosecuting him. If they were under a bona fide belief that his speech was provocative, they could have filed a charge sheet and let the court decide if it attracted Section 153A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The resort to preventive detention as soon as a person is granted bail, with the perverse purpose of continuing his imprisonment, is not uncommon in the country, but the practice is condemnable. It normally indicates mala fide targeting by the administration concerned, and one does not need to look beyond the case of Dr. Kafeel himself to conclude that the latest instance of the resort to the NSA is aimed at inflicting disproportionate punishment on him for expressing political dissent on a supposedly forbidden subject. It is regrettable that the police and the bureaucracy appear to act in wanton disregard for basic rights. The relentless hounding of Dr. Khan is a blot on the country’s democratic credentials. Taking the cue from growing opinion, most recently articulated by Justice D.Y. Chandrachud of the Supreme Court, that protest and criticism directed at government policy do not amount to being anti-national, officials should pause before they are seen as enablers of the excesses of an authoritarian dispensation. To invoke the NSA in cases where sections of the IPC would suffice is to undermine its efficacy as a tool to protect national security.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/perverse-zeal-the-hindu-editorial-on-dr-kafeel-khan-arrest-under-nsa/article30836806.ece
336,2020/02/17,Delhi at the centre: On Kejriwal 3.0,"Kejriwal must now work within his mandate, and the Centre should not stall him

Enthusing his admirers and infuriating detractors, Arvind Kejriwal took oath as Chief Minister of Delhi for a third time in six years. From stomping out of office after nearly 50 days of dystopian conflict with the Centre, he reoriented his approach during his five-year tenure and focused on areas within his control to improve. Consequent administrative innovations by his government improved many lives and paid him rich electoral dividends in Delhi, where he won 62 seats in the 70-member Assembly. Inaugurating the new term, he bears the burden of ballooning expectations in Delhi and beyond. Delhi’s unique status as the national capital has necessitated a diarchy in the city, where the State is forced to share authority with the Centre. Policing and most matters related to urban development are with the Centre. The Centre’s obstructionism and the Delhi government’s combativeness had slowed down critical development projects in the past. There cannot be a stronger, clearer message to the BJP and AAP from the people who chose, over two elections, the former for the Centre and the latter for Delhi — they must work together in the interest of the city. While the Centre must be magnanimous, the State must be conciliatory. Mr. Kejriwal made the right move by inviting Prime Minister Modi to his swearing-in ceremony.

With local sources of pollution remaining largely unaddressed, apart from court-ordered steps such as the permanent closure of the Badarpur thermal power plant in 2018 and the Graded Response Action Plan, the shortage of public buses remains one of the biggest concerns — for reducing pollution as well as improving urban mobility. Having made bus rides free for women, the AAP government has to now make sure there are enough buses. In its 10-point “Kejriwal Ka Guarantee Card”, the party promised Delhiites over 11,000 public buses and 500 km of Delhi Metro network. The scheme of 20,000 litres of free water to every household every month will be continued, but the quality of that supply needs to be consistent. Governments, State and Central, have spent several crores over the past decades to clean the Yamuna, but the problem remains. The Delhi government will not be able to address this problem on its own and will have to work with the Centre. Delhi has a huge housing shortage, and both governments must get their act together in implementing the long overdue land pooling policy that will provide a roof over the head for lakhs and to kick-start the sluggish sector. The Chief Minister will also need to focus on working with his counterparts in neighbouring Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to deal with the city’s problems. Mr. Kejriwal has shown remarkable ability to evolve, as a politician and as an administrator. He must stay the course.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/delhi-at-the-centre-the-hindu-editorial-on-arvind-kejriwals-third-term-as-delhi-cm/article30836807.ece

Jagdeesh Hirmani, member of the National Safai Karamchari Commission has instructed additional compensation of ₹10 lakh to be provided to the family of the worker who died while cleaning a sewer channel at the Express Avenue (EA) mall in November last year.

Mr. Hirmani, who recently reviewed the site at the EA mall, also ordered that a job must be provided to one person in the victim’s family at EA mall. Officials from Chennai Metrowater and police had accompanied him. Police officials said that the victim’s family was already provided with a compensation of ₹14 lakh.

339,2020/02/17,"Take a break from work when you need it, former Tamil Nadu top cop tells students","Letika Saran was speaking to budding psychologists at a conference on mental health practices in Chennai

Former Director General of Police Letika Saran had a message for budding psychologists: Take a break from work to take care of your own mental health.

Noting that there was a lot of similarity between mental health professionals and the police department, she said during the 1990s and early 2000, all that inspectors of All Women Police Stations dealt with was settlement of grievances, basically marital discords.

“People with all kinds of problems will come your way. That is going to be your daily diet. So, you are going to be hearing similar stories day after day. Here is my advice. Just take a break, if you can take a break in the week or sometime in the day. Go out for a walk, learn a new skill, do something that takes your mind off your work every day. If you are able to do that, you will be able to take care of your patient and yourself,” she told students at the inauguration of a two-day international conference on Monday.

The conference, ‘Professional excellence in mental health practice - A way ahead’ was organised by the Indian Academy of Professional Supervisors (IAPS) in collaboration with Madras School of Social Work (MSSW).

Among the objectives of the conference was to create awareness about professional supervision and its importance to the counselling fraternity in the Indian context and to know different therapies counsellors could use in their practice.

Noting that supervised practice was not followed among novice mental health practitioners in India, Vasuki Mathivanan, founder and president of IAPS, said, “The aim of the conference is to understand professional supervision and know the significance of supervised practice.”

340,2020/02/17,Buses skip two bus stops on Velachery Main Road leaving passengers stranded,"Commuters say that MTC buses constantly do not stop at the Concorde junction and Kannigapuram bus stops

Commuters at the Concorde junction bus stop (near Halda) on Velachery Main Road have to often wait for long periods, as Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC) buses keep skipping the bus stop. If the buses don’t stop, commuters are forced to take autorickshaws.

Since the MTC diverted buses bound for Velachery towards the Guindy railway station, only a few buses including S570, D70 and A51, pass through this bus stop on Velachery Main Road. With all these buses either Deluxe or Express services, the buses do not stop at the Concorde junction bus stop, causing severe inconvenience to commuters. This, despite MTC having long ago discontinued the ‘limited stop’ system.

H. Darshan, who works in a private office near Halda junction, rued that all the buses go by without stopping even as commuters have to wait for the one odd ordinary bus to pass by. He said that along a stretch of more than 2 km (from Little Mount to Checkpost bus stops) that has and having two bus stops including Concorde junction and Kannigapuram bus stop, MTC buses hardly stop.

341,2020/02/17,AIADMK has perfected funny-money accounting: Palanivel Thiagarajan,"DMK wants more federalism, less centre interference, less imposition of Hindi, less intrusion of Centre in State’s rights.

The AIADMK government has presented a Budget without populist schemes. DMK IT wing head and legislator Palanivel Thiagarajan, a former banker, contends that populist schemes might come as part of the Chief Minister’s announcements and why such announcements under Rule 110 in the Assembly are bad. In an interview with The Hindu on Sunday, he accuses the AIADMK government of managing the economy badly and also talks about his party affairs. Excerpts:

Just a year before the 2021 Assembly polls, Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam in the last full Budget of this government did not announce any populist scheme. Do you think rising debts could be a reason?

They [The government] have already projected rather massive schemes and grants and subsidies year after year. Just because the Finance Minister has not announced populist schemes, doesn’t mean they are not going to do it. I believe these numbers [provided in the Tamil Nadu Budget] are just meaningless numbers. The gap between what they said they will do in the Budget, what they said they have done in revised estimates and what they end up doing eventually is huge. Even between the revised estimate and the final account, there has been an increase. In the 2019-2020 Budget, they said they would have a revenue deficit of ₹14,000 crore in 2019-20, but in the revised estimate the figure went up to ₹25,000 crore. They have perfected the art of funny money accounting.

In the old days, Ministers did their respective jobs. But now, the Chief Minister has to announce all new schemes under Rule 110. I guarantee you that between now and Thursday next, the CM will make some announcements under Rule 110. This is bad not just for democracy, but also for administration. It is bad for administration because it concentrates power in one person. Bad for democracy, in the sense, what is the point of having a legislature and a Cabinet? So, I don’t yet share your optimism that because of the large debt, they will not undertake irresponsible populist schemes.

The DMK aspires to come to power in 2021, and if that happens, how do you plan to handle the situation of the rising debt and manage the economy?

I am not senior enough in the party to make policy decisions. My leader will show us the way. But in my professional opinion, as a former banker, I think we have to consider some fundamental restructuring, because we have reached a point where the non-discretionary spending – pensions, salary, non-wage operational and maintenance expense and interest charges – has taken up almost 100% of the State’s own revenue. That means there is no money left to do anything discretionary. However, you cannot really cut any of the first three non-discretionary spending items, but you can cut down the fourth – interest charges. Total interest charges have escalated beyond all measures.

People who do not admit their problems, can’t begin to fix them. I have been saying since 2016 that our State’s biggest problem is that the revenue as a percentage on GSDP [Gross State Domestic Product] has dropped dramatically. It has dropped from 14.45% during ‘‘Thalaivar” Kalaignar [M. Karunanidhi]’s rule to 12.67% during “Ammaiyar’s” [Jayalalithaa’s] rule to 10.4% during this rule. There are certain expenses you cannot cut out — pensions, salaries, non-wage operational and maintenance and interest payments.

The AIADMK has revoked its decision to hold public exams for Class V and VIII. The Chief Minister has won praise for announcing that the Cauvery Delta would be declared as Protected Special Agriculture Zone. Some of your allies too welcomed it. Does the DMK have any issues to campaign against the government?

Just because they corrected their mistake [implementing public exams for Class V and VIII], doesn’t mean we have the same ideology. The DMK is for the Special Agriculture Zone but we are asking as to how the government is going to implement it. There are several other issues on which the AIADMK is on the other side of us. Why didn’t they get their alliance party [the BJP] to exempt Tamil Nadu from NEET? DMK wants more federalism, less interference from the Centre, less imposition of Hindi. We are against the CAA-NRC-NPR, we are against the new educational policy. But the AIADMK government doesn’t seem to oppose any of these.

Founded in 1949, the DMK has been led by stalwarts, including C.N. Annadurai and M. Karunanidhi. Should a party as big as the DMK need external hand-holding by electoral strategist Prashant Kishor?

As a former consultant (for over a decade before I was a banker), it’s a deeply personal question. I feel that many powerful people in the world engage specialists as and when required. I have been a consultant for several large multi-national corporates. Every person, who has a unique skill, can offer advice as long as they can add value to any organisation. Mr. Kishor has worked as a consultant for the BJP. Does it mean that he has shaped Mr. Modi’s policies? Such a man should be seen as a professional, who comes in as an adviser for a specific subject such as campaign strategy. Consultants work for different competitors in the same industry. The reason they are brought in as consultants is that they have a broader view than internal office-bearers. Mr. Kishor has now clearly developed a particular philosophy. He is pro-Constitution, against centralisation, against autocracy, against the CAA, the NRC and the NPC and pro-federalism. He has exited the JD (U) over the CAA.

Senior BJP leader L. Ganesan has alleged that the DMK is instigating the anti-CAA protests in Tamil Nadu. Your views…

I am appalled. It is morally reprehensible. I am a Hindu and I have faith. And I think a true Hindu would not thrust his belief on others and, in fact, would defend others’ faith as his own. The BJP is doing politics by dividing people based on religion. I think that is vile and uncouth and in fact, ‘un-Hindu’. My grandfather had the main idol in Sabarimala made by a ‘sthapathi’ in Swamimalai and donated it to the temple. The DMK, through its ‘thiruppanis’ while in government, has done more service to Hinduism than all Brahmins combined. I venture to say that I have done more for temples and Hindus’ events than Mr. Ganesan and H. Raja combined.

Revenue Minister R.B. Udhayakumar has said only those without proper understanding of the CAA are protesting...

342,2020/02/17,Participants in walkathon collect 500 kg of plastics,"300 volunteers cover five city roads

A total of 300 volunteers participated in a 75-km walkathon covering five roads and collected 500 kg of plastics as part of the Payanam 75 organised by Walk For Plastics on Sunday.

The plastics were handed over to the Greater Chennai Corporation.

The walk covered major roads, including Rajiv Gandhi Salai and Jawaharlal Nehru Salai, and concluded at Kathipara junction at 5.30 p.m.

The walkers were mainly youngsters including those working in the IT industry. Mohammed Ashfar, a YouTuber and volunteer, said he had been walking daily and collecting plastics. “What we collect is usually sold off to the Kabadiwallahs and that amount is used to support families of rag pickers,” he said.

B. Sivanesan, who works in the IT industry, said they have been walking and picking plastics for over 200 days now.

“The aim of our walk is to make people understand that garbage should be segregated and plastics responsibly recycled. There are many people who have started segregating after they see us picking plastics from the roads,” he said. Walk For Plastics has recycled a total of 6.5 tonnes of reusable plastics in 237 days during which volunteers collected waste from major roads. The value of plastics collected was ₹45,000. Artist B. Gowtham , founder of the Walk for Plastics initiative, said that their vision was to create a litter-free world thus protecting nature and create a world with good human values.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/ye8qfe/article30837704.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17THWALKTHONPLASTIC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/participants-in-walkathon-collect-500-kg-of-plastics/article30837705.ece
343,2020/02/17,Science strikes a resonant chord at The Music Academy,"Fifth edition of Science at the Sabha held

Due to its very nature, Science at the Sabha drew a diverse audience to its venue at The Music Academy on Sunday.

A dancer and music lover, V. Madhurima was no stranger to The Music Academy. But it was the first time she was there to present a talk about the science of dance.

“I had to don three hats — of dancer, rasika and a scientist,” said Prof. Madhurima, who is a condensed matter physicist at the Central University of Tamil Nadu in Thiruvarur. “In a way, there is a dichotomy — in art you are taught to accept and in science to always question. I think it is very important for us to question many things about dance as well,” she added.

The fifth edition of Science at the Sabha also had Shannon Olsson of the National Centre for Biological Sciences, Bengaluru; Harinath Chakrapani of the Indian Institute for Science Education and Research, Pune; and R. Ramanujam of The Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai (IMSc), as speakers.

Prof. Olsson spoke about the chemical interaction between lifeforms and the effect of human interventions. After building up the talk with stories and a friendly description of the history of drug discovery, including serendipitous accounts, Prof. Chakrapani briefly addressed the work being done in his lab.

Role of logic

Prof. Ramanujam, a computer scientist, spoke about using logic to understand how human behaviour differed when people got together in groups, as in when voting for elections. “The relationship between the individual and the State, or the person and society, is changing with the advent of social media, and what is the role of logic in this?” he asked.

“Instead of working for Google or some such organisation, a few smart minds should work on such problems,” he said.

The event also featured a poster exhibition on ‘Deep History of the Subcontinent’. “We thought it would be topical, given the discovery of ancient DNA at Rakhigarhi this year,” said Varuni. P. of IMSc, who is part of the organising committee.

“The exhibition gave a bird’s-eye view of the archaeological wealth of the region,” said Padmaja Anant of Orient Blackswan, who was there for the event.

J.S. Yadav, head of the Fuel Processing Division of the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, had come down to Chennai just for the event. He expressed interest in taking the programme to Mumbai.

344,2020/02/17,Vandalur-Kelambakkam Road needs urgent repair: motorists,"Highways officials say patchwork would be taken up soon

It is a bumpy ride for hundreds of motorists taking the Vandalur-Kelambakkam Road.

An important road connecting the Rajiv Gandhi Salai with the GST Road in the south, it is in a bad shape as its top layer has worn off. Several stretches, including Kolapakkam and Mambakkam, are dusty, as the blue metal has come off, causing further stress.

K. Palaniappan, a resident of Kolapakkam, said the road witnesses heavy traffic due to the presence of educational institutions, industries and development in neighbouring areas.

“It needs repairs and street lights are a must due to curves on the road. Not even the thickly populated places, where pedestrian movement is high, have lights. We move about in the light from roadside shops,” he said. Encroachments at the Mambakkam junction must be removed, said C. Ravi, a resident. “This is the junction with the Medavakkam-Velachery Road, and many establishments have encroached upon the road, making vehicular movement difficult. For now, vehicles take a U-turn after a kilometre and turn onto the road. There is a school nearby and the road gets jammed during rush hour,” he said.

Installing lights

Hundreds of commercial establishments have come up due to the presence of colleges on the road. But safety of pedestrians remains a question. “Without street lights, even CCTV cameras installed by the police are useless. The police ask us to install lights, but how many can we install outside our establishment,” said M. Mano, who runs a commercial establishment at Mambakkam.

Highways officials said that patchwork would be taken up soon. “A total of 10 km of road would be improved by the end of this month. However, it is up to local panchayats to install lights,” said an official.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/fz8al9/article30837574.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17THVANDALURKELAMBAKKAMROAD2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/vandalur-kelambakkam-road-needs-urgent-repair-motorists/article30837575.ece
345,2020/02/17,"Metro Rail slashes Phase II estimate by ₹7,000 crore","Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry has deemed initial cost to be very high

In a huge development, the Chennai Metro has drastically cut down the estimate of its Phase II project by nearly ₹7,000 crore.

From an initial estimate of ₹69,180 crore for 118.9 km, the project cost has been brought down to ₹62,000 crore, highly placed sources told The Hindu.

The Union Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) has directed Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL) to reduce the project cost, as it deemed it to be very high, the sources said.

Over the last year, CMRL officials held several rounds of discussions with MoHUA officials to find ways to bring down the project cost.

“It was an extremely challenging and tough process, but we managed to do it. It was very difficult as Bhopal Metro Rail was set as the benchmark for calculating cost per kilometre for the project. It may not be right to compare Chennai with Bhopal, as the purchase price of raw material and labour will be different,” a source said.

A slew of changes made in land acquisition and systems and operations helped in bringing down the cost by about ₹7,000 crore. “The MoHUA also gave recommendations on pricing for some of the systems, and changes were made accordingly,” another source said.

The final revised cost of the project will be sent to the MoHUA, after apprising the State government. After it approves the final cost, a few minor modifications will be made in the detailed project report as well, the source added.

Funds in phases

Sources said the Centre was likely to release funds in phases for Phase II, as requested by the State government.

After signing an MoU with the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), for a loan of ₹20,196 crore, the Metro has been in talks with the Asian Development Bank and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank for loans for some of the stretches of the project.

Chennai Metro has already begun floating tenders to first start work on 52 km of the 118.9 km, and the tunnelling contracts will be awarded in a few months.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/al9qr6/article30837571.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17THMETRO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/metro-rail-slashes-phase-ii-estimate-by-7000-crore/article30837572.ece
346,2020/02/17,"China, the media and truth-telling in a crisis","Wuhan has shown that when given the space to work, Chinese journalists can play a much-needed watchdog role.

On February 3, Caixin, a Chinese magazine known for its independent reporting — at least as independent as a media outlet can get in China — published the first of a four-part investigation. The article, headlined “How Wuhan lost the battle”, laid bare how a month-long cover-up allowed the novel coronavirus outbreak to spread, while the Chinese public remained completely unaware. That very same day, the lead story on the front page of the People’s Daily, the ruling Communist Party’s official newspaper, reported breathlessly on how a visit by China’s President Xi Jinping to a village in Qinghai province had transformed its fortunes. That visit, incidentally, was in August 2016.

A window to coverage

The two contrasting stories from two contrasting media outlets present a snapshot of how the media in China is covering the novel coronavirus outbreak, which as of February 16 has infected more than 68,500 people and claimed 1,665 lives on the mainland. In India, there is a widespread assumption that the media in China is one, single, heaving, Communist Party-controlled beast, where every article has to be signed off by the Politburo. Those perceptions, to be fair, have only deepened in the eight years since Mr. Xi took over the reins of the Party, a period that has seen a relentless tightening of controls over the media.

COVID-19 | For China’s Xi, the coronavirus challenge comes laden with economic costs and political risks

The Wuhan outbreak has served a reminder that below the surface, the media landscape in China remains a contested terrain, and that when given the space to work, Chinese journalists can play a much-needed watchdog role. Unfortunately, as the crisis and cover-up has reminded us, finding this space has become all too rare. We now know, thanks to the reporting of Caixin, Caijing, the Beijing News and a few other outlets, that the crisis was unfolding in Wuhan’s hospitals throughout December, even as the city and provincial leadership hid the scale of the outbreak. As a doctor at the Wuhan Union Hospital told Caixin, clinics were being flooded since late December with as many as 900 patients a day showing pneumonia-like symptoms. On December 30, eight doctors sent warnings on chat groups about the outbreak. Among the whistle-blower doctors was Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist. The eight were hauled up by police for “spreading rumours” and forced to sign statements withdrawing their claims.

It is now clear that the Wuhan government lied about the number of infections until at least January 16, which was, incidentally, when the city and province’s annual political congress ended. While the congress was being convened, the official number of infections remained constant. On January 11, the government said the number had actually declined to 41. By that point, there were likely tens of thousands of cases already in Wuhan alone. “All doctors in our hospital knew it was not correct as it was so different from what we’d seen,” one doctor told Caixin, which reported that the number of infections had grown so vast that CT scan machines in hospitals started breaking down.

Also Read A swift response and a cover-up

Moreover, a number of doctors and medical workers began falling ill, although hospitals barred doctors from disclosing this. The provincial government would maintain until January 20 that this viral pneumonia was under control and there was no clear evidence of human-to-human transmissions — a premature and ill-considered statement that helped magnify the crisis. Indeed, on January 19, the local government even held an annual community dinner for 40,000 families. It was only the following day, when respected Chinese epidemiologist Zhong Nanshan revealed the scale of the crisis did Wuhan realise it was in the middle of an unprecedented outbreak; Dr. Zhong rose to fame during the SARS or the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome fight, in 2002-03. And just three days later, with little warning, the entire province of Hubei would be put in quarantine — from buffet dinner to complete lockdown in 96 hours.

Structure of control

We know these facts only thanks to the brave Chinese journalists who have been reporting relentlessly from Wuhan’s ground zero. What explains the return of Chinese investigative journalism? Maria Repnikova, author of Media Politics in China: Improvising Power Under Authoritarianism, suggested in a recent article that the central government in Beijing has often deliberately granted limited space in times of crisis. Doing so serves at least two purposes: releasing a pressure valve that helps assuage public anger and assess public sentiment, and helping the central government better identify the source of the problem when under-fire provincial officials would be more concerned about saving their careers. The structure of control of Chinese media, to some extent, also enables such reporting. While the Hubei Party Committee would have direct control over media in their province, they have no such say over a magazine from Beijing or Shanghai. This explains why media from other provinces have led the coverage. Of course, even this is only possible because Beijing temporarily sees it as in its interest to project what Ms. Repnikova calls “an image of managed transparency”.

Unfortunately, the space for such reporting is usually fleeting, as was the case after the Sichuan earthquake in 2008 and the high-speed railway accident in Wenzhou in 2011, that claimed 40 lives. Indeed, there are already signs that the clampdown will resume. “The window now seems to be closing,” the China Media Project reported on February 5, citing an internal government directive stating “reports concerning the epidemic must take [information from] authoritative departments as the standard”.

Also Read Indian companies in China brace for uncertainty amid outbreak

“Without joint arrangements [with authorities], daring to use outside media reports is strictly prohibited.” Another instruction read: “Do not render commentary on the economic impact of the epidemic, resolutely preventing talk of the Chinese economy being undermined by the epidemic.”

The death of the whistle-blower doctor Li Wenliang on February 7, after he had contracted the coronavirus, unleashed a wave of public rage on Chinese social media that was unprecedented on many levels. Perhaps the only close parallel was the public response to the Wenzhou train accident. But this time around, the scale was much larger, underlining the public anxiety over the outbreak and the sense of immediacy of this crisis — anyone could be affected. On WeChat, everyone, from businessmen and academics to taxidrivers and primary schoolteachers posted tributes to Li. The lyrics of “Do you hear the people sing” from Les Misérables went viral, and the phrase “freedom of speech” trended briefly on the Twitter-like social media website, Weibo, before censors stepped in.

Political impact

The current crisis is perhaps the biggest challenge facing the Party in the Xi era. The Party taking the unprecedented steps of showing, for the first time, videos of leaders speaking at usually secretive Politburo Standing Committee meetings, and subsequently releasing on February 15 an internal speech by Xi, suggest it is more than a little concerned about how the public is looking at its response. In the speech, Mr. Xi said he had as early as January 7 issued orders to deal with the crisis, a rare instance of him taking the step of actually explaining the Party’s actions to the public. He called for lessons to be learnt, including plugging the loopholes in responding to such disasters. He also called for ensuring “societal control and security”. While a prolonged crisis could certainly hurt the Party’s legitimacy, an early victory in the fight against coronavirus — which the world will be hoping for — could still end up as a rallying call for Mr. Xi ahead of the Party’s 100-year-anniversary in 2021.

While the Party may well see more control as the answer, in the view of some Chinese, however, it is a systemic culture of secrecy that prides security above all else — one that only incentivises local officials to cover up, control their media, and maintain “stability” at all costs until a crisis has spiralled beyond control — that explains the Hubei provincial government’s actions. How else would they respond if “stability maintenance” is a leading criterion for a promotion? In their view, transparency is the solution, although one need only look closer to home to conclude it is perhaps a necessary but not sufficient condition to deal with such outbreaks, which require a robust and prepared health-care system too.

Winds of change?

Moreover, they see the stifling of independent Chinese voices as hurting the government’s own mission of trying to convince the world of its response. When much of the media is state-controlled and there are few independent outlets mediating China’s rapidly expanding engagement with the world, scepticism will likely abound overseas, even if China ironically has, at least since January 20, been far more transparent in handling the outbreak than it was during SARS 17-18 years ago. To that end, a petition put forward by a number of academics from the elite Tsinghua University in Beijing, Mr. Xi’s alma mater, has now called to make February 7, the day of Dr. Li’s passing, a national day for freedom of speech. It is perhaps too early to tell where such calls will go, and whether the current sense of anger will end up as fleeting as this revival of Chinese journalism.

347,2020/02/17,A Justice resigns,"The sudden resignation by Bombay High Court’s Justice S.C. Dharmadhikari has stunned the legal fraternity. We do not know as yet what really prompted the very outstanding and brilliant Justice Dharmadhikari to put in his papers. But this is a great and enormous loss for our now-crumbling judiciary.

Justice Dharmadhikari was a fair, and no-nonsense, Judge with an impeccable and unblemished record. It is extremely anguishing that the Supreme Court was unable to find a way out to retain one of the finest jewels in the judiciary. Did justice elude Justice Dharmadhikari? Or did his impeccable principles and integrity reign supreme, leaving the learned Justice with no option but to be the master of his own destiny? Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. His statement: “Hope this institution does not bend before the mighty state, the biggest litigant before it” should be an eye-opener.

As Caroline Kennedy, attorney, diplomat and daughter of the late President John F. Kennedy, observed: “The bedrock of our democracy is the rule of law and that means we have to have an independent judiciary, judges who can make decisions independent of the political winds that are blowing.” Or, as the late President Andrew Jackson of the United States stated: “All the rights secured to the citizens under the Constitution are worth nothing, and a mere bubble, except guaranteed to them by an independent and virtuous judiciary.”

349,2020/02/17,In the name of ‘nation’,"The two most abused terms in a democracy are “national interest” and “national security”. They are used to curb citizens’ rights and to pull wool over people’s eyes. We should not forget that everything Hitler did was in what he considered to be ‘national interest’ and yet he took Germany efficiently and determinedly on a path to ruin. The rise of Hitler in the inter-war years was possible because the silent majority in his country saw in Hitler’s ascent a manifestation of the ‘national German pride’! Similarly, the dilution of Article 370 in 2019 was done in the name of ‘national interest’ and ‘national security’. If the dilution was meant to facilitate Jammu and Kashmir (J&K)’s integration into the national mainstream, why did the government hold on to the Kashmir-specific Public Safety Act (PSA)? Here, in Goa, Section 144 has been imposed citing the excuse of ‘terror threats’. The reality is, for authoritarian governments, the biggest threat comes not from external enemies but from its own citizens. This is when elements in the jurisprudence such as Section 144, PSA and Section 124A, dealing with sedition, come into play. While the British Empire used the sedition law to curb free speech during India’s independence struggle, the present government is using it to silence and harass those with divergent opinions, including writers, activists and protesters. Britain repealed this law in 2009 while we in India continue to have it in our statute books. Mysteriously, the ‘national interest’ always converges with the political interests of whichever party or leader is in power. Considering this, a true patriot must always be ready to defend his country against his government.

350,2020/02/17,Shocking incident,"It was unbelievable that girls in a college hostel in Gujarat’s Bhuj were made to line up in a toilet and remove their undergarments to prove that they were not menstruating.

The ‘discovery’ of a used sanitary pad and the possible entry of the menstruating woman into the temple and the kitchen on the premises are said to have warranted the strip search. It was assumed that one of the hostel inmates threw the pad to escape being ‘quarantined’ in a dark, filthy basement, a prescription for menstruating students. The unspeakable ‘exercise’ was obviously aimed at identifying the ‘culprit’ who dared to hide her period in violation of the institute’s rules.

Nothing could have been more humiliating than the naked invasion of their privacy to the victims. It will now take time for the deep psychological wound inflicted by the ordeal to heal.

It is most lamentable that menstruation is treated as something ‘impure’ and ‘polluting’ in this day and age. There is no reason why menstruating women should be confined to a dark room or barred from entering a kitchen or a place of worship. God’s abode is not defiled or desecrated by the presence of a menstruating woman.

It is basic science that menstruation is a biological phenomenon linked to procreation. Vaginal bleeding is a presage and preparation for pregnancy. It is a sign of readiness for pregnancy. It is crude and primitive ‘to punish’ women for having monthly periods ordained by nature. It is time as a society we normalise menstruation and empower girls.

352,2020/02/17,Cleansing electoral politics,"Annoyed by the Centre’s utter disregard for a 2018 Constitution Bench judgment that sought greater disclosure of criminal history of electoral candidates, the Supreme Court has taken a tough stand. However, cleansing the political system cannot be achieved by guidelines and rulings issued by apex court and Election Commission alone, unless the political parties themselves take initiative to prohibit such candidates. Publication of criminal history of candidates will not make any impact, as people elect them, with huge margins, knowing fully well their criminal background. Further, the political parties may prefer publishing the criminal history of the tainted candidates rather than preventing them from contesting elections. Political parties are capable of furnishing convincing reasons for fielding tainted candidates. There are two options before the authorities for cleansing electoral politics. One, political parties should refrain from giving ticket to tainted candidates; two, Election Commission should reject the nominations of such candidates. (Editorial, “Choice and candidacy,” February 15).

D. Sethuraman,

Chennai

Though one welcomes the latest directive of the Supreme Court that all political parties should invariably publish the entire criminal history of the candidates which the State or Centre intend to field for the elections and also cite the reasons that prompted and provoked them to dole out tickets, I, for one, wonder why the apex court was so stoically silent over this cardinal issue, for years on end, since 1952 when the first General Elections were held in our country.

Had the Supreme Court cracked the whip in 1952 itself, one could not have seen such an alarming number, 43%, in the case of MPs with questionable backgrounds, in the year 2019.

One thing is crystal clear. Political parties, undoubtedly and wantonly, close their eyes to the criminal records of the candidates, even if some irregularities are noticed.

Has anyone come across any other government vacancy being filled up if the candidate had a proven criminal record? Such being the case, how come candidates chosen for the State or Centre elections with shady background are given tickets? A moot point to ponder.

Will the recent directive of the Supreme Court be followed in letter and spirit by the concerned? Doubtful indeed.

The hugely dismal performance of the Indian National Congress in the Delhi elections, which not only saw the party draw a blank but also witnessed almost all its candidates forfeiting their deposits, has perturbed several senior leaders and a chorus of demands for reinventing the party are being heard from various quarters. (“After Delhi defeat, Cong leaders for reinvention of party,” Feb. 16). Senior leader and former Union Minister Veerappa Moily has joined his colleagues in the Karnataka Congress and called for a serious introspection into the present state of affairs. Younger elements in the party like former Union Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia too have voiced their deep concern. However, it appears that as long as the Gandhis call the shots, the future of the Congress, as far as its electoral prospects are concerned, is extremely bleak. Discredited leaders like the former Finance Minister P Chidambaram, who turned ecstatic after AAP’s resounding victory oblivious to the rot in his own backyard, are only dragging the party deeper down the mire. It is unbelievable that this was the same party that ruled Delhi for 15 years at a stretch.

353,2020/02/17,Missing in action,"There cannot be a bigger falsehood than Pakistan’s claim to the the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) that the international terrorist Masoor Azhar and his family are ‘missing’ (Front page, “Masood Azhar & family missing, Pak. tells financial watchdog FATF,” Feb. 16). The international community, hopefully, has not forgotten Islamabad’s denials of Osama bin Laden’s presence in the country, later proved to be false when the 9/11 mastermind was found to be hiding in an Abbottabad mansion located near a military academy. Pakistan’s assertions will not find many takers this time among observers.

K. Vijayaraghavan,

Hyderabad

Not long ago, Pakistan was feigning ignorance on the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden, saying he might be in Afghanistan. But the U.S. Navy SEALS operation in 2011 left Islamabad red-faced. Similarly, Islamabad’s assertion that Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) chief Masood Azhar and his family are missing is nothing but spinning wool over the eyes of the FATF and the United Nations. Pakistan is currently unable to take firm stern measures to contain terror outfits. It won’t be surprising if, in the near future, Azhar surfaces and Pakistan is forced to manufacture reasons that are hard to believe.

S. Arjun Prasanna,

Bengaluru

Pakistan has taken no real action against any of the terror networks and terrorists operating from its soil. The country is not willing to give up its confrontational attitude over Kashmir and needs the support of the likes of Azhar. It won’t be surprising if, after the fear of blacklisting by the FATF is warded off, the deep state there prevails upon the judiciary to get the recently convicted Jamaat-ud-Dawa leader Hafiz Saeed freed.

S.S. Paul,

Chakdaha, Nadia, West Bengal

The new CCTV footage that shows policemen thrashing Jamia Millia Islamia students at the university’s Old Reading Hall makes it clear that Delhi police were given a free hand to use force while dealing with the students. Just days later, members of the same law enforcement department were seen standing outside the Jawaharlal Nehru University’s campus as masked goons beat up students and teachers of the University. The incidents raised troubling questions on the functioning of the Home Ministry.

The Delhi police has, for long, been known to use force to silence innocent voices. But, for the first time, they have resorted to entering university spaces and even libraries to show their heavy-handedness on unarmed students. Some videos also raise questions on whether it was people from the Delhi police who burnt buses and vandalised property. The police brutality over the last few months has led to several students being injured and admitted to hospitals, with one of them even losing sight in an eye.

It won’t be an exaggeration to say that the Delhi Police has now become the personal bouncer of the Central Home Ministry, with no ethics, morals or code of conduct.

There seems to be little introspection in the government about what led to the deadly attack in Pulwama in Jammu and Kashmir a year ago. We do not know what steps the state has taken to prevent such dastardly attacks from taking place in future.

Like the state, can journalism too afford to not introspect? When a section of the media hyped up India’s retaliatory strikes in Balakot,Pakistan, and its dogfight with Pakistani jets that led to the capture of Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, this newspaper did it its duty by merely reporting facts. It did not provide fodder for propaganda.

Journalism and propaganda

My column titled “The difference between journalism and propaganda” (March 4, 2019) was subjected to a savage attack for not being “nationalistic” enough. It was written at a time when many believed that there were major strategic gains to be made with the Balakot strikes in Pakistan, and that the Indian Air Force shot down an F-16. While media propagandists were busy putting out unverified numbers of terrorists killed in the offensive, The Hindu decided to stick to reporting facts which it could either verify or attribute to a responsible authority. It consciously decided not to publish claims of military success by anonymous sources. The lack of accountability made selective plants in the media not only suspicious but also vitiated the information environment. When eye-witness accounts of the Balakot strikes emerged in the international media (Indian journalists do not have access to Pakistan), discerning readers understood the difference between journalism and propaganda.

A year later, as this newspaper pointed out in its report, “Many loose ends hamper probe into Pulwama attack” (February 15, 2020), the National Investigation Agency has not been able to trace the source of high-grade explosives used by the car-borne suicide bomber. There is little or no inquiry into the intelligence failure that led to the attack. The dramatic arrest of Davinder Singh, Deputy Superintendent of the J&K Police, on January 11 when he was supposedly ferrying two Hizbul Mujahideen terrorists, Naveed Mushtaq alias Babu and Altaf, as well as an unidentified lawyer who allegedly worked as an overground worker for terror groups, makes the issue murkier as Singh was posted in Pulwama.

Nationalism and patriotism

In my column, “Retaining the ability to question” (April 8, 2019), I invoked a George Orwell quote — “In a time of deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act” — to explain the newspaper’s meticulous reports on the U.S.’s count of F-16 planes in Pakistan. Orwell’s 1943 resignation letter from the BBC has been a guiding light to many journalists to hold on to journalistic principles in the light of overwhelming governmental propaganda.

The author of 1984 also wrote an essay called “Notes on nationalism” which listed out the various blinkers generated by the notion of nationalism. Orwell made a clear distinction between the enabling idea of patriotism and the debilitating imagination of nationalism. It is important that this essay is read not only by journalists, but also by citizens to guard against the hijacking of our democratic rights by demagogues. In a searing passage, Orwell explained the trappings of nationalism: “Every nationalist is haunted by the belief that the past can be altered. He spends part of his time in a fantasy world in which things happen as they should – in which, for example, the Spanish Armada was a success or the Russian Revolution was crushed in 1918 – and he will transfer fragments of this world to the history books whenever possible. Much of the propagandist writing of our time amounts to plain forgery. Material facts are suppressed, dates altered, quotations removed from their context and doctored so as to change their meaning.”

Journalism has survived various bouts of strident nationalism. But the present variant has a new complication in the form of digital multiplications and algorithm-driven manipulations. For instance, Google maps shows two different versions of Kashmir: one for users accessing the Internet from India and one for those outside the geographical border of the country. Unlike algorithm-driven selective interpretations of events, which in many cases lie between half-truths and blatant lies, journalism refers to the act of first verifying information and only then publishing it.

355,2020/02/17,Visitors are welcome to try their hand at grape plucking here,"No sour grapes these: Visitors at the Konda Laxman Telangana State Horticultural University are going ‘ga-ga’ over the grape-plucking experience

One wouldn’t have asked for anything better than taking a walk in a grape garden during the weekend. Enjoying the pleasant February breeze and getting to eat farm-fresh produce was a unique experience. To make Hyderabadis appreciate the yield of nature and taste the best produce of the season, Konda Laxman Telangana State Horticultural University organised a week-long grape festival. The Annual Grape Festival aims to provide visitors with a first-hand experience of grape plucking at its grape research centre.

The 3.5-acre university at Rajendranagar was teeming with people that Sunday. Children were thrilled with the vast open spaces and especially at the thought of plucking grapes. While visitors were given access to the grape garden, there were a few dos and don’ts as well; visitors could pluck grapes from specific creepers they were guided to, and strict instructions were issued on how to pluck so as not to damage/destroy the plants. Visitors were also advised to carry their own bags.

Tasteful lessons

“This is way better than spending my Sunday watching my favourite cartoon shows at home. I have only seen grapes in supermarkets earlier, this is the first time I visited a grape garden. I was at a mango farm last year,” recalls 11-year old Anahita Mohan. Does Anahita like grapes? “Only if they are sweet. Since we don’t know much about varieties, we tasted every variety we saw and picked only the sweet ones. By the time we were ready to leave after picking and buying grapes, my belly was full from tasting,” she laughs.

To help visitors identify the varieties of grapes, each row was marked with names. Some of the names spotted include Kismis, Navrang, Red Globe, Rose, Sharat seedless, among many others.

Every year the Horticultural University auctions the grape farm and subsequently, the buyer, in turn, opens up the garden to sell the produce to the public. Corani Mahesh who bought the grape garden this season says, “People in Hyderabad must know what our state produces. The grape varieties grown here are very good and soon the streets on the highways will be full of grape sellers. By the end of the festival, the farm will be empty of grapes.”

“It was extremely hot yesterday but the children were delighted to see a real farm. Living in a concrete jungle, children hardly to get to see and enjoy Nature. This fest at the University is a good way to introduce children to nature,” says Bharati Raja, a visitor.

Washing ways

Will the visitors return for a festival again? “If any farm is willing to sell pesticide-free fruits like they did at Konda Laxman Telangana Horticultural University, why not,” says another visitor.

According to Ram Reddy, scientific officer at the State Horticultural University, “The best grapes in these parts are known as Anab-e-Shahi, patronised by the Nizams. With resilient weather to support, viticulture has never been as good as in 2019-20; a bumper harvest of over 60 varieties is ready to be plucked at the Grape Research Station farms near Rajendranagar. The Thomson Seedless variety is the pick of the season. Grape cultivation in Telangana shows a leg-up despite losing major chunks of grapes garden land to real estate.”

Prices of grapes at the Grape Research Station farm range between ₹150 and 300 per kilogram. The fest ends on February 20.

Old newspapers and grapes

Back in the 70s and 80s, only seeded variety of grapes were sold on carts in Hyderabad. The grape bunches would be wrapped in newspaper, and not plastic carry bags as they are now. During the grape season, such was the demand that newspapers fetched a higher price when sold to raddi wallahs (scrap dealers)",food,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/m74385/article30842347.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hym18-grape3,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/grape-fest-konda-laxman-telangana-state-horticultural-university/article30842348.ece

358,2020/02/17,K.D. Swaminathan is new Western Fleet chief,"Communications and electronic warfare specialist to succeed Sanjay Jasjit Singh

Rear Admiral Krishna D. Swaminathan took over as the new Western Fleet Commander last week.

The baton of the Flag Officer Commanding Western Fleet was handed over to him by Rear Admiral Sanjay Jasjit Singh (AVSM, NM) at a change of command function, held on board the aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya on Friday.

An alumnus of the National Defence Academy, Rear Admiral Swaminathan is a specialist in communications and electronic warfare and has commanded front-line warships such as INS Vidyut, INS Vinash, INS Kulish, INS Mysore and INS Vikramaditya.

The Western Fleet has been at the forefront of all naval operations across the Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean region since its inception, consistently executing the military, diplomatic, constabulary and benign roles of the Indian Navy. The fleet has grown in capacity and capability over the years and presently includes the aircraft carrier, multi-role destroyers and frigates, fleet tankers, three air squadrons and integral flights.

359,2020/02/17,CM bats for a stronger judiciary to tackle crimes against women,"Uddhav also suggests doing away with archaic British-era laws

Expressing dismay that the accused in the Nirbhaya rape-murder case have still not been executed, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday said, “We need to build a judiciary and a society where separate fast-track courts will not be needed for crimes against women.”

Mr. Thackeray also said strict implementation of laws requires seamless coordination between the legislature, executive, and judiciary. “The judiciary has the power to create the Maharashtra envisaged by Babasaheb Ambedkar, Shahu Maharaj, Mahatma Phule and Shivaji Maharaj.”

He was speaking at a lawyers’ conference ‘Marching towards speedy modern judiciary’ organised by the Maharashtra and Goa Bar Council in Nashik.

The CM stressed the need to do away with archaic British-era laws if they are irrelevant. “People want speedy justice, and all four pillars of democracy need to come together to determine how to achieve that. A lot of positive changes can be made if the judiciary takes suggestions and expectations of the CM of every State. Archaic British-era laws need to be revisited and changed according to the changed needs of society, and circumstances.”

About the crimes against women, the CM said, it is the responsibility of all to create a judiciary and a society to ensure that fast-track courts are not required for such offences. “We need to create such a social structure. If we fail to form an ideal society, no number of jails will be enough to keep criminals. Apart from laws, instilling good values in a society is important.”

Mr. Thackeray assured the audience that a law university will be set up with a special emphasis on those who want to become judges. He also unveiled the plaque of the new district court that will be constructed in three years.

Also present at the occasion were SC judge Justice Bhushan Gavai, Transport Minister Anil Parab, Justice Makarand Karnik and Justice Sandip Shinde of the Bombay High Court, and many senior officers from the judiciary.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ihd5p1/article30838058.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17BMUDDHAV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/cm-bats-for-a-stronger-judiciary-to-tackle-crimes-against-women/article30838006.ece

The police said around 6.15 p.m, Priya Sagar (31) noticed that some jewellery was missing. Ms. Sagar confronted her mother, Kamal, who said she would return it on Monday. While the argument continued, the daughter consumed a toxic substance.

Ms. Sagar’s father rushed her to Kokilaben Ambani Hospital. In the meantime, their domestic help realised that Kamal was missing and raised an alarm. The police said Kamal ended her life around 6.45 p.m.

An officer with the Oshiwara police said, “Ms. Sagar was treated at the hospital and is now stable. We have registered an accidental death report in the mother’s case.”

361,2020/02/17,500 DYFI members detained for anti-CAA rally without nod,"Around 500 activists of the Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) were detained by the police on Sunday when they started a morcha against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC). The protest was planned from BPCL in Uran to Wahal, and they were detained around 2 p.m. by the Uran and the Nhava Sheva police. The agitation was part of their four-day protest from Uran to Chaitya Bhoomi in Dadar.

“We were detained citing that we had no permission. We told them to either detain us legally and arrest under relevant sections or let us go. We told them that with or without permission we would continue our march,” Prasad Subramanium, spokesperson of DYFI, said.

Hesaid the demonstration was to voice their concerns over the CAA and NRC, and highlighting issues related to the youth. “We need jobs. We are also against privatisation of PSUs. Among the protesters was a group from Nashik whose houses have not been built because they haven’t yet received money under the PMAY.”

Senior police inspector Jagdish Kulkarni from Uran police station said, “They were detained as they had no permission. They had applied for permission but it was rejected due to security issues as they intended to start the protest at BPCL. After four hours, we let them off with a warning.”

362,2020/02/17,Civil work on new Thane-Diva lines to be completed by April,"Girders to be used on rail flyover awaiting final approval

The civil construction of the long-pending fifth and sixth lines between Thane and Diva is expected to be completed by April, with completion of the rail flyover near Mumbra station.

Railway officials said the steel girders to be used on the flyover were awaiting approvals from the Research Design and Standards Organisation. “The girders are being fabricated in Kota and are expected to arrive in the city within a fortnight,” an official said.

After the civil construction is completed, the Railways will need to work on the yard remodelling at both ends. This will integrate the new lines with the existing ones through a series of nine cuts and connections at 12 locations along the corridor, each of which would require a 10-hour megablock.

Officials said they were already planning on the blocks and should be ready with a schedule around the same time.

The two additional lines are key to reducing the load currently borne by Central Railway (CR), as they will allow segregation of long-distance passenger trains and suburban services between Kurla and Kalyan. The patch between Thane and Diva is a bottleneck at the moment, with six lines each operational between Diva and Kalyan and Thane and Kurla.

The project, which is being executed by the Mumbai Rail Vikas Corporation, sanctioned under the second phase of the Mumbai Urban Transport Project (MUTP 2) in 2008. It has since been plagued by several delays with the cost of the project has increased from around ₹140 crore to around ₹500 crore.

The two lines are among three pending MUTP 2 projects, and the only one nearing completion. The fifth and sixth line between Kurla and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus, being executed by CR, and the sixth line between Mumbai Central and Borivali, being executed by Western Railway, also sanctioned under MUTP 2, are far from completion.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/civil-work-on-new-thane-diva-lines-to-be-completed-by-april/article30837956.ece
363,2020/02/17,Number of protesters dips at Mumbai Bagh,"Some cite fear of police action, others say agitation still going strong

The number of women protesting at Mumbai Bagh in Mumbai Central saw a drop on Sunday, as the protest entered its 21st day.

The protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the National Population Register (NPR) started on the night of January 26. Thousands of women joined in during the initial two weeks, but the third week saw a drop in the footfall.

Volunteer Adil Sakhani, who has been supporting the women since the first day, said, “The women are scared as the police are issuing notices under Section 149 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to anyone entering the protest area. Even the people delivering fruits and snacks to the venue are not being spared. The police cooperate with us except for [one particular officer].”

Mr. Sakhalani claimed that this particular officer of the Nagpada police station, while patrolling, warns the women that notices are being issued to them and if anything goes wrong, they will be held responsible.

Protester Safia Sheikh, however, said the protest was going strong and an increasing number of women were joining each day. “I think the protest is gradually moving towards its objective as all the Bharatiya Janata Party leaders are alarmed. This is proven by their contradictory statements in Parliament and at other events. We support the census, but not the additional questions in the NPR,” she said.

Another protester, Fiza Khan, said there was a need for a shed and few speakers. “We got two umbrellas but the police took them away. Other than that, they have been very patient with us. They are just doing their jobs and we have no grudge or complaint against them,” she said.

Many volunteers help the women and ensure their safety. Irfan Sheikh (55), a volunteer, said, “Prime Minister Narendra Modi is selling the country … He is only interested in the progress of some Gujarati businessmen.”

Iqbal Patel (53), another volunteer, said people are being killed for raising their voice all over the country. “I was disturbed since the day Aishe Ghosh from Jawaharlal Nehru University was hit on the head by the Delhi Police. I have been volunteering here and did so at the Gateway of India protest for two days. The Mumbai Bagh protest did not get enough media coverage,” he said.

Even with fewer voices, however, the enthusiasm remained high and the sloganeering loud.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/number-of-protesters-dips-at-mumbai-bagh/article30837933.ece
364,2020/02/17,Amravati college incident clear instance of gender bias: Zen,"Bravery award winner seeks action against officials for ‘unconstitutional’ pledge

After a video of students of an all-girl college in Maharashtra taking a pledge against the concept of love marriage went viral, a 12-year-old has written to the Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, Union Minister of Women and Child Development Smriti Irani and the Director General of Police, seeking urgent intervention.

Zen Gunratan Sadavarte, who received the National Bravery Award 2020 from the President on Republic Day for saving 17 lives in a fire at her residence in August 2018, said she has demanded that an FIR be registered against officials of Mahila Arts and Commerce College, Amravati.

The young girl said the act of making girls take such a pledge is unconstitutional and deprives the girls of the right to make decisions regarding their life.

The incident occurred on Friday, which was Valentine’s Day. According to Zen, the video could cause mental agony as it encourages the mindset that takes inspiration from the Manusmriti. She also said it was a clear instance of gender discrimination under Section 294 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 67A of the Information Technology Act, 2000.

Hence, a complaint was filed under Section 154 of Code of Criminal Procedure against the National Student Scheme (NSS) programme professor Pradeep Danday, who allegedly forced the girls to take the oath.

“I have written two letters. In the first letter I have mentioned Yashomati Thakur, the State Women and Child Development Minister, who said the pledge was not binding on anyone and the girls must have taken the oath in light of surrounding events. If a minister is saying this, then what will happen to democracy?” she asked.

The Bravery Award recipient further said the second letter, addressed to Mr. Thackeray and Ms. Irani asks them to take urgent and immediate steps to prohibit girls from taking unconstitutional oaths, which were part of a brainwashing process by the authorities.

‘Violation of rights’

Through the letters, Zen also said it is a grave violation of natural justice and the girls’ right to free will of marriage. It falls under mass offensive schooling under the NSS programme.

“The reason why I stepped forward is because I do not want such an incident like this to happen ever again in any government educational institute,” the 12-year-old said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ioqgmg/article30837919.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17BMAnanya,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/amravati-college-incident-clear-instance-of-gender-bias-zen/article30837920.ece
365,2020/02/17,Hundreds pedal to highlight importance of mental health,"Cyclists take pledge to increase conversation on wellness

More than 2,000 people gathered early on Sunday to cycle in support of mental health awareness, as part of the fifth edition of Ride to Mpower, the annual community cycle ride.

A 27-km ride was flagged off from NSCI in Worli by Mpower founder and chairperson Neerja Birla; Minister of Environment, Tourism and Protocol Aaditya Thackeray, Municipal Commissioner Praveen Pardeshi, and cricketer, entrepreneur and head, Aditya Birla Sports, Aryaman Birla.

A 15-km ride was flagged off by Mayank Bathwal, chief executive officer at Aditya Birla Health Insurance, and Kausar Munir, Bollywood lyricist and screenwriter. The cyclists also received words of encouragement from Commissioner of Police Sanjay Barve.

The streets from Worli to Bandra Kurla Complex were filled with enthusiastic Mumbaikars pledging to increase conversation about mental health and make the city taboo-free.

Participants were from all walks of life, including social and mental health activists, corporate executives, cycling ambassadors, fitness enthusiasts and college students, an MPower spokesperson said.

Stamping out stigma

A fitness aficionado, Ms. Birla aims to bring together all fitness champs to pledge their support towards mental health. “At Mpower, we always strive to bring about a change in perception and attitude towards mental health in India. We are delighted with the overwhelming support we have received over the past four years, with Mumbaikars coming out to stamp out stigma around mental health,” she said.

Ms. Birla said with this year’s Ride to Mpower, they hoped to bring in more cycling and fitness communities together.

“We want to encourage more and more people to join the movement and create dialogue about mental health with the same zeal, openness and seriousness as we do for physical health. After all, a healthy mind and healthy body both contribute towards an individual’s holistic well-being,” she said.

Mr. Thackeray, who is also the MLA from Worli, said he was happy to be present for such an important cause. “Ms. Birla’s Mpower is doing a fantastic job in alleviating stigma associated with this topic, and cycling is a great way to bring the city together. We started a cycling track at Marine Drive to promote the activity, and Ms. Birla’s enthusiasm and thought behind Ride to Mpower has inspired me to create more initiatives for fitness,” the minister said.

One in six people in India suffers from a serious mental disorder, and yet mental health remains a taboo in most Indian households, institutions and workplaces, a statement from Mpower said. “The uncaring attitude, the ignorant labels, the tone-deaf conversations, the endless stigma and the lack of mental healthcare need to change,” it said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/jd3m9r/article30837911.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17BmCycling,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/hundreds-pedal-to-highlight-importance-of-mental-health/article30837912.ece
366,2020/02/17,"HC pulls up State for not paying dues of ₹3,000 crore to MSRTC","‘Unfortunate scenario’ should be avoided, losses brought down, says court

The Bombay High Court recently said the government not reimbursing more than ₹3,000 crore to the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) was an unfortunate scenario that had to be avoided, and the government must bring down the continued losses of the corporation.

A Division Bench of Justices S.C. Dharmadhikari and R.I. Chagla was hearing a public interest litigation filed by advocate Datta Mane.

Appearing in person, Mr. Mane said the MSRTC should not be permitted to cancel concessions because the State government has not cleared its dues.

On August 12, 2015, the counsel appearing for the MSRTC told the court that the corporation was awaiting reimbursement of more than ₹3,000 crore. The MSRTC gives concessions on tickets to 25 categories of passengers, including persons with disabilities, freedom fighters, senior citizens, students and sportsmen.

Earlier this month, various government departments were yet to release the dues to be paid to the corporation. Mr. Mane contended that the welfare implemented by the MSRTC resulted in operational losses year after year. Further, the corporation does not have adequate funds to upgrade and improve services.

He said if State transport services have to be efficient, smooth and expeditious, the MSRTC is aware that it will have to compete with private bus operators. The private operators have managed to virtually take over routes on which the corporation operates. Being a government enterprise does not mean the MSRTC should continue to incur losses, Mr. Mane said.

The court said, “We would like the secretary of the Transport Department to take up this issue with the other functionaries of the government and resolve it as expeditiously as possible.”

It said secretaries of the departments concerned should cooperate with the Transport Department and resolve the matter amicably.

The Bench said, “The MSRTC is not expected to incur losses or indulge in litigation for it is an enterprise or undertaking of the State. It is not expected to then launch proceedings, civil and criminal, against the other departments of the government. This unfortunate scenario has to be avoided and the continued losses of this corporation have to be brought down with sincere and genuine efforts.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ktdlun/article30837884.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17BMMSRTC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/hc-pulls-up-state-for-not-paying-dues-of-3000-crore-to-msrtc/article30837885.ece

368,2020/02/17,Policeman in Cuddalore pens song against child abuse,"Head constable Pon Sivaperuman says the aim is to sensitise children about their rights

Here is a cop who is not just good at policing but has also taken to music to create awareness on critical social issues. Not letting his passion and inborn talents from his school years go waste, he finds time, despite a hectic work schedule, to pen lyrics for songs that appeal to a large section of people.

With increased incidents of sexual abuse against children, Pon Sivaperuman, a head constable attached to the Marudhur police station in Cuddalore district, has now penned a song to convey his message on the social evil.

He has written the lyrics with simple words, which warn those indulging in abuse against children.

The song Touch Me Not aims at empowering children on good touch and bad touch and warns that anyone molesting a child would land in jail and would be punished under the stringent provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. The lyrics by Mr. Sivaperuman are in Tamil.

The head constable has already distinguished himself by writing songs to address various social issues. He has already penned a song to raise awareness about the need to abide by traffic rules for one’s own safety.

Mr. Sivaperuman, who was posted at Marudhur station near Chidambaram, is now in Cuddalore on deputation for performing Villu Paatu on road safety at traffic junctions, major road intersections and educational institutions. He is now looking for an organiser to compose the music for the song. “The aim is to ensure that the song reaches children and sensitises them on their rights,” he said.

Mr. Sivaperuman’s initiatives have been appreciated by Superintendent of Police M. Sree Abhinav, who sanctioned a vehicle equipped with speakers and ten policemen from the Armed Reserve.

The team led by Mr. Sivaperuman has been visiting schools and educational institutions in all police sub-divisions in the district creating awareness among children.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/bazzvb/article30837830.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16FEBTHAWARENESSCAMP1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/policeman-in-cuddalore-pens-song-against-child-abuse/article30837831.ece
369,2020/02/17,Sixth anniversary of Jipmer’s cadaver donor programme celebrated,"Institute has harvested organs from 42 brain-dead patients since the programme’s inception

Jipmer celebrated the sixth anniversary of its Cadaver Donor Transplantation Programme by honouring families of its donors.

Rakesh Aggarwal, Director, Jipmer, along with the members of the deceased donor transplantation committee honoured donor families and police officers who coordinated with the Jipmer hospital in completing the necessary formalities for organ donation.

Medical experts, nurses and other support staff at Jipmer who actively participated in the programme and contributed extra working hours and effort outside their duty hours without expecting any extra remuneration were also felicitated.

Inaugurating the event, Dr. Aggarwal said Jipmer was the first institution to start organ harvesting from brain-dead donors in Puducherry in December 2013. Harvesting and transplanting of organs like kidney and liver, and tissues like hands, skin and corneas (eyes) were being offered at Jipmer.

Jipmer has till date performed a total of 650 corneal transplants (since 1997), 218 kidney transplants (since 2012), 5 liver transplants (since 2017), 1 skin transplant and 3 hand transplants (since 2017).

Hand transplant

In fact, Jipmer is the only government hospital in India to have performed a hand transplant operation, he said.

Jipmer has so far harvested organs like kidney, liver and heart from 42 brain-dead patients since the programme’s inception. A total of 218 patients have undergone kidney transplants at the institute till date, of which 82 kidneys were from deceased donors and 3 from PIMS as a part of organ sharing.

Since it started the liver transplant programme in 2017, Jipmer has performed five liver transplant operations, the Director said. Sreejith Parameswaran, Nodal officer, NOTTO, presented the annual report. Shankareswari, Deputy Nursing Superintendent, faculty members from various departments, staff and member of the public participated.

A public interactive session on brain death and organ donation was chaired by Mohan V.K., Associate Professor of Anaesthesiology & Critical Care.

370,2020/02/17,Manpower shortage affecting enforcement of food safety laws,"Several vacancies in the Food Safety Department not filled; absence of vehicles is also affecting random collection of samples from the market

An acute shortage of manpower has crippled the functioning of the Food Safety Department in Puducherry. Most senior posts in the department, including those of the Food Safety Officers, have been vacant for several years and the department has been running the show by assigning work to the existing officials.

As against the sanctioned strength of eight, the department has only two Food Safety Officers.

According to sources in the department, “the two officers have to look after all the 23 constituencies in Puducherry, which is practically impossible.

“The manpower shortage has crippled the functioning of the department at a time when it is battling a host of public health issues, including food adulteration. In addition, the department has no Ministerial staff on its rolls and all the posts, including those of Superintendent and multi-tasking staff, remain vacant.”

An official, on condition of anonymity, pointed out that there had been no permanent replacement for the staff who retired, were transferred or resigned all these years.

The problem arose after the nomenclature was changed from Food Inspectors to Food Safety Officers. Although the pay scale alone changed, there had been no sanction. The department had raised this issue several times with the State government and the Centre. But, there had been no response, he said.

The department does not have its own vehicle and the two Food Safety Officers use their own vehicles to reach places on time.

This has affected the collection of samples and there has been no follow-up against companies which sell substandard and unsafe food items in the market.

Poor conviction rate

The enforcement of the Food Safety Act is lax if the statistics provided by the Centre to a question raised by Villupuram Member of Parliament D. Ravikumar is any indication.

Statistics of the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare reveal that not even a single case of food adulteration was registered under FSSAI Act, 2006 in Puducherry. Similarly, not a single conviction has been secured during the period.

While the enforcement of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, primarily lies with the States and Union Territories, inadequate manpower for regulatory work and laboratory infrastructure has resulted in poor enforcement in Puducherry.

During 2018-19, 2,037 samples were analysed in Puducherry. Of them, 39 were found to be non-conforming. While penalties were imposed in just seven cases, not a single case was booked or conviction obtained. On the other hand, out of 5,730 samples tested in Tamil Nadu, 2,601 were found to be non-conforming. As many as 666 and 1,718 cases were booked under civil and criminal laws and of them 306 ended in conviction.

MP concerned

But what is surprising and perplexing is that when Tamil Nadu has registered 2,384 cases, the figure for Puducherry presents a dismal picture.

Mr. Ravikumar pointed out that while the department had been conducting routine inspections, not even a single case ended in conviction.

“This is very strange and not acceptable as several samples in Puducherry were found to be non-conforming. The authorities must wake up to the situation and ensure that Food Safety Act is implemented strictly in Puducherry,” he said.

“Hygienic environment should be ensured in places where food is cooked and sold to the public. In Puducherry, one can come across a number of eateries dotting the streets. There are places where open air cooking takes place, which will only repel the onlookers. Effective monitoring and inspection should be done as per the provisions of the Food Safety Act. There is no point in making a hue and cry without initiating any steps to nip the problem in the bud,” said S. Nadarajan, a senior citizen.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/54r0sa/article30837528.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17THUTMATTERS02,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/manpower-shortage-affecting-enforcement-of-food-safety-laws/article30837529.ece

372,2020/02/17,Shakespeare’s Richard III comes alive,"Play strikes resonance with a spectrum of issues ranging from national identity to political ambition

An adaptation of William Shakespeare’s Richard III, a searing scrutiny of the politics of power — personal and political — was staged at the 21st Bharat Rang Mahotsav parallel theatre festival being held at Adishakti, Auroville.

This was one of the two plays of the Bard of Avon to be brought to life at the theatre festival, the other being city-based group Indianostrum’s Chandala Impure based on Romeo And Juliet.

Richard III (Director: Guy Roberts), marking Shakespeare’s conclusion to his epic Wars of the Roses chronicles, was performed by the Prague Shakespeare Company, Czech Republic.

Deformed in body and spirit, it portrays a depraved madman’s obsession with becoming King of England. Does he fall? Of course, but not before taking down all of us on his wickedly entertaining ride.

Jealous and crippled, Richard of Gloucester murders his brothers, nephews, and any opposition to become King Richard III.

It is left to Henry of Richmond t raise an army, kill Richard in battle, and ascend the throne as King Henry VII.

The stellar cast included Jan Thomson, OBE, British Deputy High Commissioner to India.

The director sees the play as a story that plays out in front of us time and time again, and, if anything, has become even more relevant now, over 400 years after it was written, with corrupt leaders stopping at nothing to achieve and maintain power.

The play strikes resonance with a spectrum of issues ranging from national identity, political ambition, honour and duty.

The Prague Shakespeare Company is continental Europe’s only professional English-language Shakespeare company, employing artists from across Europe, Asia and North America, by bringing together a group of artists from many different cultural sensibilities.

Mr. Roberts, Founding Artistic Director of Prague Shakespeare Company (PSC), is a recipient of the 2018 Best Actor Houston Theatre Award for his performance of the poet in An Iliad. He has been awarded the TG Masaryk Medal of Honour from the Masaryk Democratic Movement in recognition for his work promoting arts and artistic freedom, and the inaugural Sidney Berger Award from the Shakespeare Theatre Association in recognition of his outstanding talent and dedication to the works of William Shakespeare.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/8yl7yy/article30837495.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17THSHAKESPEARE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/shakespeares-richard-iii-comes-alive/article30837496.ece
373,2020/02/17,Does your child use her phone to unwind during study breaks? Help her balance screen time,"Phones and laptops are an integral part of our children’s lives — whether they are preparing for an exam, or using them to unwind in between. How do we help them balance screen time?

On a study break, does your child hit the YouTube app? “Devices and the internet are not bad for you... in moderation,” says Ishwarya Kumar Ahmed, co-founder at Upturn Learning, a start-up straddling Bengaluru and Chennai that focusses on digital and real world connections, especially within the student community.

The UNICEF report, ‘State of the World’s Children 2017- Children in a Digital World’ has some key statistics: “Youth (ages 15-24) is the most connected age group. Worldwide, 71 per cent are online compared with 48 per cent of the total population. Children and adolescents under 18 account for an estimated one in three internet users around the world.”

Priya Venugopal, the Technology Integrator at the American International School Chennai, combines the use of technology in the classroom. She says, “A lot of children watch YouTube videos to learn by themselves. Students use apps like Byju’s, Khan Academy and so on for conceptual practice.” On the other hand, research has shown that notifications on electronic devices can stimulate the release of dopamine, a brain chemical involved in cravings and desire, which can be addictive.

With help from Venugopal, the Upturn team, and Raji Nagarajan, behavioural counsellor, Chennai, we have put together a simple plan to streamline study habits in the age of screens.

Keep the gadgets out

Students cooped up in a room with multiple devices are more likely to be distracted, even tempted to take a quick break and check social media accounts.

Trust your kid

Involve your child in setting rules and boundaries. Students, especially teenagers, can be partners in designing a framework for study routines and expectations. Nagarajan says, “We have to start the conversation as early as seven or eight years, before we give children access to their devices. They need to understand how to handle the information overload. Self-regulation, regulating emotions and delayed gratification are also very important.” Venugopal adds, “I encourage parents to create screen-time contracts, where they both decide on how much screen time is allowed for entertainment.”

Define a good break

“Cognition requires attention, and any distracting stimuli negatively impacts study,” says Nagarajan, “If a break involves physically playing a board game or going out, then the student can come back and refocus. With a social media break, the child comes back to study but cannot refocus and concentrate, because the mind drifts back to what they just saw, liked, or shared.”

The 20, 20, 20 rule

According to the American Optometric Association, it is ideal for a person to take a 20-second break, every 20 minutes, to look 20 feet away, in order to reduce digital eye strain.

The 5-4-3-2-1 rule

Formulated by Upturn co-founders Ishwarya and Sudhalini Devadason, this rule helps limit interaction with devices.

Be less scattered

Having multiple tabs open can be distracting, and it helps to be on topic, by using a select, few verified resources. Try sticking to five or less tabs.

Keep moving

Physical movement within the house at regular intervals is important. Get your child to walk about, especially to a space with plants, or interact with family or pets.

Limit your tech time

Changing settings on the device is a relatively simple hack to limit the time spent on apps. You can mute notifications, use time limit reminders (like on Instagram), or use Wind Down mode on certain Android phones, to reduce distraction while sleeping.

Do it together

If a friend group or family members decide to go off social media for a fortnight, that reduces FOMO (fear of missing out).",children,https://www.thehindu.com/children/m3uh63/article30842567.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17MPHealth1,https://www.thehindu.com/children/help-children-balance-screen-time-and-study-breaks/article30842569.ece

377,2020/02/17,Demonstrators ordered to remove tents,"Groups resolve to defy police diktat

The City police on Sunday issued an ultimatum to the demonstrators outside the Secretariat to remove their protest tents within two days.

Notices were served to those who have been sitting in protest in solidarity with the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) demonstration in Shaheen Bagh and the stir seeking justice for the two girls who allegedly committed suicide in Walayar under suspicious circumstances. The groups have resolved to defy the police diktat and continue their protests.

Increasing support

The Thiruvananthapuram Shaheen Bagh protest, which completed 14 days on Sunday, has witnessed increasing support with several political leaders, including Communist Party of India State secretary Kanam Rajendran, Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala, Congress working committee member Oommen Chandy, etc. backing the demonstration.

The protest by the Justice for Walayar Kids Forum has completed 22 days.

In its notice, the Cantonment police said the protest tents posed a security threat in the high-security zone as it apparently blocked the view of the Secretariat. The tents obstructed the paths of pedestrians and motorists. The police also claimed that permission for erecting tents in the area were normally provided for not more than two days.

378,2020/02/17,State government to fast-track outer-ring road project,"Key component of Capital Region Development Project

Faced with mounting pressure over the alleged neglect meted out to the State capital in the Budget, the government is toying with various ideas to expedite the development of the proposed outer-ring road, a key component of the ambitious Capital Region Development Project (CRDP).

With the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) approving the ₹8,136-crore project, the onus is on the State government to undertake the acquisition of the required land.

In order to circumvent the limitations posed by the prevailing fiscal crisis, the possibilities of either issuing land bonds or introducing a land pool scheme are being actively pursued. Realising any one or both of the options would enable the government to fast-track land acquisition without creating an additional burden of roughly ₹3,000 crore, the estimated cost of the purpose, on the State exchequer, official sources said.

Planned as part of the second phase of the CRDP, the 79-km outer ring road from Vizhinjam to Navaikulam will require nearly 1,500 acres of acquired land. .

Fixed interest rate

For this, land bonds could be issued to owners in return for the land ceded for the project.

The financial instrument, which will carry a fixed rate of interest, will enable long-term repayments. Besides, those in need of cash immediately will be able to find prospective buyers in the bond market that has been witnessing increasing popularity in the country. “If all goes to plan, Kerala will become the first State to issue land bonds for infrastructure development projects,” the official said.

Another option is the introduction of a land-pooling scheme, similar to the one that has been successfully implemented in various parts of the country.

While the government will not be required to pay land acquisition costs, the landowners stand to benefit from the increased land value from parcels of unused land that are transferred back to them in proportion to their original property.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/state-govt-to-fast-track-outer-ring-road-project/article30837561.ece
379,2020/02/17,‘Waste-to-energy plants not necessary’,"Expert says Kerala has already so much in place in decentralised waste management

Even as the State government is moving ahead with its plans to set up waste-to-energy (WTE) plants in various districts, waste management experts say that the history of the operation of such plants in the country prove that they will turn into white elephants sooner than later.

Swati Singh Sambyal, solid waste management expert, who is in the city as part of the three-day National Conference of Cities for Zero Waste being organised by the city Corporation, has found waste-to-energy plants to be ineffective in finding a lasting solution to the problem of waste.

Calorific value

“The waste-to-energy plants, dependent on incineration-incentive technology, requires high-calorific-value waste as feed. But the energy produced from this is priced high at ₹7-₹8 per Kilowatt, compared to ₹3-₹4 through other sources. The plants will not run properly if the waste is not of high calorific value of 2,100 kcal per kg and above. Most of our waste being biodegradable the calorific value is low, around 1,400 to 1,800 Kcal per kg. For Kerala, it is a big ‘no’ because you are already segregating the biodegradable waste, treating it at home or community composting centres. Then, what will you burn is the big question,” says Ms. Sambyal, who had formerly worked with the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE).

According to her, the country’s first such plant was set up at Timarpur in Delhi in 1987. It had to be shut down owing to the low quality of waste supplied.

Till now, 14 more waste-to-energy plants have been opened across the country, out of which seven have already been closed down.

“Currently, they are running in Delhi, Jabalpur, and Shimla. Though the Jabalpur one was touted to be a state-of-the-art plant, it asked for waste from towns located in the 250-km radius because the waste that the city had was not enough for the plant’s capacity. Most of these companies take in all the waste without segregation. We are making these giants that are eating up waste that could be converted into more useful products, with more communities benefiting from it. The ash that is generated is another problem, as it will have to be disposed of in a hazardous landfill site,” she says.

State policy

She says that Kerala has already so much in place in decentralised waste management, and has the opportunity to become a zero-waste State.

“I don’t think in any other State so much work has been done at the policy level and on the ground. At no cost should it let WTE be the foundation for waste management. The foundation has been laid in decentralised waste management. You have built and cemented everything. Now, only the painting needs to be done and now you seem to be saying ‘let’s construct another building’. It makes no sense at a time when the decentralised model from Kerala is being replicated in towns such as Muzaffarpur and Balaghat,” says Ms. Sambyal.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/waste-to-energy-plants-not-necessary/article30837547.ece

383,2020/02/17,BBC takes football pundit Craig Ramage off air after racist comment,"The BBC has dropped a football pundit from broadcasts after he made a racist comment about players at second-tier club Derby.

Craig Ramage, a former Derby midfielder, singled out players he called the “young black lads” for criticism following Saturday’s 1-1 draw with Huddersfield on a BBC Radio Derby podcast.

“Craig Ramage made unacceptable comments in a podcast yesterday, which have been removed,” the BBC tweeted from its Derby sport account on Sunday. “We are thoroughly investigating. Craig will not be on air while we look into this matter. Derby said it stands shoulder, together as one with all our players,” and Ramage later issued an apology.

“What I said was wholly inappropriate and unintentional,” he said. “Race is irrelevant to the issues that I was discussing and I deeply regret what I said. I sincerely hope that the players accept my apology.”

Derby defender Max Lowe had highlighted Ramage’s comments in an Instagram post, saying it is unacceptable for players to be judged by the colour of our skin.

“As a young black footballer making my way in the game, I was shocked,” Lowe, who was an unused substitute against Huddersfield, wrote on Instagram.

“With the support from people I have around me — and after reading today that (England and Manchester City player) Raheem Sterling is to spearhead an anti-racism and anti-discrimination taskforce on behalf of players from all backgrounds — I have decided to speak out on behalf of black footballers at Derby County.

He was shown a yellow card for the reaction and after the abuse continued he tried to leave the pitch, pointing his thumbs down to the crowd, but was restrained by his team mates for a number of minutes.

Porto coach Sergio Conceicao was eventually forced to substitute Marega in the 72nd minute.

“We are completely indignant,” Conceicao told reporters. “They insulted Marega since the warm up. We are all a family here, regardless of our nationality, skin colour, height or the colour of our hair and we all deserve respect. What happened here is outrageous. I know the fans here are very passionate about their club and many fans are not represented by some of the people who were in the crowd today.”

Marega later posted a message on Instagram calling the supporters who targeted him as “idiots” and also criticising match referee Luis Godinho.

“I'd also like to show my thanks to the referee who did not defend me and who gave me a yellow card for defending the colour of my skin. I hope I never meet you on a football pitch ever again. You are a disgrace,” he added.

The league's organising body Liga Portugal condemned the chants.

“Liga Portugal does not agree and never will with acts of racism, xenophobia or intolerance that jeopardize the dignity of footballers or any human beings,” said a statement on the organisation's website. “Liga Portugal will do everything to ensure that this episode and all other racist incidents do not go unpunished. We believe this is a fight where your team's colours do not matter and everyone must come together to eradicate this scourge on the game.”

Porto's director of communications Francisco Marques added on his own Twitter account: “Marega was fed up and left the pitch and Porto was forced to make a substitution due to racism.”

Portuguese newspaper A Bola reported that no Porto players spoke to the media after the game in solidarity with Marega.

Vitoria coach Ivo Vieira said he did not want to comment on the incident as he was not certain what had happened.

“I prefer not to speak about a situation without being aware of all the facts. But if the player was provoked, then he should not have been,” he said.

385,2020/02/17,La Liga | Leaders Real Madrid held to draw by late Celta strike,"Celta took an early lead through Russian striker Fedor Smolov and Real struggled to respond, leading to the home fans booing their players off the pitch when the halftime whistle was blown.

Real Madrid's La Liga title bid took a dent after Zinedine Zidane's leaders were held to a 2-2 draw at home to Celta Vigo on Sunday, denied all three points by a late strike from Santi Mina.

Mina latched on to a classy through ball from former Barcelona midfielder Denis Suarez and produced a clinical low finish to equalise in the 85th minute, trimming Real's lead over Barcelona to one point.

Celta took an early lead through Russian striker Fedor Smolov and Real struggled to respond, leading to the home fans booing their players off the pitch when the halftime whistle was blown.

But the league leaders came out stronger after the break and Toni Kroos levelled in the 52nd minute, shortly after Real captain Sergio Ramos had a goal ruled out for offside.

Ramos then scored from the penalty spot to put Zidane's side in front in the 65th minute after Eden Hazard, making his first outing in almost three months after recovering from an ankle injury, was tripped by Celta keeper Ruben Blanco.

“Dropping two points at home hurts me a lot,” Zidane told reporters.

“Celta are a good team that don't deserve to be near the bottom of the league but it's painful to lose the two points after we made such a big effort.”

Real forward Gareth Bale meanwhile avoided a possible red card for a wild tackle on Celta's Rafinha, escaping with only a booking.

The draw ended a five-game winning streak in the league for the leaders and left them on 53 points after 24 games, one ahead of second-placed Barcelona who beat Getafe 2-1 at home on Saturday.

Celta, who had lost on their last seven league visits to the Santiago Bernabeu, climbed out of the relegation zone into 17th place in the standings.

“I'm happy with my performance, not so happy with the draw but I think we can do better in our next game,” said Hazard.

“When you are winning 2-1 you should win the game. They are good players but they came here just to defend, they had only two chances and scored two goals.”",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/sswqtw/article30839213.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/REALKB,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/la-liga-leaders-real-madrid-held-to-draw-by-late-celta-strike/article30839214.ece
386,2020/02/17,Premier League | Lacazette ends goal drought as Arsenal crush Newcastle 4-0,"The defeat ended an eight-game unbeaten run for Newcastle.

Substitute Alexandre Lacazette ended his goal drought as Arsenal secured their first Premier League win since New Year's Day with a 4-0 victory over Newcastle United at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday.

Lacazette had gone nine games in all competitions without a goal before he found the target with a mis-hit shot in the final moments of the game.

After a goalless first half, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang put the Gunners in front with a powerful header from a Nicolas Pepe cross.

Pepe himself added the second, from close range after good work from Bukayo Saka, and Mesut Ozil got his first of the season with a tap-in.

Lacazette, left on the bench with youngster Eddie Nketiah, finished off a smart move for Mikel Arteta's side, who recorded just their second win since the Spaniard took over at the club.

388,2020/02/17,Imagining new futures: Shweta Taneja’s sci-fi story nominated for Grand Prix de l’Imaginaire Awards,"Shweta Taneja is thrilled her short story set in a post-apocalyptic India has been nominated for a French literary award

Shweta Taneja is back in Bengaluru for good. “After having travelled the world these past two years, I am back in Bangalore, finally settled in north Bangalore, again,” the science fiction and fantasy (SFF) writer says. “Though the city is trembling through a developing phase, I feel it is a wonderful place for writers to grow. There is just the right mix of attitude, creative exposure and people in the creative and scientific fields, for me to continue being inspired.”

And there is a wonderful homecoming gift for Shweta. Her short story, The Daughter That Bleeds (translated into French as La Fille Qui Saigne by Mikael Cabon) has been shortlisted for the Grand Prix de l’Imaginaire Awards of 2020, a French literary award for science fiction and fantasy.

Shweta says, “I wrote it between the Anantya Tantrist (a fantasy trilogy featuring a tantric detective) books, submitted it to a couple of places in 2017, got rejections and forgot about it. Then when the editor of an anthology asked me for a story, I remembered that I had written this one and submitted it. It was finally published in English in The Best Asian Speculative Fiction in 2018 and received the Editor's Choice Award.”

Shweta says in 2019, the story was translated into French and published by Galaxies SF, a science fiction magazine in France which publishes short stories and articles in French, all related to speculative fiction. “I met the editor, Pierre Gevart, at Eurocon, a SFF festival where I gave a talk on Asian Science fiction and fantasy. The story was also published in Dutch and Romanian science fiction magazines last year.”

Electric underground Anantya Tantrist, is a feisty foul-mouthed occult detective solving crimes in a Delhi where all manner of fantastic creatures co-exist with regular people. As of now there are three Anantya Tantrist novels — The Cult of Chaos (2015), The Matsya Curse (2017) and The Rakta Queen (2018)

Galaxies sent the story to the national committee for The Grand Prix de l’Imaginaire Awards. “It was a jury that read all the short stories in translation released in France in 2019 and selected mine as one of the finalists. I am still amazed at the nomination. I found out when I received a congratulatory email from Gevart.”

Admitting to enjoying writing speculative fiction, Shweta says, “It is such a wonderful genre to look at alternatives in societies, imagine new futures, or even mirror on the present. I have already written shorts for two anthologies this year and plan to write a few more. The Daughter That Bleeds will be republished in a new anthology this year on South Asian women’s voices on violence against women which have works from people like Deepti Naval, Kamala Das, and Aruna Chakravarti.” The Daughter That Bleeds tells of a post-apocalyptic India where very few women can menstruate and so have children. “In the world, girls who bleed are valued both socially and economically and sold in special markets to the highest bidder. It was while researching menstruation for the third Anantya Tantrist’s novel, The Rakta Queen, that the idea germinated in my head. I wondered what would happen in a patriarchal society where women-who-bled are rare. Since I love exploring issues through humour, the story had to be laugh-out-loud. I am happy to see that is how it turned out to be.”

On women’s reproductive health in speculative fiction, Shweta says, “Speculative fiction is about exploring future alternatives and how new technology, new possibilities change the fabric of our society and how we perceive gender. That is the reason that SF writers have, and continue to explore societal, cultural, biological consequences of new reproduction technologies. The explorations could range from new roles for women around reproduction as in Margaret Atwood’s work, inter-species reproduction as in the works of Octavia E Butler, or even gender fluidity and politics around it as we see in Ursula Le Guin's novels.”

Shweta does not, however, feel women’s reproductive health has become a trope. “Most SF writing keeps to newer, more streamlined spaceships and weaponry systems, continuing colonial-era desires in space.”",authors,https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/idebqa/article30843108.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Shweta4jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/imagining-new-futures-shweta-tanejas-sci-fi-story-nominated-for-grand-prix-de-limaginaire-awards/article30843109.ece
389,2020/02/17,"Perumal Murugan’s ‘Amma’ is woven with memories, love and tears","The author speaks about his latest book ‘Amma’ on his recent visit to the city

She took him by the hand and they trudged their way through a journey called life. She squeezed his tiny fingers in a way that promised him hope and reassurance. That her presence and warmth would last for eternity, until that fateful day she left him to survive on his own. She, was a mother in Perumal Murugan’s case.

The author’s latest book, Amma, is not just a memoir of his mother, Perumaayi, but a labyrinth of memories that any child would relate to. “I remember the time when amma used to walk with me. I somehow liked holding her hands. That visual is still fresh in me,” says Perumal Murugan, recounting an imagery that would form the basis of writing Amma, his first non-fiction book in English, translated by Nandini Murali and Kavitha Muralidharan.

Memories of mother

Perumaayi passed away in 2012 of Parkinson’s. That day, Murugan could only trade words for tears. He wrote two essays mourning the loss of a companion who was more than just a mother. “I thought I should write something when she died. At least, that was my initial reaction,” he says, adding that the idea to develop it into a full-fledged book was an afterthought that came from ‘Kalachuvadu’ Kannan, his publisher in Tamil. Murugan would “subconsciously” impart anecdotal references about his mother in his speeches at literary festivals, that further convinced him to write this book. But soon, he was clouded with self-doubt on determining the structure — whether to make it biographical or not. “I don’t have details to support amma’s history starting from her date of birth. That’s when I decided to make it into a collection of essays,” he says, “I thought I should capture the amma who lives in my memories. That’s the amma I wanted to present to the world.”

Writing that births out of nostalgia is both a blessing and a curse. While it certainly allows you to revisit and relive memories, it also has the power to make one feel remorseful. Murugan says he did reconsider certain episodes that he could have handled with more clarity. “That’s basic human nature, right? Even though we looked after her during her last days, there’s this lingering feeling that we could have done better.”

Perumaayi is a recurrent character name in his novels. “It’s a common name in our village for people born in the month of Purattasi. Men are usually named Perumal, also my father’s name, and women are named Perumaayi. So, I have a bit of both of them in me,” he says. But the book documents very little about his father, with whom he shared a cold relationship — something he wrote in detail in Nizhal Mutrattu Ninaivugal. “Our personalities never matched; he was impulsive and I was quite reserved,” he says, about the equation they shared since childhood, “Which is why he used to mock me for my personality.”

All said and done, Murugan says he had a joyful childhood with memories of amma, goats, cows and village life — like the world his characters inhabit.

Into a writer’s world

“The weight of memory was harder than the might of my pen,” remarks Murugan. He cites a particular chapter in Amma that left him filled with rage and remorse in equal measure. It is where he talks about the time Perumaayi was robbed of the colours of life, when she became a widow. “I felt really bad for her even while writing it. Had I been aware of the politics of wearing a white sari back then, I would have made some effort to avoid the practise,” he says.

Words to films Perumal Murugan has received offers for the movie adaptation of Madhurobhagan, the infamous novel for which he announced a literary suicide. But nothing concrete has developed so far. One of his short stories has now been made into a feature film. He has written the dialogues for the movie.

How much of Murugan is left in the books translated in English? “Readers have received the English novels the same way as Tamil. This goes on to explain that I’ve breached the language barrier,” he says with a laugh.

But the heartwarming aspect of the book — divided into 22 chapters or rather essays — lies in the fact that the foreword is written by Murugan’s wife, Ezhilarasi. It did take a while for Perumaayi to approve of his wife, given theirs was an inter-caste marriage. “But amma accepted her for who she is,” he says, adding that his mother and wife shared a healthy relationship, which he considers a rarity. He had reservations about the reception Amma would get, as opposed to his other novels given the deeply personal nature of the memoir. The response, however, has been heartening for him. “I managed to bring them [readers] into my world. They, especially girls, are able to relate to it because it’s a story about a mother,” he adds.

Murugan never read out his writing to his mother. That was taken care of either by his wife or daughters. “Of all people, amma knew on whom the characters or events were based. Sometimes she would even guess the womb of my story,” he laughs, “Whatever little she heard of my writing, she only said nice things.”

Perumaayi, as Ezhilarasi says in the book, continues to be an invisible companion in his life.

390,2020/02/17,Stories of love and loss,"Shehr-e-ishq is a nostalgic trip to the times of eternal love stories

When was the last time you heard a love story of royals that touched your hearts? Listen to the story of a prince to understand why he was considered a celebrated lover and ‘dilon ka shehzaada’ (prince of hearts), or the reasons why a charming lawyer and his British wife made Hyderabad their home, only to leave it after a slander. This February, Shehr-e-ishq (meaning ‘City of love’), an event organised by Hyderabad Trails brings a gamut of stories dealing with love and loss. Fittingly, these events are at heritage venues, for just the right ambience.

In its third edition, the magical stories are narrated over three weekends. When the annual festival first started two Februarys ago, the team realised the existence of many love stories that are neither popular nor celebrated. “We started in February and it sort of coincided with Valentine’s Day and what better way than to remember these historic love stories,” says AB Gopalakrishna of Hyderabad Trails. The iconic Irrum Manzil is a place to know about nawabs in love, Sardar Mahal near Charminar transforms into a significant zone to unearth the secrets of ‘Once Upon a Time’ in Hyderabad. The reasons for choosing iconic places as venues are many and one of them is its natural setting. “Imagine a beautiful sunset and soaking in lawns around Quli Qutb Shah Tombs or its staircase and listening to a kahaani of Quli; He was considered the prince of hearts because he was an accomplished poet, celebrated lover, father of Hyderabad who set the city’s culture with a ganga jamuna tehzeeb,” he says adding the staircase of Qutb Shahi Tombs forms a natural amphitheatre.

The curtain raiser this weekend gives space for poetry and Gopalakrishna observes how members understand its relevance. He says, “Poetry transcends time, just like these stories also do; What happened back then, especially the love story of Quli Qutb Shah, has a lot of relevance today. He was a sultan patronising local culture, married a Hindu woman, respected religious differences and these qualities are respected. Getting youngsters interested in these events is not an issue any more.” While team had invited experts like city historian Sajjad Shahid and Anuradha Reddy, convenor of Intach to share stories in the past, this year most of the stories are shared by Gopalakrishna.

For Pratik Reddy, a law student, these stories evoke nostalgia. He feels such sessions bring about a different side of the royalty. “Held during a Valentine’s week, this idea to dig out eternal love stories and introduce us to this side of personality is unique. We read about them in books but it is amusing to know that royals too did things which commoners do.”

Another segment, titled The ‘188 Love Stories and scandals’, to be held at Chowmahalla Palace is based on a book An Appeal to the Ladies of Hyderabad: Scandal in the Raj by Benjamin B Cohen. Gopalakrishna chanced upon the book online and says, “The book talks about a lawyer Mehdi Hasan who came to Hyderabad from Lucknow in 1888. Because of his British wife Ellen Donnelly, he was invited to parties and gatherings. He was a charming person too and eventually became a minister in the court.” The couple faced envy and a scandal in the form of pamphlets. “Nearly 2000 pamphlets were circulated with an appeal to the ladies of Hyderabad that the wife (Ellen) is a prostitute and this guy (Mehdi) has been using her to rise to prominent positions. Mehdi tries to identify the people behind this slander but could only know about the printing press where these pamphlets were printed. The disheartened couple eventually left Hyderabad.”

Sessions on Abul Hasan Taneshah and Aurangzeb bring out their characteristics and their own stories of love. “Taneshah was in love with Taramati. Aurangzeb too fell in love with courtesans in his youth, but the story of his lost love led him to become the kind of person he eventually was. We share the epic battle, grand story and the characters involved while also sharing the background love of these two people.”",life & style,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/b1srzh/article30840779.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYM14QULI,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/stories-of-love-and-loss/article30840781.ece
391,2020/02/17,"India’s birds suffering dramatic population declines, warns scientific report","Growing threat from loss of habitat, widespread presence of toxins, hunting and trapping, it says

Over a fifth of India’s bird diversity, ranging from the Short-toed Snake Eagle to the Sirkeer Malkoha, has suffered strong long-term declines over a 25-year period, while more recent annual trends point to a drastic 80% loss among several common birds, a new scientific report jointly released by 10 organisations said on Monday.

Also read | Man vs. Wild: The battle for survival on Kerala's forest fringes

The State of India’s Birds 2020 (SoIB) assessment raises the alarm that several spectacular birds, many of them endemic to the sub-continent, face a growing threat from loss of habitat due to human activity, widespread presence of toxins including pesticides, hunting and trapping for the pet trade. Diminishing population sizes of many birds because of one factor brings them closer to extinction because of the accelerated effects of others, the report warned. For every bird species that was found to be increasing in numbers over the long term, 11 have suffered losses, some catastrophically.

Of 101 species categorised as being of High Conservation Concern — 59 based on range and abundance and the rest included from high-risk birds on the IUCN Red List — endemics such as the Rufous-fronted Prinia, Nilgiri Thrush, Nilgiri Pipit and Indian vulture were confirmed as suffering current decline, and all except 13 had a restricted or highly restricted range, indicating greater vulnerability to man-made threats.

Rare urban sparrows

Among widely known species, the common sparrow, long seen as declining in urban spaces, has a stable population overall, although the data from major cities such as Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Chennai confirm the view that they have become rare in cities and urban areas. Among the possible reasons for this is a decrease in insect populations as well as nesting places, but there is no conclusive evidence in the scientific literature on radiation from mobile phone towers playing a part.

Peafowl, on the other hand, are rising in numbers, expanding their range into places such as Kerala, which is drying overall, and areas in the Thar desert where canals and irrigation have been introduced. Stricter protection for peacocks under law also could be at work.

One of India’s major conservation concerns, the Great Indian Bustard (GIB), is being brought back from the brink. Having lost about 90% of its population and range over a five-decade period, a viable population of GIB at Jaisalmer in Rajasthan is the focus of programmes run by the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS), Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Birdlife International and other agencies, to eliminate the threat of fatal collisions with power lines.

The SoIB was produced using a base of 867 species (among 1,333 birds ever recorded in India), and analysed with the help of data uploaded by birdwatchers to the online platform, eBird. Adequate data on how birds fared over a period of over 25 years (long-term trend) are available only for 261 species. Current annual trends are calculated over a five-year period.

Raptors fall

Looking at the health of avifauna based on scientific groupings such as raptors (birds of prey), habitat, diet, migratory status and endemicity (exclusively found in an area), the analysis concludes that raptors overall are in decline, with ‘open country’ species such as the Pallid and Montagu Harriers, White-bellied Sea Eagle and Red-necked Falcon suffering the most. The severe long-term decline of vultures, recorded and analysed for years now, is underscored by the report.

Migratory shorebirds, along with gulls and terns, seem to have declined the most among waterbirds, the report states, consistent with population trends among Arctic-breeding shorebirds based on independent assessments. Within India, the losses suffered by resident waterbirds, particularly in the past five years, calls for detailed investigation, it adds.

From a dietary viewpoint, meat-eater populations have fallen by half, and birds that depend on insects exclusively have also suffered over the long term. But there has been some stabilisation for omnivores, seed and fruit eaters in recent years. Habitat impacts have decimated ‘specialist’ birds, which need specific environmental conditions to survive, particularly those dependent on forests. This is followed by declines in numbers of grassland, scrubland and wetland species, the researchers said, calling for urgent investigation into the causes.

On the national effort that went into the assessment, M.D. Madhusudan, co-founder of Nature Conservation Foundation (NCF), a partner organisation, said, “No single institution or agency on its own could have put together a report of this scope and size. The SoIB became a real possibility only because it is built on a large-scale collaborative effort between thousands of citizen birders and a consortium of researchers across multiple institutions.”

Habitats need help

Forward-looking actions suggested by the report include an update to the Red List of endangered species published by IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) using the SoIB, collaborative research by scientists and citizens aided by policy with special emphasis on removing gaps in data, and urgent emphasis on habitats of species of high concern, notably grasslands, scrublands, wetlands and the Western Ghats.

Noting that the report was a first step, and an assessment of trends rather than causes, Suhel Quader, Scientist, NCF, and member of the SoIB team, said, “Habitat loss and fragmentation are known causes of species declines in general, but targeted research is needed to pinpoint causes of decline.”

The SoIB, which can be accessed at www.stateofindiasbirds.in, was produced in a partnership that included ATREE, BNHS, Foundation for Ecological Security, NCF, National Biodiversity Authority of India, National Centre for Biological Sciences, SACON (Salim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History), Wetlands International, WII and WWF.",environment,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/rtpe5b/article30840855.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/6702HI-W05023RG9U5FIQFA3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/indias-birds-suffering-dramatic-population-declines-warns-scientific-report/article30840893.ece
392,2020/02/17,Chicken-killing monkeys in Assam trigger rethink on leopards,"Beset by ‘unmanageable monkeys’, some parts of rural eastern Assam are turning to the spotted cats.

Some parts of rural eastern Assam are becoming more lenient towards the leopard. One of the reasons is “unmanageable” troops of monkeys that even kill chicken for food.

About six years ago, people of Negheriting in Golaghat district had blocked an arterial National Highway to force the authorities into taking steps to check the population of rhesus macaques that raid their grain stores and kitchens. Negheriting is about 80 km east of Kaziranga National Park.

“We went into the issue and found the monkeys were desperate enough to target hen coops and rip the chickens apart to eat the grain the fowl store in the sac-like crop before digesting,” said Mubina Akhtar of NGO Kaziranga Wildlife Society.

A deeper study revealed the macaque “population explosion” was correlated to the dwindling population of leopards as well as the transformation in the landscape. This was because of small tea gardens and commercial crops replacing the sugarcane fields and traditional kathoni — small jungle-like backyard patches of fruit trees— where leopards thrived. “Both macaques and leopards are highly adaptive and live close to humans. The kathonis in particular sustained monkeys in the past, not requiring them to raid homes, while leopards preyed on the monkeys,” Ms. Akhtar said.

Wildlife officials said about 15 years ago, there were about 12,000 leopards in Assam, they said. The figure is likely to be less than 5,000 now. Qamar Qureshi of the Dehradun-based Wildlife Institute of India said it would be difficult to ascertain if monkeys killing chicken was a new phenomenon. He was in a team that had last year surveyed leopards, whose findings would be released in March.

“There is a correlation between monkeys and leopards although the changing landscape and availability of garbage and wasted food have been major factors in the increase in monkey population,” Qamar Qureshi of the Dehradun-based Wildlife Institute of India told The Hindu.

“Macaques such as the rhesus, Assamese and bonnet are omnivorous, not strictly vegetarian like some other monkeys. But they might not kill chickens for their flesh,” Mr. Qureshi added.

But some villagers, hitherto antagonistic toward leopards, have been learning the hard way to understand them through the monkeys, Ms. Akhtar said.

“Six-seven leopards used to be killed in Noragaon in Golaghat. People now let the leopards be or have them captured and released in the wild,” Ms. Akhtar said.

A degree of awareness about compensation schemes has also led to a mindset-change, officials said. Some villagers, with monkeys in mind, now do not mind leopards preying on livestock.",environment,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/2bgi2p/article30837446.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Honey-Monkey,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/chicken-killing-monkeys-in-assam-trigger-rethink-on-leopards/article30837447.ece
393,2020/02/17,‘I am preparing for my exams and feel fatigued with pain in the shoulder. What should I do?’,"Dr Kannan Pugazhendi answers readers’ queries on physical fitness

My children, in Class X and XII are under stress because of the board exams. What is the best form of exercise for them to take a break from studies?

It is ideal to go out and play a game. If they already play a sport, let them continue with that. Avoid starting a new sport now, because that will cause additional pressure. The exercise they choose should not take them back to their studies even in thought, and should keep them in the moment, concentrating on a ball or shuttle, for example. The aim is to have a change in the audio-visual input (so avoid exercise videos on screens) which can then help the nervous system switch from sympathetic (fight or flight stress) to the parasympathetic (rest and recovery). Sport helps build more neural connections, which will only contribute to children being better able to focus on studies.

I am a student preparing for my medical entrance examination. I feel very fatigued with pain in the shoulder, neck and legs. What could the reason be?

You need to breathe optimally for proper oxygen supply. This can be changed with exercise, so that you get energy. Take breaks and do some stretches once an hour or so. Have a warm bath before you begin studying, and you’ll feel better.

I am a 16-year-old boy, 166 cm. My father is as tall as I am. Will using hanging bars for two minutes daily help increase my height, at least by three inches?

As a boy, you will grow for another three to five years. However, if you’re very particular to find out, you can request a doctor for an X-ray of the knee, to measure if the growth plates are ossified (after which there will be no growth). Girls often stop physical growth at about 16 years. However, hanging on bars alone will not help. Get daily exercise by playing a sport, eat a healthy diet, avoid junk food, and you will grow well.

394,2020/02/17,Understanding cancer surgery,"A breast cancer survivor, in conversation with a surgical oncologist, helps decode a part of the treatment

Cancer is more feared and less understood. What still resonates in my ears are the words of my doctor: “Not early but treatable,” as he went through the report of stage three carcinoma in the left breast. The prognosis could have been much better had I acted on the warning signs and consulted an oncologist in time. I had felt a lump appear and disappear, redden and lighten and my resistance to fight simple ailments greatly reduced. I had thought it was menopause setting in, that it was just a temporary change, a tiredness due to multi-tasking, always in a state of denial.

She is currently a Senior Consultant, Head and Neck Cancer, at one of the Capital’s Fortis Hospitals. She helps us better understand the surgical aspects of cancer treatment.

Why is surgery the basic of cancer treatment?

Surgery to a great extent remains as a mainstay of treatment for most solid cancers. Patient and tumour factors — the site and type of lesion and the stage of disease — have a significant bearing on the final decision-making for treatment of these cancers. Surgery guarantees complete removal of the local disease.

However, advanced tumours will require additional treatment with radiation, with or without the combination of chemotherapy, to prevent a relapse. Surgery is considered the primary course of cancer treatment when the disease is localised, and also when the biology of the tumour does not portend a distant spread. There are also cancers which are neither radio-sensitive nor chemo-sensitive; these tumours will again warrant surgical resection.

What is debulking?

The word ‘debulking surgery’ suggests removal of tumour volume as much as possible. If the surgical extermination is performed with curative intent, it is called cytoreductive surgery. These types of surgery are performed for certain brain tumours and ovarian cancers, to alleviate the patient’s symptoms, such as a decompression in the central nervous system and to make chemotherapy more efficacious in ovarian carcinomas. Sometimes debulking surgeries are performed as palliation, to relieve airway obstruction or to facilitate swallowing, thereby providing a better quality of survival time.

How is a surgical oncologist different from a surgeon?

Cancer surgeries should be performed by specialists trained in various specialities of surgical oncology. Cancers originating from different anatomical regions behave differently, and to understand the finer nuances, one needs dedicated training. Surgeries done by a general surgeon and a trained oncosurgeon may appear the same on the surface, but the eventual oncological outcome which shows up with time may be different to a great extent.

A lot of tests are prescribed before a surgery. Why?

A cancer patient is subjected to a large battery of investigations targeted at identifying different facts pertaining to the disease. Step one begins with a biopsy or FNAC for diagnosing cancer and its subtype. Following diagnosis, radiological investigations are asked for, to stage the disease (to understand its extent). Then a set of haematological investigations are performed to look into the functional status of the various organs to confirm fitness for the cancer treatment. Various tumour markers done during the course of examination also throw light on the tumour burden. At times, these investigations are able to pick up other coexisting diseases.

What are the next steps after a cancer surgery?

Following surgical resection (removing the cancerous part), a biopsy of the resected specimen is read in detail. This helps the clinician to assess the need for further adjuvant treatments and also offer the person a prognosis.

What do cancer stages and grades mean?

Most cancers have four stages. Patients often interpret stage four as the end of the journey, though it is not so. Stage three and stage four are considered advanced states, warranting intensification of therapy. Grading of cancer reflects their extent of differentiation. They can be high-grade cancers which behave aggressively and give a shorter survival period to patients, or they could be intermediate or low-grade; the latter have a better prognosis.

What are the general risks of a cancer surgery?

The general risks for cancer surgeries are the same as with other surgeries: haemorrhages, wound infection and others. Wound healing issues are exacerbated on account of poor nutrition, the side-effects of chemotherapy and radiation.

Head and neck cancer treatment often has issues pertaining to disfigurement, impairment of speech and swallowing. Lymphoedema (swelling) of the arm is common in breast cancer surgery. Abdominal surgeries can be fraught with anastomotic leaks (a leak where two sections are joined), while gynaecological/urological surgical treatments are associated with urinary complications or lymphorrhea (an abnormal flow of lymph).

How does a breast oncologist decide if it is a lumpectomy or a mastectomy that needs to be performed?

Breast cancers are treated either with a breast conservation surgery (lumpectomy with oncoplasty) or a modified radical mastectomy. The decision-making regarding the type of surgery is influenced by size and multi-focality (spread) of the tumour. Small breast tumours are amenable to conservation. Large tumours and multi-focal lesions on the other hand will warrant a modified radical surgery.

Who are the different kinds of specialist surgical oncologists?

Human anatomy is quite complex and intriguing. Cancers originating from the different parts are biologically very different and require a deep understanding to maximize the treatment results. Head and neck, breast, thoracic, gastrointestinal tract, urology, gynaecology and sarcoma to name a few.

What is head and neck cancer?

Head and neck cancers are malignant lesions originating from sites above the clavicular bone. Excluding the brain and the eye, the rest of the anatomical areas fall in this domain viz: oral cavity, oropharynx, nose, paranasal sinuses, larynx, hypopharynx, ear, thyroid and salivary gland.

What are the signs and symptoms of head and neck cancer?

Most patients with head and neck cancers present with signs and symptoms referable to the site of their lesion. Oral cancers, which account for 30-50% of these cancers, generally present with non-healing ulcer, abnormal growth, oral bleed, progressive trismus, abnormal loosening of dentition and a change in voice. While cancers of the voice box present with persisting hoarseness, cancers of the food passage present with progressive difficulty in swallowing. Nose and paranasal sinuses present with nasal obstruction, nasal bleed, may be accompanied with headache and visual impairment. Thyroid cancers and salivary gland cancers are mostly asymptomatic. Though the head and neck area is amenable to visual inspection, unfortunately only 12-13% of patients present in the early stage of the disease.

Surgery in most cases is a very complex affair. Who are the members of the surgical team and what are their roles?

The head and neck area is an anatomically complex region. It houses vital organs of speech, swallowing, chewing, smell and taste. Surgeries of this area are often cosmetically disfiguring with a loss of certain vital functions. All these can be restored to a great extent if the cancer surgeon integrates his/her work with a good onco-reconstructive surgeon. Therefore, the two teams, resection and the reconstruction are key members for head and neck cancer surgery. For all cancer surgeries, one needs a good intensivist to look into the immediate post-operative care.

Signing a consent form before surgery is compulsory. What should the family members keep in mind before signing the consent?

The consent form is an important official medico-legally document in the language of the patient. It is signed both by the members of the treating team and also the patient and attendants. This document clearly details the type of surgery which the patient will undergo and its associated complications.

It is important to remain healthy and cancer free. Do share best practices?

Cancer to a great extent has become a lifestyle disease. It is important to have an optimistic approach in life to boost the immune system which actually helps to defy this disease. It is important to abstain from tobacco and alcohol. At least half an hour of moderate to vigorous physical activity should be incorporated in the daily schedule. The importance of keeping the body weight under control should not be underestimated. A regular healthy dietary pattern comprising 400gms of vegetables and fruits of varied colors to be encouraged.

What are the various imaging techniques and how do they differ?

The choice of imaging is guided by the type, site and stage of the disease. Most cancers are imaged using Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or Positron Emission Tomography CT (PET-CT). USG, nuclear scans, angiography are also used to complement. CT scans highlight bony tissues better, while MRI defines soft tissues with greater clarity. PET scans are used to detect the functional activity of the tissues.
